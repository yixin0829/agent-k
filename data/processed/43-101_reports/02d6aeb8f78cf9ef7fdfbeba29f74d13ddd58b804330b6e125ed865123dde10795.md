## 1- Summary

SGS Canada Inc. ('SGS Geostat') was commissioned by Geomega Resources Inc. ('Geomega') on June 15 th ,  2011 to prepare an independent estimate of the mineral resources of the Montviel Core Zone Rare Earth Element (REE) deposit. The mineral resource estimate was completed by SGS Geostat based on data available from recent drilling data collected by Geomega during the 2010 and early 2011 (prior to June 30 th ) exploration programs. The mineral resource estimate was completed in accordance with National Instrument 43-101 Standards and Disclosure for Mineral Projects. This report  represents  the  first  NI-43-101  compliant  resource  estimation  on  the  Montviel  Core  Zone. Although  the  Montviel  Core  Zone  is  principally  a  REE  deposit  hosted  in  a  carbonatite,  it  does contain Niobium and Phosphate concentrations that are potentially economically extractable.

The  Montviel  Property  ('Property')  is  in  the  Abitibi  Region  of  Quebec  Canada,  in  Montviel Township.  It is located approximately 97 km by road from the town of Lebel-sur-Quevillon and is accessible via a network of logging roads. The property consists of 216 claim cells for 11998.71Ha.

Geologically, the Montviel property is located in the eastern part of the Superior geological province, at  the  contact  between  the  Opatica  and  Abitibi  sub-provinces,  just  north  of  the  Waswanipi  Saguenay  extensional  corridor  (Saguenay  rift).  The  mineralization  is  hosted  within  the  Montviel carbonatite complex, part of the Montviel alkaline intrusion; dated at 1,894Ma. Regional metamorphism is generally greenschist facies, with amphibolite facies observed in the vicinity of the intrusions. The Montviel alkaline intrusion measures approximately 10 x 3 km for a total of 32 km . 2 The carbonatite core covers an approximate area of 3km² (Goutier 2006).

The property has been explored since 1958 by multiple exploration companies searching for various commodities. The most interesting historical values were obtained by Nomans Resources in 2002 and include: 0.41% Nb O  over 7 m in Hole MV-02-01; 1.1% REE over 10.8 m also in Hole MV2 5 02-01; and 6.35% P O  over 107 m in Hole MV-02-03. Niogold acquired the property in 2002 and 2 5 undertook,  soil  sampling,  airborne  geophysics,  mapping  and  prospecting.  In  December  2010 Geomega and Niogold Mining Corporation ('Niogold')  initiated  a  10,065m  drill  campaign  from which the resources reported herein were estimated.

All the claims within the Montviel Property are held 100% by Geomega; all the claims have a Net Output Return Royalty of either 2% or 3%. The core of the property, including claims that host the resources estimated herein, was formerly held by Niogold. Niogold retains a 2% Net Output Return royalty on this portion of the Property with no buyback rights.

As part of the independent verification program, the authors of the report validated the exploration methodology  which  includes  core  logging,  sampling,  analytical  procedures,  and  quality  analysisquality control protocol implemented by Geomega. SGS Geostat also completed a validation of the drill  hole  database  as  part  of  the  verification  program.  The  authors  and  SGS  Geostat  are  of  the opinion that the data quality is acceptable and that the final drill hole database is adequate to support a NI-43-101 compliant mineral resource estimate.

The mineral resource block model was derived from the geological interpretation and modeling of the mineralized carbonatite at Montviel. The resource model is defined by blocks 10x10x10 meters

<!-- image -->

in  size,  located  below  the  bedrock/overburden  interface.  Interpolation  of  the  block  grade  was performed using ordinary kriging from composited analytical data in multiple successive passes using anisotropic search ellipsoids increasing in size from one pass to next. Finally, a mineral resource was estimated based on the results of the block model interpolation. The bulk of the mineral resources were  classified  as  indicated  with  the  remainder  occurring  as  inferred  resources.  Sufficient  bulk density data was available to interpolate and estimate the final tonnage of the mineral resources.

The final mineral resource estimate for the Montviel Core Zone at a base case cut-off grade of 1% TREO  totals  183.9Mt  tonnes  grading  1.45%  TREO  of  indicated  resources  and  66.7Mt  grading 1.46% TREO of inferred resources (Table 1).

Notes:

- · Effective date September 29, 2011.
- · Mineral resources are not mineral reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability.
- · Total Rare Earth Oxides (TREO) include: La2O3, Ce2O3, Pr2O3, Nd2O3, Sm2O3, Eu2O3, Gd2O3, Tb2O3, Dy2O3, Ho2O3, Er2O3, Tm2O3, Yb2O3, Lu2O3, Y2O3.
- · Light Rare Earth Oxides (LREO) include: La2O3, Ce2O3, Pr2O3 and Nd2O3.
- · Intermediate Rare Earth Oxides (IREO) include: Sm2O3, Eu2O3 and Gd2O3.
- · Heavy Rare Earth Oxides (HREO) include: Tb2O3, Dy2O3, Ho2O3, Er2O3, Tm2O3, Yb2O3 and Lu2O3.

SGS Geostat is in the opinion that the Geomega successfully discovered and outlined the mineral resource potential of the Montviel's Core Zone based on 2010 and 2011 exploration programs and considers the project to be sufficiently robust to warrant the following work:

- · Additional drilling in the south-western portion of the zone to better define and potentially model an independent high-grade zone.
- · Additional drilling in the northwest portion of the Montviel Core Zone to challenge the current geological interpretation.
- · Test the concentrations of Niobium and Phosphate in the overburden covering the Montviel Core Zone.
- · Initiate environmental, geotechnical, hydrogeological and metallurgical studies to better assess the modifying factors to the economic potential. The metallurgical study is particularly important due to the relatively high level of uncertainty regarding the production of saleable

- products from REE deposits. Each deposit has its own characteristics and challenges with this regard.
- · Initiate a Preliminary Economic Assessment to test the potential economic viability of the resources within the Montviel Core Zone.
- · Continue constructive interactions with the Grand Council of Crees, the Cree First Nation of Waswanipi and the citizens of Lebel-sur-Quevillon. A strong relationship with local stakeholders is the key to obtaining a social license necessary to operate any potential future mining activity.

## 2.3 Source of Information

Information  in  this  report  is  based  on  critical  review  of  the  documents,  information  and  maps provided by personnel of Geomega, in particular Kateri Marchand, Chief Geologist. A complete list of the reports available to the authors is found in the References section of this report. Drilling data was primarily obtained from Geomega and validated against information obtained during the field visit  and  directly  from  the  analytical  laboratory.  Property  descriptions  were  summarized  primarily from a recent and comprehensive geological report prepared by Géologie Québec (Goutier 2006). Historic work was largely summarized from the previous technical report prepared for Geomega by Solumines  (2010).  The  authors  would  like  to  thank  the  Geomega  technical  team  for  their collaboration, especially Kateri Marchand P.Geo who supervised and logged most of the drill core at Montviel for Geomega.

## 2.4 Site visit

The author has visited the site between June 27th and June 29th 2011. The personal inspection was positive; the work sites were clean and well maintained, organisation and work process was up to international  standards  and  best  practices.  Geomega  has  installed  an  exploration  camp  near  the Montviel  carbonatite  deposit.  The  workers  live  in  temporary  mobile  home  during  exploration campaigns.  The  drill  core  is  cross-piled  on  wooden  pallets  and  was  in  the  process  of  being transferred into newly constructed core racks (Figure 1). The site is constantly monitored.

All drill sites are marked by wooden stakes identified with the drill hole number in addition to steel rod on the casing cap. The author was able to locate the drill holes and verify their location using a hand held GPS. All holes that were visited had a GPS position consistent with that recorded in the database. SGS is satisfied with evidence of exploration on the site and has no reason to doubt the authenticity of boreholes.

## 2.5 Disclaimer

It  should  be  understood  that  the  mineral  resources  which  are  not  mineral  reserves  do  not  have demonstrated  economic  viability.  The  mineral  resources  presented  in  this  Technical  Report  are estimates based on available sampling and on assumptions and parameters available to the authors. The comments in this Technical Report reflect the authors' and SGS Geostat best judgement in light of the information available.

## 3- Reliance on Other Experts

The authors of this technical report are not qualified to comment on issues related legal agreements, royalties, permitting, and environmental matters. The authors have relied upon the representations and documentations supplied by the Company management. The authors have reviewed the mining titles,  their  status,  the  legal  agreement  and  technical  data  supplied  by  Geomega,  and  any  public sources of relevant technical information.

Unlike  common metals, REEs, Nb and Y are not sold on public exchanges and evaluating their prices  is  not  as  straightforward.  Prices  for  these  metals  tend  to  fluctuate  strongly  due  to  1)  a relatively small and growing market; 2) the very limited production outside of China; 3) speculation as to the future demand. For this study metal prices were derived from a three year weighted average obtained  from  www.asianmetal.com.  Comparisons  were  made with  other  recent  technical  reports and price assumptions available which showed that the price assumptions were well within range of other  experts.  These  prices  were  used  to  establish  a  minimum  cut-off  grade  for  the  REE.

## 4- Property Description and Location

The Montviel property is located 215 km NNE of the town of Val d'Or, 93 km NNE of the town of Lebel-sur-Quevillon and 50 km north of the town of Miquelon. Geographically, the property is located in NTS sheets 32F15 and 32F16 and is centered at UTM coordinates 389,530E/5,521,970N.

The  Montviel  property  consists  of  one  block  covering  an  area  of  11998.47Ha  (Table  4).  The property has 4 gaps in it that are held by another mining company. The property boundaries have not been surveyed. When a mining title is acquired by map designation in Québec, there is no need to  survey  the  cells  boundaries,  as  they  are  already  defined  by  the  NTS  geographical  coordinate system.

All  216  claims  are  in  good  standing  with  renewals  due  in  2012  and  2013.  The  accumulated exploration  expenditures  has  a  total  of  106,232.24$;  this  does  not  include  2010  and  2011 expenditures which are expected to exceed 4,500,000$. The total exploration expenditure necessary to exercise the next claim renewal is 298,800$ with an administration cost of 11,501$. It is therefore expected that sufficient funds and credits are in place to keep the property in good standing.

All the claims within the Montviel Property are held 100% by Geomega, and have a Net Output Return  Royalty  of  either  2%  or  3%.  The  core  of  the  property,  including  claims  that  host  the resources estimated herein, was formerly held by Niogold mining Corporation ('Niogold'). These claims are illustrated in green on Figure 4. Niogold retains a 2% Net Output Return royalty on the Montviel  Property  with  no  buyback  rights.  Geomega  will,  upon  securing  70%  of  the  capital requirements  for  commercial  production,  as  specified  in  an  eventual  feasibility  study  for  the Montviel Property, pay $4,500,000 to Niogold in cash or common shares at the election of Niogold. This amount shall be treated as non-refundable advanced royalty payment.

A  series  of  claims  were  staked  jointly  between  Niogold  and  Geomega.  These  claims,  shown  in yellow  in  Figure  4  are  subject  to  the  same  2%  Net  Output  Return  Royalty  described  above.  In March 2011 several claims were optioned from Pierre Perron and Fan Wen shown in blue in Figure 4. These claims are subject to a 1% Net Output Return Royalty to Niogold and 2% to either Fan Wen or Pierre Perron.

There are no known environmental liabilities on the property. The property is covered by swamps streams  and  forests.  Logging  has  been  undertaken  on  parts  of  the  property.  The  Nomans  River crosses the property but is not expected to impact any future mining development on the property as  it  is  more  than  100m  from  the  interpreted  limit  of  the  mineralized  carbonatite.  Some  of  the northern claims are covered by the Goéland-Waswanipi hydro-electrical reservoir and may not be accessible for mining (Figure 5). The Montviel Alkaline intrusion, which hosts the Montviel Core Zone, is not present on these claims.

## 5- Accessibility, Climate, Local Resources, Infrastructure and Physiography

Parts  of  this  section  were  summarized  from  the  Solumines  Report  (2010)  after  validation  for accuracy.

The  property  has  a  relatively  flat  topography,  ranging  from  280m  to  315m  above  sea  level.  The average  elevation  is  approximately  290  m  above  sea  level.  The  main  hydrographic  feature  is  the Nomans River, which crosses the property in a SW-NE direction. It flows to the NE, where it joins the  Inconnue  River,  then  the  Maicasagi  River,  and  ultimately,  Maicasagi  Lake.  The  property  is covered  by  a  mix  of  swamp  and  forest,  the  latter  consisting  mainly  of  black  spruce.  Part  of  the property was logged several years ago. As observed in drill holes, the overburden thickness varies from 0 to a maximum vertical depth of 78 m but is generally less than 35m over the carbonatite. Permafrost does not occur at this latitude.

The property is easily accessible from the town of Lebel-sur-Quevillon using highway 113 for 60 km in the direction of Chibougamau. Upon reaching kilometer marker 170 one follows the 1018 logging road for 50km. The 1018 is a major logging road, which branches off to a network of secondary logging  roads  that  provide  access  to  the  property.  Heavy  equipment,  like  drills,  can  be  mobilized directly to the property via road (Figure 6)

There is no mining infrastructure on the property; however, a logging camp called Camp Goeland is located  close  to  the  south  limit  of  the  property  at  UTM  coordinates  389,360E  /  5,515,625N. Supplies,  services  and  qualified  manpower  are  available  in  Lebel  sur  Quevillon,  about  115  km  by road to the SSW, or in  Val d'Or, approximately 270 km to the SSW by road from the Montviel property. There is an electric power line along highway 113 about 50 km south of the property.

The area lies at the limit between the subarctic and humid continental climates. This climate zone is characterized by long, cold winters and short, cool summers. Daily average temperatures range from -20°C  in  January  to  +16.1°C  in  July.  Break-up  usually  occurs  in  early  April,  and  freeze-up  in November. These are normal climatic conditions for the Abitibi region, where exploration work is usually conducted year round.

## 6- History

Parts  of  this  section  were  summarized  from  the  Solumines  Report  (2010)  after  validation  for accuracy. Table 5 summarizes the historic work completed on the Montviel property. No historic resource, reserve estimate or production is recorded within the Montviel property.

The area was first visited in 1895 by Robert Bell of the Geological Survey of Canada, followed later by Bancroft (1912), Cooke (1927), Lang (1932), Norman (1937), and Freeman (1938). In  1949,  P.E  Imbeault  produced  the  first  geological  map  of  the  property  area  on  behalf  of  the Quebec Department of Mines, at the scale of 1:63,360. Carbonatite rocks are not mentioned in his report.  With  the  exception  of  some  large  scale  mapping  projects,  the  next  major  study  was conducted  by  the  Quebec  Government  (MRNFQ)  by  Jean  Goutier  in  2004-2005.  The  Montviel carbonatite complex is extensively described in Report # RG 2005-05 and #RG 2006-04. Goutier et al.  established  the  age  of  the  Montviel  carbonatite  complex  at  1,894.2  ±  3.5  Ma.  Goutier  and McNicoll  (2008)  established  the  2,708  ±1.2  Ma  date  for  the  Nomans  tonalite,  which  hosts  the Montviel carbonatite complex.

The first exploration work on the property and its vicinity was reported by F.H Jowsey Ltd. in 1958. Eighteen  miles  of  lines  were  cut  and  a  Turam  survey  was  completed.  This  was  followed  by  six diamond drill holes for a total of 588.7 m; this includes three drill holes lost in overburden. The main lithologies intersected consisted of iron formation (magnetite layers in a tuffaceous horizon), recrystallized  limestone,  greywacke  and  chloritic  tuffs.  It  is  likely  that  the  lithologies  described  as recrystallized limestone are actually carbonatite. Turam anomalies were explained by narrow sections of pyrite/pyrrhotite and/or graphite; no assay results were reported.

The property remained dormant from 1958 to 1973. Exploration resumed in 1973 with geological reconnaissance and an airborne (Mag and EM) Dighem survey by Duval International Corporation. This was followed-up by line cutting and ground magnetic surveys over eight selected targets and by prospecting on the major magnetic and EM anomalies. A total of 46 basal till samples were collected which did not reveal significant anomalies. The core from Jowsey drilling was found and assayed for base metals, uranium, thorium and columbium. During the 1973-1974 program, geologists working for Duval Corp. found a grid of lines and a drilling platform: this work was apparently performed by Umex Exploration, and was never reported.

In  1976,  the  Société  de  Development  de  la  Baie  James  ('SDBJ')  and  Duval  International  Corp. formed a joint venture, which drilled 20 holes for a total of 2,589 m from 1977 to 1979. Eighteen of these hit the bedrock, and two were lost in overburden. The objective of these campaigns was to test geophysical  anomalies  associated  with  the  carbonatite  complex  and  Nb O   concentrations.  The 2 5 Duval/SDBJ joint venture remained active until at least 1981; however no additional drilling was reported.

In  1979,  Birkett  prepared  an  evaluation  report  on  the  Montviel  carbonatite  on  behalf  of  Shell Canada  Ltd.  Its conclusion  states that the main  target at this time was  uranium-thorium mineralization.  In  1988,  Corona  Corporation  staked  55  claims  to  cover  the  central  part  of  the Montviel carbonatite complex. The only work reported is a geological compilation and a search for the core drilled by Duval/SDBJ in 1977-1979.

No  work  was  completed  from  1989  to  2000.  In  2000,  the  property  was  acquired  by  Nomans Resources. In January 2001, Berthelot and De Corta completed an evaluation report on the Montviel carbonatite complex on behalf of Nomans. Nomans undertook an exploration program in 2002 with 13.3 km of line cutting followed by 13.9 km of ground EM surveying (HLEM) and the completion of eight drill holes totalling 1,245.5m. Two of these did not hit the bedrock because of overburden as thick as 78m. The purpose of this drilling was to validate the results of the Duval/SDBJ drilling, namely the Nb O  intersected in holes 77-1, 79-1 and 79-3; as well as 4 geophysical anomalies. 2 5

In 2002, the property was optioned by Niogold Mining Corp. (Niogold) from Nomans Resources. Technical reports in the following years highlighted the carbonatite potential for hosting phosphorous, niobium, REE, thorium, fluorite, barite, copper and PGE deposits, in different phases of the carbonatite, and the possibility of high grade residual niobium, apatite (P2O5), titanium and vermiculite  deposits.  In  2003,  Fugro  Airborne  surveys  completed  an  EM,  Mag  and  radiometric survey with a 100m line-spacing over the Montviel property. In 2005, Y. Ghanem, geophysicist, reprocessed  the  data  from  the  same  survey,  covering  the  complex  and  its  surroundings  to  aid  and facilitate  geological  interpretation.  In  April  2005,  T.  Mulja  prepared  a  mineralogical  study  which described the following paragenetic sequence: calcite → siderite/dolomite → strontianite → REEbearing carbonate → witherite. Pyrochlore occurs mostly as subhedral grains associated with biotite and secondary carbonates, and rarely as euhedral inclusions in pyrite.

The  last  work  reported  by  Niogold  was  completed  in  2005  and  consisted  of  soil  geochemistry surveys followed by geological mapping and prospecting. The report recommended that drilling be undertaken on 4 Mobile Metal Ion (MMI) anomalies that were outlined (Henriksen 2006).

In 2010 Geomega optioned the property from Niogold and started a 22 drill hole campaign totaling 10,065m. Two of these drill holes were lost shortly after intersecting bedrock. The drilling targeted the carbonatites within the Montviel intrusion and encountered significant REE mineralization in most of the drill holes.  The resources outlined in this report were derived solely from this most recent drill campaign.

## 7- Geological Setting and Mineralization

## 7.1 Regional Geology

The Montviel property is  located  in  the  eastern  part  of  the  Superior  province  in  the  core  of  the Canadian Shield. The metamorphic grade in the area is typically of greenschist facies, except in the vicinity  of  intrusive  bodies,  where  it  can  reach  amphibolite  or  even  granulite  facies.  According  to Goutier (2005), the area covered by the Montviel property is located in the Abitibi sub-province and is adjacent to the south limit of the Opatica sub-province (Figure 7). Superior Province rocks range in  age  from  2600Ma  to  3800Ma;  locally  however,  rocks  typically  have  ages  between  2600Ma  and 2850Ma.    Proximal  to  the  Montviel  Property,  the  Abitibi  comprises  volcanic,  sedimentary  and plutonic  rocks  deformed  during  the  Kenoran  Orogeny.  The  Opatica  comprises  volcanic  and plutonic rocks (dominated by tonalitic), grey gneisses and some younger granitoids (Goutier 2006). The contact between the provinces is interpreted as representing a collision zone between an ocean basin and a craton, with south dipping shear zones, and a major north dipping subduction of the Abitibi.

## 7.2 Local Geological Setting

The  Montviel  Alkaline  intrusion  is  hosted  by  the  Nomans  tonalite,  dated  at  2,708.9  Ma.  The Nomans  tonalite  is  highly  deformed  and  represents  a  window  at  the  core  of  a  dome  structural feature. It is foliated and contains two horizons of diorite as well as granitic dykes (Goutier 2006). The regional metamorphism is generally at the greenschist facies, with the amphibolite facies seen in the vicinity of the intrusive. The Montviel Alkaline Complex is younger, weakly metamorphosed and practically undeformed.

The local geological setting is shown in Figure 8; the legend and stratigraphy are illustrated in Figure 9. Alkaline Intrusions and particularly carbonatites are interpreted to form in extensionally tectonic environments.  Previous  authors  have  suggested  that  the  Montviel  carbonatite  is  located  in  the Saguenay  failed-rift  (Waswanipi  -  Saguenay  corridor).  In  MB  99-35,  Moorhead  et  al.  locate  the Montviel carbonatite between the Nottaway and Waswanipi - Saguenay corridors, and just north of the latter. The Crevier Township, Grevet and Montviel carbonatites are located in close proximity to the Waswanipi - Saguenay corridor (Figure 10).

## 7.3 Geological Setting of the Property

The Montviel property covers most of the Montviel Alkaline Intrusion, which is oriented ENE with an approximate size of 10 km x 3 km for a total of 32 km². The Geomega Property covers about 90% of the  intrusion.  The  Montviel  intrusion  is  significantly  younger,  than  surrounding  rocks  at 1,894 Ma and is relatively undeformed, and is interpreted to dip steeply to the NNW (Goutier 2006). The Montviel carbonatite complex and its various units are illustrated in Figure 11.

The Montviel carbonatite is constituted of six main rock units named Pmtv 1 to 6. The descriptions herein are summarized from the Goutier (2006).

Pmvt 1 is composed of pyroxenite and peridotite with variable amounts of biotite. It has highest magnetism of all the units within the intrusion; likely a function of the presence of magnetite. The Pmvt 1 unit occurs as 4 separate zones which are rarely exposed.

The  Pmvt  2  unit  is  composed  of  syenite,  melanosyenite  and  biotite  bearing  pyroxenite.  It  is characterized by biotite enrichment, weaker regional magnetism and a miaskitic geochemical affinity; where  (Na  +  K)/Al  &lt;  1.  Carbonate  and  potassic  alterations  are  the  two  most  common  types observed.

Pmvt 3 is the main intrusive unit, and has been defined from the outcrops observed mainly in the west part of the intrusion and by historical drilling. This unit is made up of ijolite, urtite, syenites and ultramafic  intrusions  with  an  agpaïtic  geochemical  affinity,  where  (Na  +  K)/Al  &gt;  1.  Pmvt  4  is located in the south central part of the intrusion. It is composed of a granite observed in drill holes MV-02-05 and 79-10.

The  Pmvt  5  unit  comprises  carbonatites  and  silicocarbonatites  found  in  the  central  part  of  the intrusion. This unit covers 2.76 km² in the central part of the intrusion, and 2.9 km² in the west part of the intrusion. The central part is weakly magnetic, and does not outcrop, but has been intersected by many drill holes. The carbonatite can be further subdivided into: ferrocarbonatite, apatite-bearing ferrocarbonatite, silicocarbonatite and pyrrhotite-bearing calciocarbonatite. This unit hosts the REE, Nb and P mineralization and is discussed further in other sections of this report.

Pmvt 6 is a polygenetic intrusive breccia with a carbonatite matrix, located at the top of the central carbonatite unit. It outcrops north of Nomans River, and is commonly intersected in drill core. The breccia is generally massive, with several joints. It is made up of ultramafic fragments derived from the Pmvt 1and Pmtv 3 units. They vary from angular to rounded, and range in size from several mm to decimetres with rare metric blocks. Some fragments are fresh, and others are carbonate-altered.

The Montviel alkaline intrusion is different from those seen elsewhere in the world, because of its abundant ferrocarbonatites, and the presence of pyrrhotite-bearing calciocarbonatites. In the other complexes, the carbonatites are dominated by calciocarbonatites (which are magnetite and sulphide depleted) and magnesiocarbonatites.

## 7.4 Montviel Core Zone

The REE and Nb mineralization is widespread within the Calciocarbonatite and Ferrocarbonatite units at the core of the Montviel Intrusion. Grades tend to be somewhat lower within the apatitebearing carbonatite and richer with depth (near the outer contact with the silicocarbonatite) (Figure 12, Figure 13). All of the drill holes within the Montviel Core Zone encountered significant REE intersections (Table 6).

The extents of the mineralization as encountered in drilling to date can be traced for a maximum of 690m in the NE-SW direction and 580m in the NW-SE direction and a depth of 540m. It is open in all  directions  although  drilling  at  the  SW  (MVL-11-09)  and  NE  (MVL-11-12  and  13)  suggests  a pinching  of  the mineralization. The  NW  limit  should  represent  the  updip  portion  of  the mineralization  as  suggested  by  the  layering  of  ferrocarbonatite  and  calciocarbonatite  and  REE grades,  especially  evident  below  300m  depth  (Figure  13).  The  current  interpretation  of  this  NW contact  is  that  the  lithologies  are  abruptly  cut-off  by  the  silicocarbonatite  and  polygenetic  breccia units. It is  felt  by  the  authors  that  there  is  insufficient  drilling  across  this  contact  to  establish  this relationship, particularly at shallow depths. This is discussed further in the recommendations section of this report. The SE is very much open, however the richest mineralization is trending deeper in this direction (downdip).

The most significant intersection is within drill hole MVL-11-18 which intersected 250.65 meters of 2.14%  TREO  and  2,953ppm  Nb.  This  drill  hole  is  located  in  the  SW  sector  of  the  model  and suggests that a higher grade zone is present near surface in this sector.

## 8- Deposit Types

The  Montviel  mineralization  collectively termed  Montviel  Core  Zone  is  hosted  within  the carbonatites at the center of the Montviel Alkaline intrusion (Figure 11, Figure 12 and Figure 13). Carbonatites are defined as intrusive or extrusive igneous rocks composed of more than 50 percent, by  volume,  carbonate  minerals.  They  typically  occur  within  zoned  alkaline  complexes  with  other under-saturated alkaline rocks (feldspathoidal syenites and rocks of the ijolite suite), and can form intrusive plugs, dykes or sills (Wolley and Kemp 1989).  In this case the carbonatite appears to form the core of the concentrically zoned intrusion. The zoning itself is currently poorly defined due to lack of outcrop and drilling however there is a general trend from ultramafic to felsic and extremely evolved magma (carbonatite) at the core. The process for enrichment of REE, Nd and P appears merely to be a function of these elements being incompatible in the common rock forming minerals and are successively enriched in the residual magma till they are eventually incorporated in unusual minerals due to their relatively high concentrations.

Due to the extreme enrichment of trace elements and the great spectrum in magma composition necessary  to  produce  the  observed  rock  types  it  is  likely  that  the  magma  evolved  in,  and  was periodically  fed  from,  a  deeper  subchamber.  Assuming  that  the  all  the  rocks  observed  within  the Montviel Intrusion are coeval it follows that they were the product of fractional crystallization of ultramafic  magma (the least  evolved phase  present).  For  illustrative  purposes:  a  typical  ultramafic magma from the Proterozoic contains around 4ppm Ce (Desharnais 2004). An ultramafic magma chamber  of  5km  by  5km  by  5km  would  be  necessary  to  account  for  the  Ce  present  within  the inferred and indicated resources reported herein; itself, a fraction of the total Ce contained in the Montviel  Intrusion.  Magma  was  likely  pumped  into  the  Montviel  intrusions  periodically  which brought with it fragments of the rocks that were previously crystallized (autoliths). These autoliths are observed in many places often near lithological contacts (Goutier 2006) (Figure 12, Figure 13, Figure  14).  Collectively  these  breccias  are  termed  the  polygenetic  breccias  and  are  drawn  by Geomega  geologists  as  linear  zones  resembling  dykes.  These  breccia  zones  are  typically  weakly mineralized  with  respect  to  REE;  potentially  a  function  of  dilution  by  foreign  blocks.  In  some instances the breccia unit is relatively enriched in REE.

Carbonatite-related  deposits  are  classified  as  magmatic  or  metasomatic  types  (Richardson  and Birkett, 1996), and their supergene equivalents (Mariano, 1989). The Montviel Core Zone appears to be of the magmatic type as illustrated by its apparent correlation with lithological units (Figure 14). Local remobilization and concentration is very likely (although not directly observed) due to the fact that the REE is hosted in carbonate minerals, which are readily dissolved and precipitated.

REE and Nb mineralization is disseminated in ferrocarbonatite and calciocarbonatite. The general trend appears to be an increase in grade towards the contact with the silicocarbonatite, followed by a significant  drop-off  within  this  unit.  The  P O   rich  unit  appears  to  represent  the  core  of  the 2 5 intrusion and follows this trend (lower REE and Nb grades overall). A schematic drawing illustrates the authors' model for the concentric zoning of lithologies and enrichment (The best intersection to date (MV-11-18: 250.65m at 2.1% TREO and 0.30% Nb) appears to be located near this contact at the SW limit of the body.

The  mineralogy  is interpreted from  a limited number  of  samples  (7) taken from  a very heterogeneous body and should be considered preliminary. The primary hosts to the REEs are Babearing  fluoro-carbonates.  The  most  important  are  huanghoite    BaREE(CO ) F]  and  cebaite 3 2 [Ba Ce (CO ) F ], 3 2 3 5 2 followed by minor subordinate qaqarssukite [Ba(Ce,REE)(CO3 2 ) F] and a BaSrNaREE  phase.  Pyrochlore  [(Na,Ca) Nb O (OH,F)]  is  the  primary  Nb  bearing  phase  and 2 2 6 monazite [(Ce,La,Nd,Th)PO ] is present in varied amounts. Fergusonite (YNbO ) is also observed 4 4 but is  rather rare. Apatite is the main phosphate bearing phase. In the P O  rich rocks the REEs 2 5 appear to be hosted primarily by monazite (single sample). A more detailed mineralogical description is available in the 'Mineral Processing and Metallurgical Testing' section.

The  Montviel  Intrusion  is  rather  unusual  in  that  its  carbonatitic  core  is  significantly  enriched  in sulphides in the form of pyrrhotite, pyrite, sphalerite and galena. The Palabora alkaline intrusion in South  Africa  represents  another  example  where  the  presence  of  sulphides  are  noted  (Econ  Geol 1976). In fact, the first drill holes on the Montviel complex were testing EM anomalies which were explained  by  pyrrhotite mineralization.  The  best  result  was  1.07%  Zn  and  0.18%  Mo  over  1.7 m intersected in Hole MV-02-03, in a silicocarbonatite. The best Cu result was 0.48% in a grab sample in the eastern part of the intrusion, at the contact between the Pmvt 3 and Pmvt 5 units in an altered syenite  (Goutier  2006).  Other  sulphide  bearing  carbonatites  are  known  to  contain  economically significant concentrations of PGE (Pt, Pd, Rh) (Rudashevsky et al. 2001). PGE data is only currently available from a single historical drill hole (MV-02-04A) within Montviel Intrusion; measured values were below the detection limit within this drillhole.

## 9- Exploration

Geomega's primary exploration objective was to drill the core of the Montviel Intrusion. A Fugro airborne magnetic, electromagnetic and radiometric survey was flown at a 100m spacing over the newly  acquired  claims.  A  3  week  mapping  and  prospecting  campaign  was  undertaken  in  August 2011. Additionally, 4 lines of soil sampling were completed over the Montviel Core Zone as well as 2 on a magnetic anomaly in the northern part of the property. Results on the mapping, prospecting soil geochemistry were not available as of the writing of this report.

## 10- Drilling

Geomega undertook a drill campaign in 2010 and 2011 to evaluate the REE, Nb and Phosphate potential of the carbonatite core of the Montviel intrusion. Drilling was aligned with the help of the magnetic  maps  from  the  Fugro  Airborne  survey  as  well  as  the  mapping  completed  by  Goutier (2006).  The  first  hole  MV-10-01  intersected  410.85m  of  1.33%  TREO.  In  total  Geomega  has completed 22 NQ-diameter core drill holes, of which 2 were lost soon after intersecting bedrock (

Table 7). Eighteen of the remaining 20 drill holes intersected significant REE mineralization (Table 6). Some of these intersections contain higher grade sections; however they do not in any case carry significant waste sections.

The 2010-2011 drill campaign was planned on sections 100m meters apart and trending AZ330°. The typical distance between holes is 100m; however several holes were collared on the same drill setup and in some cases proposed locations were altered due to topographic issues. The end result is a grid approximates a 100m spacing with some slight offsets. Most of the drilling was oriented along the sections, with the noted exception of drill hole MVL-11-18 which was oriented at Az286.5° to attempt  to intersect the contact with the silicocarbonatite at a perpendicular  angle. These orientations  of  all  the  holes  are  near  the  perpendicular  to  the  stratigraphy  and  the  lengths  of intersections are considered good approximations of true length.

Deviations were measured with the use of a Flex-It device which measured the azimuth with the use of  magnetic  compass.  The  on-site  geologist  analyzes  the  azimuth  readings  and  accepts  or  rejects them based on the deviation from the expected value and magnetic susceptibility in the rock. Overall 46 of 178 of the azimuth measurements were rejected (25%).

On-site geologists were responsible to shut-down drill holes after verification of the most recent drill core and comparing with the updated drill sections. Unfortunately, the style of mineralization as well as the mineralogical controls on the REEs was not well understood during the 2010-2011 drilling campaign  and  several  drill  holes  were  ended  in  mineralized  calciocarbonatite  or  ferrocarbonatite (MVL-11-06, 08, 10, 11, 14 and 15). The average grade of the final composite assay within these six drill holes is 1.4% TREO at a down-hole depth of 530m. Most of the holes have been drilled across the mineralized mass.

Drill  access  on  the  property  was  achieved  through  a  network  of  small  roads  or  trails.  In  lightly forested  areas  the  trees  and  brushes  were  cut  prior  to  drill  mobilization.  Water  for  the  drilling operation was supplied by surface pumps in ponds. In some cases water was observed seeping from drill hole  casings  for  days  following  completion  of  drill  holes.  This  is  evidence  of  positive hydrological pressure in the area.

Drill holes are spotted by the on-site geologist with a hand-held GPS unit and compass. Planned holes  locations  were  marked  by  pickets,  and  completed  holes  are  resurveyed  using  the  DGPS equipment. Measurements are taken at the centre of the top of the casing, as well as at ground level at the side of the casing. In the case of inclined holes, the ground-level measurement is taken at the leading edge of the casing. In most cases, the drill casings were left in-ground after the holes were completed.

Core was retrieved from the drill string using conventional wire line techniques. Core was removed from the core tube by drill contractor employee and carefully placed in standard NQ wooden core boxes; a wooden bloc was put in the box at the end of each run (3 metres). Once filled, core boxes were closed and sealed. Boxes were removed from the drill site twice daily (at the end of each shift) by  drill  contractor  personnel  and  delivered  to  the  Geomega  exploration  facility  at  Montviel.  The core  boxes  were  then  placed  in  the  core  shack  for  logging  and  marking  with  sampling  intervals. Afterward the core boxes were transferred into the detached core cutting facility.

## 11- Sample Preparation, Analyses and Security

All samples used in the resource estimation are from split NQ core, which is logged, split and bagged on site. Samples were then shipped to, and analysed by, ALS Minerals.

The drill core is logged in the core shack; sampling intervals are drawn by a geologist to respect geological contacts typically varying from 1 to 1.5 meters with a few exceptions outside these limits. All drill holes are sampled from beginning to end.  The core is split using a diamond saw; half the core is returned to the core box as a witness, while the other half is bagged with the appropriate tag (matching the one left in the core box). The sample number is also inscribed on the sample bag with a marker. Each plastic sample bag is stapled and put into a rice bag along with instructions and a sample list. Rice bags are labelled and then shipped in batches to ALS Minerals' preparation laboratory in Val d'Or Québec. A blank, a standard and a duplicate are inserted every 50 samples (corresponding to a sample tag booklet); this amounts to 6% of analyses destined to QA/QC. For the blanks and standards, these are at fixed numbers ending with 00, 25, 50, 75. Geomega protocol states that duplicates are selected from highly mineralized intervals and represent ¼ split core.

Once cut and bagged, the sample information are saved into an access database. Thereafter sample bags are only opened at ALS laboratory. The drill core samples were sent for preparation at ALS Minerals in Val-D'Or, Quebec. The analyses were performed at ALS Vancouver facility.

ALS Global conducted all analyses in their Vancouver laboratory. Trace elements were analyzed by lithium metaborate fusion, followed by ICP-MS, major elements by ICP-AES, and niobium by XRF. All ALS Minerals laboratories are certified ISO 9001:2000 for the 'supply of assays and geochemical analysis services' by BSI Quality Registrars. Certification for ISO 9001:2000 requires evidence of a quality management system covering all aspects of the organization. ALS Minerals also takes part in the 'Proficiency Testing Program - Minerals Analysis Laboratories' and holds a certificate demonstrating its success in the program for analysis of REE. All samples received by ALS Minerals are processed through a sample tracking system that is an integral part of that company's Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS). This system utilizes bar coding and scanning technology that provides complete chain-of-custody records for every stage in the sample preparation and analytical process and limits the potential for sample switches and transcription errors.

The sample preparation  was  completed  according  to  Prep-31  (Figure  16):  samples  are  dried,  and then crushed to 70% passing Tyler 10 meshes (2 mm). A 250 g subsample is split off the crushed material, and pulverized to 85% passing Tyler 200 meshes (75 microns). Crushing and pulverizing equipment  is  cleaned  with  barren  wash  material  between  sample  preparation  batches  and,  where necessary, between highly mineralized samples. Sample preparation stations are also equipped with dust extraction systems to reduce the risk of sample contamination.

Samples are dissolved by adding 0.200g to the metaborate lithium flux (0.90 g), mixed and fused at 1000 degrees celcius. Afterward it is dissolved in 100ml acid made of 4% HNO3 and 2% HCl. This solution is then analysed by ME-ICP06 (Figure 17) for the major elements, including P O  and ME2 5 MS81(Figure 18) for the trace elements (including REEs, Y, Nb). Please see the ALS website for details on these methods.

In addition to ICP, Geomega Resources requested an X-Ray Fluorescence Spectroscopy (XRF) on each pulp. A  finely  ground  sample  powder  (10  g  minimum)  is  mixed  with  a  few  drops  of  liquid  binder  (Polyvinyl Alcohol)  and  then  transferred  into  an  aluminum  cap.  The  sample  is  subsequently  compressed  under  30 ton/in  to form the pressed pellet. After pressing, the pellet is dried to remove the solvent and analyzed by 2 WDXRF spectrometry for Nb. This method (ME-XRF05) provides a detection limit of 2ppm and an upper limit of 10,000ppm. This method was favoured to the ICP-MS as discussed in the following section.

The author and SGS Geostat are of the opinion that the data quality is acceptable and that the final drill hole database is adequate to support a NI-43-101 compliant mineral resource estimate.

## 12- Data Verification

Geomega had excellent QAQC protocols in place and SGS Geostat was able to show that the data is of sufficient quality to use for resource estimation. The only issue encountered was that the ICPMS methodology used by ALS Minerals was consistently underestimating Nb in samples. This was discovered  during  the  course  of  the  2011  winter  drilling  campaign,  and  a  decision  was  taken  to analyze  Nb  via  XRF.  This  method  appears  to  provide  better  results;  unfortunately  insufficient weight of standard material was sent to the lab for XRF during this campaign. This complicated the demonstration of accuracy for Nb via XRF.

## 12.1 Verification with Laboratory Certificates

The data used for the interpolation corresponds to the values produced by ALS Minerals in 2010 and  2011.  Values  in  the  database  were  cross  checked  with  data  downloaded  directly  from  ALS Minerals.  A  total  of  32%  (2200  of  6937)  of  available  samples  were  verified  against  the  certificate values. A single anomaly was identified related to Nb concentration used (ICP instead of XRF). The cause of this error was identified and corrected.

## 12.2 Blanks

Blanks were used to assess any contamination issues that would occur in the lab. The blank material was silica sand which contains an average of 32ppm Ce (not certified). The average value obtained during routine analyses of the blank returned 30ppm Ce from 142 analyses. Generally speaking the blank data is very constant (Figure 19). Blank Sample J139925 represents a significant anomaly that was investigated  further. This  blank  was  inserted  within  a  mineralized  interval  and  may  represent contamination from previous samples (Figure 19 inset). This worst case still has little impact on the resource estimate: it has 0.05% TREO which is 1/20 th of the base case cut-off grade. Inter-sample contamination during preparation and analyses is so low that it is not measurable for the most part; and in the worst example has no significant impact on the end results.

## 12.3 Check Sampling

Fifty-six independent samples were collected from quarter sawn core and analyzed by SGS analytical laboratories.  Additionally,  Geomega  sent  about  5.3%  of  the  pulps  to  a  separate  independent laboratory (Actlabs) to verify the results obtained from the original analyses (ALS). The comparison between averages obtained from the original analysis (ALS) and the check labs are shown in Figure 20. Generally the check values correspond very closely with the values in the database. Ce, La and Nd appear to have slightly higher values in the original analyses than with the check samples at SGS. Values  obtained  from  ActLabs  as  well  as  the  HREE  appear  to  be  slightly  lower  values  than  the original samples.

To verify  whether  there  is  a  systematic  bias  towards  higher  or  lower  values  between  the  original analyses and the check samples a sign test was used (Figure 21). This test shows that Pr, Gd and Tb have slight to moderate biases toward higher values in the original dataset. Conversely Tm, Y, Yb and Lu have moderate to strong bias towards higher values within the check samples. The absolute differences  appear  to  be  very  small  if  we  look  at  Figure  20.  To  further  investigate  the  apparent differences several scatter plots with 20% limits were constructed; six of these are shown in Figure 22. Overall, data plots close to the expected trend and mostly within the 20% limits. The sign test suggests a moderate bias for the Pr data, however the scatter diagrams suggests that the bias does not  necessarily  translate  in  significantly  different  values  (Figure  20,  Figure  21,  Figure  22).  The situation for the Lu is rather different in that most of the data falls outside the 20% range.

It  should  be  noted  here  that  the  variographic  analyses  suggests  a  nugget  effect  around  50% (discussed  further  in  the  Resource  Estimation  Section).  This  effectively  means  that  half  the  total variability inherent to the deposit can be accounted for by adjacent samples (e.g. other half of core sample).

The red lines show the limits of what can be explained by a limited sample set (i.e. elements plotting above the upper red line have a bias toward higher values within the original dataset).

The check sampling has shown that the concentrations reported by Geomega are valid; particularly of the main elements contributing to the value of the mineralization (Ce, Nd, La, Eu, Pr, Nb). Check sampling  provides  support  for  high  concentration  identified  in  the  mineralization  and  cannot determine whether the values are accurately measured; this is why we use certified standards.

## 12.4 Standards

Geomega inserted three certified standards and 2 in-house standards. In general the values obtained from ALS compare favorably with the certified or assumed values. In cases where concentrations deviate  from  the  accepted  values,  they  almost  invariably  have  concentrations  below  the  accepted concentrations.  The  most  useful  standard  for  validation  is  the  OREAS-146 standard  which  has  a certified concentration of 1.44% TREO; this is very similar to the concentrations found within the mineralization at Montviel. The values measured by ALS compare favorably with the certified values for  the  most  part.  There  is  one  negative  anomaly  (sample  10)  which  can  be  observed  for  each element and a positive anomaly (sample 48) which is observed only in La and Ce. The average values for all elements are below the certified values for this standard. In most cases the average measured values is below the certified 95% lower confidence limit (except Ce, Sm, Lu and Y). In a few cases the  measured  value  only  rarely  plots  within  the  confidence  intervals  (Gd,  Er,  Yb,  Tb).  It  is  clear from this  analysis  that  values  equal  to,  or  slightly  below  the  certified  values;  and  that  the  data  is suitable for use in a resource estimation.

A separate certified standard was used to assess the precision of Nb analyses (OKA-1 by Canmet). Unfortunately the method used by ALS Minerals by ICP consistently underestimated the Nb present in  the  sample  (Figure  23).  This  was  realized  by  Geomega  during  the  course  of  the  exploration campaign; subsequently all pulps were reanalysed by XRF. The amount of standard that was sent to ALS was insufficient to analyse by the XRF method and there are no values available that can be used  to  assess  the  precision  of  this  method.  Fortunately  ALS  Minerals  uses  the  OKA-1  certified standard as part of their internal QAQC program and 2 values are available (0.369% and 0.368%) which are within the 95% confidence limit (0.37% ± 0.01%). The limited data available suggests that the XRF analyses for Nb completed by ALS Minerals provide data that is accurate enough to use to estimate resources.

## 13- Mineral Processing and Metallurgical Testing

This section was is the executive summary from a report prepared by SGS Canada for Geomega and dated September 9, 2011 'The mineralogical characteristics of seven composite samples from the Montviel REE Project'. This report was contracted and completed independently from the current technical report.

## 13.1 Mineralogy and REE Distribution

- · The  bulk  composition  of  the  samples  is  dominated  by  carbonate  minerals  and  less  by silicates, sulphides and Fe-Ti-Oxides (Table 1).
- · The  main  REE  minerals  are  Ba-bearing  phases  and  their  composition  is  quantified  with electron microprobe analyses; both are Ce-rich carbonates. They are identified as huanghoite [BaREE(CO3)2F] and/or cebaite [Ba Ce (CO ) F ], 3 2 3 5 2 followed by minor subordinate qaqarssukite [Ba(Ce,REE)(CO ) F]  and  a 3 2 BaSrNaREE phase. Pyrochlore [(Na,Ca) Nb O (OH,F)] and 2 2 6 monazite [(Ce,La,Nd,Th)PO ] are present in varied amounts in 4 the samples. Rare fergusonite (YNbO4 )  is  also observed and is grouped under other REE due to its scarcity.
- · REE mineralization is controlled by the Ba-REE carbonates.
- · Nb and partially Y are controlled by pyrochlore.
- · Monazite is below 0.5% in all samples except in the DDH 10-03 RE with high phosphate that  also  carries  the  highest  apatite  grade.  Note  that  apatite  is  also  present  as  a  minor  to moderate phase in the RE with Ba,Sr,Th and Low Grade RE samples.
- · DDH 10-01 at depth is poorly mineralized.
- · The silicate content is generally low (&lt;11%) in all samples.
- · A moderate content (~12%) of ilmenite is recorded in the High Grade RE sample.

## 13.4 Liberation and Association

For a K 80 of 212 μ m the liberation of Ba-REE carbonates is poor to moderate and ranges from 30% to 61%, that of monazite from nil to 55%, that of pyrochlore from 20% to 75%, and that of apatite from 10% to 87% (Table 10). A finer grind is expected to improve liberation.

## 13.5 Grade and Recovery

- · The  following  grade-recovery  calculations  are  based  on  the REE  minerals (Ba-REE carbonates and Monazite) grade and indicate for:
- i. DDH 10-03 RE with high phosphate: grades of between 94% and 62% for REE minerals recoveries of 49% to 96%, respectively.
- ii. DDH 10-01 at depth sample shows grades of between 97% and 68% for REE minerals recoveries of 44% to 73%, respectively.
- iii. For  the  rest  of  the  samples grades  of  between  96%  and  61%  for  REE minerals for recoveries of 44% to 86%, respectively are projected.
- · The following grade-recovery calculations for pyrochlore indicate for:
- i. DDH 10-03 RE with high phosphate: grades of between 98% and 74% for pyrochlore recoveries of 29% to 50%, respectively.
- ii. DDH  10-01  at  depth:  grades  of  between  98%  and  78%  for  pyrochlore recoveries of 55% to 75%, respectively.
- iii. For  the  rest  of  the  samples: grades  of  between  99%  and  61%  for pyrochlore  recoveries  of  55%  to  89%,  respectively  are  projected,  with  the exception of DDH 10-01 RE with Ba,Sr,Th that has a very low pyrochlore content and data might be statistically poor.
- · The following grade-recovery calculations for apatite indicate for:
- i. DDH 10-03 RE with high phosphate: grades of between 91% and 55% for apatite recoveries of 43% to 97%, respectively.
- ii. DDH 10-03 Low Grade RE: grades of between 95% and 60% for apatite recoveries of 46% to 77%, respectively.
- iii. DDH 10-01 RE with Ba,Sr,Th: grades of between 92% and 68% for apatite recoveries of 31% to 64%, respectively.

## 13.6 Mineralogy Conclusions and Recommendations

- · The samples are variably  mineralized  (as  shown  by  the  %  of  REE  minerals).  However, they are homogeneous in bulk composition, with the exception of an apatite rich sample. Ba-REE  carbonates,  and  less  monazite,  carry  most  of  the  REE  in  the  samples.  Nb  is almost exclusively hosted by pyrochlore. Y is accounted by ca. equal amounts of Ba-REE carbonates  and  pyrochlore.  Both  the  Ba-REE  carbonates  and  monazite  should  be  corecovered for maximum REE grades.
- · Note that minor amounts of mainly Ce and Nd are carried by apatite and barytocalcite and may account for small REE losses because they would be rejected.
- · The liberation of the main REE phases is poor to moderate for the K 80 of 212 μ m used for this  study.  Most  of  the  free  and  liberated  Ba-REE  carbonates  occur  below  125 μ m. Monazite is generally fine-grained, and most of the liberated mass occurs below 50 μ m and often below 20 μ m. Therefore, processing of the samples will result in moderate grades and recoveries at K 80 of 212 μ m. Instead grinding at a K 80 of 100 μ m is suggested.
- · A mass balance calculation can be performed in order to calculate a desirable feed material (excluding the apatite rich sample) for metallurgical purposes if the blending proportions are fixed.
- · The high phosphate sample might be treated separately. The DDH 10-03 Low Grade RE sample  is  similar  to  DDH  10-01  at  depth,  and  blending  with  the  higher  grade  samples might dilute the grade of the REE. Therefore, caution is advised on how a feed sample might be composed.
- · The specific gravity (SG) of monazite is 5.3 g/cm , Ba-REE carbonates 4.8 and pyrochlore 3 5.2. The SG of ankerite is 3.2, siderite 3.9 and dolomite 2.8.  Therefore, pre-concentration either  by  gravity  or  flotation  should  be  conducted  prior  to  any  attempts  to  recover  the REE.
- · Leaching of the feed samples is strongly not recommended due to the high content of the carbonates that would result in high acid consumption. However, some tests parallel to the pre concentration of the REE minerals might be worth exploring.

## 14- Mineral Resource Estimates

## 14.1 Mineral Resource Statement

Mineral resources for the Montviel Core Zone were estimated by using a 1% TREO cut-off grade. At this base case cut-off, the Montviel Zone hosts an Indicated Resource of 183.9 million tonnes grading  1.45%  TREO and an additional  Inferred  Resource  of 66.7  million  tonnes  grading  1.46% TREO. The mineral resource estimates for TREO cut-offs of 0.85%, 1.0% (base case), 1.25% and 1.5% are outlined in the table below. Results are presented as in-situ. There are no known factors or issues  related  to  permitting,  legal,  mineral  title,  taxation,  socioeconomic  or  political  relations  that could  materially affect the mineral resource estimate. Potential modifying  factors regarding marketing are discussed in the Cut-Off Grade section below.

## 14.2 Block Model

The mineral resources were estimated using analytical results from 19 diamond drill holes totaling 8,856 meters completed by Geomega at the Montviel Zone in 2010 and 2011 (prior to June 30 th ). The  mineral  resource  estimate  was  completed  using  three-dimensional  wireframe  modeling  of geological contacts followed by block model interpolation methodology. The geological wireframe outlined the contact between silicocarbonatite and either calciocarbonatite or ferrocarbonatite; thus eliminating the silicocarbonatite from the resource estimation. Although a few examples of REEenriched silicocarbonatite can be found at Montviel it is felt that this contact presents a sharp and geologically reasonable limit to the resources.

The block model was defined by blocks measuring 10 metres long by 10 metres wide by 10 metres thick. The blocks were confined to the wireframe described above as well as a surface defining the base of overburden. The base of overburden was defined by a wireframe joining the base of drill hole casings across the Montviel area. A total of 98,054 blocks had grades and density interpolated.

## 14.3 Phosphate Enriched Zone

An Apatite-rich zone is present in the upper central portion of the REE mineralization. This zone was wireframed based on geological contacts and contains an estimated 12.3 million tonnes at 5.2% P2 O5 and 1.29% TREO. This estimate is based solely on the 1% TREO cut-off grade and limited by the  P O   geological  wireframe  (Figure  27).  This  mineralization  is  included  in,  and  is  already 2 5 accounted for in the indicated resources from Table 12. The phosphate enriched zone was actually modeled  as  2  separate  lenses  that  dip  parallel  to  the  lithological  and  REE  grade  stratigraphy observed lower in the intrusion (Figure 28).

A separate P O  resource could have been estimated; however the current value of the P O  is far 2 5 2 5 outweighed by the REEs. It was therefore decided with Geomega to treat the P O  as a byproduct 2 5 for this study.

The single sample analyzed mineralogically suggested that the main REE bearing mineral within this unit is Monazite. Further mineralogical and metallurgical tests should be conducted on this zone to see how this would impact the metallurgical performance of this rock-type.

## 14.4 Interpolation Methodology

The grades of all the REE, Nb and P O  were interpolated by using the ordinary kriging method. 2 5 Three separate variographic analyses and kriging parameters were used for the interpolation (TREO, Nb,  and  P O ).  The  mineral  resources  were  estimated  using  SectCad  software.  Assay  lengths 2 5 averaged 1.33m with a range of 0.35m to 2.25m. To ensure grade representativity, reduce local noise yet retain the inherent variability, composites were created at 2m intervals which were limited to the mineralized intervals. Only drilling from the December 2010 to June 2011 was used for the resource estimation; even though sparse and shallow historic drilling is present in around the Montviel Core Zone. Drill density and data quality was sufficient from the recent campaign and prevailed over the added complication and potential pitfalls of using multiple generations of drilling and assay data.

The  distribution  of  the  composite  grades  are  symmetrical  and  do  not  show  a  strong  skewness (Figure 29). The maximum value of 6.9% TREO is far less than 10 times the average composite value of 1.38% TREO; therefore no capping was applied to the composites.

## Three successively larger search ellipses were used for the interpolation (

Table 14, Figure 30). Blocks that were interpolated from an earlier pass were not re-interpolated. Ordinary kriging was used to interpolate the grade within each block. Each block was discretized by 2 in each dimension; which means that for each block, 8 separate calculations were made (one in each octant) then averaged for the block itself. Each interpolation had a set minimum of 6 and a maximum  of  20  composite  values.  A  maximum  of  5  composites  from  a  single  drill  hole  was imposed to ensure that data was used from at least 2 drill holes.

The bulk density was  interpolated  (inverse  distance  squared)  from  308  evenly  distributed  specific gravity  measurements  taken  from  wrapped  core  samples.  The  average  value  for  the  samples  was 2.92t/m³, and the interpolated average for the deposit was 2.91t/m³. This value at first glance seems rather high; for example published density values for limestone are between 2.3t/m³ and 2.7t/m³. A compilation  of  the  geochemistry  within  the  Montviel  Carbonatite  shows  that  it  actually  contains more Fe than Ca (22% vs. 17%) and has significant concentrations in other heavy elements such as BaO  (2.4%),  MnO  (2.1%)  and  TREO  (1.3%  uncut).  The  density  values  were  also  verified independently by SGS.

## 14.5 Variography

Three separate variographic analyses and kriging parameters were used for the interpolation (TREO, Nb, and P O ). The variograms used to establish the model curves are shown in Figure 31, Figure 32 2 5 and  Figure  33.  Composites  within  the  mineralized  wireframe  were  used  to  for  the  variographic analysis.  Outlier  data  for  TREO  were  removed  from  the  variographic  analysis  to  obtain  a  clearer trend (less than 0.1% of total data). The spatial variability of Nb and TREO are very similar with modeled  nugget  effects  of  0.5  and  0.45  respectively  and  a  range  of  150m.  This  nugget  value effectively means that half the total variability inherent to the mineralization can be accounted for by adjacent samples. The range of 150m means that pairs of samples with spacing greater than 150m are not more similar to each other than any other sample within the dataset. P O  is more spatially 2 5 consistent with a modeled nugget effect of 0.1 and a range of 250m.

Several other geometries of variance were analyzed to attempt to attain a lower geometrical variance without success. This included a search at azimuth of 130° and dip of -33° which is the apparent trend of high grade layers within the Montviel Core Zone. Probably due to a limited number of pairs this did not result in a lower nugget or wider range.

## 14.6 Cut-Off Grade

A cut-off grade was established by SGS Geostat by using a conceptual economic model based on an estimated  operating  cost  compiled  from  recent  economic  studies  of  other  REE  projects.  A significant buffer was then added to account for the uncertainty related to future value of saleable products from the Montviel Core Zone. Due to wide shallow extent of the mineralization an openpit mining scenario was chosen. The total estimated processing cost was of 120 US$/tonne; plus a mining cost of 5 US$/tonnes. At the time of the resources estimation process the US$ and CAD were near parity.

A compilation of REE prices in US$ was completed to establish a 3 year trailing average (August 2008 to August 2011) (Table 15).

LREE and IREE prices were obtained from www.asianmetal.com.

Prices for the HREE were from www.asianmetals.com for 2011 and Preliminary Economic Assessment by Quest Resources (2010) for years where the prices are not listed.

Nb prices were taken from the Iamgold website.

REE prices attained all time highs in 2011, and there remains significant uncertainty regarding the future pricing. Given the prices listed in Table 15 and the relative concentration of the elements in the estimated resources it is possible to show the relative value of each elements within the resource. The  overall  economic  viability  and  recovery  are  not  considered  in  this  analysis  (Figure  34).  This chart illustrates that the conceptual primary source of revenue (given the pricing assumption) would be from Ce, Nd, La, Eu, Pr, and Nb.

A cut-off based on a 'metal equivalent' or a 'Net Output Revenue' was considered at first. The drawback of this approach is that there is a more direct link to the price of the commodities which are  poorly  constrained  and  volatile  compared  to  most  other  mining  products  due  to  the  limited number of buyers and sellers. To ensure that the resource estimate was more transparent and stood the test of time it was decided to use a TREO cut-off grade; which is the current industry standard.

<!-- image -->

The obvious drawback of this approach is that elements that may not have an economic impact on the deposit are included in the cut-off value (for the current prices). It should be noted that, 96% of the  apparent  potential  value  of  the  mineralization  is  within  Ce,  Nd,  La,  Eu,  Pr,  and  Nb.  These elements (excluding Nb) comprise 97% of the concentration of the TREO grade at a 1% cut-off. This means that the REE with little apparent value to the deposit (Dy, Sm, Tb, Y, Er, Gd, Tm, Yb, Ho, Lu) increase the TREO values by only 3%.

The TREO concentration necessary to pay for the conceptual operating cost 120$/t and assuming a 75% recovery of REE is 0.3% TREO. The recovery was assumed based on the favourable grain size distribution  of  the  REE  minerals  and  the  simple  approach  necessary  to  get  these  minerals  in solution. No data from metallurgical tests on the Montviel Core Zone are available at the writing of this report. The operating costs were estimated based on economic studies conducted recently on similar REE deposits. The actual cost of refining and extracting each element into saleable products is  poorly constrained at the moment due to the overwhelming dominance and secrecy of Chinese producers for processing these elements.

Due to the high uncertainty related to current and future REE prices and potential operating costs it was decided with Geomega to use a more robust cut-off grade of 1% TREO.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

To test for the prospect of economic extraction an optimized mining scenario was constructed with GEMS Whittle software. The model assumed 45° pit slope, 75% TREO recovery, and 60% Nb recovery. Of the 98,054 blocks that were interpolated only 12 fell outside of the 'Base Case' pit shell; of which only one was above the 1% TREO cut-off grade.

## 14.7 Resource Categories

An assessment of  the  grade  continuity  was  undertaken  to  establish  the  drill  spacing  necessary  to attain an indicated or inferred level of confidence. The range of 150m observed for TREO and Nb provides some evidence that drill spacing provides meaningful information about the grade in the intervening distance (Figure 31, Figure 32). The average intersection width of 369.5m within 18 drill holes spaced 60-200m apart in the Montviel Core Zone significantly increases the confidence that any drilling amongst this group will not intersect significantly dissimilar mineralization. The absence of any drill sections with unusually low grade within this group of drill holes also lends confidence to the geological and grade continuity.

Blocks were tagged with the help 2 separate search ellipses, corresponding with the second pass and third  pass  (Table  14).  For  example,  blocks  that  encountered  2  separate  holes  within  the  'second pass' search ellipse (radius of 100m) were tagged as 'indicated'. This means that a drill grid spacing tighter than 100m is necessary to attain an indicated category of resources. For inferred resources a drill  grid  spacing  of  150m  is  necessary  to  attain  an  inferred  resource  category  (third  pass  search ellipse). Several minor geometrical aberrations comprising less than 3% of the total indicated blocks, such as 'pant-legs' and  'islands'  of  inferred  within  the  indicated  resources  were  observed  when validating the categorization.  A wireframe was created around the indicated blocks and acceptable geometrical aberrations to retag them and create a contiguous volume of indicated resources.

## 14.7 Validation of Resource Estimate

The grade for the mineral resources underwent a rigorous verification process. All of the modeling steps  and  decisions  on  parameters  to  be  used  were  reviewed  by  another  Qualified  Person  within SGS Geostat.  To validate the grade distribution, a thorough section by section visual comparison was undertaken to compare the color coded block values versus the composites data in the vicinity of the interpolated blocks. Additionally, the grade average and standard deviation parameters for the composite data and the  block model data were compared. Table 16 summarizes the comparative statistics of the composite and block model datasets without any applied cutoff grade. The slightly higher grade within the Blocks in Table 16 is due to high grade zones (SW and deep) occurring near the edges of the model and therefore causing a slightly higher grade within extrapolated blocks. This result was expected and verified. The lower overall standard deviation is a function of the relative 'sample  size'  between  a  block  and  composite.  This  is  the  expected  result  of  any  interpolation process where you are estimating the value within a volume (block) that is greater than the volume of the samples (composites) you are using for the estimation.

Table 16. Comparison of data from interpolated blocks (no cut-off grade) and composites used to interpolate them.

|            | Average Value  (% TREO)   | Standard  Deviation   | Count   |
|------------|---------------------------|-----------------------|---------|
| Blocks     | 1.38%                     | 0.34%                 | 98,054  |
| Composites | 1.35%                     | 0.63%                 | 3,333   |

The tonnage was validated by comparing the wireframe around the interpolated blocks (135,456,204m³) and the sum of volumes of blocks before cut-off grade applied is (134,708,170m³) for a net difference of 0.55% between the two datasets. This small difference is accounted for by the individual blocks at the contact of the block model with the overburden which are estimated by using a block fraction function. The resources for the Montviel Core Zone were also estimated independently with inverse distance squared method which resulted in a near identical result in terms of grade and tonnage.

## 15- Adjacent Properties

The Montviel Property is completely surrounded by claims and contains four gaps. The four gaps as well as a block to the east were staked by Zimtu Capital Corp. and Glenn Griesbach. These claims were then optioned in January 2011 by Canada Rare Earths Inc. Carbonatite has been identified on these claims from historic and new drilling; however assay results are not currently available to show whether it contains anomalous REE or Nb values (Figure 35). Presumably the carbonatite unit at the western limit of the property came from a separate pulse of magma from the proposed subchamber (described in the geology sections). It is not possible to foretell whether this unit will be enriched in REE.  No historic showings or deposits are documented on these properties.

Although  other  claims  are  adjacent  to  the  Geomega  property,  they  do  not  appear  to  be  of significance due to the geological constraints of the mineralization in question.

## 16- Other Relevant Data and Information

The authors are aware that drilling is ongoing and metallurgical testing have been submitted. Results from these activities were not available at the moment of preparation of this report. No other relevant data or information is necessary to clarify the Montviel Property or this report.

## 17- Interpretation and Conclusions

SGS Geostat validated the exploration processes and drill core sampling procedures used by Geomega  as  part  of  an  independent  verification  program.  This  included  a  visit  of  the  Montviel Property in June of 2011. This report only covers results obtained from work completed prior to June 30 th 2011. SGS Geostat concluded that the drill core handling, logging and sampling protocols are according to conventional industry standards and conform to generally accepted best practices. The authors are confident that the protocols and methodology used by Geomega is appropriate and data produced thereof is suitable for the estimation of a NI 43-101 compliant mineral resource.

Geomega successfully discovered and outlined the Montviel Core Zone in a very short period since acquiring  the  property  in  late  2010.  The  mineralization  is  hosted  primarily  within  Ba-rich  fluorocarbonate minerals within Calciocarbonatite and Ferrocarbonatite units at the core of the Montviel Alkaline  Intrusion.  It  is  quite  unusual  to  define  such  a  significant  resource  with  a  single  drill campaign (Table 17). As can be observed within Figure 26 and Figure 30, some portions of the zone are more enriched than others. The grade is interpreted to be higher near the outer contact with the silicocarbonatite. This can be observed as an increase in grade with depth in the drill holes as well as a higher grade zone to the west (Figure 27, Figure 30). This western enrichment is exemplified by drill hole MVL-11-18 which intersected 250.65m of 2.15% TREO and 0.32% Nb. The PhosphateRich zone is near surface and comprises 12.3 million tonnes at 5.2% P O  and 1.29% TREO. This 2 5 estimate  is  based  solely  on  the  1%  TREO  cut-off  grade  and  limited  by  the  P O   geological 2 5 wireframe. This mineralization is included in, and is already accounted for in the indicated resources from Table 17.

Table 17. Final resource summary.

| Resource  Category   |   Cut-off Grade  TREO (%) |   Weighted average of  Density (t/m ³) | Tonnes      |   TREO  (%) |   Y2O3 (%) |   Nb2O5  (%) |
|----------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|------------|--------------|
| Indicated            |                         1 |                                   2.91 | 183,900,000 |       1.453 |      0.007 |        0.126 |
| Inferred             |                         1 |                                   2.91 | 66,700,000  |       1.46  |      0.008 |        0.14  |

Time is of essence for this project; particularly due to the relatively large number of REE projects that  are  at  various  stages  of  exploration  and  development.  Although  REEs  are  currently  in  short supply and prices have recently reached historic highs; in  the  medium  term  this  situation  has  the potential of causing oversupply and devaluation of REEs as a whole. The Montviel Core Zone has the advantage of containing significant concentrations of Nb and P that have more stable prices and could buffer any significant drops in REE prices. Additionally, the mineralogy completed to date on the Montviel Core Zone suggests that it could have a favorable metallurgical properties compared to some of its peers.

## 18- Recommendations

SGS Géostat considers that the potential to expand the resources for the Montviel Core Zone is excellent. The  authors  recommend  that  Geomega  work  aggressively  towards  illustrating  the economic viability of the deposit through a Preliminary Economic Assessment. A summary of the proposed work, including a preliminary budget is shown in Table 18.

Metallurgical  samples  have  already  been  sent  for  analyses  to  better  understand  the  potential recoveries  that  could  be  obtained  from  this  deposit.    The  metallurgical  performance  of  the  ore represents a significant risk factor for any REE deposit. A preliminary hydrogeological study should be undertaken to assess any potential issues relating to hydraulic head and rock permeability. The metallurgical and hydrogeological themes are particularly important for the recommended Preliminary Economic Assessment.

It is strongly recommended that Geomega follow up the western part of the Montviel Core Zone; more specifically on section 6W (Figure 36A). This section was crossed at an oblique angle by drill hole MVL-11-18, which resulted in the highest grade intersection within the mineral deposit. Better definition of the mineralization in this sector should permit modeling of this zone separately and further enhance the overall economic prospectivity of the project. Additionally, metallurgical tests should be undertaken on this zone in particular because it is likely to be the first zone to be mined in any conceptual plan.

Drilling  should  be  conducted  north  of  the  polygenetic  breccias  to  test  whether  the  higher  grade mineralization  that  we  see  at  depth  continues  past  this  feature  (Figure  36B,  Figure  37).  Limited drilling has been completed across this contact to date and shallow high-grade ore could significantly increase the economic potential of the Montviel Core Zone.

Exploration  should  still  be  considered  as  early  stage  within  a  rare  and  unusual  intrusion.  Zones enriched  in  other  elements  could  be  encountered  which  may  enhance  the  value  of  the  property. Elements such as P, Ti, V, Ba, Mn, Pt, Pd are known to be present in economic concentrations in other alkaline intrusions and any zones enriched in these elements should be investigated for their potential impact on the economics of the Montviel Core Zone. An assessment of the potential for PGE mineralization  (Pt,  Pd  followed  by  Rh,  Ru,  Os,  Ir)  should  be  undertaken  because  sulphide bearing carbonatites are very rare and have produced economic concentrations of these elements. A limited number of pulps selected from separate sulphide bearing zones could be sent to analyze for these elements. It is very important to stay focused on the principle elements of interest; however at this stage of the project it is just as important to identify all potential opportunities.

Sampling of the soil above the Montviel carbonatite should be undertaken to test for enrichment in P2 O5 and Nb. The wide area and relative thickness of overburden means that a significant tonnage of material could be obtained from this layer. Five drill holes specifically designed to samples the soils should suffice to show the viability of this material to host economic concentrations Nb and or P2 O5. It is altogether possible that the overburden material is composed solely of glacial sediments, in which case further investigation is not recommended.

<!-- image -->

A market study should be undertaken to ensure that the full value of the Montviel Core Zone is optimized. The future value of the REE is poorly constrained and a clearer view of the potential value of these as well as any other elements of value should be properly evaluated.

The certified  standard  OKA-1 should be redistributed so that  sufficient  material  is  present  to  be analyzed via the XRF method.

Following the completion of the current drill campaign Geomega should review the 3D geological model to take into account the new information. Subsequently, a thorough review of the geophysical data should be undertaken to create a new regional map that should help identify other exploration opportunities. A few drill holes should be reserved to test other sectors within the carbonatite; it is still unknown whether the Montviel Core Zone is the most prospective sector within the intrusion (Figure 38). A review of the geophysical signature paired with a compilation of the soil geochemistry (MMI) should be used in the target selection process.

Geomega  has  made  great  efforts  to  involve  the  local  communities  in  the  ongoing  work  on  the Montviel Property. In October 2011 they announced a pre-development agreement with the Grand Council of Crees and the Cree First Nation of Waswanipi. Continued transparency, good faith and participation  of  local  stakeholders  will  help  ensure  a  smoother  transition  to  any  potential  mine development stage for the Montviel Project.
