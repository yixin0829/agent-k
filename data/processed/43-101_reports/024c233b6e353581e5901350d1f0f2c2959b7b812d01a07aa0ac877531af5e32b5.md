## SUMMARY

Lorraine Copper Corp. owns the Lorraine-Jajay property, located approximately 280 kilometres northwest  of  Prince  George,  BC.  The  property  is  accessed  by  paved  and  all-weather  gravel roads from Prince George, through the town of Mackenzie and along the main haul road to the Kemess Mine.  Hydro electric power is available to within 40 kilometres of the property as is access to the B.C. rail line along Takla Lake.

The  large  claim  block  comprises  119  mineral  claims  (30,658.76  hectares)  and  lies  within  the Omineca Mining Division.

Eastfield Resources Ltd. ('Eastfield'), by way of an option agreement dated October 17, 2000, has the right to earn up to a 75% interest in the property from Lysander Minerals Corporation ('Lysander') by completing $4,000,000 in exploration and making $550,000 in payments before December 2007 to earn  a  65%  interest and the final 10% by completing a positive feasibility study. The Eastfield/Lysander option agreement was suspended in early 2005 and was replaced with  an  agreement  where  Eastfield  and  Lysander  would  each  carry  a  50%  interest  in  the property for the duration of an option to Teck Cominco Limited (TCL). TCL has an option to earn  an  initial  51%  interest  in  the  property  be  spending  $9,000,000  on  exploration,  with minimum budgets of $1,500,000 per year. TCL may earn an additional 9% interest by funding and completing a feasibility  study.  Should  TCL  decide  to  put  the  property  into  production,  it may  earn  a  further  5%  by  arranging  the  financing  requirements  for  Eastfield  and  Lysander. Kennecott  Canada  Exploration  Inc.  holds  a  2%  royalty  interest  (reducible  to  1%)  on  the Lorraine and Dorothy-Elizabeth claims. In December 2007 Eastfield and Lysander completed a Plan of Arrangement whereby each company put its 50% interest in the Lorraine-Jajay property into a newly formed company called Lorraine Copper Corp. TCL is now earning its interest in the property from Lorraine Copper Corp.

In January, 2006, TCL signed an option agreement with L. B. Warren and W. G. Luck which allows TCL to earn a 100% interest in the Jan-Tam-Misty ('JTM') property by making total cash payments to the vendors of $525,000  and  completing $2,000,000  in exploration expenditures by December 31, 2011.  The vendors will retain a 3% Net Smelter Returns Royalty (NSR) which may be reduced to 1% by TCL electing to pay the vendors $2,000,000. After the earn-in, TCL will pay an advanced royalty of $50,000 per year to a maximum total of $500,000, which advanced royalty shall be recoverable by TCL from future royalty payments, or the buydown  of  the  NSR.  TCL  subsequently  offered  this  property  for  inclusion  into  the  Eastfield/ Lysander  Option  Agreement  on  the  Lorraine-Jajay  property  under  the  terms  of  the  Area  of Influence clause. The JTM property option was accepted and now forms a part of the LorraineJajay property for the duration of the option agreements.

The Lorraine-Jajay-JTM property is host to alkalic porphyry copper-gold-silver deposits similar to the Galore Creek, Mt. Polley, Afton and Copper Mountain deposits, all of which occur within alkalic intrusive complexes of the Triassic-Jurassic aged Quesnel-Stikine Terrane. Mineralization  is  temporaly  related  to  potassic-altered  Phase  1  alkali  pyroxenite  to  syenite intrusions of the Duckling Creek Syenite Complex.

Work on the Lorraine-Jajay-JTM property, which include valid titles located as early as 1931, has  included  188  diamond  drill  holes  and  22  percussion  holes,  for  a  total  of  210  drill  holes totaling32,683.84  metres.  This  drilling  is  summarized  as  follows:  prior  to  the  year  2000,  133 holes  were  completed  totaling  16,458.71  metres;  from  2000  to  2005  Eastfield  oversaw  the drilling of 64 drill holes for 12,016.13 metres.

The 2006 exploration program on the combined Lorraine-Jajay and JTM properties comprised 37.5  kilometres  of  IP  geophysical  surveying  on  three  grids,  17  diamond  drill  holes  totaling 5,675.8 metres in the Misty, Slide and Lorraine (2,606 metres) areas, an airborne geophysical (magnetics  and  radiometrics)  survey  over  the  extent  of  the  Duckling  Creek  Syenite  Complex underlying the property, detailed geological mapping in the Misty, Slide, Boundary and Lorraine areas,  soil  geochemical  sampling  on  the  southern  slope  of  All  Alone  Dome  and  talus  fine sampling west of the Rhonda area. A new camp was constructed at the headwaters of Duckling Creek, at a lower elevation than the previous camp, to facilitate an earlier start to the season and a later demobilization.

The 2007 exploration program was designed to evaluate a large (12 by 6 km) core area of the Duckling Creek Complex which hosts most of the known significant mineralized zones.  A total of 90.6 line-kilometres of IP geophysics were completed and 592 soil samples were collected on the IP lines. The IP survey was designed to 'look' down to approximately 450 metres in depth, to  test  for  continuity  of  the  mineralized  zones  along  strike  and  to  depth.    Soil  sampling  was directed at filling gaps in the existing data base.  Additional geological mapping was completed in this core area.  Six widely spaced diamond drill holes, totalling 1,604 metres, were completed in the Slide Zone as a follow up of the successful 2006 drill testing

The geophysical survey was successful in outlining both existing mineralized zones, such as the Bishop Zone, as well as indicating new or extended targets such as an IP anomaly that extends for 2.0 kilometres northwest from the All Alone Dome target.  Several IP anomalies appear to be  increasing  in  size  and  strength  to  depth,  offering  new  potential  for  discovering  large mineralized zones.

The  2007  soil  geochemistry  produced  a  1.0  kilometre  northwest  extension  to  the  previously outlined All Alone Dome copper in soil anomaly.  The soil sampling results also produced a new approximately  1.5  by  1.0  kilometres  gold-in-soil  anomaly  that  is  partly coincident  with anomalous copper. This new anomaly is open-ended to the north, and is on strike between All Alone Dome to the south east and the  Boundary zone to the north west.

Multiple bands of good copper values were intersected by the Slide drilling

Detailed core re-logging to examine alteration and mineral zonation patterns in the Bishop, Main and Lower Main zones, and additional mapping in the Dorothy-Rhonda, Slide, Main, Ekland and Bishop areas were also completed.    This  work in addition to the TCL mapping improved the understanding of the lithological structural, alteration and mineralizing systems associated with the Duckling Creek Syenite Complex .

The authors conclude that the exploration carried out in 2007 and prior years has advanced the project which continues to show potential for further discoveries and therefore warrants further

exploration on its many targets.  The authors recommend a $5 million exploration program to further test the property but must clarify that under the terms of the Agreements covering the property,  TCL has full control over the direction and amount of exploration expenditures and the outline of future exploration and may not follow the authors suggestions or recommendations.

## PROPERTY DESCRIPTON AND LOCATION

The  Lorraine-Jajay  property  includes  119  contiguous  mineral  claims,  located  in  the  Omineca Mining  Division  of  central  BC  and  centred  on  UTM  sheet  93N14W  at  55 ° 55'  N,  125 ° 27'W. The claims, listed below, are all located on government (Crown) land and encompass 30,658.76 hectares (75,756.76 acres).  All the claims are recorded in the name of Eastfield Resources Ltd.

Eastfield Resources Ltd., by way of an option agreement dated October 17, 2000, has the right to earn up to a 75% interest in the property from Lysander Minerals Corporation by completing

G. L. Garratt, P.Geo.

$4,000,000 in exploration and making $550,000 in payments before December 2007 to earn a 65% interest and the final 10% by completing a positive feasibility study. The Eastfield/Lysander option  agreement  was  suspended  in  early  2005  and  was  replaced  with  an  agreement  where Eastfield and Lysander would each carry a 50% interest in the property for the duration of an option to Teck Cominco Limited. Teck Cominco has an option to earn an initial 51% interest in the property be spending $9,000,000 on exploration, with minimum budgets of $1,500,000 per year. Teck Cominco may earn an additional 9% interest by funding and completing a feasibility study. Should Teck Cominco decide to put the property into production, it may earn a further 5%  by  arranging  the  financing  requirements  for  Eastfield  and  Lysander.  Kennecott  Canada Exploration  Inc.  holds  a  2%  royalty  interest  (reducible  to  1%  by  payment  to  Kennecott  of $1,000,000)  on  the  Lorraine  and  Dorothy-Elizabeth  claims.  In  December  2007  Eastfield  and Lysander completed a Plan of Arrangement whereby each company put its 50% interest in the Lorraine-Jajay  property  into  a  newly  formed  company  called  Lorraine  Copper  Corp.  Teck Cominco Limited is now earning its interest in the property from Lorraine Copper Corp.

In  January,  2006,  Teck  Cominco  Limited  ('TCL')  signed  an  option  agreement  with  L.  B. Warren  and  W.  G.  Grant  which  allows  TCL  to  earn  a  100%  interest  in  the  Jan-Tam/Misty property ('JTM') by making total cash payments to the vendors of $525,000 and completing $2,000,000 in exploration expenditures by December 31, 2011.  The vendors will retain a 3% Net Smelter Returns Royalty (NSR) which may be reduced to 1% by TCL electing to pay the vendors $2,000,000. After the earn-in, TCL will pay an advanced royalty of $50,000 per year to a maximum total of $500,000, which advanced royalty shall be recoverable by TCL from future royalty  payments,  or  the  buy-down  of  the  NSR.  TCL  subsequently  offered  this  property  for inclusion  into  the  Eastfield/ Lysander Option Agreement on the Lorraine-Jajay property under the  terms  of  the  Area  of  Influence  clause.  The  Tam/Misty  property  option  was  accepted  and now forms a part of the Lorraine-Jajay property for the duration of the option agreements.

Mineral  claims  in  British  Columbia  may  be  kept  in  good  standing  by  incurring  exploration expenses or by paying cash in lieu.  Four dollars per hectare per year of exploration work must be  applied  prior  to  the  first,  second  and  third  anniversaries  followed  by  an  eight  dollar  per hectare per year requirement thereafter.  Exploration work normally requires that the company submit  a  Notice  of  Work  and  Reclamation  at  least  30  days  before  work  is  planned  to  begin. Eastfield  submits  such  a  request  annually.    The  author  is  not  aware  of  any  extraordinary environmental liabilities that may be associated with land comprising the property.

## ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES AND PHYSIOGRAPHY

The  Lorraine-Jajay  property  is  located  in  the  Omineca  Mountains  near  the  headwaters  of Duckling  Creek.    This  location  is  approximately  280  kilometres  northwest  of  Prince  George, British  Columbia.    Road  access  to  the  Lorraine  claims,  which  form the heart of the LorraineJajay  property,  is  either  via  Fort  St.  James  and Germansen Landing using a bush road off the Omineca Mining Road, or along the Kemess Access Corridor from MacKenzie to logging haul roads along the Osilinka River and HaHa Creek to the west side of the property, where a 9.5 kilometre trail was upgraded in 2004 to give access to the main Lorraine camp.  Recent logging activity in the area has pushed industrial logging roads to within a few kilometres of the property from the southeast (via Germansen Landing), from the southwest (via rail loading facilities at Takla Lake) and from the north (via MacKenzie and the Kemess Access Corridor).  One of the newly constructed roads approaches the property from the southwest using a new bridge on the Omineca River. It provides access to the BC Rail line at Lovell Cove on Takla Lake where logs are  shipped  to  Prince  George.  This  road  and  bridge  will  be  an  important  component  to  the necessary  infrastructure  if  and  when  a  mine  is  constructed  on  the  property.    A  second  road accesses the extreme southeastern region of the property using a new logging road branching from the Omineca Mining Road. This road extends to within a few hundred metres of the east bank  of  Duckling  creek  and  has  been  used  for  access  to  the  MacKenzie  Target  area.    The property is located in a section of the interior which is truncated to the north and south by the broad, subdued river valleys of the Osilinka and Omineca Rivers, respectively.

Elevations on the property range from approximately 1,000 m (3,200 feet) on Duckling Creek to around  2,100  m  (6,900  feet)  on  the  highest  ridge  tops.    Pleistocene  glaciation  has  incised  a number of north and east-facing cirques, which interrupt the general north-south lineation of the topography.    Cirque  floors  are  generally  found  at  1,550  to  1,600  m  (5,000  to  5,200  feet) elevation.

Talus  development  is  extensive  on  the  northern  and  eastern  slopes,  while  the  southern  and westerly slopes are commonly vegetated.  Glacial till and fluvioglacial outwash blanket the valley bottoms,  limiting  most  outcrop  exposures  to  streambeds  below  tree  line.    A  thick  growth  of mature spruce, pine and balsam covers much of the lower elevation areas extending up to tree line at approximately 1,650 m (5,400 feet) elevation.

The climate of this region of BC is typically cool and moderate with warm moist summers and cold winters. The lower elevation regions of the claims are snow free from the end of April until the  beginning  of  November.  In  the  highest  elevation  regions  of  the  claims,  winter  snow  may linger  until  the  end  of  June  and  occur  again  any  time  after  the  middle  of  September.  Total snowfall is not excessive.

## HISTORY

The  following  historical  review  has  been  excerpted  from  a  report  prepared  by  J.  W.  Morton, P.Geo. dated January 1, 2004, and updated by G. L. Garratt, P. Geo. in 2004, 2005 and 2006 and  again  in  this  report.    The  historical  review  was  drawn  from  over  fifty  private  and  public company reports which have been reviewed by the author.  Field verification has shown that the historical  work  is  reasonably  verifiable  with  the  exception  of  some  local  inaccuracies  in  site locations.  Some sample sites have been found to be as much as 100 metres from their originally plotted  locations,  though  this  is  not  inconsistent  with  historical  work  that  preceded  modern location technology such as GPS and more accurate topographic mapping.  The historical work was completed by junior and senior exploration and mining companies and is generally believed to be reliable and not misleading.

In the early 1900's, prospectors noted the malachite-stained bluffs of Lorraine Mountain, but it was not until 1931 that the property was first staked.  The Consolidated Mining and Smelting Company Limited (later  named  Cominco)  acquired  the  Lorraine  property  in  1943 and held it until 1947.

Kennex (a subsidiary of the Kennecott Corporation) acquired the Lorraine property in late 1947 and,  in  1948,  under  the  name  of  Northwestern  Explorations  Limited,  completed  mapping  and surface sampling programs on the property.  In 1949, five widely-spaced AX diamond drill-holes were completed on the Lorraine claims in the vicinity of the copper stained cliffs later known as the Main zone.  Results from this drilling were mixed.

Regional prospecting, undertaken during the 1948 program, located copper-mineralized float on the East Side of Duckling Creek (approximately 8 kilometres distant) in what soon became the Dorothy  and  Elizabeth  showings.    Several  boulders,  described  as  being  up  to  4  cubic  feet  in volume and consisting of approximately 90% sulphide, were discovered on the Elizabeth claims. These boulders returned assays varying from 24.2% to 31.3% copper. In 1949, Northwestern followed-up  this  prospecting  with  a  program  of  mapping,  line-cutting,  hand  trenching  and diamond-drilling.    Four  AX  diamond-drill  holes,  totalling  442  metres,  were  drilled  at  the Dorothy  showing.    The  best  intersection  from  this  program  assayed  0.48%  copper  over  109 metres (357 feet).

Limited exploration was carried out in the area during the 1950's and early 1960's.  In 1951, H. V. Warren and D. A. Barr carried out a biogeochemical survey in the Dorothy-Elizabeth area. In the early 1960's Kennco Explorations (Western) Limited carried out a program of mapping, silt and soil sampling, and geophysical (IP and magnetometer) surveys in the area, and in 1963, they  drilled  2  AX  diamond-drill  holes  (DDH  DY-1,  2).    Sufficient  assessment  work  was generated by this work to hold the Dorothy 2-post claims until 1972, after which cash in lieu of work was paid to hold the property.

The  Lorraine  property  then  lay  dormant  until  it  was  joint  ventured  with  Granby  Mining Company  Limited  in  1970.    During  the  period  1970-73,  Granby  enlarged  the  property  and carried  out  a  major  exploration  program  of  geological  mapping,  rock  and  soil  sampling, trenching  and  drilling.    A  total  of  3,992  metres  of  diamond  drilling  and  2,470  metres  of

percussion drilling were completed on the Main Zone.  By 1973, the Main zone had been subdivided into two zones and a preliminary estimate of reserves calculated.  At a cut off grade of 0.4%  copper,  the  Lower  Main  zone  contained  a  pre  NI  43-101  compliant  inferred  historical estimate of 5,500,000 tons grading 0.6% copper and 0.1 grams per tonne gold, and the Upper Main Zone an inferred 4,500,000 tons grading 0.75% copper and 0.34 grams per tonne gold. (Lorraine, CIM , Spec. Vol. 15, Porphyry Deposits of the Canadian Cordillera, Wilkinson, W.J., Stevenson,  R.W.  and  Garnett,  J.A.,  1976.).    A  large  area  surrounding  the  Granby-Kennecott holdings  was  acquired  or  staked  by  a  large  group  of  junior  and  senior  resource  companies. Additionally in the early 1970's  senior mining  companies  including  Noranda,  Cominco, Falconbridge and Amoco Canada conducting exploration peripheral to the Kennecott holdings on the site of the present Lorraine-Jajay claims.

The Lorraine properties were inactive during the later years of the 1970's and through most of the 1980's.  In 1989, Kennecott Canada Inc. began a reassessment of the gold-copper potential of the Lorraine and Dorothy properties.  The property was expanded, and an initial orientation program was contracted to C.E.C. Engineering Ltd. in 1990.  This included road rehabilitation, establishing  grids,  geological  mapping,  soil  sampling,  and  geophysical  (IP  and  magnetometer) surveys.

In 1991, Kennecott resumed management of the property and embarked on a twelve-hole (2,392 metres)  diamond-drill  program  in  the  Lorraine  area,  with  nine  holes  drilled  in  the  Lorraine Extension (later  called  the Bishop) Zone. Two holes were also drilled in the Weber Zone and one  hole  drilled  in  the  North  Cirque  Zone.    Detailed  geological  mapping  and  petrographic studies were begun during this program.  The exploration program also extended to the Dorothy /  Elizabeth  areas.    Work  consisted  of  road  construction  (from  the  Dorothy  Duckling  Creek access  road  to  the  Elizabeth  Breccia  area),  test  pitting,  rock  sampling,  IP  surveys  and  the diamond drilling of 6 NQ holes for a total of 961.6 metres.   The first three holes were drilled at the Dorothy showing in the vicinity of Northwestern's 1949 drill-holes and the remaining three holes  were  drilled  along  the  Dorothy  Duckling  Creek  road  south  of  Dorel  Creek.    The  most significant  intersection  was  in  hole  D91-1  which  averaged  0.34%  copper  and  0.12  grams  per tonne gold over 121 metres.

In 1993, Kennecott drilled another 2 holes (the 3rd hole was lost in overburden) on the Lorraine claims, and completed detailed rock chip sampling of the Main and Extension (Bishop) zones.

In  1990,  BP  Resources  Canada optioned several claims surrounding the Lorraine claims. This option was negotiated following the discovery of platinum and palladium mineralized float  by prospector Richard Haslinger in 1990. In 1991, BP located the source of the mineralization in a breccia outcropping on a cliff face.  In 1991, BP completed geochemical, induced polarization and  minor  diamond  drilling  southeast  of  the  Bishop  Zone  and  what  is  now  referred  to  as  the TooGood Target, as well as completing a detailed airborne geophysical survey.  An expanded program was proposed for 1992 but was not completed owing to the decision of BP's parent oil company to wind down BP Resources Canada.

In  1994,  Lysander  Gold  Corporation  (now  Lysander  Minerals  Corporation)  optioned  the Lorraine  property  from  Kennecott  and  carried  out  a  10-hole  diamond-drill  program  (1,221.4 metres),  which  was  focused  on  the  western  part  of  the  Upper  Main  (3  holes)  and  Bishop  (7

holes)  zones.    The  success  of  this  program  led  to  the  optioning  of  the  adjacent  Boot-Steele claims to protect a possible southeastern extension of the Bishop zone.

Lysander  continued  drilling  in  1995  with  a  26-hole,  3,843.53  metre  program.    A  total  of  23 holes (2,903 metres) were drilled on the Upper Main Zone with the known mineralization being extended to deeper levels than earlier work had suggested.  Two holes were drilled in the Bishop zone in 1995 with both failing to intersect significant mineralization, suggesting that faulting may be disrupting continuity. A single 'wildcat' hole drilled on Jeno Ridge (above the 'BM' Breccia, the above named platinum-palladium occurrence) also failed to intersect significant mineralization.  This  program  also  successfully  established  the  existence  of  a  potential  oxide copper resource in the weathered talus apron below the Upper Main Zone.

In  1996,  Lysander  optioned  the  Dorothy  and  Steelhead  properties  and  staked  the  Pal  claims. Initial  work in 1996 on the expanded Lorraine-Jajay property included a geochemical program of  sampling  soils,  talus  fines,  seepage  sediments  and  rocks  over  the  western  third  of  the expanded  property.    A  10-hole  diamond-drill  program  in  1996,  in  the  Lorraine  area,  probed extensions of the Upper Main Zone and reestablished extensions to mineralization in the Bishop zone.  Significant intersections included hole 96-44 which cut 32.2 metres (106 feet) of 1.49% copper in the Bishop Zone.

Lysander  continued  drilling  in  1997  with  an  8-hole  (1,146.3  metres)  program.    4  holes  were drilled in the Dorothy showing, 3 holes in the Bishop zone and 1 hole in the Ato area (Bobinette claim).  In the Bishop zone, hole 97-47 intersected 64 metres of 0.58 % copper and 0.24 grams per tonne gold.  The geochemical (talus fines and seepage sampling) program was continued in 1997, and a limited amount of follow-up sampling was carried out.  Numerous copper and gold anomalies  were  identified  in  both  of  the  1996  and  1997  geochemical  surveys.  Subsequent reanalysis of some of these samples resulted in the identification of several PGE anomalies.

In  1998,  G.R.  Peatfield,  Ph.D.,  P.  Eng.  computed  a  then-current  resource  for  Lysander  Gold Corporation  (now  Lysander  Minerals Corporation) using all available drill data current to the end of 1996. Mr. Peatfield's methodology consisted of constructing a series of 10 meter spaced level  plans  to  calculate  a  new  resource  for  the  Upper  Main  and  Bishop  Zones.    The  smaller Lower  Main  Zone,  with  a  published  resource  originating  from  earlier  Granby  Mining  and Kennco work, was added to his new calculations.  Mr. Peatfield's categories for the resource (measured, indicated and inferred) conform to definitions currently required and are relevant in the opinion of the authors.  The summary of resources published in the 1997 Annual Report for Lysander Gold Corporation follows:

Peatfield  noted  in  his  1998  report  that  the  three  zones  in  his  resource  estimates  are  open  for expansion (in at least one direction). Peatfield's 1998 calculation predates National Policy 43101  implementation,  and  is  therefore  is  a  'historical  estimate'  and  due  to  new  information provided  by  subsequent  exploration  has  been  determined  by  the  authors  as  no  longer complying with the Instrument and should  not be relied upon.

In 1999, Lysander completed three fly-camp scale reconnaissance-prospecting surveys of three of the more obvious targets originating from the geochemical reconnaissance completed in 1996 and  1997.  The  most  significant  result  of  this  work  was  the  identification  of  'Lorraine  style' mineralization in an alpine drainage 1,000 metres south of the Bishop Zone. Evaluation here led to the discovery of several new outcrops containing significant copper and gold mineralization in potassic altered syenite and syenite-magnetite breccia.

Eastfield Resources Ltd. optioned the Lorraine-Jajay property from Lysander Minerals Corporation in October,  2000. Shortly thereafter Eastfield initiated a program  in  the southeastern  region  of  the  claim  block  (the  Mackenzie  Zone).    The  program  which  ran  until early  November 2000 entailed drilling 5 short holes totalling 378 metres and completing a 91 sample soil survey. While the drilling was unsuccessful, the soil survey outlined a new coppergold anomaly.

In 2001, Eastfield initiated exploration at the Lorraine area of the property. The program, which commenced  in  June,  ran  until  the  middle  of  October  and  entailed  2,508  metres  of  diamond drilling  in  13  holes,  16.5  kilometres of induced polarization and magnetometer survey and the reconstruction of Upper Camp. Hole 2001-58 confirmed an open direction to mineralization on the southeastern boundary of the Bishop Zone while hole 2001-60 confirmed an open direction to mineralization on the southern boundary of the Lower Main Zone. Holes 2001-58 and 200160 are approximately 1,400 metres distant from each other.

In  2002  Eastfield  completed  7  diamond  drill  holes  totalling  1,106  metres,  repaired  the  access road  to  the  camp  and  completed  12  kilometres  of  induced  polarization  surveying.    New  drill targets  were  defined  for  the  All  Alone  Dome  and  Weber Basin areas.  Also in 2002 Eastfield entered into a Geoscience partnership with the BC Geological Survey Branch which resulted in the publication of Open File 2003-4 on July 23, 2003 (Nixon, G.T. and Peatfield, G.R., 2003). Eastfield also purchased the Steelhead claims.

In June 2003, during a property tour a new area of copper mineralization on the north side of the Steelhead area of interest was discovered.  A second mineralized showing (mineralized talus) was discovered 500 metres to the west of the June discovery in mid September.

The  2004  exploration  program  included  the  drilling  of  24  diamond  drill  holes  in  the  Lorraine area, 28.9 line-kilometres of pole-dipole Induced Polarization and magnetic geophysical surveys in  the  Lorraine  and MacKenzie areas, 14.31 line-kilometers of soil sampling in the Mackenzie area, geological mapping at 1:2500 scale in the Lorraine area, reconnaissance prospecting and mapping in the Steelhead, Dorothy, Rhonda and Nupal (northeast corner of the property, north of  Rhonda)  areas,  approximately  9.5  kilometres  of  road  rehabilitation  and  the  construction  of 2.5  kilometres  of  ATV  trails.    At  the  Lorraine  Main  Zone  the  program  was  successful  in expanding  the  area  of  related  mineralization  by  a  kilometer  to  the  south  and  west  indicating potential for related mineralization two kilometers west of Ekland Ridge.  Several significant soil geochemical  anomalies  were  outlined  in  the  MacKenzie  area  and  subsequent  geophysical surveying partially outlined a large anomaly.

The 2005 exploration program, funded by Teck Cominco Limited, and carried out by Eastfield, included:  the  drilling  of  17  diamond  drill  holes  totaling  3,704  metres;  40.3  line-kilometres  of pole-dipole Induced Polarization and magnetic geophysical surveys in the Lorraine, MacKenzie, North Dome, Steelhead and Rhonda areas; grid soil sampling totaling 588 samples at 50 metre spacing in the Mackenzie and TooGood areas; the collection of 390 talus/soil samples taken at 100  metre  spacing  along  topographic  contours  in  the  south-central  part  of  the  property; geological mapping at 1:5000 scale in the Lorraine and Dorothy-Rhonda areas; and reconnaissance  prospecting  and  mapping  in  the  Steelhead,  MacKenzie  and  Nupal  areas.    The results of this program are reported herein.

Four  areas  were  drill  tested  during  the  2005  program:  at  the  MacKenzie  Target  several geophysical anomalies were drilled at broad spacing and indicated an area of increased potassic alteration; three holes were drilled on the Rhonda Target to test a broad zone of mineralization and  alteration  associated  with  a  450  metre  wide  IP  chargeability  anomaly  and  these  holes  all intersected  significant  copper  mineralization  indicating  a  large  system;  several  broadly  spaced holes tested the TooGood geophysical anomaly and indicated a large potassic alteration system associated  with  late  stage  syenitic  intrusions;  two holes were drilled in the Lorraine Main and Weber Zones area resulting in a confirmation of the significant westward extension of the zones indicated by drill hole 04-82. Geochemical reconnaissance sampling resulted in the discovery of a large area of anomalous copper geochemistry west of the Rhonda Target; this area had seen little to no previous exploration.

The  2006  exploration  program  on  the  combined  Lorraine-Jajay  and  Tam/Misty  properties comprised  37.5 kilometres of IP geophysical surveying on three grids, 17 diamond drill holes totaling  5,675.8  metres in the Misty, Slide and Lorraine areas, an airborne geophysical survey over  the  extent  of  the  Duckling  Creek  Syenite  Complex,  detailed  geological  mapping  in  the Misty, Slide, Boundary and Lorraine areas, soil geochemical sampling on the southern slope of All Alone Dome and talus fine sampling west of the Rhonda area. The results of this most recent work continued to expand known areas of mineralization in the Lorraine area, discovered a new zone  of  significant  mineralization  in  the  Slide  area,  intersected  several  significant  mineralized

intercepts over a large area in the Misty area and improved the understanding of the alteration and mineralizing systems.

## Jam/Tam/Misty (JTM) Property:

The following historical summary of the JTM property was taken from a summary written by Paul  Baxter,  P.  Geo.,  of  Teck  Cominco  Limited,  and  the  authors  accept  the  validity  of  this summary and incorporate it into this report.

The area that is now the JTM property was originally staked in the late 1940's following the discovery  of  the  Lorraine  Cu-Au  mineralization  but  the  property  was  comprised  of  several smaller properties under different ownership.  It was not until 2005 that the property came into its present outline under one owner.

The  Misty  area  was  first  staked  in  1948  for  Kennco  Exploration  Ltd  but  no  significant  work occurred  till  the  1970's.    From  1970-1973  El  Paso  Mining  and  Milling  Ltd.    carried  out  an extensive program of mapping, soil sampling, IP and magnetic geophysical surveys, trenching, diamond  drilling  (9  holes,  1517m)  and  rotary  percussion  drilling  (8  holes,  488m).    El  Paso outlined a mineralized zone 500m long, averaging 11m wide that extends to a depth of at least 170m.  Mineralization comprises disseminated chalcopyrite, pyrite and bornite, with veinlets of chalcopyrite  and  pyrite  common  along  the  contact  margins  of  crosscutting  syenite  dikes  and orthoclase  veins.    Mineralization  is  hosted  within  a  northwest  trending,  chloritized,  k-feldspar altered, hornblende-biotite gneiss.  El Paso calculated  a resource of 3 million tonnes grading 0.6 per  cent  copper  (Pilcher  et  al,  1976). This calculation  predates  National  Policy  43-101 implementation,  and  is  therefore  is  a  'historical  estimate'  and  due  to  new  information provided  by  subsequent  exploration  has  been  determined  by  the  authors  as  no  longer complying with the Instrument and should  not be relied upon. The Property was allowed to lapse and was restaked in 1989.  In 1989 and 1990, Aranlee Resources carried out programs of geological mapping, rock, soil and stream sediment sampling.  Since 1995, the Misty area has been restaked several times by L. Warren.  No significant exploration programs have occurred since Aranlees's 1990 work.

Mineralization in the Boundary area was first discovered in the late 40's by Kennco Explorations but  not  until  the  early  70's  was  any  extensive  work  conducted.    From  1969  -  1975,  Union Miniere  Explorations and  Mining  Corporation  Limited  (UMEX)  conducted  programs  of geological mapping, soil and rock sampling, IP and magnetic geophysical surveys, trenching and diamond drilling (25 holes, 3629m) on the Boundary, Midway, Cirque and Fault targets.  This work resulted in the definition of inferred  (possible)  reserves  for  the  Boundary deposit of 7.2 million tonnes grading 0.55 percent copper and 4.11 grams per tonne silver (Dyson, 1974). This calculation predates National Policy 43-101 implementation, and is therefore is a 'historical estimate' and due to new information provided by subsequent exploration has been determined by the authors as no longer complying with the Instrument and should  not be relied upon .  The best  drill  hole  from  the  Boundary  deposit  is  0.68%  Cu  over  179.8m  in  hole  74-6  from  3.7183.5m including 1.59% Cu over 39.6m from 3.7-43.3m.  Copper mineralization occurs both as fine-grained  disseminations  and  as  fracture  fillings  within  fine  grained  foliated  and  massive potassium altered syenites.

G. L. Garratt, P.Geo.

Joseph E.L. Lindinger, P.Geo.

While developing the Boundary prospect, UMEX also carried out exploration programs in the Slide  area  documenting  mineralization  in  outcrop  in  1973.    From  1973  to  1975  UMEX conducted  geological  mapping,  soil  geochemical  surveys,  IP  geophysical  surveys  and  drilled three diamond drill holes totaling 326.2m.   The best results from this work was 0.43% Cu over 10ft in hole T-17.

In 1990 and 1991, Major General Resources Ltd. now Commander Resources Ltd, and Varitech Resources  Ltd.  carried  out  programs  of  mapping,  rock  and  soil  sampling,  IP  and  magnetic geophysical surveys over the Boundary, Midway and Slide showings but did not drill test any targets.      A  10m  random  chip  sample  from  the  1970's  Slide  hand  trench  returned  1.27%  Cu from malachite stained fine grained potassium altered gneissic monzonite or greenschist.   No significant exploration programs have occurred at Boundary or Slide since 1991.

In 2006, Teck Cominco Limited conducted geological mapping and IP geophysical surveys over the Misty, Boundary and Slide prospects, drilled 10 diamond drill holes totaling 3069.8m testing the Misty and Slide targets and covered the property with an airborne Gamma Ray Spectrometer and Magnetic Gradiometer survey.

## GEOLOGICAL SETTING

The  Lorraine-Jajay  property  occurs  within  a  large  composite  intrusive  complex,  the  Hogem Batholith, which is located within a northwest-southeast trending Mesozoic remnant of a west facing volcanic arc termed Quesnel Terrane and part of the larger Quesnel-Stikine Terrane. The tectostratigraphic setting of the Quesnel Terrane has also been referred to as the Takla-NicolaStuhini Volcanic Arc.

The Quesnel and Stikine Terranes are a Triassic to Jurassic aged obducted island arc assemblage that forms an approximately 1200 kilometre long belt of most commonly calc alkalic with lesser alkalic  volcanic  rocks  and  associated  sediments  and  related  intrusive  bodies  that  parallels  the northwesterly  trend  of  the  Canadian  Cordillera.  The  belt  extends  from  the  B.C.-Washington State border in the south, to the Yukon border in the north. The Quesnel Terrane is fault bound on the west and east, abutting older terranes.  To the east are lithologies assigned to ancestral North  America  and  less  commonly  smaller  remnants  of  older  island  arc  assemblages.  To  the west are mostly lithologies of oceanic provenance assigned to the Cache Creek Oceanic Terrane in the South and east facing Stikine Terrane in the north.

The  Quesnel  Terrane  hosts  several  calc-alkalic  porphyry  copper-molybdenum+/-silver+/-gold and alkalic porphyry copper-gold-silver+/-molybdenum+/-Palladium+/-Platinum. deposits throughout  its  length.    Examples  of  alkalic  past  and  present  producing  mines  include  Copper Mountain (Ingerbelle), Afton and Mt. Polley, as well as a number of deposits that have reached advanced stages of exploration such as Galore Creek.  Deposits in the region that are likely also related, but are more of a calc-alkaline character are represented by the Red-Chris deposit, the Kemess Mine deposits and the Mt. Milligan deposit which is presently undergoing a feasibility study by Terrane Metals Corp., who are completing the study begun by Placer Dome.

G. L. Garratt, P.Geo. Joseph E.L. Lindinger, P.Geo.

The  Lorraine-Jajay  property  lies  in  the  northern  portion  of  the  Quesnel  Terrane  and  exhibits many characteristics similar to the Mt. Polley and Galore Creek deposits. Mineralization at these deposits is generally disseminated, pyrite deficient, is associated with magnetite and has narrow peripheral alteration halos flanking strong potassium alteration cores.

Authors' Note: The following sections, titled  Regional  Geology and Property Geology, have been taken from an in-house report by Graeme Evans, P. Geo., Teck Cominco Limited.

## REGIONAL GEOLOGY

The Lorraine property is located at the northwest margin of the Hogem Batholith and is well summarized by Garnett as follows: …' the Hogem batholith, which is the largest intrusive body within  the  Swannell  Ranges,  a  subdivision  of  the  Omineca  Mountains.  The  batholith  is  a Mesozoic intrusion located within the island arc environment of the Quesnel Trough.  To the west, older, uplifted Cache Creek Group rocks are separated from this belt by the Pinchi fault zone.  To the east, the Manson fault zone separates this volcanic belt from the older, uplifted Wolverine  Complex.   The  current  structural  setting  of  the  Hogem  batholith  and  the  intruded Takla  Group  volcanic  rocks  is  therefore  best  explained  by  vertical  tectonics  associated  with graben development. Detailed mapping in the southern section of the Hogem has documented a complex intrusive history spanning a much larger time interval than previously thought. It is a composite  intrusion,  containing  three,  and  probably  four,  partial  plutons  with  distinctive petrographic and chemical compositions.

Geochronologically,  emplacement  can  be  separated  into  three  distinct  phases.   Phase  I, chemically divided into the Hogem basic suite and the Hogem granodiorite, yields K/Ar dates within  the  limits  176  Ma  to  212  Ma,  and  volumetrically  represents  the  main  intrusive  event. The Phase II Duckling Creek and Chuchi syenite bodies yield K/Ar dates within the limits 162 Ma  to  182  Ma  and,  although  there  is  some  age  overlap  with  Phase  I,  are  interpreted  as distinctly younger on the basis of field observations.  Phase Ill granite yields K/Ar dates within the limits 108 Ma to 126 Ma, and occurs as relatively small isolated bodies at four localities within the southern Hogem batholith.'

Recent work has improved the knowledge base of the batholith due to attempts at reconstructing some of the primary structural and chemical features. The oldest Hogem phase 1 consists of several plutons (i.e. Thane, Detni ) of a calc-alkaline to sub-alkaline affinity. These are  not  known  to  host significant mineralization. The Duckling Creek suite is a generally NW trending  multi-phased  complex  of  an  alkaline  affinity.  This  complex  is  the  largest  alkaline intrusive complex  in  B.C.  This  intrusive  complex  is  likely  related  to  subduction  related shoshonitic  magma  series  volcanic  rocks  of  the  Nicola-Takla  Group  portion  of  the  Quesnel Terrane. The Duckling Creek suite contains most of the Cu-Au mineralization in the batholith. The early to mid Cretaceous Meslinka and Oslinka granodiorite intrusions crosscut the earlier intrusive  sequence  in  a  discordant  orientation  which  further  complicates  unraveling  of  the Hogem Batholith.

## PROPERTY GEOLOGY

The  Lorraine-Jajay-Jan-Tam-Misty  property  covers  the  central and  southern  end  of  the northwest-trending  Duckling  Creek  Syenite  Complex,  an  alkalic  intrusive  complex  within  the Triassic-Cretaceous  Hogem  batholith.    The  Hogem  batholith,  including  the  Duckling  Creek syenite complex, intrudes Takla Group volcanic rocks along the eastern and southeastern sides of  the  property.  Multiple  phases  of  Hogem  batholith  intrusions  extend  into  the  Takla  Group volcanic rocks as dykes with consistent northwest and northeast control. Along  the southeastern  side  of  the  property  the  Duckling  Creek  complex  extends  into  the  Takla  Group volcanic rocks (i.e. Mackenzie area).  Within the Hogem batholith, the Duckling Creek syenite complex  displays  a  strong  regional  northwest  trend  with  conjugate  northeast  intrusive  trends locally dominant.  Early intrusive phases of the Duckling show both NW and NE control, while later phases generally occur with a NE-trend only.

G. L. Garratt, P.Geo.

Joseph E.L. Lindinger, P.Geo.

The  Duckling  Creek  syenite  complex  intrudes  older  diorite  and  monzonite  of  the  Hogem batholith and comprises an intrusive suite ranging from pyroxenite to leucosyenite. Oldest rocks include a suite of pyroxenitic rocks ranging from true clinopyroxenite and feldspathic pyroxenite with up to 40% primary feldspar, to a K-feldspar megacrystic unit with 5 to 95% 1-5 cm long K-feldspar megacrysts in a pyroxenitic matrix.  Pyroxenite is intruded locally by a dioritic phase with associated Moly  mineralization. Leucocratic  K-feldspar megacrystic  porphyry  and monzonite  with  close  spatial  and  timing  relationships,  intrude  the  pyroxenite  and  diorite. Potassic  alteration  associated  with  the  K-spar  megacrystic  porphyry  and  monzonite  phase  is locally  pervasive  and  contains  significant  copper  mineralization,  for  example  at  the  Lorraine Main Zone.  Late leucosyenite, feldspar-hornblende porphyry, and K-feldspar pegmatitic dykes cross cut all earlier phases and locally contain minor copper mineralization.

The dominant northwest intrusive trend to the Duckling Creek syenite complex is cut by faults with  two  dominant  orientations  -  northeast  and  northwest.    Both  northwest  and  northeast trending faults appear to post-date all intrusive phases, cut each other and are likely reactivated earlier faults.  However, the youngest and most regionally continuous brittle structures on the property  are  northeast-trending,  southeast-dipping  faults  that  step  and  shuffle  the  northwesttrending  Duckling  Creek  complex.    A  series  of  these  laterally  continuous  structures  show  a curve from northeast to north, for example along the Duckling Creek valley.  Mapping shows there to be relatively little lateral displacement and dominantly vertical displacement, normal or reverse,  along  these  major  structures.  The  Duckling  Creek  Complex  can  be  consistently followed along the northwest corridor although exposed to different structural levels in different fault blocks.

The  Jan-Tam-Misty  property  covers  the  central  section  of  the  northwest-trending  Duckling Creek  syenite  complex,  an  alkalic  intrusive  complex  within  the  Triassic-Cretaceous  Hogem batholith  (Figure  3).    The  property  spans  the  entire  width  of  the  Duckling  Creek  complex, including both the faulted northeastern and southwestern margins (Figure 5).  Deformation and alteration are concentrated along the margins of the complex in the Misty and Boundary areas. Alteration  and  mineralization  are  mostly  limited  to  the  Duckling  Creek  complex  rocks  with minor alteration and veining in the Hogem granodiorite and monzonites outside of the corridor across faulted intrusive contacts.

Alteration  on  the  Jan-Tam-Misty  Property  is  concentrated  along  the  margins  of  the  Duckling Creek  complex  in  the  Misty,  Slide  and  Boundary  areas.    In  the  northern  Boundary  area, alteration  ranges  from  early  stage  coarse  to  sugary  grey  K-feldspar+  biotite+magnetite+/cpy+bornite, to later stage pink K-feldspar alteration phases with strong white mica (sericite)+/pyrite.      Along  the  southern  margin  of  the  complex,  in  the  Misty  area,  deformation  is  much stronger  and  grey  K-feldspar+biotite+magnetite+/-cpy+/-bornite  altered  rocks  are  strongly foliated  with  a  later,  overprinting  K-feldspar+/-white mica(sericite) alteration phases.  Pods of alteration  and  mineralization  within  the  Duckling  Corridor  on  the  property  occur  at  the  West and  Cirque  showings.    They  are  interpreted  to  be  relict  pods  of  early  stage  alteration  and mineralization overprinted and destroyed by later pink K-feldspar alteration stages.

The dominant northwest intrusive trend to the Duckling Creek syenite complex is cut by both northeast and northwest faults.  There is strong northwest fault control and foliation in the rocks along the margins of the complex, particularly in the Misty area.  Geological relationships in the Misty  area  show  syn-intrusion  semi-ductile  deformation  of  a  border  phase  syenite  with  later syenite dykes and intrusions and young brittle NW and NE faults. Faults across the property in both NW and NE orientations appear to post-date all intrusive phases, cut each other and are likely reactivated earlier faults.  However, the youngest, and most regionally continuous brittle structures on the property are northeast-trending, high-angle faults that locally step and shuffle the northwest-trending Duckling Creek complex rocks.

## DEPOSIT TYPE

- C.  Deyell  (May,  2004)  adequately  describes  the  mineral  deposit  type  that  occurs  at  the Lorraine/Jajay  property,  with  particular  reference  to  the  Lorraine  deposit. 'Cu-Au  porphyry deposits  associated  with  alkaline  igneous  rocks  are  characterized  by  distinctive  alteration zones that include sodic and calc-potassic mineral assemblages.  These deposits only occur in a  few  mineral  provinces  worldwide  and  some  of  the  best-known  examples  are  from  British Columbia (e.g., Galore Creek, Mt. Polley, Afton/Ajax, Copper Mountain).  The Lachlan Fold Belt of New South Wales, Australia is the second largest alkalic porphyry district (e.g., Cadia, Goonumgla)  and  other  isolated  alkalic  systems  are  known  from  the  Philippines  (Dinkidi), Greece (Skouries), Colorado (Allard Stock) and Mongolia (Oyu Tolgoi).'

'Alkalic  porphyry  deposits  are  of  economic  significance  and  represent  some  of  the  world's highest-grade porphyry gold resources (e.g., Ridgeway: 53 Mt @ 2.5 g/t Au, 0.77% Cu or 4.26 M oz Au; Cadia Far East: 290 Mt @ 0.98 g/t Au, 0.36% Cu or 9.13 M oz Au).  In B.C., the large alkalic porphyry systems at Copper Mountain, Mount Milligan, and Galore Creek have a combined  resource  of  over  900  Mt  (Lang  et  al,  1995),  and  new  exploration  at  Afton  and Lorraine may significantly add to this resource.'

All known alkalic copper-gold porphyry deposits in British Columbia occur within the Quesnel and related Stikine Terranes which forms a 1200-kilometre-long belt of volcanic and sedimentary  rocks  that  lies  centrally  in  the  province  and  extends  from  the  U.S.  to  nearly  the Yukon  border.  These  deposits  are  generally  characterized  by  large  magnetic  and  potassium alteration  signatures  with  relatively  high  concentrations  of  copper  and  gold  with  accessory silver,  molybdenum, palladium and platinum.  Most alkalic porphyry districts are characterized by multiple deposits and display strong structural controls. Several deposits usually occur within an area of a few kilometres and may range in size from 10 to 300 million tonnes.

## MINERALIZATION

- · The following section on the Lorraine area, All Alone Dome, Jan, Tam, Misty, Boundary and Steelehead zones is excerpted from Baxter's 2006 reports on the Lorraine and Jan-Tam Misty Properties.  Excerpts are in Italics. For the plan showing the location of the mineralized zones please refer to Figure 18.

' There are several centres of strong to intense alteration and mineralization on the Lorraine Property  within  rocks  of  the  Duckling  Creek  Complex,  surrounded  by  areas  of  moderate  to weak  alteration.    The  Lorraine  Main  Zone  represents  the  most  well-exposed  and  well  known centre; the TooGood area shows significant alteration in drill core and strong IP and magnetic responses indicate a large alteration and potentially mineralized centre; and the Dorothy area has  turned  up  significant  bornite  in  drilling  and  the  few  outcrops  available  show  strong potassic and possibly sodic alteration.  Alteration and mineralization related to the Duckling Creek Complex occurs in rocks peripheral to the Complex as well, in the earlier phases of the Hogem Batholith and Takla volcanic rocks, this alteration is described briefly below.

The  Lorraine  Main  Zone  is  the  most  well-exposed  area  with  significant  alteration  and mineralization  on  the  property.  Mapping  of  lithological  and  alteration  relationships  in  the Main Zone area in 2006 has increased the understanding of the alteration and mineralization styles, specifically in that area.  The sequence is presented below as an example and guide to alteration  from  other  parts  of  the  property  as  well,  although  it  should  be  used  with  caution from one area to another with awareness of local variations.

The  following  alteration  sequence  is  broken  out  into  5  alteration  stages  (Figure  5).    These stages are only broadly defined and grouped into assemblages; each stage may include several alteration  pulses  and  assemblages  with  slight  variations  that  are  grouped  to  show  rough temporal  associations.    The  stages  are  meant  to  outline  a  progression  from:  early  regional biotite /barb2right grey  ksp+bio+mag+alb+Cu /barb2right later  generations of pink K-feldspar alteration +/Cu.  Copper mineralization appears in several stages, no single copper mineralizing event has been recognized; however, the stage 2 alteration shows a consistent, high copper content.

## Property Alteration

Figure 8

<!-- image -->

Alteration on the Jan-Tam-Misty property is focused along or near the margins of the Duckling Creek  complex.    Alteration  is  dominantly  Potassic,  with  various  styles  and  overprinting assemblages.

In  the  Misty  area,  alteration  and  associated  mineralization is focused along the deformation zone.    Weak  to  strongly  foliated  grey  K-feldspar  (microcline)-dominant  mineralization+/biotite is coarse grained to sugary with pods of strong, disseminated cpy+bornite mineralization.    Later  stage  pink  K-feldspar  alteration  phases  overprint  the  well  foliated, deformed, early alteration and mineralization stages.  In the boundary area, alteration follows the same sequence with early grey K-feldspar-dominant +/- copper mineralization, followed by later  pink  K-feldspar  +/-  white  mica  alteration.    In  the  Boundary  area,  the  later  pink  Kfeldspar + white mica + pyrite alteration is widespread and locally destructively overprints the earlier mineralized stages.

Detailed mapping, generally at a 1:1000 and 1:2500 scales, was undertaken by Teck Cominco Limited  in  several  key  areas  on  the  Lorraine/JMT  property  during  2006.  The    following summaries of this work is excerpted from Baxter et al (2006).

## Lorraine Main

The  Lorraine  Main  area  is  described  here  in  a  single  section  as  the  detailed  geology  from several zones within the Main area have contributed to overall understanding of this part of the system.  It is bound to the north by the cryptic northern margin of the Duckling Creek Complex. Cliffy hills and glacially-scoured bowls have excellent outcrop exposure and were the focus of detailed  lithological  and  alteration  mapping  in  2006.  The  Lorraine  Main  area  includes previously  named  zones:  (Upper)  Main  Zone,  Lower Main Zone, Ekland Ridge, Weber Bowl, Copper Bowl, Copper Peak, Copper Ridge, Page Bowl, Bishop Bowl, and North Cirque.  Ekland Ridge and Copper Ridge are described in more detailed sections below.

1998

…'The Lorraine Main area is unique within the Lorraine Property due to the presence of the early pyroxenite stage of intrusion.  Feldspathic pyroxenites locally with K-feldspar megacrystic domains  and  subrounded  pseudoleucite  are  intruded  by  dominantly  leucocratic  K-feldspar megacrystic porphyry and monzonite dykes.  The South Stock, which underlies the southern end of Jeno Ridge, is underlain by massive K-feldspar megacrystic porphyry from which northwesttrending dykes and sills intrude the pyroxenite to the north in the Page Bowl and Bishop areas.

G. L. Garratt, P.Geo.

Joseph E.L. Lindinger, P.Geo.

Northwest-trending  dykes  and  sills  of  monzonite  intrude  pyroxenite  farther  north  on  Ekland Ridge, in the Main and Lower Main Zone areas, south of Lorraine Peak and in North Cirque. Northeast-trending leucosyenite dykes and local K-feldspar pegmatitic dykes are prevalent and relatively  continuous  from  Ekland  Ridge  across  Weber  Bowl  and  up  over  Lorraine  Peak  into North Cirque.  Late feldspar porphyry and feldspar hornblende porphyry dykes trend NW across the north side of Lorraine peak and cut across all earlier phases and alteration.

A  wide  alteration  halo  of  weak  to  moderate  selective-pervasive  biotite  extends  around  the Lorraine  Main  area.    Biotite  alteration  increases  into  the  centre  of  the  area  as  moderate  to intense, completely pervasive biotite alteration in pyroxenites.  K-feldspar-dominant alteration overprints  the  biotite  phase  and  where  most  intense  completely  replaces  pyroxenite  and  the dykes phases  to be indistinguishable protoliths. K-feldspar  alteration  includes  grey-Kfeldspar+diopside+biotite+magnetite+/-albite+/-chalcopyrite and bornite.  Multiple phases of K-spar alteration of varying intensity have distinctly different textures including a medium to coarse grained phase with local copper mineralization, a fine grained sugary phase with strong copper association.  Later phases of pink K-feldspar alteration pervasively wash earlier phases as  well  as  introducing  new  K-feldspar  as  medium  to  coarse  grained  to  pegmatitic  veins  and pods.

Moderate to intense K-feldspar alteration and copper mineralization in the Lorraine Main area consistently occurs as moderately SW-dipping stacked alteration sheets (Figure 8).  The sheets are defined by sharp to diffuse K-feldspar alteration boundaries in pyroxenite and are internally variable in alteration intensity and style, commonly with several different overprinting phases of alteration.    At  Copper  Peak  the  alteration  boundaries  roughly  follow  primary  layering  in pyroxenite and mimic the orientation of K-feldspar megacrystic porphyry dykes.

The SW sides of Lorraine Peak (Main Zone area) and Copper Peak are dip slope surfaces of alteration sheets and expose broad areas of surface copper mineralization.  Mapping supports the extension of the Lower Main - Main Zone mineralized alteration panel further southeast to partly sky-out over Weber Ridge, then intersect the north side of Copper Peak.  Drilling to date in these areas has intersected zones of high-grade copper but without significant depth extent, supporting the sheet model for alteration and mineralization.  The Bishop Zone, also known for its  high-grade  copper  intersections  is  interpreted  to  extend  in  a  SW-dipping  alteration  panel underneath Copper Ridge.  A single drill hole in 2006 tested this model and did intersect an alteration zone at the projected depth.

Faults cut and shuffle the alteration panels making it difficult to regionally follow a single panel and  correlate  well  mineralized  sheets  along  strike;  caution  must  be  used  on  interpreting  the extension and offset of a single sheet as there is no way to distinguish one sheet from another and various smaller lenses of alteration occur locally.

Figure 10. Lorraine Main Area, Interpretive Photo

<!-- image -->

Annotated photo of the Lorraine Main area with a view south from Lorraine Peak showing southwest-dipping Kfeldspar-dominant  alteration  panels;  purple  where  moderate  to  strong  alteration,  red  where  intense  alteration with strong copper mineralization.

Alteration is genetically linked to the K-feldspar megacrystic porphyry stock to the south of the Lorraine  Main  area,  the  South  Stock.    Northwest-trending,  southwest-dipping  dykes  of  Kfeldspar  megacrystic porphyry extend from the South Stock into pyroxenite on Copper Ridge. The porphyry dykes contain disseminated blebs of chalcopyrite and magnetite, they are variably K-feldspar  altered  internally,  but  intrude  strongly  altered  pyroxenite.    Alteration  boundaries follow the same orientation as the porphyry dykes.  Scattered dykes and sills of porphyry occur farther northwest  in  Bishop  Bowl  and  in  North  Cirque;  monzonite  dykes  and  sills  are volumetrically  more  abundant.    Monzonite  is  interpreted  to  be  the  lateral  equivalent  of  the porphyry  dykes  emanating  from  the  South  Stock.    Alteration  also  overprints  monzonitepyroxenite contacts.  The strongest and most copper-rich mineralization in the Lorraine Main area occurs in the zone of monzonite dykes and sills along the northwest-extension of the South Stock intrusions. The K-feldspar megacrystic porphyry is modeled as the heat and copper source for the alteration in the Main Zone area.

## Copper Ridge (Lorraine Main area)

Copper Ridge extends east from Copper Peak with a view south over Page Bowl and northeast over  Bishop  Bowl.    The  area  was  mapped  in  detail  as  it  has  excellent  outcrop  exposure  and numerous copper showings along the ridge crest and down both flanks towards Bishop Bowl and Page Bowl. (Figure 7).

Copper  Ridge  is  underlain  by  pyroxenite  and  minor  melasyenite  intruded  by  SW-dipping leucocratic  K-feldspar  megacrystic  porphyry  dykes  and  sills,  all  of  which  are  cut  by  NEtrending,  sub-vertical  quartz-bearing  leucosyenite  dykes.    Pyroxenite  locally  displays  strong primary layering defined by grained size variation and local megacrystic K-feldspar (primary within  pyroxenite).    Patches  of  melasyenite  display  trachytic  texture  with  K-feldspar  mineral alignment sub-parallel to the SW-dipping primary pyroxenite layering.  K-feldspar megacrystic porphyry dykes are inferred to intrude along primary layering within pyroxenite.

Alteration ranges from strong to intense biotite alteration in pyroxenites to overprinting weak to intense  K-feldspar  alteration  in  both  pyroxenite  and  K-feldspar  megacrystic  porphyry  dykes. Multiples stage of 'Phase 2' alteration grey-K-feldspar+diopside+magnetite+/-albite

overprinted by a weak to intense pink K-feldspar phase as a pervasive wash and locally as pods of  medium  to  coarse  grained  recrystallized  K-feldspar  and  K-feldspar  pegmatite.    Alteration sheets  are  also  SW-dipping and mimic the orientation of primary layering and porphyry sills. Veins  of  grey  and  pink  K-feldspar+diopside+biotite+magnetite  also  dip  between  30  and  50 degrees to the SW.  There is a strong spatial correlation between strong to intense alteration and the porphyry dykes.

Copper  mineralization  occurs  in  several  styles  on  Copper  Ridge:  1)  as  1-3  mm  clots  with magnetite  within  weakly  K-feldspar  altered  porphyry  dykes  and  sills,  2)  as  fine  grained disseminated  chalcopyrite+bornite+magnetite  with  sugary  grey  K-feldspar  alteration,  3)  as chalcopyrite  in  veins  of  grey  K-feldspar+diopside+biotite+/-albite,  as  chalcopyrite  in  quartz veins associated with leucosyenite dykes.

## Ekland Ridge (Lorraine Main area)

Eckland ridge is 1 kilometer due south of Lorraine.  Baxter 2006 continues; 'Ekland Ridge has some  of  the  most  spectacular  copper  mineralization  in  the  Lorraine  Main  area,  along  is southwestern flank.  The NW-trending ridge parallels the Lorraine ridge to the north and shows similar styles of alteration and mineralization.  Several holes were drilled on Ekland Ridge in 2004 with some high-grade intersections of copper mineralization cut off by faults.  The ridge has very good outcrop exposure and was an area for detailed lithology and alteration mapping in 2006 to study and record alteration-mineralization relationships.

Ekland Ridge is underlain by variably altered pyroxenite with monzonite and minor leucocratic K-feldspar  megacrystic  porphyry  dykes  and  sills.    Monzonite  dykes  have  moderate  to  steeply SW-dipping  contacts. NE-trending  sub-vertical leucosyenite dykes and  pink  K-feldspar pegmatite dykes, some of the best-exposed on the property, cut across all earlier phases. At least 2 generations of NE-trending high angle, low displacement faults cut across Ekland Ridge.

Alteration  on  Ekland  Ridge  includes  moderate  to  strong  biotite  alteration  of  pyroxenite  and weak  to  intense  K-feldspar  alteration  of  pyroxenite,  monzonite,  and  K-feldspar  megacrystic porphyry.  K-feldspar alteration outlines a moderately (40 -60 ) SW-dipping sheet with sharp ° ° and locally diffuse alteration boundaries.  The alteration sheet is cut off by a NE fault along the upper (southeastern) end of the ridge, but appears to pinch out at this end; the sheet extends to the north off the ridge, under cover.  Albite+/-epidote+/-garnet alteration as well as increased magnetite+diopside+/-albite veining increase towards the core of the alteration sheet.

Mineralization on  Ekland  Ridge  occurs  predominantly  in  intense,  fine-grained  grey Kfeldspar+/-biotite alteration as fine grained disseminated chalcopyrite and bornite.

## All Alone Dome

All  Alone  Dome'… 1  kilometer  west-northwest  of  Lorraine  …' is along  strike  from  the southwest-dipping  alteration  panels  through  the  Lorraine  Main  area.    The  dome  has  limited ridge-crest  outcrop  and  talus  along  the  upper  flanks,  lower  flanks  are  tree  covered  with  very limited outcrop. .

Variably  altered  pyroxenite  underlies  All  Alone  Dome,  cut  by  northwest,  east  and  northeast high-angle faults.  Northeast-trending leucosyenite dykes cut pyroxenite.

Alteration sequence on All Alone Dome follows the sequence defined in the Lorraine Main area. Early  biotite  alteration  of  pyroxenite  is  overprinted  by  grey  and  pink  K-feldspar+diopside+/albite+/-magnetite alteration.  Alteration is weak to strong along the ridge crest, and strong, pervasive K-feldspar alteration is found in talus down the west flank.  Pink ksp veins are locally common. Known m ineralization along the ridge crest is limited to local disseminated pyrite.'

The Dome is flanked on its south and east sides by moderate to strong copper and weak gold in soil  anomalies.    The  bedrock  source  of  these  anomalies  are  unknown  but  Baxter  suggests  that they  may  represent  indications  of  extensions  of  the  Lower  Main  zone  of  Lorraine.  Lindinger suggests that these anomalies may in part have originated from glacially derived debris from the Lorraine ridge and North Cirque areas.

## West Rhonda

The West Rhonda area is located on the east side of the Lorraine Property and is centered about 2 kilometers northwest of the Rhonda target and includes the Fox MINFILE occurrence .

The area is underlain by Hogem monzonite and fine to medium grained diorite, also interpreted to  belong  to  the  oldest  Phase  1  Hogem  rocks.    Coarse  grained  diorite  and  gabbro  that  is correlated  with  an  early  Duckling  phase  occur  in  a  northeast(?)-trending  domain  with  grain size-gradational contacts into Hogem diorite and monzonite.  Sub 2 metre-wide, steeply dipping east-northeast-trending  feldspar-hornblende  porphyry  and  leucosyenite  dykes  cut  the  coarse grained diorite.    Multiple  generations  of  NW  and  NE-trending  faults  cut  all  intrusive phases, late NE faults are regionally consistent and cut NW faults.

Alteration  is  limited  to  weak  to  moderate  potassic  alteration,  commonly  biotite  alteration  of mafic  minerals  and  patchy  pink  K-feldspar  flooding.    Pink  veins  of  K-feldspar  1mm  to  2  cm wide are common.  At the margins of the coarse grained Duckling diorite, the Hogem monzonite is moderate to strongly K-feldspar flooded.

Mineralization at the Fox showing occurs as weak to moderate chalcopyrite disseminations in the medium grained diorite.  High Cu samples in talus were collected at the base of the cliffs below the showing area.

## Steelehead

The Steelehead area lies 5 kilometers North of Lorraine and …' is predominantly underlain by Hogem monzonite and fine to medium grained Hogem diorite.  The ridge immediately south of Steele creek is underlain  by leucocratic megacrystic  K-feldspar  porphyry  with  variable megacryst content; contacts of the megacrystic body are inferred to be NE-trending.  Dykes of pink fine to medium grained syenite, leucosyenite, as well as feldspar and feldspar-hornblende porphyry dykes trend northeast across the area.

Alteration  within  the  Hogem  rocks  outside  of  the  megacrystic  body  is  limited  to  potassic alteration around syenitic dykes.  Regional weak greenschist facies alteration has altered mafics in the Hogem rocks to chlorite, this is overprinted by local secondary biotite.  Pink K-feldspar alteration  occurs  along  syenite  dyke  intrusions  and  as  local  grey  and  pink  K-feldspar  veins. Along  the  western  margin  of  the  megacrystic  body  K-feldspar  alteration  is  fine  grained  and sugary.    Within  the  megacrystic  body,  pervasive  grey  to  pink  K-feldspar  alteration  is  locally moderate to strong with increased pink -feldspar veins and pink K-feldspar+quartz veins.

The Steelehead area boasts some of the most widespread copper anomalies in soils, along the northern  side  of  the  area  in  talus  samples,  and  in  the  overburden-covered  basin  at  the headwaters of Steele Creek.  Chalcopyrite+pyrite is found in high-grade veins associated with syenite dykes and alteration, particularly well exposed in north-facing cirque walls in the north part  of  the  area.    Disseminated  chalcopyrite  is  found  in  fine  grained  sugary  K-feldspar alteration along the margin of the megacrystic porphyry body.  The high copper values in soils in  the  headwaters  basin  are  interpreted  to  be  derived  from  copper  mineralization  associated with the megacrystic body.

## Misty

The  Misty  area  lies  along  the  southern  margin  of  the  Duckling  Creek  syenite  complex  in  the southern half of the Jan-Tam-Misty claim block.  The northwest-elongate area has high cirque walls on the southwest side with cliffs that overlook a northwest-trending fault marked by a lake and  rusty  notches  in  the  ridgeline.    Very  strongly  altered  and  foliated  rocks  with  strong chalcopyrite+bornite+/-chalcocite  mineralization  occur  in  outcrop  in  the  cliffs  and  talus immediately south of the lake, as well as in the cliffs along strike to the northwest and along the ridge to the southeast.

Duckling Creek rocks occur on both sides of the major fault that marks the Misty trend.  To the north  of  the  fault  are  K-feldspar  megacrystic  rocks:  leucocratic,  monzonitic  megacrystic porphyry  (Dcz)  immediately  north  of  the  fault  in  the  area  of  the  lake,  with  more  widespread mafic K-feldspar megacrystic unit (Dcm) to the east and north.  To the south of the fault are strongly foliated, potassic and calc-potassic altered rocks of uncertain protolith cut by dykes of weak  to  moderately  altered  megacrystic  porphyry,  both  mafic  matrix  megacrystic  unit  (Dcm) and leucocratic porphyry (Dcz).  Westward, alteration and foliation in the rocks decreases and the  protolith  is  a  fine  to  medium  grained  grey  syenite  with  &lt;50%  mafics  (amphibole  and biotite).  This bounding unit, a mafic-rich syenite, has similar mineral composition to the mafic megacrystic unit and is inferred to be a fine grained border phase of the same unit.  The contact with  Hogem  granodiorite  with  the  medium  grained  mafic-rich  syenite  farther  to  the  eastsoutheast is a sharp intrusive contact, seen in outcrop along the cliffs at the northern end of the Misty trend.

The Misty area is unique in its strongly foliated, altered rocks immediately south of the fault. Finely  banded,  well  foliated  rock  is  mineralogically  segregated  into  1mm  to  1cm  bands  of alternating  amphibole+biotite+garnet  domains  and  fine grained microcline domains, there is little to no albite present.  Apatite, sphene, and epidote grains also occur within or adjacent to

## G. L. Garratt, P.Geo.

Joseph E.L. Lindinger, P.Geo.

the mafic domains (McLeod, 2006).  Fine grained disseminated chalcopyrite and bornite occur locally within this fine grained, sugary rock.

The  protolith  of  these  strongly  altered  and  foliated  rocks  has  been  debated;  however  there  is strong  evidence  for  correlation  with  the  Duckling  mafic  megacrystic  unit:  the  gradational deformation boundary on the west side of the zone into medium grained mafic syenite rock as well  as  zones  of  relatively  weak  deformation  within  the  zone  preserving  relict  K-feldspar megacrysts.

The megacrystic dykes that cut the well foliated, altered rock are themselves variably deformed. The  dykes  are  well  foliated  internally,  to  rigid  and  boudinaged,  to  relatively  undeformed, recognizable mafic K-feldspar megacrystic unit.  The dykes are weakly to strongly K-feldspar altered.  Early grey K-feldspar alteration is overprinted by pervasive to patchy, coarse pink Kfeldspar  alteration  and  veins.  There  are  several  cross-cutting  vein  generations  that  range  in colour  (white  to  pink)  and  are  dominantly  K-feldspar  with  variable  amounts  of  albite(?).  All veins cut the older alteration and foliation of the wall rock.

The  early finely banded  foliation  in  the strongly altered and  mineralized  rocks  trends consistently  northwest.    Fabrics  associated  with  this  deformation  are  ductile  to  brittle.    The fabric  is  cut  off  by  the  main  bounding  west-northwest  trending  fault,  a  reactivated  brittle structure.

The Misty zone is interpreted to be a deformation zone along the boundary between a chilled border phase and the 'mafic' K-feldspar megacrystic unit.  The Misty deformation zone was active  as  a  brittle-ductile  shear  zone  during  intrusion  of  at  least  the  later  Duckling  intrusive phases. Deformation fabrics suggest synchronous deformation and dyke intrusion, supported by the variable states of internal dyke foliation and folded dykes.  Alteration was also progressive over the evolution of the deformation zone, from early fine grained, mineralogically segregated alteration in the wall rock, to later pink K-feldspar and veining that cuts the early deformation fabric.

Mineralization  in  the  Misty  area  is  commonly  fine  grained  disseminated  chalcopyrite  and bornite,  up  to  40%  volume  locally.    Grain  size  is  very  fine  and  mineralization  is  sometimes difficult  to  see  in  poor  light.    The  fine  grained,  sugary  grey  K-feldspar alteration is the most receptive  common  host  to  mineralization  as  northwest-elongate  pods  parallel  to  the  early foliation.  Mineralization occurs locally along the margins of K-feldspar porphyry dykes.  There is generally very little copper mineralization in the later pink K-feldspar alteration phases.

## Boundary Area

The  Boundary  and  Midway  showings  occur  near  the  northern  margin  of  the  Duckling  Creek Complex in  what is collectively called the Boundary area. The area is poorly exposed and is mostly below tree line.  A natural clearing at the Boundary showing exposes float boasting some of the best mineralization yet found in the area, otherwise rock on surface is scarce.  Hills rise up to the south of the Boundary and Midway showings, with outcrop along the side of the ridge.

The Boundary area includes the margin of the Duckling Creek syenite complex where Hogem medium  grained  monzonite  is  in  inferred  fault  contact  with  strongly  altered  Duckling  Creek rocks (Figure 29).  On the ridge to the south of the Boundary and Midway showings strongly Kfeldspar+white mica altered rocks have an inferred primary syenite protolith (Ds).  The faulted margin is also marked by large (&lt;2m) wide quartz veins in Duckling Creek rocks.  Down into the  trees  to  the  north,  in  the  immediate  Midway  and  Boundary  showing  areas,  rock  from  old diamond drill core shows strong alteration of an uncertain protolith.

Alteration along the ridge to the south of the immediate showings is slightly different than the alteration seen in old core.  Along the ridge, Duckling rocks immediately adjacent to the fault are strongly K-feldspar + white mica altered comprised of 100% Pink-orange Kfeldspar+interstitial white mica.  In core, the alteration is strong grey K-feldspar, including fine

grained  sugary  alteration  with  strong  disseminated  chalcopyrite  and  bornite  mineralization, overprinted by late pink K-feldspar alteration phases, with an uncertain protolith.  It appears that the strong, sugary grey K-feldspar alteration with mineralization is cut off by the bounding northwest fault, or is overprinted by the later stage K-feldspar+white mica alteration.

## West Showing

The West showing lies immediately west of the southern end of the Boundary area, described above.  The showing occurs on a steep west-facing ridge flank that falls off into the Haha Creek Valley to the north.

The area is underlain by the orange syenite unit, with northwest-trending, steeply-dipping pods and slivers of relict mafic megacrystic unit (Dcm).  The mafic megacrystic domains are variably K-feldspar altered, and contacts with the orange syenite are diffuse and strongly altered.  The orange  syenite  is  itself  strongly  K-feldspar+white  mica  altered  and  what  has  locally  been mapped as intrusive, may be strongly altered mafic megacrystic unit with the protolith altered beyond recognition.  Northeast faults cut the area with approximately 100 to 200 metre spacing, but generally have less than 10 metres of lateral displacement.

The West showing occurs within a northwest-trending mafic megacrystic domain approximately 200  metres  long.    The  megacrystic  body  is  locally  strongly  altered  to  fine  grained  grey  Kfeldspar+biotite+disseminated  chalcopyrite  and  bornite  with  &lt;10cm  biotite  veins  and  &lt;2cm wide  chalcopyrite  and  bornite  veins.    Later  stages  of  alteration  include  patches  of  pink  Kfeldspar flooding and veining.

Copper  mineralization  in  outcrop  and  in  float  was  found  for  250  metres  across  the  slope including the showing.  Chalcopyrite and bornite are finely disseminated in fine grained sugary alteration, and also occur in &lt;2cm veins locally.  At the West showing massive chalcopyrite and

## G. L. Garratt, P.Geo.

bornite  occur  with  increased  biotite  and  mineralized  veining;  there  is  a  strong  spatial correlation  between  biotite  veining  and  mineralization.    Some  biotite  veins  show  conjugate northwest and  northeast  control, the strong mineralization in the immediate  area  may concentrate at a structural intersection.

There is no other mineralization in the cliffs immediately along strike to the south. Outcrop is limited to the north under tree cover, however the presence of a north-northeast trending fault suggest that the zone of altered and mineralized relict mafic lenses is cut off or is offset into the valley under cover if it continues to the north.

## Cirque Showing

The Cirque showing occurs to the west, along the ridge, from the West showing.  Outcrop occurs along the lip of a north-facing bowl; the Cirque showing is at the top of the bowl.

The area is underlain by the orange syenite unit, weakly to strongly altered.  One to two metrewide dykes of fine grained leucosyenite trend steeply northeast across the top of the bowl.

At the Cirque showing the alteration changes to fine grained grey K-feldspar biotite alteration, locally  with  disseminated  chalcopyrite.    Veins  of  biotite+/-albite+chalcopyrite  and  malachite are concordant with the alteration.  A pink K-feldspar wash and patchy pink K-feldspar+white mica  alteration  overprints  the  grey  K-feldspar  phase.    The  grey  K-feldspar+biotite  alteration zone  is  &lt;15  metres  side  and  trends  northwest.    Copper  mineralization  is  limited  to  &lt;1  metre lenses and pods and biotite veins.

The Grey K-feldspar+biotite alteration is interpreted to be an early stage alteration, overprinted and engulfed by the orange syenite intrusion and associated pink K-feldspar+white mica+/-pyrite  alteration.    At  Cirque,  the  mineralized  lens  may  be  a  relict  altered  mafic megacrystic pod, similar to the occurrences in West showing area.

## Slide

The Slide area lies near the northeastern margin of the Duckling Creek Complex, on the north side of Haha Creek.

The  Slide  area  is  underlain  predominantly  by  a  mafic  K-feldspar  megacrystic  phase  of  the Duckling  Creek  Complex  separated  from  Hogem  monzonite  and  quartz  monzonite  to  the northwest across a series of steep northwest-trending faults.  Along the bounding fault, on the eastern  side  of  the  area,  an  orange  K-feldspar  syenite  phase  intrudes  both  the  K-feldspar megacrystic unit as well as Hogem monzonite on either side of the faulted boundary.  There are also hints of Takla volcanic rocks in the area of the Slide showings.  Rocks here are intensely altered  and  bounded  by  the  K-feldspar  megacrystic  unit,  but  show  relict  volcanic  breccia textures,  possibly  rafts  of  strongly  altered  Takla  volcanic  rocks  within  the  Duckling  Intrusive Complex.

## G. L. Garratt, P.Geo. Joseph E.L. Lindinger, P.Geo.

Alteration is most intense in the immediate area of the Slide trenches with fine grained, sugary K-feldspar+biotite+magnetite+chalcopyrite with veins of biotite and K-feldspar to 1 cm wide. Later stage pink K-feldspar+/-white mica washes over the earlier alteration and also cuts across the early foliation in veins. Northwest-trending alteration boundaries are relatively sharp over 2-3  metres  from  weakly  K-feldspar+biotite  altered  rock  to  intense,  sugary  grey  K-feldspar altered  rock.    There  is  a  garnet  halo  to  the  intense  alteration,  prismatic,  dark  brown  garnet occurs within approximately 20 metres of the alteration boundary.

Alteration  is  more  regionally  manifested  in  the  Slide  area  as  K-feldspar  and  quartz  veins overprinting  selective-pervasive  biotite  alteration.    Towards  the  faulted  boundary  with  the Hogem  rocks,  associated  with  the  orange  syenite  unit,  strong  pink  K-feldspar+white  mica alteration is dominant.

Mineralization at Slide is almost exclusively limited to the intensely altered northwest-trending domains in the area of the slide trenches.  Fine grained disseminated chalcopyrite and bornite occur within a fine grained sugary K-feldspar+biotite rock.  Chalcocite and a distinctive pale blue  azurite  occur  on  fractures.    Quartz  veins  containing  blebby  chalcopyrite  occur  in  to  the west of the peak at the top of the Slide showing area.  The veins are 1-2 cm wide and contain mineralization only locally.'

## Other Mineralized Zones:

Several other mineralized zones occur on the property and have been described in Garratt and Lindinger's, May 2006 report which has been filed on www.sedar.com.  These areas include the Dorothy, Rhonda, and MacKenzie areas. No new work was completed in these areas.

## EXPLORATION

Work on the Lorraine-Jajay  property,  which  include  valid  titles  located  as  early  as  1931,  has included 188 diamond drill holes and 22 percussion holes, for a total of 210 drill holes totaling 32,683.84 metres. This drilling is summarized as follows: prior to the year 2000, 133 holes were completed  totaling  16,458.71  metres;  from  2000  to  2005  Eastfield  oversaw  the  drilling  of  64 drill  holes  for  12,016.13  metres;  in  2006  Teck  Cominco  drilled  seven  holes  totaling  2,606.0 metres in the Lorraine area.

For additional  2006 exploration results  please  refer  to  prior reports including the report titled 'Summary  Report  on  the  Lorraine-Jajay  Property'  dated  March  12,  2007,  which  is  filed  on www.sedar.com by Eastfield Resources Ltd. and Lysander Minerals Corporation.

The  2007  exploration  program  was  designed  to  evaluate  a  large  (12  by  6  km)  area  that comprises the core of the Duckling Creek Complex and hosts most of the significant mineralized zones  in  the  Lorraine  area,  by  geological  mapping,  deep  IP  geophysics  and  widespaced  soil sampling.

A total of 90.6 line-km of IP geophysics were completed and 592 soil samples were collected on the IP lines. The IP survey was designed to 'look' down to approximately 450 m in depth, in order to test  for  continuity  of  the mineralized zones along strike and to depth.  Soil sampling was directed at filling gaps in the existing data base. The geophysical survey was successful in outlining both existing mineralized zones, such as the Bishop Zone, as well as indicating new or extended targets such as an IP anomaly that extends for 2.0 km northwest from the All Alone Dome target.

Six diamond drill holes were completed totaling 1,603 m in the Slide area.

Detailed  core  re-logging  was  completed  to  re-examine  alteration  and  mineral  zonation  in  the Bishop, Main and Lower Main zones.  Additional mapping in the Dorothy-Rhonda, Slide, Main, Ekland and Bishop areas. were also completed.

## Soil Sampling Results:

(The  following  review  of  the  geochemical  survey  is  excerpted  directly  from  a  Teck  Cominco Limited report summarizing the 2007 exploration results authored by Paul Baxter, P.Geo., the Lorraine Project Manager.)

In  2007,  592  soil  samples  were  collected on the Lorraine-Jajay and Jan-Tam-Misty properties along the 2007 grid lines in the area between All Alone Dome and the Boundary target.  Sample number locations, copper and gold results are shown in Figure 15.  Soil samples were collected at  50m  stations  along  the  cut  grid  lines  with  a  tree  planting  shovel,  placed  in  kraft  bags  and labeled with the sample number.  Soil sample location coordinates were recorded by hand held Garmin GPSMap 60CSX receiver in NAD83, zone 10.  Soil sample material was typically the B soil  horizon but in some alpine areas it may approximate a talus fine material.  Sample depths were typically in the 20-40cm range but occasionally up to 60cm deep.  Samples were dried on

site prior to shipment to Global Discovery Labs for a multi-element ICP plus trace gold analysis. Sample preparation and analytical methods are included in Appendix 2.

In  2006  a  large  very  strong  copper  -  gold  soil  geochemical  anomaly  was  outlined  on  the southeast  side  of  All  Alone  Dome.    In  2007,  this  anomaly  was  ground  checked  with  mixed results.  There is mineralized float on surface however; it appears that the material is moraine in origin probably originating from Weber bowl representing mineralized material sourced from the Main and Lower Main zones.  There are no significant IP anomalies on line 4500N or in the reprocessing of 2004 line 100N indicative of a local bedrock source in this area.

On the northwest slope of All Alone Dome, 2007 and historic sampling outlines elevated copper in  soil  values  (Soil  Anomaly  'A')  that  are  coincidental  with  the  All  Alone  Dome  North  IP chargeability anomaly outlined in 2007.  The copper in soil anomaly is approximately 2000m in length and is locally coincidental with elevated gold, silver, high moly especially on line 5700N, phosphorous and vanadium.

On the east end of 2007 soil grid lines 6100N - 6900N and in the historic sampling there is a north - northwest trending creek valley with copper enrichment.  It is unclear if this enrichment is due to glacial transport of mineralized material from the Lower Main and Main zone.  There are no IP geophysical anomalies in this area to suggest a local bedrock source.

On the west side of the 2007 soil grid (lines 5300N-6900N), a narrow, 1900m long copper in soil anomaly parallels the margin of a linear aeromagnetic high feature and is coincidental with the south end of a weak but deeper IP chargeability response (Soil Anomaly 'B').  The copper in soil anomaly also shows elevated gold, zinc and especially phosphorous and vanadium at its southerly end.

Soil Anomaly 'C' (lines 7300N - 8500N), which could be the continuation of anomaly 'B', is a narrow 1200m long copper anomaly with local elevated gold, zinc, phosphorous and vanadium. The south end is associated with near surface IP chargeability responses that may be associated with the main anomaly on line 7300N.  The soil anomaly is associated with a structure evident in the  airborne  magnetic  tilt  derivative.    In  the  area  of  line  8500N,  the  north  end  of  this  soil anomaly was drill tested by three diamond drill holes (72-3, 72-4, 74-5) from the early 1970's and  is  known  as  the  Fault  target.    This  target  is  described  as  a  strongly  sheared,  K  feldspar altered zone erratically mineralized with chalcopyrite, malachite and bornite (Adamson, 1972). The diamond drilling returned no significant results.

Copper anomaly 'D' is a 500m x 300m copper core of a larger Au, Ag, Mo, Pb, Zn and As in soil anomaly.  The core of this multi-element anomaly is rimmed by a much wider (1.0x1.5km) weaker gold in soil anomaly outlined in 2007 on its south end.  The anomaly covers the historic Sam target outlined by Umex in the 1970's And Varitech Resources in 1991.  The Sam target is described  as  being  hosted  in  leucosyenites  with  quartz  veins  cut  by  north  trending  recessive structures.    Mineralization  consists  of  fine  disseminated  pyrite  and  chalcopyrite  (Peto,  1991). Mapping  by  Teck  Cominco  shows  the  area  to  be  underlain  by  coarse  grained  to  pegmatitic feldspar  syenite  with  variable  white  mica.    The  soil  anomaly  partially  covers  an  aeromagnetic low  that  lies  at  the  northwest  termination  of  an  aeromagnetic  high  feature  that  extends northwestward  from  the  All  Alone  Dome  area.    The  soil  anomaly  lies  off  of  the  grid  lines

covered by the 2007 deep penetrating IP survey but was covered by an IP survey in 1991 by Varitech Resources. The 1991 survey shows no chargeability anomalies in the soil anomaly 'D' area. The size and strength of this anomaly requires additional evaluation.

## Geophysical Survey:

Baxter 2007 continues; '…The bulk of the 2007 exploration program on the Lorraine-Jajay and Jan-Tam-Misty properties was a 90.6km deep penetrating IP geophysical survey.  Cut grid lines were oriented by combination of compass and GPS control and were spaced between 300 and 450m apart.  Stations along the lines were flagged by the IP crew with coordinates recorded by hand held Garmin GPSMap 60CSX receiver in NAD83, zone 10.  The IP geophysical survey was conducted by Scott Geophysics Ltd. of Vancouver BC and occurred between August 5 and October 11, 2007.  The survey utilized a pole-dipole array at an 'a' spacing of 100m and 'n' separations  of  1  to  12.    It  is  estimated  that  the  survey  is  confidently  seeing  to  depths of 400500m below surface.

Surveying of the Slide target was not completed due to weather and budget limitations at the end of the season.

## Geophysical Results

The  IP  data  was  3D  modeled  and  level  plans  at  selected  depth  intervals  were  produced  for graphic  two  dimensional  display.  Figures  x  and  y  show  the  -200m,  -300m  and  -400m chargeability level plans with labels and drill hole collar locations indicating mineralization zones and targets.

As alkalic copper-gold deposits such as the Lorraine occurrences are typically low sulphide, i.e., carry low percentages of sulphides, have relatively sharply defined edges and the country rocks surrounding  the  deposits  carry  little  to  no  sulphides,  IP  geophysical  surveys  are  particularly useful  in  outlining  sulphide,  or  metal-bearing  zones.  Generally  the  sulphide  assemblages  are dominant  in  copper  bearing  varieties  such  as  chalcopyrite  and  bornite  with  much  lesser  iron sulphides such as pyrite. These characteristics combine to suggest that mineralized zones will be strongly  indicated  by  IP  chargeability  anomalies  that  are  weak  to  moderate  or  stronger  in strength (i.e. &gt;6 ms).

The Figures display several chargeability anomalies many of which are associated with known mineralization  such  as  the  Upper  and  Lower  Main  Zones  and  the  Bishop  Zone.  Anomalous levels on these figures is shown by light green to yellow to red colors. The linear character of many of the anomalies strongly supports earlier interpretations and observations of mineralized zones  which  display  linear  and  often  slab-like  geometry.  In  particular,  the  IP  data  suggests continuity  through  the  Lower  Main  Zone  to  Bishop  Zone  area  which  has  been  previously interpreted but has yet to be drill tested between zones. Anomalies to the south of these zones indicates the potential for outlining further mineralization through Copper Peak and to the south of there.

It  is  also  apparent  that  many  anomalies  gain  width  and  strength  at  deeper  levels.  This  is particularly  significant  indicating  strongly  developed systems that now appear to show greater depth extent and size than could have been known from previous data.

## G. L. Garratt, P.Geo.

Joseph E.L. Lindinger, P.Geo.

With  regard  to  some  of  the  individual  targets  that  were  previously  known  from  shallow  or surface data, interesting new observations can be made. The All Alone Dome Target (AAD) was previously described by a 500m  by  500m  coincident  soil copper geochemical  and IP chargeability anomaly. The deep IP now suggests an anomalous zone extending for at least 2 km as  well  as  a  large  new  anomaly  appearing to the southwest of the main anomaly.  This target area is now comparable in scale to the Main-Bishop area.

In the Boundary area it appears that the IP anomaly lies to the west of the drilling and has not been tested in its strongest part. The 2 Good (shortened from Too Good To Be True) anomaly in the southwest grid area is the most dramatic of all the anomalies by its size and strength, both of  which show strong increase to depth. This target is 2.5 km long and open-ended. Previous shallow drilling did not test the stronger portions of the anomaly though one hole (05-101) did carry some pyrite zoning to pyrite-chalcopyrite toward the bottom of the hole suggesting a need for deeper drill testing.

## Geological Work

The following geological review of work by TCL geologists during the 2007 program is taken directly from an internal summary memo by Paul Baxter, P.Geo., of TCL.

## Revised Geologic Model

'In 2007, continued mapping and core re-logging in the Bishop and Main zones has lead to a revised model of the geologic setting, timing of igneous events and hydrothermal mineralization, the tectonic evolution of the Lorraine deposit and the development of clear vectors to ore.  The principle  rock  types  present  at  Lorraine  have  not  changed  and  a  detailed  discussion  on  the lithologic  units  can  be  found  in  previous  reports  by  Evans  and  Devine,  2006  and  Baxter  and Devine, 2007.

The revised model for the Lorraine deposit is summarized in Figures 17a through 17d.

Stage one is the initial intrusion of an alkaline dyke swarm into the host Hogem batholith with local  preservation  of  older  Takla  volcanics.    The  alkaline dyke swarm ranges from pyroxenite through to syenite compositions with porphyry copper mineralization and associated alteration of  the  Lower  Main,  Main  and  Bishop  zones  developed  within  this  dyke  swarm  above  a  yet unidentified causative intrusion, Figure 17a.

Stage two of the model is a northeasterly tipping of the stage one dyke swarm and porphyry copper  mineralization  producing  the  well  documented  southwesterly  dip  to  the  mineralized zones at Lorraine, Figure 17b.

Stage three is formation of an east-west trending subvertical ductile shear zone that has affected parts of the Lower Main zone, Figure 17c.

Stage four is renewed alkaline igneous activity that produces a stage 2 dyke swarm also ranging from pyroxenite through to syenite composition, Figure 17d.

The Jan-Tam-Misty and Lorraine-Jajay property geology map from 2006 has been re-interpreted to represent the distribution of stage one and stage two igneous events and is shown in Figure 18.'

## Sulfide Zonation.

'Figure  19  (a,  b)  shows  the  results  of  mapping  copper  sulfide  species  within  core  from  the Bishop zone outlining a well defined sulfide zonation from a bornite core outwards to a pyrite margin.  As porphyry copper sulfide zonation usually forms in a subvertical orientation tilting of the  mineral  zonation  must  occur  to  get  to  this  present  orientation.    The  recognition  of  this zonation and its current geometry is key in the development of the revised model and gives clear vectoring to use for continued exploration.  Figure 19 also illustrates the cross-cutting nature and abundance of the second stage post mineral igneous event.'

<!-- image -->

## Implications to Exploration

'The above model has been developed through detailed studies of the geology, alteration and mineralization  of  the  Lorraine  Deposit.    Similar  observations  such  as  sulfide  zonation,  post mineral dyking and southwest dipping mineralization have been made at other prospects within the Duckling Creek complex however due to the less developed nature of these prospects not all conclusions reached at Lorraine can be carried to these other prospects.  What can be concluded is that the Duckling Creek syenite complex is host to multiple centres of porphyry style copper mineralization  that  illustrate  both  pre  and  post  mineralizing  igneous  events.      Alteration paragenesis is complex however, sulfide zonation gives easily identifiable vectoring information that can be quickly applied in the field.  At Lorraine, the second stage of igneous activity is not productive but one cannot conclude that this observation holds throughout the entire Duckling Creek  complex.    It  is  possible  that  copper  porphyry  systems  have  developed  elsewhere  in association with the second stage of igneous activity.

## Dorothy Rhonda Corridor

The Dorothy and Rhonda prospects are associated with an elongate northeast trending diorite body  cutting  Takla  Group  volcanics  both  of  which  are  cut  by  stage  two  Duckling  Creek syenites.  The style of mineralization, presence of moly and the alteration assemblage of Dorothy and  Rhonda  is  different  than  the  copper  occurrence  further  to  the  northwest.    It  has  been suggested  that  the  diorite  body  is  more  closely  related  to  the  older  phases  of  the  Hogem Batholith  rather  than  the  Duckling  Creek  syenite  complex.    Samples  of  the  diorite  have  been collected for age dating but results have not been received yet.'

## DRILLING

The  first  diamond  drilling  on  the  Lorraine  claims  occurred  in  1949  and  since  that  time  most drilling  has  been  on  the  core  Lorraine  claims.  Work  on  the  Lorraine-Jajay  property,  which include  valid  titles  located  as  early  as  1931,  has  included  182  diamond  drill  holes  and  22 percussion  holes,  for  a  total  of  204  drill  holes  totaling  31,080.84  metres.  This  drilling  is summarized  as  follows:  prior  to  the  year  2000,  133  holes  were  completed  totaling  16,458.71 metres; from 2000 to 2005 Eastfield oversaw the drilling of 64 drill holes for 12,016.13 metres. Twenty diamond drill holes have been completed on the Dorothy claims and approximately the same  number  in  several  scattered  locations  throughout  the  remainder  of  the  property.    Most holes drilled after 1972 have their replicated splits stored at three core storage facilities on the property.  The results of significant mineralized intercepts from previous drilling, and their hole locations are listed in Appendices 3 and 4 respectively.

## 2007 Drilling

Six  widely  spaced  diamond  drill  holes,  totalling  1,603.6  metres,  were  completed  in  the  Slide Zone  to  follow  up  on  the  successful  drill  testing  completed  in  the  2006  program.  Drilling continued  to  intersect  good  copper  values  in  this  area  and  intersected  multiple  bands  of

mineralization, indicating that further drill testing is warranted.  A summary of selected results from this program are outlined in the following table:

## SAMPLING METHOD AND APPROACH

For past exploration programs please refer to prior reports including the report titled  'Summary Report on the Lorraine-Jajay Property' dated May 17, 2006, which is filed on www.sedar.com.

2007 Sampling Procedures.

Sampling  was  completed  by  employees  of  Mincord  Exploration  Consultants  Ltd.  under  the guidance and direction of Teck Cominco project management. A review of these procedures has determined that they meet the quality control and assurance standards.

Drill core is placed in numbered core boxes at the drill site by the driller's helper whenever the core tube is pulled up and it contains core.  A wooden run block marks the bottom end of the core  recovered  in  the  box  each  time  the  tube  is  pulled.    The  driller  keeps  track  of  the footage/depth by counting the number of ten-foot rods in the hole. The 'zero' point, usually the top of the casing or the surface of the drill-deck is discussed and agreed upon by the driller and the geologist prior to the first hole being drilled.  Diamond drill core is usually transported daily by helicopter, all terrain vehicle, or pickup truck from the drill to the core storage and sampling facility located on the property.

Here the core is laid out,  metric  conversion  of  the  run-blocks  footages  is  carried  out  and  the core boxes are labeled with a weather-proof metal tag.  The laid-out core is examined by the project geologist who does a preliminary evaluation of the hole's potential, identifies the main rock  types,  marks  the  main  contacts  and  mineralization  zones.    A  technician  measures  core recovery between wooden blocks and records these on a recovery sheet.  Any mistakes made by the  driller  in  marking  the  boxes  or  run  blocks  are  usually  caught  by  the  next  stage.    Core photographs or digital images are taken three boxes at a time.  The core is then moved to the core logging shack where the geologist uses a computer Access based logging system to record the geology.  The geologist also enters the sample intervals, generally 1 to 3 metres depending on variations in rock types or the intensity and character of the mineralization.

The core is then moved to the next shack to be split using a mechanical core splitter with half the sample bagged and the other half left in the core boxes for record purposes  to be stacked on site.    The  core  splitters  fill  in  of  triple  tags  books  of  pre-printed  sample  numbers  using  the intervals entered and marked by the geologist.  The splitter and his helper note the interval in the tag  book  and  place  each  sample  in  a  heavy-duty  poly  sample  bag  also  inserting  a  uniquely numbered tear-off section from the assay book.  A corresponding number is stapled into the core box at the bottom of the proper sample interval.  No other number or mark is made on the core or sample bags and from that point on no person handling the core when it is shipped, received at the analytical laboratory can determine what hole or even what property the core is from.  The poly  sample  bags  are  closed  and  sealed  with  a  cinch  strap  and  bundled  in  groups  of  5  or  6 (weighing 20 to 30 kilograms) into an opaque rice-sack which is also sealed.  During the core splitting there are normally several people present, and none of the core-splitters wear jewelry. No other sample preparation is carried out on the property.

## SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSIS AND SECURITY

## 2007 Program

To  trace  samples  quickly,  each  drill  hole  was  allotted  a  1-2-3  shipment  number  with  A-B-C suffixes  for  drill  holes  shipped  over  several  weeks.    Each  week,  samples  were  shipped in rice bags duly marked with the shipment number.  The samples went by truck to Fort St. James by bonded carrier where they were either trucked to Global Discovery Labs in Vancouver directly, or trucked to Prince George and then sent to Vancouver via Greyhound Courier, depending on the shipper's schedule.  A sample list accompanied each shipment and Acme sent confirmations of shipments received.  Assay certificates also referred to that shipment number.

## Analytical Control

This  section  has  been  supplied  by  Teck  Cominco  Limited  who  undertook  and  managed  the sampling and quality control program under the supervision of their project manager Paul Baxter, P.Geol.

Three copper - gold standards were obtained from CDN Resource Laboratories Ltd which were routinely inserted into the sample stream from the field.  In total, 31 standards representing 7% of  all  drill  samples  submitted were inserted.  Table 4 summarizes the recommended value and the 'Between Lab' two standard deviation values for the standards.

## Table 4: Analytical Standards

| Standard Number   | Recommended Cu Value   | Recommended Au Value   |
|-------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| CDN - CGS - 6     | 0.318 +/- 0.018 %      | 0.26 +/- 0.03 g/t      |
| CDN - CGS - 7     | 1.01 +/- 0.07 %        | 0.95 +/- 0.08 g/t      |
| CDN - CGS - 11    | 0.683 +/- 0.026 %      | 0.73 +/- 0.068 g/t     |

For  the  2007  drill  program,  the  analytical  lab  used  was  Global  Discovery  Labs  (GDL)  of Vancouver,  BC  and  the  standard  analytical  package  used  on  all  samples  was  a  multi-element aqua  regia  ICP  package  and  a  trace  level  aqua  regia  solvent  extraction  gold  package.    The analytical procedures used by Global Discovery Labs are attached in Appendix 2.  For the 2007 drill  program, any sample that returned an initial ICP copper value &gt;1000ppm was flagged for re-analysis by assay methods for % copper.  As a result, any potentially economic mineralization will  be  analyzed  by  assay  technique.    Similar  for  gold,  any  initial  geochemical  gold  result &gt;100ppb Au was re-analyzed by fire assay for g/t Au.  The exception here is for the mineralized intervals from holes 12 and 15 which were sent directly to an assay for % Cu and g/t gold.

In addition to the standards and duplicates inserted in the field, Global Discovery Labs internal QA/QC program includes insertion of standards and repeat analysis.  For fire assay, every batch of 48 samples includes 7 repeats and 1 standard, for aqua regia multi-element ICP every batch of 30  samples  includes  3  repeats  and  1  standard  and  gold  geochem  includes  3  repeats  and  2 standards in every 25 samples.  The standards used by Global Discovery Labs during the 2007 drill program are listed in Table 5.

## Table 5: Global Discovery Lab Standards

| Standard Number   | Recommended Cu Value   | Recommended Au Value   |
|-------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| CDN-FCM-1         | 0.94 +/- 0.07 % Cu     | 1.71 +/- 0.14 g/t Au   |
| CDN-GS-P5B        |                        | 0.44 +/- 0.04 g/t      |
| CDN-GS-3C         |                        | 3.58 +/- 0.31 g/t      |
| CDN-HLLC          | 1.49 +/- 0.06 % Cu     | 0.83 +/- 0.12 g/t Au   |
| STD:  DA          | 132 ppm Cu +/- 10-20%  | In House Standard      |

## Field Analytical Standards

## Copper Standard

Figures  1,  3  and  5  show  the  three  copper  standard  aqua  regia  ICP  results  relative  to  the recommended value +/- two standard deviations.  The multi-element ICP copper results are on average within 8-10% of the recommended copper value for the standards used however, these results do not show many samples falling within the recommended ranges and several samples would be classified as failures (Mean +/- three standard deviations).  GDL results do not show any  consistent  pattern  of  over  or  understating  the  copper  value  for  the  standards  used.    One must  remember  that  this  is  a  comparison  of  an  aqua  regia  ICP  technique  measured  against  a standard determined by assay techniques.

As all standards are greater than the 1000ppm copper threshold used to trigger a re-analysis, all standards  would  have  also  been  analyzed  for  copper  by  Assay  techniques.    The  assay  quality copper results for the inserted standards falls very close to the recommended value for the three standards and are considered acceptable (Figures 2, 4 and 6).

## Gold Standard

Figures  7,  9  and  11  show  the  trace  level  aqua  regia  gold  results  of  the  three  standards  used relative  to  the  recommended  value  +/-  two  standard  deviations.    The  results  for  all  three standards shows that most samples under estimate the gold by 22-28% with very few samples falling within the accepted values.  This under recording of gold is a function of the analytical technique  that  is  poor  at  recovering  all  the  gold  within  rock  samples.    Again  these  standard samples  have  also  undergone  analysis  by  fire  assay  techniques  with  all  but  one  of  the  assay results falling within acceptable result limits (Figure 8, 10 and 12).

## Comments on QA/QC

For  the  2007  drill  program,  all  core  samples  have  been  analyzed  by  an  initial  aqua  regia  ICP technique that has not done well at meeting the recommended copper values for the standards inserted.    This  is  due  to  a  comparison  of  an  aqua  regia  geochemical  analysis  compared  to  a standard determined by assay techniques.  This would raise concerns with regards to the average copper results for any mineralized intersections but this has been overcome by re-analyzing for copper by assay techniques the mineralized intervals and any samples &gt;1000ppm copper.  The assay  quality  results  for  the  inserted  standards  shows  a  high  degree  of  accuracy such that the

G. L. Garratt, P.Geo. Joseph E.L. Lindinger, P.Geo.

average % copper grades shown for the diamond drill program can be considered acceptable. Similar to the copper analysis, any gold results for the diamond drill program that are a result of an assay technique can be considered acceptable.

## ADJACENT PROPERTIES

Lysander  Minerals  Corporation  holds  claims  that  border  the  Lorraine-Jajay-Jan-Tam-Misty property  on  the  western  and  northern  boundaries.  Most  of  this  property  has  only  seen reconnaissance level exploration with the exception of the Cat Mountain property where several exploration programs over the past thirty years have continued to evaluate known copper-gold and gold mineral occurrences hosted in Takla volcanics.

## MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING

The company has not undertaken any metallurgical testing.

## MINERAL RESOURCE AND MINERAL RESERVE ESTIMATES

Misty

On  the  Misty  target  El  Paso  Mining  and  Milling  Ltd.  outlined,  by  trenching,  diamond  and percussion drilling a mineralized zone 500 m long, averaging 11m wide that extends to a depth of at least 170m.  Mineralization comprises disseminated chalcopyrite, pyrite and bornite, with veinlets  of  chalcopyrite  and  pyrite  common  along  the  contact  margins  of  crosscutting  syenite dikes  and  orthoclase  veins.    Mineralization  is  reportedly  hosted  within  a  1200  meter  long northwest trending southwest dipping, chloritized, k-feldspar altered, hornblende-biotite gneiss. El  Paso  calculated  a  'reserve'  of  3  million  tonnes  grading  0.6  per  cent  copper  (Pilcher  et  al, 1976). This calculation predates National Policy 43-101 implementation, and is therefore is a 'historical estimate' and should not be relied upon.

## Slide

Union Miniere Explorations and Mining Corporation Limited (UMEX) completed trenching and diamond drilling (25 holes, 3629m) on the Boundary, Midway, Cirque and Fault targets.  The best  drill  hole  from  the  Boundary  deposit  is  0.68%  Cu  over  179.8m  in  hole  74-6  from  3.7183.5m including 1.59% Cu over 39.6m from 3.7-43.3m.  Copper mineralization occurs both as fine-grained  disseminations  and  as  fracture  fillings  within  fine  grained  foliated  and  massive potassium altered syenites.  Umex calculated a 'reserve' for the Boundary deposit of 7.2 million tonnes  grading  0.55  percent  copper  and  4.11  grams  per  tonne  silver  (Dyson,  1974). This calculation predates National Policy 43-101 implementation, and is therefore is a 'historical estimate' and should not be relied upon .  New mapping information by Teck-Cominco suggests this estimate may be too large.

Peatfield's 1996 calculation predates National Policy 43-101 implementation, and is therefore a 'historical  estimate',  and  due  to  the  new  information  provided  by  subsequent  exploration  has been determined by the authors as no longer complying with the Instrument and should not be relied  upon.    Although  new  information  described  in  subsequent  reports  and  disclosures, including this report has improved delineation and enlarged the volume of mineralized rock used in  Peatfield's resource estimate, the authors have not completed sufficient work to classify the historical  estimate  with  the  incorporated  new  information  as  current  mineral  resources  or reserves.

## OTHER RELEVANT DATA AND INFORMATION

The authors are not aware of any other relevant data or information pertaining to the property that has not been reviewed or included in this report.

## INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS

The  Lorraine-Jajay  and  Jan-Tam-Misty  property  is  underlain  by  the  alkalic  Ducking  Creek Syenite complex, that and hosts many alkalic copper-gold-silver+/-PGE deposits.   The deposits and  mineral  occurrences  associated  with  the  complex  occur  with  the  late  phase  syenite differentiates and host dominantly disseminated chalcopyrite and bornite copper mineralization. Anomalous levels of silver, gold and occasionally palladium occur with the copper mineralization.    This  is  characteristic  of  these  deposit  types  in  British  Columbia.    Also characteristic is the multiple occurrence of several individual mineral deposits, as has been well documented  at  the  Galore  Creek,  Mt.  Polley,  Afton  and  Copper  Mountain  districts  of  the Quesnel-Stikine Terrane , all of which are analogous to the Lorraine-Jajay system.

The  alteration  systems  associated  with  mineralization  in  the  Lorraine,  Elizabeth-Dorothy, Rhonda and West Rhonda, Misty, Slide, Boundary, Steelehead, All Alone Dome and Mackenzie areas has been outlined by mapping to extend up to 6 kilometres by 15 kilometres.  Each area hosts  several  known  mineral  occurrences  defined  by  various  level  of  exploration.    The  best

G. L. Garratt, P.Geo.

copper and gold mineralization as currently known occurs as northwest striking moderately to steeply  northeast  rotated  and  now  southwest  dipping  'pencil  porphyry'  bodies  and  occur  as copper  sulphide  disseminations  with  biotite  and  is  most  commonly  associated  with  texturally destructive extreme potassic alteration (resulting in a rock of syenitic composition) of the 'Phase 1' pyroxenitic intrusions  of the Duckling Creek Syenite Complex.  These pencil porphyries in the  Bishop  deposit  host  a  chalcocite-bornite  core  that  grades  outward  to  bornite-chalcopyrite then chalcopyrite-pyrite then to a narrow pyrite shell.  Other significant styles of mineralization include magnetite, gold and high grade copper +/- PGE veins within shears.    Significant copper occurrences are most often, but not always, associated with weak to moderate IP chargeability anomalies, while strong IP anomalies generally reflect dominantly pyrite occurrence. Crosscutting  and  truncating  the  earlier  lithologies  and  mineralization  are  northwest  striking vertically  oriented  Phase  II  syenites  to  pyroxenites  intrusive  postdate  most  of  the  known mineralization.

The Elizabeth-Dorothy-Rhonda areas are interpreted to be hosted by a diorite body not related to the Duckling Creek or Hogem intrusive complexes.

The  Lorraine-All  Alone  Dome  area  appears  to  be  the  largest  known  alteration/mineralizing system of this type in British Columbia.  This northwesterly trending system is well expressed as a regional magnetic high anomaly.

Drilling  on  the  Slide  target  re-confirmed  the  presence  of  significant  copper  mineralization  but there is still insufficient drilling to define the geometry or size mineralized zones..

The deep IP geophysics within the central portion of the exploration area produce some very interesting chargeability anomalies which must be followed up by both shallow and deep drilling.

The  2007  exploration  program  was  designed  to  improve  geological  information  in  key  target areas.  The program was very successful in improving the understanding about the mineralizing systems  in various parts of the property. The  greatly  improved  understanding  of  the relationships between intrusive phases, alteration and mineralization gained in this program will aid  future  exploration  in  focusing  on  key  identifiers  to  mineralizing  systems  on  the  property. The  project  certainly  met  its  objectives  and  increased  the  potential  for  the  discovery  of mineralization in several areas.

## RECOMMENDATIONS

The authors have outlined an exploration program to further assess the exploration potential of the Jajay-Lorraine/JMT properties. While the authors have recommended the program outlined below based on information from all available sources including Teck Cominco's 2006 and 2007 reports,  the  actual  exploration  programs  and  strategies  will  be  designed  and  implemented  by Teck Cominco Limited personnel under the rights of the Option Agreements. While some of the recommendations described below may be implemented, there is no certainty or requirement that Teck  Cominco  Limited  will  indeed  implement  any  of  these  recommendations.  Similarly,  Teck Cominco Limited is not bound by the budget presented below and will define its own budget and make expenditures at its own discretion.  Neither the authors nor Lorraine Copper Corp. have

G. L. Garratt, P.Geo. Joseph E.L. Lindinger, P.Geo.

any control over the design and implementation of the exploration programs to be considered by Teck Cominco Limited.

## Objectives:

The 2008 exploration program is designed to:

- · Expand the known mineralized zones at the Lorraine deposits by step-out drilling.
- · Further define exploration targets surrounding the Lorraine deposits and drill test priority targets.
- · .
- · Continue the process of evaluating several priority target areas around the property to locate sites warranting detailed exploration.

## 2008 Exploration Program Proposal and Summary:

The  2008  exploration  program  will  be  controlled  by  access  availability  based  on  the  timing  of spring break-up and upper elevation snow melt.

The  2008.  Drilling  should  be  expanded  in  the  next  program  to  allow  reasonable  evaluation  of several targets. Detailed geologic mapping has been largely completed in the main areas but some fill-in and extension should be completed. The IP geophysical survey should be extended northward to  cover  the  Slide  target  as  well  as  along  the  western  side  to  cover  probable  extensions  of  the 2Good target and to cover at least part of the Misty area.

## 2008 Exploration Program: Budget Estimate

The  preliminary  budget  estimate  given  below  is  derived  from  reviewing  the  2007  expenditure statements and applying those costs to the proposed program.  Contractor and supplier costs for 2008  are  not  known,  and  some  escalation  is  expected  over  2007  costs.    Certain  aspects  of  the program have not been costed or tendered for contractor bids and may be in error. This preliminary budget estimate will require further research to refine,  particularly with respect to infrastructure, materials and contractor costs.

Analytical Procedures

<!-- image -->

## Gold (Solvent Extraction-AA)

## Analytical Preparation/Method

A 10 gram sample pulp is roasted at 625  C for 1 hour.  The sample is o then digested in Aqua Regia followed by solvent extraction of the gold in 2,  6-Dimethyl-4-heptanone  (DIBK).    Samples  are  analyzed  by  Atomic Absorption.

## Quality Control And Statistics

Every  25  samples  prepared  include  3  sample  repeats  and  2  in-house  and/or commercial standard.

## ICP  DIGESTION (Aqua Regia)

## Analytical Preparation/Method

A 0.5 gram rock sample pulp is digested in aqua regia on a sand bath at 95 O C for 3 hours, shaking every 20 - 30 minutes.  Sample is diluted and mixed on a vortex. The sample is then analyzed on the I.C.P. to produce a 28 multi-element package which includes: Cu, Pb, Zn, Ag, As, Ba, Cd, Co, Ni, Fe, Mo, Cr. Bi, Sb, V, Sn, W, Sr, Y, La, Mn, Mg, Ti, Al, Ca, Na,  K and P.

## Quality Control

Every  40  samples  prepared  includes  3  sample  repeats,  1  in-house  standard  and/or commercial standard.

## Gold Fire Assay - Lead Collection (A.A. or Gravimetric Finish)

## Analytical Preparation/Method

- 1. 30 grams of sample is homogenized and weighed into a crucible and combined with a flux.
- 2. The sample and flux are homogenized and silver is added as a collector.
- 3. The crucibles are placed into a 2000 F furnace and are fused for 1hr. o
- 4. After fusing, they are poured into a mold to allow separation of the lead button from the slag.
- 5. They are pounded to remove the slag and then placed into cupels in another furnace pre-heated to 1600 F. They remain there until all the lead o is oxidized.
- 6. The cupels are removed from the furnace and cooled. The remaining bead of silver and precious metals is removed and analysed.
- 7. If the expected values are low, the bead is digested in acid and read on an AA. (lab method Au(4)). If the expected values are high, the sample is parted with dilute nitric acid and the remaining gold is weighed (lab method Au(2)).

## Quality Control

Every 48 samples prepared include 7 sample repeats and 1 in-house and/or commercial standard
