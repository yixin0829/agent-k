## INDEPENDENT TECHNICAL REPORT

13 April 2011

The Directors Red Crescent Resources Limited Mahatma Gandhi Cad. No: 102/1 Gazi Osman Pasa Cankaya Ankara, 06700 Republic of Turkey

Dear Sirs,

The MSA Group (MSA) has been commissioned by Red Crescent Resources Limited (RCR) to  provide  an  Independent  Qualified  Persons'  Technical  Report  on  mineral  properties  (The Hakkari Zinc Project (HZP)) located in the Republic of Turkey in which RCR has an interest.

MSA has not been requested to provide an Independent Valuation, nor have we been asked to  comment on the Fairness or Reasonableness of any vendor or promoter considerations, and we have therefore not offered any opinion on these matters.

MSA has based its review of the HZP on information and independent reports provided by RCR, data collected during the 2010 exploration program, and other relevant published and unpublished data available up to and including March 2011. Site visits were undertaken to the HZP by Mike Robertson between 26 July to 7 August 2009, 20 to 27 June 2010 and 13 to 18 August  2010,  by  Mike  Robertson  and  Brendan  Clarke  from  16  to  30  March  2010  and  by Brendan Clarke, Mike Hall and Mike Robertson between 4 and 8 December 2010. This NI 43101  Technical  Report  has  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  National  Instrument  43-101 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (NI 43-101) and Form 43-101F1, as issued by the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA). A final draft of the report was provided to RCR, along  with  a  written  request  to  identify  any  material  errors  or  omissions  prior  to  lodgment. MSA has provided consent for the release of the NI 43-101 Technical Report in the form and context in which it appears.

The  HZP  comprises  17  granted  licenses  located  in  south-eastern  Turkey.    Four  of  the Licenses are Operation Licenses whereas the remainder are Exploration Licenses. RCR has a fully  vested  50%  interest  in  15  of  these  licenses  through  a  Definitive  JV  Agreement  with Seyitoğlu  Madencilik,  the  original  holder  of  the  licenses,  now  held  in  an  RCR  subsidiary company called RCR Seyitoğlu Cinko Madencilik A.Ş. (RCR Zinc or RCRZ). The legal status and  rights  of  RCRZ  to  these  Exploration  Licenses  has  been  independently  verified  by attorneys Cakmak Avukatlik (Cakmak).  The present status of these 15 is accordingly based on  information  provided  by  Cakmak  and  copies  of  the  Exploration  Licenses  have  been observed by the author.  Furthermore, RCR have operational and explorational agreements

with the current owners of the remaining two licences (The Pentagon and Licence 26), with transfer of the licences to RCR expected in late April 2011.

The  mineral  properties  that form  the  HZP  represent  exploration  projects  which  have associated attached risks; however MSA considers nonetheless, that the projects have been acquired  on  the  basis  of  sound  technical  merit.    The  properties  are  also  considered  to  be sufficiently  prospective  on  the  basis  that  significant  quantities  of  non-sulphide  zinc-lead material have been previously mined from informal small-scale workings exploiting the same and/or  related  mineralized  units on  adjacent  properties. Additionally, RCR  undertook systematic exploration programs on two of the licenses, the results of which are reported in this  report  and  were  used to formulate the maiden  mineral resource estimate for  License 5 and a non-compliant mineral resource estimate for The Pentagon License.  Therefore, subject to varying degrees of exploration risk, the HZP warrants further exploration and assessment of its specific economic potential, consistent with the proposed programs by RCR. Exploration and  evaluation  work  programs  and  budgets  summarized  in  the  report  amount  to  a  total expenditure  of  approximately  USD$ 4 200 000  for  the  2011  exploration  season.  RCR  has prepared staged exploration and evaluation programs, specific to the potential of the projects, which are consistent with the budget allocations.  MSA considers that the relevant areas have sufficient technical merit to justify the proposed work programs and associated expenditure.

Figure 9-3 Cross-sectional view of a subvertical to overturned mineralized zone along a thrust surface.    The  lowermost  (left)  portion  is  dominated  by  Zn  (clearly  visible  as  white smithsonite  /  hemimorphite),  the  ore-zone  then  becomes  enriched  in  Fe  and  Pb  richer higher up (to the right).  This location represents the steeply dipping portion of one of the many thrust packages in the area. 37

Figure 10-3 Schematic reconnaissance structural map of License 10, showing bedding traces (red lines), mineralized zone exposures (orange dots) and interpreted strike trends of the mineralized zones (orange lines).  Note the interpreted synformal structure that appears to be responsible for duplication of the main mapped mineralized zone. 41

## 1 SUMMARY

The  Hakkari  Zinc  Project  (HZP)  is  located  in  the  Hakkari  and  Sirnak  Provinces  of south-eastern Turkey, close to the borders with Iraq and Iran. The HZP comprises 4 Operation  Licenses  and  13  Exploration  Licenses  covering  a  cumulative  area  of 264.63  km   and  is  located  within  a  broad  60 km  long  east-west  belt  extending 2 westwards from approximately 10 km west of the town of Hakkari.

Red Crescent Resources Limited (RCR) is the 100 per cent owner of Red Crescent Resources Holding Anonim Şirketi which has a fully vested 50% interest in 15 of the licenses  through  a  Definitive  JV  Agreement  with  Seyitoğlu  Madencilik,  the  original holder of the licenses, now held in an RCR subsidiary company called RCR Seyitoğlu Cinko Madencilik A.Ş. (RCR Zinc or RCRZ).  RCRZ have also formalised mining and exploration  agreements  with  the  current  Operating  Licence  (OL)  holders  on  two operating Licences (The Pentagon and Licence 26) and await formal transfer of these licences to RCRZ, expected in late April 2011.

The project area is situated within the northern margins of the Arabian Platform within a north facing fold and thrust belt known as the Border Folds region.  The fold and thrust belt comprises a sequence of marine platform carbonate dominated rocks and interbedded subordinate clastic units.

Non-sulphide  zinc-lead  mineralization  appears  to  be  restricted  to  a  sequence  of Triassic to Cretaceous  shallow water 'reef-type' limestones, with subordinate interbedded fine-grained rocks which have a variable clastic component. Mineralization outcrops within a series of thrust packages that have a general eastwest  trend  and  lie  within  a  district  of  at  least  60 km  strike  length.  Mineralization  is dominated by smithsonite and hemimorphite with variable amounts of iron oxide and subordinate  hydrozincite  and  cerrusite  in  a  matrix  of  calcite,  barite  and  quartz. Mineralization  varies  in  style  from  tabular  zones  of  variable  thickness  (&lt;0.5 m  to 13 m) to cross cutting breccia zones to disseminated mineralization occupying pore spaces and fracture planes.

The presence of multiple mineralized zones, separated by metres to tens of metres, was confirmed during the 2010 exploration program and correlates with observations on  adjacent  licenses.    The  non-sulphide  zinc-lead  deposits  and  occurrences  within the Hakkari project area are considered to represent supergene weathered derivatives of primary Mississippi Valley Type (MVT) zinc-lead sulphide deposits. Up to 6% sphalerite has been observed in samples from various stockpiles, while lead occurs as both cerrusite and galena. Sulphide-dominant mineralization has also been reported by small-scale mining operators in the district.

Although no modern systematic exploration has been historically carried out in this district prior to 2009, small-scale informal mining of high grade non-sulphide zinc-lead mineralized zones has been ongoing for a long time. Old Roman workings testify to the  exploitation  of  lead  in  the  upper  parts  of  these  zones.  Small-scale  mechanized

mining (hydraulic excavators and dump trucks) has seen increased activity over the last five years in line with increased zinc demand from China. In excess of 600 000 tonnes  of  zinc-lead  material  have  been  officially  recorded  as  sold  under  contracts through traders with typical grades (certified by SGS and Alfred Knight Laboratories) ranging  from  25%  to  40%  Zn  and  4%  to  8%  Pb.  A  significant  proportion  of  this material has been mined from areas adjacent to and between the RCR licenses.

During  2010,  RCR  executed  a  systematic  exploration  program  geared  at  defining maiden, code-compliant mineral resources on two of its Licenses.  The exploration program comprised mapping, grab and trench (channel sampling) and diamond core drilling and resulted in the issuing of a maiden Inferred Mineral Resource of 2.41 Mt at 1.92% Zn, 0.54% Pb and 1.67 g/t Ag at a cutoff grade of 0.5% for License 5.  A non-compliant estimation for the Pentagon of 198.2 kt at 10.53% Zn, 1.11% Pb and 14.73 g/t Ag (at a cutoff grade of 0.5% Zn) was also stated.

Preliminary metallurgical test work conducted on samples from stockpiles associated with  adjacent  small-scale  mining  operations  has  indicated  that  this  material  is amenable to direct acid leaching and RCR have demonstrated through gravitational concentrator  testwork that concentration  of ores  by  gravitational upgrading  is feasible, with a 7.5% Zn feed being upgradeable to 22.5% Zn.

The potential for defining additional new resources and upgrading currently-defined resources is regarded as significant, particularly given that significantly less than 1% of RCR's mineral tenure holdings have been tested through systematic exploration. Higher grade zones have been identified on both The Pentagon and in other areas on License 5. The latter are however subject to systematic sampling to establish bulk grades and will  be  tested  systematically  during  the  forthcoming  year.    Additionally, License 26 has been historically mined and a fast-tracked exploration program will be implemented in order to define a maiden mineral resource on License 26.

RCR intend to establish a mobile gravitational concentration plant on site in the third quarter of 2011.

## 2 INTRODUCTION

## 2.1 Scope of Work

The  MSA  Group  (MSA)  was  commissioned  by  Red  Crescent  Resources  Limited (RCR)  to  provide  a  Technical  Report  on  RCR's  13  Exploration  Licenses  and  4 Operation Licenses located in south-eastern Turkey in which RCR holds, or has the right  to  acquire,  a  majority  interest  through  its  Joint  Venture  agreement  with  the Seyitoğlu family vested in an RCR subsidiary company called RCR Seyitoğlu Cinko Madencilik  A.Ş.  (RCR  Zinc  or  RCRZ).  These  17  Licenses  together  comprise  the Hakkari Zinc Project (HZP).

This Technical Report has been prepared to comply with disclosure and reporting requirements  set  forth  in  National  Instrument  43-101  Standards  of  Disclosure  for Mineral Projects (NI 43-101), Companion Policy 43-101CP, and Form 43-101F1 of December 2005 and the Mineral Resource and Reserve classifications adopted by CIM Council in August 2000.

All monetary figures expressed in this report are in United States of America dollars (US$) unless otherwise stated. A glossary of all technical terms and abbreviations is attached as Appendix 1 .

## 2.2 Principal Sources of Information

MSA  has  based  its  review  of  RCR's  HZP  on  information  provided  by  other independent parties from work commissioned by RCR, from RCR itself based upon actual relevant works completed, the 2010 MSA-managed exploration program as well  as  other  relevant  published  and  unpublished  data.    A  listing  of  the  principal sources of information is included at the end of this  Technical Report.  Site visits were made by the Qualified Person (QP) Mike Robertson during the period 26 July to  7  August  2009,  20  to  27  June  2010  and  13  to  18  August  2010,  by  Brendan Clarke  and  Mike  Robertson  from  16  to  30  March  2010,  and  by  Mike  Robertson, Brendan Clarke and Mike Hall (Qualified Person) from 4 to 8 December 2010 to the 17  licences  comprising  the  HZP  and  forming  the  subject  of  this  report.  QP Certificates  are  included  in Appendix  2 .  We  have  endeavoured,  by  making  all reasonable enquiries, to confirm the authenticity and completeness of the technical data upon which the Technical Report is based.  A final draft of the report was also provided  to  RCR,  along  with  a  written  request  to  identify  any  material  errors  or omissions prior to lodgement.

The  mineral  properties  that  form  the  HZP  are  exploration  projects,  which  have associated attached risks; however MSA considers, nonetheless, that the projects have been acquired on the basis of sound technical merit.  The properties are also considered to be sufficiently  prospective on the basis that significant quantities of non-sulphide  zinc-lead  mineralization  have  been  mined  from  informal  small-scale workings exploited on related mineralized units on adjacent properties.  Therefore,

subject to varying degrees of exploration risk, the HZP warrants further exploration and assessment of its potential, consistent with the proposed programs by RCR.

Exploration  and  evaluation  work  program  costs  are  summarised  in  Table  20-1. RCR has prepared phased exploration and evaluation work programs, specific to the potential of the license areas, which are consistent with the budget allocations. The projects have evolved on the basis of ongoing exploration since October 2008 and MSA considers that the relevant areas have sufficient technical merit to justify the proposed programs and associated expenditure.

This  Technical  Report  has  been  prepared  on  information  available  up  to  and including 31 March 2011.

RCR's projects are understood to consist of a total of 28 granted Exploration and Operation  Licenses,  in  which  RCR  holds  a  controlling  right  in  terms  of  a  Joint Venture  (JV)  agreement  signed  with  the  Seyitoğlu  family.    This  report  deals exclusively  with  17  of  these  licenses  that  collectively  form  the  HZP  and  cover  an aggregate  but  non-contiguous  area  of  264.63  km   issued  in  terms  of  the  Turkish 2 Mining Law, 2005.

The  legal  status  and  rights  of  RCR  to  15  of  these  Exploration  and  Operation Licenses has been independently verified by attorneys Cakmak Avukatlik ('Cakmak')  and  the  relevant  report,  dated  22  December  2010,  is  attached  as Appendix  3 .  The  present  status  of  tenements  listed  in  this  report  is  accordingly based  on  information  provided  by  Cakmak.  This  report  as  well  as  copies  of  the Exploration  and  Operation  Licenses  have  been  viewed  by  the  primary  author. Additionally,  RCR  has  operational  and  exploration  agreements  on  two  of  the licences  (The  Pentagon  and  Licence  26),  with  transfer  of  these  licences  to  RCR expected to occur in late April 2011.  Copies of these agreements are provided in Appendix 4 .

The authors of this report are not qualified to provide extensive comment on legal and  environmental  issues  associated  with  the  HZP.  Comment  on  legal  and environmental  issues  is  for  introduction  only,  and  should  not  be  relied  on  by  the reader.

The  metallurgical  test  work  documented  in  this  report  was  undertaken  under  the direction of Mike Plaskitt, a professional metallurgist. An independent review of this work was conducted by Ewald H. O. Meyer, a Professional Engineer registered with the Engineering Council of South Africa and a Member of the South African Institute of Mining and Metallurgy.

## 4 PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION

## 4.1 RCR Exploration Licenses

The HZP is located in the Hakkari and Sirnak Provinces of south-eastern Turkey, close  to  the  border  with  Iraq.  The  13  RCR  Exploration  Licenses  (ELs)  and  4 Operation  Licenses  (OL's)  are  located  in  a  broad  60 km  long  east-west  belt extending from approximately 10 km west of Hakkari (Figure 4-1). The 17 license areas cover a total area  of  264.63  km .  These  licences  are summarised in Table 2 4-1.

## 4.2 Mineral Tenure

A legally binding Framework Agreement (FA) was concluded and signed between the original licence holders, the Seyitoğlu family company Seyitoğlu Madencilik, and RCR  in  2009.  A  subsequent  Definitive  Agreement  (DA)  between  RCR  and Abdülkadir Seyitoğlu, Kadri Seyitoğlu, Melal Kazar (Seyitoğlu Madencilik or SM) was entered  into  to  create  a  Joint  Venture  Company  RCR  Seyitoğlu  Cinko  Madencilik A.Ş.  (RCR  Zinc  or  RCRZ).  The  principal  activity  of  this  company  will  be  the exploration  and  exploitation  of  zinc  and  associated  lead  resources  to  be  defined within  the  strategy  defined  below.    This  agreement  covers  all  but  two  of  the  HZP

<!-- image -->

Licences (Licence 26 and The Pentagon), for which RCR currently has operational and  exploration  agreements  in  place,  with  transfer  to  RCR  expected  in  late  April 2011.  The transfer of The Pentagon Licence has been executed through a transfer of the Licence from Merzigo to Ber Mining.  Ber Mining have subsequently signed a transfer  agreement  of  the  Licence  to  Cifci,  which  will  be  transferred  to  RCR. Licence 26 will be transferred to RCR through an agreement with a group of local licence  holders  (collectively  referred  to  as  KC).    Copies  of  these  agreements  are provided in Appendix 4 .

The  agreement  with  the  Seyitoğlu  family  comprises  a  number  of  key  provisions. RCR has an immediate vested 50% interest in the HZP and has agreed to match the  stated,  but  as  yet  un-audited  historical  costs  of  Seyitoğlu  Madencilik  by expending US$4.5 million over two years. RCR has already expended in excess of US$3.5m  from  funds  raised  in  the  private  equity  market  in  November  2009  and February  2010  and  latterly  during  the  pre-listing  fund  raising  of  September  2010. The two year period is defined as starting once the licenses have been transferred to  the  jointly  owned  company  RCRZ.  RCRZ  commenced  in  Feb  2010,  placing RCR's expenditure program on schedule.

The  agreement  sets out other milestones, including the expectation of the completion of a first Bankable Feasibility Study (BFS) within the two year period and this  has  been  planned  and  budgeted  for  accordingly  within  the  required  capital raising undertaken to date. The minimum production set for a joint operation within the  DA  signed  is  25 000  tonnes  per  annum,  with  a  50:50  profit  share  envisaged. The DA has no formal clauses governing the specifics of RCR's right to increase its ownership beyond 50%, although it is an accepted principle within the DA that post the matching of historical costs, capital requirements will be covered on the basis of 'contribute or dilute' by shareholders. The process plant required in terms of the DA with the Seyitoğlu family as a condition precedent to the initiation of the contribute or dilute principal being applied to the funding for the HZP is being met and exceeded with the mobilisation of a 90 000 tpa capacity Gravity concentrator plant in the 3rd Quarter of 2011, which will increase early cash flow.

## 4.3 Turkish Minerals Legislation

Minerals legislation in Turkey is governed by the Mining Law No. 3213 published in the  Official  Gazette  No.  18785  dated  15  June  1985,  amended  by Law No. 5177 of June  2004.  An  further  Amendment  to  the  Mining  Law  was  published  in  the  Official Gazette on 24 June 2010 to regulate the details of the permitting process in the law and to amend other provisions of the Mining Law. The Mining Law Implementation Regulation was published in the Official Gazette No. 27751 dated 6 November 2010.

Under current  Turkish  mining  legislation,  'underground  resources'  are  subject  to  the exclusive ownership and disposition of the State and are not considered a part of the land where they are located. The State delegates its right for exploration and operation to individuals or companies for specific periods by issuing licenses subject to royalty payments to the State.

Only Turkish citizens and the companies established under Turkish laws specifically for  mining  purposes  are  entitled  to  hold  mining  rights.  Foreign  capital  companies established in Turkey for mining purposes, like RCR, are entitled to hold mining rights as they are deemed Turkish Companies.

The Mining Law categorizes minerals in six groups:

-  Sand and gravel [Group I(a)] and clay tile, cement tile or marl [Group I(b)];
-  Grounded forms of stones such as calcite, limestone, granite [Group II (a)] and block stones or decorative stones such as marble, granite, travertine [Group II (b)];
-  Salts  in  solution  form  that  can  be  obtained  from  sea,  lake  and  spring  waters [Group III];
-  Energy,  metal  and  industrial  minerals  (including  metals  such  as  gold,  silver, copper, brass…etc.) [Group IV];
-  Precious metals and gem stones [Group V]; and
-  Radioactive minerals and other radioactive substances [Group VI].

The Mining Law allows for overlapping licenses for different category minerals in the same area.

The General Directorate of Mining Affairs (GDMA), a unit of the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources (MENR), is the authorized body to regulate the mining activities and issue mining licenses.

<!-- image -->

An Exploration License or Certificate (the license issued for the fifth group is named 'certificate' in the legislation) is granted by the Mining Department in accordance with the area limitations stated in the Mining Legislation.

The exploration license has three-stages, as follows:

-  ' Pre-exploration period '  is  the  first  year  after  the  issuance  of  the  exploration license.
-  ' General exploration period ' is the period of two years for Group IV mines and one  year  for  other  groups  starting  from  the  expiration  of  the  pre-exploration period.
-  ' Detailed Exploration Period ' (for Group IV and VI mines only) is the period of four years starting from the expiration of the general exploration period.

Obligations of an Exploration License holder are summarized as follows:

-  Duties and Security Deposit: Payment of an annual duty as well as 1% of the annual duty times the hectares to be deposited as a security for each license, on an annual basis
-  Submission  of  Documents:  An  annual  report,  including  information  regarding work done, the results thereof, and associated expenditures, must be submitted to the Mining Department.

The  exploration  licenses  obtained  prior  to  the  Amendment  shall  be  subject  to  the previous regime, where an exploration license is granted for three-year term and the term of the exploration license may be extended for certain mines (i.e. Group IV) for another two years. If the license holder fails to conduct sufficient exploration activities within the three-year period, the license will be terminated.

Before the end of the exploration license period, the license holder must apply for an Operation License or Certificate . If the exploration license holder fails to apply for an Operation  License  at  the  end  of  the  license  term,  the  exploration  license  shall  be terminated  and  the  security  deposit  shall  be  forfeited.  An  Operation  License  is  an instrument  granting  the  license  holder  the  right  to  operate  a  mine  under  the  Mining Legislation.

The term of an Operation License/Certificate for the first group of minerals may not be less than five years and for the other groups may not be less than ten years. The term of an operation license/certificate may be extended, but may not exceed 60 years.

The license holder may continue exploration activities during the operation period. If the  license  holder  fails  to  identify  the  mine  reserves  within  five  years  (for  Group  IV mines)  and  three  years  (for  other  groups)  upon  issuance  of  the  license,  the  license area shall be divided.

<!-- image -->

Obligations of an Operation License holder are summarized as follows:

-  Duties and Security Deposit: Payment of an annual duty as well as 1% of the annual duty times the hectares to be deposited as a security for each license, on an annual basis, and based on the longevity of the license.
-  Submission of Documents: All technical documents, sales information form, and activity  information  form  relating  to  operational  activities  for  the  year  must  be submitted to the Mining Department by the end of April each year.
-  Royalty: Royalties to be paid by the license holder are for Group IV  minerals are as follows:

 Group IV (excluding gold, silver and platinum)

2%



Group IV (gold, silver and platinum) 4%

The royalty will be levied by an addition of 30% for mining activities conducted on State owned lands. Additionally, license holders obtain a 50% relief on royalties in the event that the extracted ores are processed in Turkey.

In addition  to  an  Operation  License,  an Operation  Permit is required  to  start production  activities.  An  Operation  License  covers  the  area  in  which  the  mining activities  will  be  conducted  and  provides  the  legal  right  to  use  the  licensed  area whereas the Operation Permit gives the license-holder the right to operate the mine. Operating  activities  are  required  to  commence  within  1  year  upon  receiving  the Operation  permit.  Failure  to  commence  operations  is  subject  to  a  penalty  of  10% royalty on annual production.

In essence for RCR this means normally its liability would be a 1% royalty on any zinc, lead  or  other  by-product  metal  or  industrial  mineral  which,  in  the  case  of  RCRZ  is barium sulphate. However as a result of government's commitment to socio-economic development in south-eastern Turkey a special dispensation is given to investors and RCR will enjoy an initial royalty free period of up to 10 years.

The ownership of mineral rights does not cover the ownership of surface rights where the mineral resources are located.   It is necessary to create a usufruct or easement right over the mineral exploration area in order to carry out any mining activities.  Other legal options to utilise privately-owned lands are purchasing or leasing.

In  terms  of  the  2010  Amendment  to  the  Mining  Law,  extensions  to  Exploration Licenses can only be granted upon the supply, from the company, of an exploration report documenting mapping and sampling results and an inferred mineral resource. For  the  conversion  of  Exploration  Licenses  to  Operation  Licenses,  the  requirements are:

-  Preparation  of  detailed  topographical  map  of  the  study  area  which  shows  drill holes, sampling points and trenches

<!-- image -->

-  Exploratory  activities  i.e.  mapping,  sampling,  trenching  and  drilling  must  have been conducted on the License
-  Samples  must  be  sufficient  in  number  and  naturespread  to  be  considered representative
-  Detailed geological, geochemical and geophysical maps must be provided, along with geological cross sections
-  Three dimensional resource modelling must be carried out
-  An indicated/measured resource statement must be prepared

Turkey's  policies  regarding  environmental  protection  and  development  are  based  on the harmonisation of policies and solutions with both European Union and international standards, reinforcement of existing legislation, improvement of environmental management,  prevention  of  pollution  and  increasing  awareness  of  environmental issues. However, mineral exploration activities are no longer subject to an environmental impact assessment report but must lodge an environmental compliance plan (ECP). The New Law also provides that the Ministry of Environment and Forestry shall  finalise  the  environmental  impact  assessment  transactions  for  other  mining activities within three months following the application. Although this amendment aims to shorten the time spent on bureaucratic transactions, the New Law does not provide any remedy for failure to finalise applications within the required time.

SRK  Danişmanlik  ve  Mühendislik  A.Ş.  (SRK)  have  conducted  an  environmental assessment of RCR's licenses and have concluded that no environmental fatal flaws exist (SRK, 2010).  They do, however, highlight the development of hydropower dams downstream in the Zap river valleys as a point that requires consideration, and they additionally  note  the  presence  of  some  ecologically  sensitive  habitats  along  the  Zap valley.  Neither the authors, nor MSA are qualified to provide an opinion regarding the environmental status of the licenses.

## 5 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE AND PHYSIOGRAPHY

## 5.1 Access

The nearest airport to the license areas is located in Van, approximately 200 km northnorthwest of Hakkari (Figure 4-1).  Major road-works are currently in progress, causing some delay, but it is anticipated that these will be completed within the next few years, providing double-lane  freeway  access  from  Van  to  Hakkari.  There  are  regular scheduled  commercial  flights  between  Van  and  other  major  Turkish  cities.  A  new airport  is  also  being  constructed  at  Yüksekova,  approximately  50  km  to  the  east  of Hakkari, which will provide quicker access to the HZP (Figure 4-1).

Access to the  majority  of  the  license  areas  is  good,  with  a  double-lane  sealed  road from  Hakkari  following  the  course  of  the  Zap  River  through  the  license  areas.  The western licenses are accessed via the sealed road from Çukurca to Şirnak   Sealed roads  extend  to  within  5  km  of  each  of  the  license  areas,  and  all  licenses  are accessible by maintained gravel roads.

## 5.2 Climate

The  climate  in  the  Hakkari  area  varies  significantly  between  summer  and  winter (Figure  5-1).    During  the  summer  months  (May  to  August),  maximum  temperatures readily  exceed  40°C.    Winter,  with  associated  snowfalls,  extends  from  November  to early March and mean temperatures are generally below freezing. During this period, surface exploration is hampered due to access problems associated with snow cover. The summer months are also the driest, with the bulk of precipitation occurring from October to April (autumn, winter and spring months).  During the winter months, the bulk of the precipitation occurs as snow.

## 5.3 Local Resources and Infrastructure

Electricity generation  and  reticulation  is  handled  by  Vangolu  Elektrik  Dagtim  (a subsidiary of the TEDAS, the Turkish electricity company).  Power lines extend along all  of  the  main  roads  and  since  all  license  areas are within 5 km of the main roads, there is power available within 5 km of the license areas.  Several villages are present within the license areas and all have access to electricity.  Water is abundant and is supplied by the Hakkari Municipality (Turkish - Hakkari Belediyesi), who draw from the numerous rivers in the area.  Several rivers are present within the licenses, including the  Zap  River  that  flows  parallel  to  the  main  road  leading  southwards  from  Hakkari (Figure 4-1). Telecommunication  infrastructure is good, with cellular telephone coverage  throughout  the  license  areas.    Several  dams  are  being  constructed  in  the lower  reaches  of  the  Zap  River  valley,  close  to  the  Iraqi  border,  with  the  aim  of providing hydro-electric energy to the region.

<!-- image -->

## 5.4 Physiography

As  Figure  5-2  and  Figure  5-3  illustrate,  the  licenses  are  located  within  rugged mountainous  terrain,  with  elevation  differences  between  the  river  valley  floors  and mountain tops in excess of 400 m. Outcrop is generally excellent allowing for ease of geological  and  structural  mapping.  The  steep  topography  does  not  present  a  major problem  to  the  companies  currently  undertaking  small-scale  mining  in  these  areas. Well-constructed  road  systems  allow  access  to  these  informal  mining  sites.    Other exploration methods, such as drilling from underground drives would not be impacted by the topography.

## 6 HISTORY

During  Roman  and  medieval  times,  the  non-sulphide  zinc  ores  known  as  ' lapis calaminarius ',  ' calamine ',  ' galmei '  or  ' galman '  in  the  Latin-,  French-,  German-,  and Polish-speaking worlds, respectively, were used as source materials for the production of brass (a zinc-copper ± tin alloy) throughout Europe and the Mediterranean regions.

There  are  many  examples  of  Roman  underground  mining  galleries  in  the  area  of interest on the HZP, as for example shown in Figure 6-1.  Although these excavations appear to have been focussed more on the upper lead-rich portion of the mineralized zone, it is quite likely that zinc has been sporadically mined around Hakkari for at least 2 000 years.  However, the difficulties in beneficiation of smithsonite ores containing 10% to 20% Zn and complex ores containing zinc oxide, silicate, and clays from lack of available  extraction  technologies,  led  to  large  bodies  of  non-sulphide  zinc  material being ignored until very recently (Hitzman et al , 2003).

Current  informal  small-scale  mining  activities  are  underway  on  mineralized  zones located between licenses 8 and 10 and licenses 5 and 8. Apart from this and similar small-scale  mining  excavations  within  the  Hakkari  area,  no  records  of  any  previous systematic mineral exploration activities exist.

On  licenses  currently  held  by  RCR  and  others,  some  of  which  are  contiguous  and adjacent  to  RCR  licenses,  significant  mining  activities  have  been  ongoing  for  many years.  These have seen increased activity over the last 5 years in line with increased commodities demand from China.  In excess of 600 000 tonnes of zinc-lead ores have been  officially  recorded  as  sold  under  contracts  through  traders  with  typical  grades (certified by SGS and Alfred Knight laboratories) ranging from 25% to 40% Zn and 4% to 8% Pb. A significant proportion of this material has been mined from areas adjacent to and  between  the  RCR  licenses.  Mining  activities  on  adjacent  properties  are discussed more fully in Section 15 Adjacent Properties.

This  is  significant  as  it  points  to  the  potential  of  the  areas  of  the  HZP  under investigation, especially in the light of the unusually  high  grades  encountered. Relatively  small  tonnages  are  required  to  be  mined,  beneficiated  and  refined  to produce significantly economic volumes of base metal products.

## 7 GEOLOGICAL SETTING

## 7.1 Regional Geology

The project area is situated within the northern margins of the Arabian Platform (Figure 7-1) that forms  part  of  the  Alpine-Himalayan  Orogenic  Belt  (AHOB).  This  first developed  in  the  Jurassic  and  continues  to  evolve  to  the  Present.  The  AHOB  is traditionally  subdivided  into  four  tectonostratigraphic  domains:  from  north  to  south these  are  the  Pontides,  Anatolides,  Taurides  and  Border  Fold  or  Arabian  Platform regions (Figure 7-1).

The  south-eastern  AHOB  in  the  project  area  is  characterised  by  north-vergent  foldand-thrust tectonics with the overriding Taurides separated from the weakly deformed Arabian Platform by the Bitlis suture/thrust (Yigit, 2009).

The  rocks  of  the  south-eastern  Arabian  Platform  beneath  the  Bitlis  Thrust  can  be generally described as a package of autochthonous north-facing folded and thrusted marine platform carbonate-dominated rocks and interbedded subordinate clastic units (Figure 7-2). The northward younging sedimentary succession has been duplicated by a  major  east-west  striking,  south  directed  thrust  structure,  with  licenses  1  to  11a situated in the upper thrust package and license 12 in the lower thrust package (Figure 7-2).

## 7.2 Property Geology

According  to  the  1:500 000  scale  geological  map  (Günay  and  Şenel,  2002),  the geology underlying the current study areas consists of 15 sedimentary units ranging in age  from  the Precambrian-Cambrian  boundary  to  the  Paleogene  (Figure  7-3). Inspection of the 1:500 000 scale map  legend points to several units being diachronous whilst others are separated by major hiatuses.  The mapping also shows some lateral discontinuity of sedimentary units, apparently the result of primary facies variations and/or paleotopography rather than tectonic movements.

The target zinc-lead mineralized bodies of the Hakkari region are restricted to the t2k1 neritic  limestones  (ranging  from  mid-Triassic  to  early  Cretaceous  in  age)  and  are interpreted to have been effective fluid conduits.  The t2k1 limestone consists not only of  shallower  water 'reef' type limestones, but also fine grained rocks with a variable clastic  component.    These  dolomitic  to  cherty  rocks  have  varying  bedding  thickness from approximately 1 cm to over 1 m and are often stacked as interlayed units of more massive layers alternating with more fissile layers.

The  zinc-lead  mineralized  zones  are  present  as  multiple  layers  ranging  in  thickness from a few centimetres to a few metres that display visible iron-oxide enrichment and generally weather negatively in relation to the indurated dolomites that are present in the hanginwall and footwall and as interlayered units.

Zinc  mineralization  is  generally  hosted  in  a  more  porous  'reef  limestone'  or  breccia unit flanked by indurated to cryptocrystalline dolomite or cherty dolomite (Figure 7-4). Both  the  host  limestone  and  cryptocrystalline  hanging-  and  footwalls  are  usually structurally deformed, with the more competent dolomitic wall rocks typically exhibiting brittle deformation  and  the  mineralized  horizon  exhibiting  ductile  to  brittle-ductile behaviour (Figure 7-4).  Partial dissolution of the mineralized horizon, presumably by the mineralising fluids, is also commonly observed.

## 8 DEPOSIT TYPES

The  age,  structural  and  shallow  marine/platform  carbonate  dominated  setting  of  the project  area makes the region an attractive target for Mississippi Valley Type (MVT) zinc-lead sulphide mineralization.

Some  zinc-lead  sulphide  mineralization  has  recently  been  identified  in  the  licenses adjacent  to  the  HZP  area.  The  ongoing  exploitation  and  mining  (albeit  on  a  small scale)  of  high  grade  zinc  (as  high  as  40%)  and  lead  (as  high  as  8%)  non-sulphide material  is  already  suggestive  of  the  development  of  either  supergene  or  hypogene zinc oxide mineralization, the former related to a buried sulphide parent.

-  Supergene  deposits  form  primarily from the oxidation of sulphide-bearing deposits  (often  MVT)  and  are  typically  dominated  by  smithsonite  (ZnCO3), hydrozincite (Zn5(CO3)2(OH)6) and/or hemimorphite (Zn4Si2O7(OH)2.H2O)) (Hitzman et al , 2003). Three subtypes have been recognized: direct replacement deposits, wall rock replacement deposits and karst fill deposits, of which several combinations have been identified (Hitzman et al 2003) (Figure 8-4).
-  Hypogene deposits are dominated by zinc silicates and oxides and are divided into two types: structurally controlled deposits comprising of irregular pipes and veins  dominated  by  willemite  (Zn2SiO4)  and  stratiform  deposits  comprising  Mn rich lenses of franklinite ((Zn, Fe, Mn)(Fe, Mn)2O4) and willemite (Hitzman et al 2003).

An MSc dissertation describing the lead isotope geochemistry of zinc-lead deposits in Turkey was completed by Ceyhan in 2003. Results from this study suggest that the zinc occurrences in the Hakkari area are stratiform and Mesozoic in age, suggesting a syngenetic type of mineralization.

Following field examination of numerous mineralized exposures within the project area (during  the  Phase  2  site  visit),  it  is  concluded  that  the  major  style  of  zinc-lead mineralization comprises supergene alteration of primary MVT-type zinc-lead deposits. An  understanding  of  the  characteristics  and  geological  setting  of  MVT  deposits  will therefore  assist  in  understanding  the  distribution  of,  and  extensions  to,  known  nonsulphide zinc-lead deposits and in further exploration targeting within the project area.

The typical characteristics of MVT deposits are described in Paradis et al (2007) and are summarised as follows:

-  Primary  MVT  deposits  are  stratabound,  carbonate-hosted  sulphide  bodies, composed predominantly  of  zinc  and  lead,  occurring  as  sphalerite  and  galena respectively. The deposits occur mainly in dolomite (less frequently limestone) as open-space fillings, breccias (crackle, mosaic, rubble, solution collapse), structures within interconnected paleokarst networks, replacement of the carbonate host  rock,  and  as  sulphide  and  gangue  minerals  occupying  primary

carbonate porosity. At the deposit scale,  mineralization-controlling  features  are commonly zones of solution collapse breccias.

-  They are located in platform carbonate settings, typically in relatively undeformed orogenic  foreland  rocks,  commonly  in  foreland  thrust  belts,  and  rarely  in  rift zones. Deposits are commonly located close to a carbonate shelf margin, at the transition into slope and  basinal shale facies. MVT  deposits  account  for approximately 25% of the world's known zinc and lead resources.
-  Major basement faults influence the alignment of deposits within districts, while subsidiary faults tend to create zones of weakness with subsequent dissolution and karsting.
-  Orebodies typically occur in clusters within mineralized districts which can extend to  hundreds  or  thousands  of  square  kilometres.  An  example  is  the  Cornwallis district  in  Canada  which  hosts  at  least  25  deposits  containing  75  orebodies. Individual orebodies are generally &lt;2 Mt, are zinc dominant, with grades seldom exceeding 10% zinc + lead combined (Figure 8-1 and Figure 8-2).
-  Individual orebodies  vary  in  geometry  and  are  often  interconnected.  Host structures are commonly zones of highly brecciated dolomite which range from concordant  features controlled by individual strata, to discordant features developed  over  tens  of  metres  across  sedimentary  strata  (Figure  8-3).  MVT orebodies are therefore stratabound on a district scale, but typically discordant on a deposit scale.
-  Style  of  mineralization  ranges  from  zones  of  massive  replacement,  to  open space filling  of  breccias and fractures, to disseminated clusters of crystals that occupy pore spaces.

Supergene non-sulphide zinc-lead deposits are formed through the reactivity of acidic, oxidised  zinc-lead  rich  fluids  derived  from  oxidative  destruction  of  zinc-lead  bearing sulphide  bodies  with  high  reactive  carbonate  wall  rocks  (Hitzman et  al 2003).  The formation of these deposits depends on:

-  The size and mineralogy of the pre-existing zinc-lead sulphide deposit,
-  Exposure of the sulphide deposit to a seasonal fluctuating water table,
-  Degree of primary porosity and secondary fault and fracture density, to permit movement of migrating oxidised ground waters,
-  A  suitable  neutralising  trap  site  for  deposition  of  secondary  zinc  and  lead minerals.

Three subtypes of supergene non-sulphide zinc-lead deposits are recognized, namely direct replacement, wall-rock replacement, and residual and karst-fill deposits (Figure 8-4). All three types may be present within a single deposit.

<!-- image -->

According to Boni and Large (2003) the critical geological features for the oxidation of primary (MVT) sulphides and preservation of the secondary zinc minerals include:

-  Tectonic  uplift  subsequent  to  primary  sulphide  mineralization,  promoting  the oxidation and the development of karst systems.
-  Brittle  fracture  of  the  host  rocks  promoting  the  flux  of  oxidising  fluids  and mobilisation to favourable depositories
-  The  presence  of  sufficient  iron  sulphide  in  the  primary  mineralization  as  an important  control  during  oxidation,  for  the  generation  of  acid  required  for  the leaching and transport of zinc.

<!-- image -->

Characteristic features of non-sulphide supergene zinc-lead deposits include:

-  Features  of  MVT  deposits,  as  described  above,  are  inherited  by  supergene deposits.
-  Supergene formation through oxidative alteration of a zinc-lead sulphide bearing precursor deposit, typically a MVT deposit.
-  The major secondary zinc minerals are smithsonite, hydrozincite, hemimorphite and sauconite, with smithsonite the most stable under atmospheric weathering conditions. Deposits may be mineralogically and metallurgically complex.
-  Deposits  are  preserved  in  various  states.  Direct  replacement  deposits  are essentially  zinc-lead  rich  gossans.  Original  iron  sulphide  rich  deposits  may produce enough acid to extensively leach secondary zinc minerals in the nearsurface environment.
-  Ore textures are varied and often complex and range from massive to brecciated to  disseminated,  with  vuggy  to  dense  mineralization.  The  most  common  ore texture is breccia, Several stages of secondary zinc mineralization are normally present, reflecting multi-cyclic oxidation and leaching.
-  The  grade  and  tonnage  of  deposits  is  a  reflection  of  the  primary  zinc-lead content; however significant upgrading of parts of these systems is common. A tabular summary of known supergene zinc-lead deposits is contained in Hitzman (2003). Significant deposits in Turkey and the surrounding region are summarized  in  Table  8-1.  The  largest  known  oxide  deposit  of  similar  grade characteristics is Angouran in Iran which is hosted in the Zagros fold and thrust belt, an extension of the 'Border Folds' belt in south-eastern Turkey in which the HZP  area lies.

As little is known about the mineralogy, structural setting and style of emplacement of the zinc-lead oxide mineralization in the HZP area, it is difficult (at this stage) to define exactly the appropriate mineralization style. However  the  direct association of significant  iron  grades  (due  to  the  presence  of  goethite  and  hematite  after  iron  rich sulphides) with that of zinc and lead (determined from assays carried out on ROM ore produced as well as visually, from photographs), suggest either wall rock replacement or direct replacement of a precursor MVT type sulphide orebody (Figure 8-5).

## 9 MINERALIZATION

## 9.1 History of Zinc mining in the Hakkari area

As discussed in Section 6, small-scale near-surface exploitation of the zinc ores has been  occurring  for  an  estimated  2 000  years  in  the  area.    No  official  estimates  of historical zinc production from the area exist, although information from local operators suggest  hundreds of thousands of tonnes have been extracted at an average grade typically in the region of 25% Zn.  This has been officially recorded in recent times, and more  specifically  in  the  last  four  to  five  years.  Within  the  latter  period  more  than 600 000 tonnes  of  zinc-lead  ores  have  been  mined  and  sold  to  traders  with  SGS certification.

## 9.2 Style of mineralization

The  mineralization  at  HZP  best  conforms  to  Hitzman's  (2003)  direct-replacement deposit type derived from the oxidation of a MVT deposit. These deposits tend to be mineralogically  simple  and  are  dominated  by  the  zinc  hydroxides  of  smithsonite, hemimorphite and hydrozincite.

Many of the attributes and textural features of MVT and non-sulphide zinc-lead deposit models are observed in the sites visited. These observations confirm that the dominant mineralization style is that of large-scale and pervasive supergene alteration of primary MVT style sulphide mineralization on a regional scale, with the formation of supergene non-sulphide zinc-lead deposits.

Zinc-lead mineralized horizons are reportedly traceable for several kilometres within a district  of  at  least  60 km  strike  length;  however individual occurrences display varied geometries  as  indicated  below.    Examples  of  the  various  mineralization  styles observed are indicated below and in Figure 9-1.

-  Tabular  replacement  zones  of  variable  thickness,  width  and  strike  extent, conformable with respect to host strata.
-  Pods parallel to bedding.
-  Crosscutting breccia zones which may be interconnected, with open space filling of mineralization.
-  Solution  collapse  zones  and  breccias,  particularly  areas  of  enhanced  solution activity. These may produce mineralized bodies with irregular geometry.
-  Disseminated  mineralization  occupying  original  pore  spaces,  primarily  within breccias.
-  Remobilized mineralization along fracture and joint planes.

Based on work conducted to date by RCR and on observations from adjacent smallscale mine workings, in general terms a 15 m to 35 m thick zone of multiple oxidized

<!-- image -->

zinc-lead mineralized layers is observed as illustrated in the examples in Figure 9-2. A 2 m to 10 m thick massive mineralized layer is typically present towards the base of this zone, and is overlain by thinner mineralized layers separated by massive to thinly bedded  limestone  and  dolomite,  which  are  in  places  brecciated  and/or  vuggy. Discontinuous  mineralized  stringers  and  pods  as  well  as  remobilized  mineralization along fractures and joint planes, are also observed. Small-scale mining in the district has traditionally focused on thick high grade mineralization; the existence of multiple mineralized  layers  within  a  potentially  bulk  mineable  zone  has  only  recently  been recognized.

Significant  variations  in  iron  content  are  observed  between  the  various  non-sulphide zinc-lead deposits. Primary differences in iron content may reflect different pulses of the  original  mineralizing  fluids.  In  weathered  supergene  deposits,  iron  is  the  most mobile and hence widely distributed element, with zinc intermediate and lead the least mobile. The amount of iron in the system is also a reflection of the original host rock composition,  abundance  of  original  iron  sulphides,  and  amount  of  iron  contained  in sphalerite  (which  can  vary  from  yellow  through  red  to  brown  to  black  [marmatite]  in colour depending on the iron content).

Evidence for several stages of zinc-lead mineralization and leaching are evident, with many sites showing mineralization being more porous and iron-rich in the upper parts (Figure 9-3). For example, the massive smithsonite mineralization is in places partially leached to form porous red-brown smithsonite and hemimorphite. Further leaching in places has resulted in a porous network of hematite-goethite dominated iron oxides.

Although  this  report  is  focussed  on  the  RCR  zinc  portfolio,  copper  mineralization associated with prominent quartz veining is observed immediately north of license 7 (Figure 9-1). This vein system is reported to extend into license 7.

## 10 EXPLORATION

As at  the  date  of  this  report,  RCR's  exploration  activities  on  the  license  areas  have comprised a comprehensive desktop study, reconnaissance mapping and sampling on various licenses,  and  detailed  mapping,  sampling,  trenching  and  diamond drilling on selected licenses. These activities are elaborated on below.

## 10.1 Desktop evaluation and remote sensing exercise

In  May  2009,  RCR  commissioned  MSA  to  undertake  a  desktop  evaluation  of  11  of RCR's zinc-lead licenses (Licenses 1-11).  The objective of the desktop study was to integrate  as  much  available  data  as  possible  in  order  to  prioritise  and  define  target areas for a follow up field validation visit. Geological maps of varying scales, published papers and reports, high resolution satellite imagery (QuickBird), ASTER satellite data, JERS radar data and Google Earth software were used during the study.

The  study  was  effective  in  obtaining  a  high  level  understanding  of  the  geology, structure and potential to host zinc-lead mineralization in the 11 license areas.  Results of this study were reported in Venter and Robertson (2009).

## 10.2 Reconnaissance site visits

All of the RCR  licenses  have  been  visited and  subjected to reconnaissance investigation  in  the  past  2  years,  involving  grab  sample  collection,  inspection  of workings and general geological assessment.

Small-scale  mining  is  being  undertaken  on  License  9,  with  mineralisation  hosted  in steeply  dipping  thrust  planes  that  may  have  developed  along  the  generally  lesscompetent mineralized horizon.  Handheld InnovX XRF results on grab samples from the thrust plane mineralisation range between 0.50 and 6.86% Zn and up to 3.52% Pb. In  the  south  of  License  9,  lead-rich  breccias  are  known  which  have reportedly  been intermittently worked since Roman times.

## 10.3 Mapping

Information available to RCR at the onset of exploration activities, coupled with field observations  and  the  outcome  of  the  aforementioned  remote  sensing  exercise, suggested licenses. 5, 8 (and The Pentagon), 9, 10 and 11 were the most prospective for economic zinc-lead mineralization.

## 10.3.1 Pre-2010 exploration field season mapping

In  2009  and  early  2010,  limited  mapping  of  mineralization  and  country  rock  were undertaken and activities focussed on Licenses 5 and 10.  Interpretation of mapping results  suggest  a  series  of  thrusts  developed  oblique  to  the  main  Bitlis  thrust  and potential transcurrent offsets of the mineralized zones.  In the area of current mining on The Pentagon (between licenses 8-10) a series of mineralized zones, spaced about

<!-- image -->

50 m apart was found.  A mineralized anticlinal structure developed on License 5 was delineated with a width (i.e. half wavelength) of approximately 2 km.  Of significance is the strike extent of the mineralized horizon.  Each mapped portion (either major thrust surface or flanks of a fold structure) can be traced for over 1 km.

Reconnaissance  mapping  by  RCR  on  License  5  revealed  the  presence  of  a  westnorthwest  trending  fold  system,  with  a  wavelength  in  the  order  of  1  km.    The  fold system is bounded to the north by a major apparent dextral shear system that trends northwest and is therefore oblique to the fold axial traces (Figure 10-1).  As in most of the other license areas, the mineralized zones tend to weather negatively in relation to the footwall and hangingwall sequences (Figure 10-2).

A similar  structural  style  was  revealed  on  License  10,  where apparent duplication of the  main  mineralized  zone  is  effected  by  folding  about  a  west-northwest  trending synformal axis that is truncated in the southeast by a northwest-striking fault (Figure 10-3).

## Figure 10-3

Note the interpreted synformal structure that appears to be responsible for duplication of the main mapped mineralized zone.

## 10.3.2 2010 Exploration Season Mapping

Detailed  follow-up  geological  mapping  was  carried  out  on  both  License  5  and  The Pentagon  during  the  2010  exploration  season.    Mapping  methodology  and  data capture  was  governed  by  the  MSA  SOP's  for  the  HZP.    Key  mapping  activities included:

-  Collection of structural measurements throughout the License areas with specific focus on the central portion of License 5 and the immediate surroundings of the active mining area on The Pentagon.
-  Delineation of mineralized horizons throughout the stratigraphy within the areas of interest.

RCR acquired an InnovX handheld XRF analyser during the course of the  program which was used to obtain preliminary grade assessments on grab samples collected in the field.

<!-- image -->

## 10.3.2.1 The Pentagon

Mapping was initially undertaken on the Pentagon area from 10 May 2010 to 15 May 2010 and again on 21 August 2010. A total of 74 outcrop points were mapped and photographed and captured into the MSA database.  Mapping identified several poorly developed mineralized horizons but was unable to extend the known mineralized zone beyond the extents of the current mining area due to extensive scree cover.  Mapping observations strongly suggest that the steeply-southward dipping mineralized zone on the  Pentagon  shallows  in  dip  to  the  south  where  it  has  been  partially  opened  up  in small-scale shallow underground workings (Figure 10-4).

## 10.3.2.2 License 5

Mapping  on  License  5  was  intermittently  carried  out  between  17  May  2010  and  2 October  2010.  A  total  of  172  outcrop  points  were  mapped  and  photographed  and captured into the MSA database.  Mapping on License 5 was successful in delineating and extending the known extents of mineralisation on the License, both in the gently dipping area that was drilled, and further to the west and north where new discoveries of  steeply  dipping  mineralisation  were  made  (Figure  10-5).    Collectively,  mapping delineated  a  strike  extent  of  ~2.5  km  of  mineralisation,  of  which  ~1.2  km  was  drill tested during the 2010 program (Figure 10-6).  Mapping in the gently-dipping central part of License 5 partially delineated the outcrop position of the upper mineralized zone intersected in drillholes and described in Section 11.1.

## 10.4 Grab Sampling

A total of 110 samples have been collected to date, with 51 collected prior to the 2010 exploration season and the balance during the course of the exploration program.  The sampling inventory comprises 3 'historical' stockpile samples, an additional 3 stockpile samples collected during the current phase of exploration, 10 samples collected from The  Pentagon  (between  Licenses  8  and  10)(see  also  Figure  10-4)  and  94  outcrop samples.  None of the samples collected to date are considered representative bulk or channel samples and should be viewed as grab or rock chip samples.  The distribution of these samples across the HZP are shown in Figure 10-6.

## Location and results of 110 rock chip samples collected within the HZP

Sampling is discussed more fully under Section12.

## 10.5 Geophysics

Three  ground  Induced  Polarisation  (IP)  lines  were  run  across  selected  areas  on License 5 and The Pentagon.  On License 5, a 690 m line was run, trending NNW,

<!-- image -->

centred over boreholes 5DD002 and 5DD003.  A second line was run over the steeply dipping zone mapped in the northeast of License 5.  At The Pentagon, a 600 m long NE-striking  line  was  run  over  holes  PENDD001,  PENDD003  and  PENDD004.    An example of one of the processed geophysical IP lines is shown in Figure 10-8.

The  results,  particularly  the  chargeability  sections,  indicate  the  presence  of  deeper anomalies that remain to be tested and could potentially represent suphides at depth. Little  to  no  correlation  is  noted  between  mineralized  oxide  intersections  in  boreholes and  anomalous  IP  responses,  which  is  expected  for  the  oxide  (and  hence  nonconductive)  nature  of  the  mineralisation.    Shallow  responses  may  be  the  result  of conductive groundwater localised along structural features.

## 10.6 Trenching

Trenching was only conducted on License 5 and commenced on 28 October 2010 and was completed on 10 December 2010. A total of 9 trenches and 1 road cut (5RC001) were excavated, mapped, photographed and sampled according to the MSA SOP, for a  total  of  474.90  m  of  trenching  (Table  10-1).  Trenches  were  sited  on  the  basis  of mapping and grab sampling assay results and were used to provide surface control to deeper borehole intersections and were mechanically excavated using an excavator, oriented as close as normal to strike as possible (Figure 10-9).  In many cases, steep topography inhibited optimal siting of the trenches and alternative positions had to be established  on  the  basis  of  actual  field  conditions.    The  road  cut  (5RC001)  was oriented subparallel to strike and although it was sampled, the results of this sampling were not included in the resource estimation due to uncertainties in ascertaining true mineralized widths.  Channel sampling was conducted across the exposed mineralized material  with  the  orientation  of  channel  samples  governed  by  the  disposition  of  the mineralisation  in  relation  to  the  trench  (Figure  10-10).    Trench  start  and  end  points were surveyed using a differential GPS upon completion of the trenching exercise.

Dip-corrected grade calculations are tabulated below (Table 10-2).  It is evident that the trenching program was only partially successful in exposing the entire width of the mineralized zone/s, accounting for the narrow width of most of the trench intersections. In all cases, however, access constraints prevented extension of the trenches to obtain complete  intersections  across  the  mineralized  zones.    The  highest  grades  were obtained  in  5TR008  and  5TR009  and  demonstrate,  together  with  drillholes  5DD002 and  5DD003,  that  high  grade  material  is  present  in  the  fold  hinge  of  the  antiform further described in Sections 11.1 and 17.2.

## 11 DRILLING

Diamond core drilling was carried out on both License 5 and The Pentagon during the 2010 exploration season.  A single rig was contracted from Spektra Jeotek, a Turkish drilling company based in Ankara (Figure 11-1).  Drilling commenced on 19 June 2010 and was halted on 18 December 2010 when heavy snow restricted drill site access. A total of 2118.40 m was drilled, the vast majority (~2000 m) drilled at HQ diameter and using  a  triple  tube  core  barrel.  Core  logging  was  conducted  according  to  the  MSA Project operating procedures and all data was captured into the MSA Microsoft Access Exploration  database.    Wherever  possible,  logging  (including  core  recovery  logs, lithology and geotechnical logs) was done at the rig, with sampling carried out at the coreshed  outside  Hakkari.    All  inclined  boreholes  were  surveyed  with  a  FlexIT ® downhole  survey  tool  operated  by  Spektra  Jeotek.    Hardcopy  survey  data  were supplied to the geologists on site at nominal 50 m intervals.  A summary of the drilling data is supplied in Table 11-1.

Drilling was conducted on a single-shift (12 hours), 7 day a week basis with extended breaks  taken  in  August  and  September  for  the  Ramadan  and  Bayram  holidays. Average drilling advance was 11.34 m/shift.

## 11.1 License 5

Drilling on License 5 commenced on 19 June 2010 and continued until 6 September 2010, whereafter the rig was mobilised to The Pentagon. The rig recommenced drilling on  License  5  on  31  October  and  continued  until  the  close  of  the  program  due  to inclement weather on 18 December 2010. A total of 1693.40 m was drilled on License 5  in  fourteen  boreholes  (Figure  11-2),  which  includes  76.79  m  (uncorrected  for  dip) logged as mineralized zone (MZ). Typical MZ intersections are shown in Figure 11-3. Approximately 800 m of planned drilling was not completed.

Eleven of the fourteen boreholes intersected MZ. Strip logs displaying lithology and Zn, Pb and Ag grades were compiled for all fourteen holes using Geosoft Target software, and  are  included  as  Figures  11-4  to  11-10.  Definition  of  drill  targets  was  achieved through a combination of surface mapping and sampling, structural geological analysis and trenching where appropriate.  Access restrictions imposed by the extremely steep topography  resulted  in  multiple,  variably  oriented  boreholes  being  drilled  from  the same collar position.  Hole 5DD001 did not intersect MZ although this was ascribed to potential coreloss in a particularly friable zone between 20 and 30 m.  The initial 30 m of 5DD001 were not drilled using a triple tube corebarrel and the hole was twinned by 5DD010 from the same collar position (using a triple tube core barrel) and intersected a  narrow  MZ  from  26.20  to  27.40  m.    Borehole  5DD011  failed  to  intersect  any recognisable mineralized zone whereas 5DD014 had to be stopped prior to completion due to adverse weather conditions and associated unsafe access conditions with the onset of heavy winter snowfall.

Drilling  on  License  5  has  revealed  the  presence  of  two  discrete  mineralized  zones (upper  and  main),  each  comprising  a  number  of  mineralized  horizons  interstratified with calcareous host rocks.  Mineralized widths are variable from a few centimetres to a few metres and although the spacing of drill holes in the 2010 field season does not allow for continuity of individual mineralized layers to be established with confidence, both  the  upper  and  main  mineralized  zones  are  continuous  within  the  drilled  area. Grade persistence in the hanging- and footwall is commonly associated with localised structural remobilisation of the mineralisation along fractures, faults and breccia veins.

Dip-corrected significant (&gt;1 m true width, &gt;1% Zn) intersections are provided in Table 11-2.  It is evident that the highest grade intersections are found in the northernmost holes,  which  are  interpreted  to  fall  on  or  near  a  major  antiformal  hinge  that  can  be traced across the river valley to the north (Figure 11-11).  Full details on the sampling methodology and assay technique are provided in Sections 12 and 13.

## 11.2 The Pentagon

Drilling  on  The Pentagon commenced on 1 October 2010 and was completed on 18 October  2010.  A  total  of  425  m  was  drilled  in  10  boreholes,  including  57.10  m (uncorrected  for  dip)  of  MZ.  The  locations  of  the  holes  drilled  in  The  Pentagon  are shown  in  Figure  11-12.    Seven  of  the  ten  boreholes  intersected  MZ.    The  drilling strategy at The Pentagon was heavily constrained by access and the existing mining highwall (Figure 11-13).  As a result, many of the holes were collared in mineralisation. PENDD001 was inadvertently collared in the footwall of the main MZ, whereas several of  the  holes  had  to  be  collared  in  the  footwall  and  drilled  at  a  marginally  shallower

<!-- image -->

angle than the mapped dip of the MZ in order to obtain an inverted intersection.  Holes PENDD007 and PENDD008 did not intersect the MZ and are interpreted to have been collared immediately to the west of a fault zone that has displaced the MZ to the south i.e. upslope. Generally, the mineralized material intersected in the Pentagon boreholes is significantly more competent than the frequently friable material intersected on License 5.  Typical examples of mineralized intersections are shown in Figure  11-14.  Strip  logs  for  holes  PENDD001-PENDD008,  compiled  using  Geosoft Target, are shown in Figure 11-14 to Figure 11-18.

The  2010  drilling  campaign  failed  to  definitively  identify  a  discrete  upper  and  main mineralized  zone,  although  outcomes  of  the  geological  and  resource  modelling (Section 17) suggest potential for an upper mineralized zone on The Pentagon.

Significant  intersections  (&gt;  1  m  width,  &gt;1%  Zn)  are  tabulated  in  Table  11-3.    The anomalously  wide  intersection  in  PENDD003  is  difficult  to  interpret  given  the  limited amount of drilling that was undertaken on The Pentagon.  It is, however, evident that Zn and Ag grades at the Pentagon are significantly higher than on License 5 whereas Pb grades are similar to License 5.

## 12 SAMPLING METHOD AND APPROACH

Five  groups  of  sample  subtypes  have  been  collected  during  exploration  of  the  HZP and are discussed separately below:

-  Grab samples from mining stockpiles and mineralized outcrops for metallurgical testwork.
-  Grab samples collected during the mapping program
-  Channel samples collected during trenching.  These were collected according to the MSA SOP's and are considered representative and have been used in the resource  estimation  exercise  with  the  exception  of  a  channel-sampled  roadcut that was oriented subparallel to strike (5RC001) in which it was not possible to ascertain the true thickness of mineralized intersections.
-  Drill  core  samples  from  the  diamond  drilling  program  that  were  collected  for grade  determination  by  assay  techniques  outlined  in  Section  13.    These  were collected according to the MSA SOP and involved collection of half-core samples (after  splitting  with  a  diamond  saw)  over  the  mineralized intervals at a nominal sample width of 1 m.
-  Drill  core  samples  from  the  diamond  drilling  program  that  were  collected  for mineralogical analysis at the Natural History Museum in the United Kingdom

## 12.1 Stockpile samples

A total of 6 stockpile samples have been collected by RCR from roadside stockpiles from mining activities adjacent to RCR's licenses or from artisanal operations on RCR licenses.  These samples are not considered representative of mineralisation on the HZP  as  they  have  undoubtedly  been  subjected  to  crude  pre-concentration  by  the operators.

## 12.2 Mapping grab samples

A total of 94 outcrop grab samples have been collected during the course of mapping on  the  HZP.    Grab  samples  typically  comprise  visibly  mineralized  material  and, wherever possible, samples of 1-2 kg mass were collected and placed in sample bags with a duplicate ticket book number that is cross-correlated in the MSA database with the outcrop locality number.  Although the samples are not representative of the bulk grade of the mineralized zone, high grade grab samples were used in conjunction with structural  data  to  site  trenches  for  representative  channel  sample  collection.    Grab samples were analysed with the InnovX handheld XRF prior to laboratory dispatch to rapidly obtain indicative grade results.

## 12.3 Channel samples

A total of 233 routine channel samples totalling 220.58 m (uncorrected for dip) were collected  from  the  excavated  trenches  on  License  5  and  submitted  for  analysis. Friable samples were split using a riffle splitter such that a representative subsample was  retained  on  site  and  field  duplicates  could  be  prepared.    Of  the  233  collected samples, 102 of the samples were from the main or upper mineralized zone, for a total uncorrected  width  of  94.37  m.  The  remaining  samples  comprised  dolomitic  and brecciated units from the hangingwall and footwall and, in several instances, middling units between mineralized layers.

## 12.4 Drill core samples

A total of 562 routine drill core samples for a total width (uncorrected for dip) of 538.44 m were collected from borehole cores from License 5 and The Pentagon.  Competent drill  core  was  split  using  a  diamond  saw  and  half-core  samples  bagged  and  tagged using  duplicate  ticket  books.    Incompetent  sample  material  was  split  using  a  rigid plastic  sheet  to  approximately  half  the  sample  interval  in  the  coretray,  with  one  half collected and bagged for laboratory submission and the balance retained in the core tray. Field  duplicates  were  created  by  splitting  the  half-core  submitted  to  the laboratory  into  two  quarter  cores.    Of  the  562  routine  samples  submitted  to  the  laboratory, 147 of these were logged as mineralized zone with the balance comprising mineralized brecciated units in the footwall or hangingwall and middling units between mineralized horizons.

The HZP drill core is securely stored in a core shack facility just outside Hakkari. The PVC core trays are stored in racks within a lockable shed (Figure 12-1).

## 12.5 Mineralogical samples

A  suite  of  samples  spanning  various  grades  and  compositions  was  selected  for mineralogical analysis under instruction from staff at the The Natural History Museum in the United Kingdom.  These samples are tabulated in Table 12-1.

## Table 12-1 Sample types and numbers submitted for mineralogical analysis

| Intersection types   | Intersection types                 |   Intersection types |
|----------------------|------------------------------------|----------------------|
| 1                    | Low grade oxide (<5%)              |                    5 |
| 2                    | Oxide 5-12% Zn                     |                    6 |
| 3                    | Oxide 18-25% Zn                    |                    5 |
| 4                    | V high grade 25-48% Zn             |                    5 |
| 5                    | Fe-rich (43-58% Fe)                |                    5 |
| 6                    | Mineralized dolomites and breccias |                    5 |
|                      | Total                              |                   31 |

Results of the mineralogical study are expected to be available in April 2011.

## 13 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND SECURITY

## 13.1 Sample Preparation, Analyses and Security

All samples were submitted to ALS Chemex in Izmir for preparation which comprised crushing to 70% &lt;2 mm and pulverising of 1 000 g to 85% passing 75 μm , prior to being dispatched to Vancouver for assay by method ME-OG62 (4-acid digest with ICPAES finish) for Ag, Bi, Cd, Fe, Mg, Mn, Mo, Pb, S and Zn.  Overlimit (&gt;30% Zn) assay results were flagged and these sample pulps reanalysed using method ME-OG62h (a dilution  technique).    Cu  and  Cr  were  included  in  earlier  assay  requests  but  results returned values at or below the respective detection limits and these elements were removed from the analytical suite.

Density  determinations  were  carried  out  on  all  samples  in  the  field  using  the Archimedes principle.  The dry mass of a sample (in air) is ratioed against its mass when immersed in water to determine its density relative to water (which has a density of  1  g/cm .    For  friable  samples,  the  sample  was  wrapped  in  clingfilm  prior  to 3 immersion in order to ensure sample integrity although it was noted that this method resulted  in  incomplete  sample  immersion  due  to  trapped  air  bubbles  and  therefore likely under-reports sample density.  MSA recommend that field-based determinations of  density  should  be  carried  out  using  a  volume-replacement  technique  on  in-situ mineralized material.  This would involve extraction and weighing of a known volume of material in order to determine bulk density.

## 13.2 Quality Assurance and Quality Control

Appropriate  quality  assurance  and  quality  control  (QAQC)  monitoring  is  a  critical aspect of the sampling and assaying process in any exploration program.  Monitoring the  quality  of  laboratory  analyses  is  fundamental  to  ensuring  the  highest  degree  of confidence  in  the  analytical  data  and  providing  the  necessary  confidence  to  make informed decisions when interpreting all the available information. Quality assurance may be defined as information collected to demonstrate that the data used further in the project are valid. Quality control (QC) comprises procedures designed to maintain a  desired  level  of  quality  in  the  assay  database.    Effectively  applied,  QC  leads  to identification and corrections of errors or changes in procedures that improve overall data  quality.    Appropriate  documentation  of  QC  measures  and  regular  scrutiny  of quality control data are important as a safeguard for project data and form the basis for the quality assurance program implemented during exploration.

In order to ensure quality standards are met and maintained, planning and implementation  of  a  range  of  external  quality  control  measures  is  required.    Such measures are essential for  minimising  uncertainty  and  improving  the  integrity  of  the assay database and are aimed to provide:

-  An integrity check on the reliability of the data,

<!-- image -->

-  Quantification of accuracy and precision,
-  Confidence in the sample and assay database,
-  The necessary documentation to support database validation.

Sampling procedures were implemented according to the MSA SOP for the Hakkari project and were subsequently revised by RCR to align with operational requirements. Key elements of the laboratory SOP are:

-  Fixed sample batch sizes of 40 samples
-  Each batch to commence with a blank and include a minimum of one standard (certified reference material (CRM)) and one field duplicate

Field  duplicates  were  created  by  splitting  of  channel  and  drill  core  samples.    In  the initial stages  of  the  program,  however,  RCR  requested  duplicate  analysis  of  a submitted  sample  (i.e.  open  duplicates).    In  the  latter  stages  of  the  program,  this methodology was changed with RCR submitting blind field duplicates sequentially into the sampling stream.  In addition, ALS Chemex's internal QAQC results were supplied with each set of assay results and included blanks, standards and reanalysis of pulps.

Matrix-matched (oxide) CRMs used during the exploration program were sourced from African  Mineral  Standards  (AMIS)  in  South  Africa  and  Geostats  in  Australia.    These are listed below in Table 13-1.

## Table 13-1 AMIS and Geostats CRM's used during the 2010 exploration program

| CRM       | Description                     |   Certified %Zn | %Pb              |
|-----------|---------------------------------|-----------------|------------------|
| AMIS0144  | zinc oxide ore ex Skorpion Mine |           17.36 | 0.00             |
| AMIS0145  | zinc oxide ore ex Skorpion Mine |           12.59 | 0.00             |
| AMIS0152  | zinc oxide ore ex Skorpion Mine |            5.88 | 0.00             |
| GBM306-12 | Cu-Pb-Zn caprock                |            2.05 | 2.68 (certified) |
| GBM396-10 | Supergene ore ex Murchison      |            1.06 | 0.10 (certified) |
| GBM903-12 | Zn concentrate                  |           48.95 | 1.10 (certified) |

In addition, a commercially prepared (AMIS108) silica powder was used as the project blank material.

Assay  results  were  monitored  on  a  batch-by-batch  basis  using  the  following  criteria defined in the RCR laboratory protocol:

-  Failure of a standard or blank i.e. a CRM, constitutes a failure of an entire batch
-  Failure  criteria  are  defined  as  more  than  two  standard  deviations  from  the certified values for standards and assay values greater than 0.05% (Pb and Zn) for blanks

A summary of the CRM's inserted into the sampling stream is given in Table 13-2.

## 13.2.1 RCR QAQC performance

## 13.2.1.1 Blanks

Of the 36 blanks inserted into the sampling stream, all except three returned values within  the  0.05%  Zn  warning  limit.    All  of  the  blanks  returned  Pb  values  within  the warning limits.  In terms of the RCR protocol, the three batches comprising the failed blanks  were  re-assayed  in  their  entirety.    Sample  H2416  returned  0.16%  Zn  and immediately  followed  sample  H2415  which  returned  25%  Zn,  clearly  indicating contamination in the assay process.  Samples H2438 and H2508 returned values of 0.066% Zn and 0.242% Zn.  Both of these blanks were inserted at the beginning of their respective  batches  and  suggest  improper  flushing  of  analytical  equipment between batches.

The  three  batches  (IZ10118550,  IZ10160763,  IZ10165908)  were  re-assayed  in  their entirety  and  all  three  blanks  returned  values  within  the  warning  limit.    The  re-assay results were retained in the final database and failed batch values overwritten with the re-assay data.  Similarly good blank performance was noted for Ag.  MSA considers the performance of the blanks to be acceptable.

Final control charts for blank samples are shown in Figure 13-1.

## 13.2.1.2 Standards

A  total  of  30  standards  were  inserted  into  the  Hakkari  sampling  stream.    With  the exception  of  two  high-grade  standards,  all  returned  values  within  two  standard deviations  relative  to  their  certified  values.    The  two  standard  samples  that  did  not return valued within two standard deviations are both GBM 903-12, the high grade Zn concentrate with a certified value of 48.95% Zn.  Both of these samples were reported as  &gt;30%  Zn  (i.e.  overlimit  samples)  but  were  not  re-assayed  using  the  dilution technique  for  overlimit  samples  that  was  employed  in  the  balance  of  the  assay program.    Both  of  these  samples  were  from  Batch  IZ1016666  that  exclusively comprised samples from the road cut (5RC001) and was not included in the resource model.  The AMIS standards contain very low levels for Pb and are not certified for Pb. As a result, only GBM standards were used to monitor accuracy of Pb assay results. Similarly, only AMIS145 and GBM 396-10 are certified for Ag and in all instances the standards  reported  within  the  accepted  deviation  from  the  certified  value.  The performance of the CRMs was monitored using control charts (Figures 13-2 to 13-5).

<!-- image -->

MSA  does  not  consider  the  failure  to  reassay  the  two  overlimit  standards  to  be  a material issue and is of the opinion that the accuracy of the assay data is acceptable, both for Pb and Zn.

## 13.2.1.3 Duplicates

A  total  of  43  field  duplicates  were  inserted  by  RCR  into  the  sampling  stream, comprising a combination of open (pulp) duplicates and field duplicates.  Duplicates performed well with a correlation coefficient of 0.998 for Zn, 0.994 for Pb and 0.993 for Ag (Figures 13-6 and 13-7).  Scatter is evident towards the lower detection limit (well below  economic  grades),  particularly  for  Ag,  in  line  with  the  precision  of  the  assay method, but the relative-difference (RD plots) further confirm the good performance of the duplicates and assign sufficient confidence to the precision of the assay data

## 13.2.2 Laboratory QAQC performance

As part of their internal QAQC procedures, ALS Chemex monitored their results with the insertion of their own standards, blanks and duplicates. Control charts showing the results of laboratory blanks and CRMs are illustrated in Figures 13-8 to 13-13.  All of the  laboratory  QAQC  measures  are  considered  appropriate  and  MSA  considers  the data to be accurate and precise.

## 13.2.3 Umpire laboratory

A selection of approximately 5% (36 samples) of all routine samples was submitted to ACME  laboratory  in  Ankara  for  umpire  analysis.    The  umpire  list  was  selected  at random across the grade range reported by ALS Chemex.  Samples were analysed using the same ICP-AES methodology as employed by ALS Chemex and an extremely strong  correlation  is  noted  between  the  original  (ALS)  and  umpire  (ACME)  results (Figure 13-4).  Ag assays show some scatter close to the detection limit (as evidenced in  the  RD  plot)  but  this  is  not  considered  a  material  failure  given  the  extremely  low values in question (RD's greater than 15% are only noted for original Ag assays &lt; 4 ppm).  MSA considers that the umpire results demonstrate the integrity and validity of the  original  assay  dataset.    Three  standards  and  one  blank  were  inserted  with  the umpire  batch  and  reported  within  the  prescribed  limits  applied  to  the  ALS  Chemex dataset.

## 14 DATA VERIFICATION

In  accordance with National Instrument 43-101, the QP (Mike Robertson) visited the Hakkari properties from 26 July to 7 August 2009, 16 to 30 March 2010, 20 to 27 June 2010,  13  to  18  August  2010,  and  together  with  Mike  Hall  (mineral  resources  QP) between 4 and 8 December 2010. The purpose of these site visits was to inspect the license areas comprising the HZP project and establish the geological setting of the project and of the zinc mineralization, visit adjacent small-scale mining areas, observe the extent of exploration work conducted by RCR and to verify the compliance of the exploration program with the project SOP's.

During the site visits, the QP was accompanied by various RCR and MSA personnel, including  Brendan  Clarke,  co-author  of  this  report.    Sampling,  trenching  and  drilling activities were observed and found to be compliant with the MSA SOP's and with the requirements of NI 43-101.

MSA is responsible for the management of data generated during RCR's exploration activities at the HZP.    As  such,  a  Microsoft Access  relational database  was established, comprising the following data tables:

-  Mapping, including grab sample assay results and outcrop data from pre-2010 activities on the HZP
-  Borehole collar header table
-  Borehole lithological log
-  Borehole structural log
-  Core recovery and geotechnical (rock quality designation, RQD) log
-  Borehole sampling log
-  Trench header table
-  Trench lithology and structure log
-  Trench sample (channel) log
-  Borehole sample assay results
-  Borehole field duplicate assay results
-  Borehole CRM assay results
-  Trench sample assay results
-  Trench field duplicate assay results
-  Trench CRM assay results
-  Core photography table
-  Downhole survey table
-  InnovX handheld XRF results for borehole core

-  InnovX handheld XRF results for trench samples
-  Specific gravity results table
-  Mineralogical sampling table

The  field-based  geological  team  provided  weekly  data  updates  to  the  MSA  data manager in Johannesburg via email in the form of dropdown-validated locked Excel spreadsheets.    Data  from  these  updates  was  subject  to  a  rigorous  QAQC  protocol prior to importation into the database.

Mike  Robertson  (project  QP,  MSA)  and  Brendan  Clarke  (MSA)  directly  received  all assay certificates from ALS Chemex.  These data were subject to QAQC procedures prior to acceptance into the database, as document in Section 13.2.

In addition to the regular visits made during the 2010 exploration season, RCR have made provision for regular visits by the project QP in 2011.  Additionally, MSA have a permanent  staff  presence  on  site  and  all  MSA  geological  staff  are  professionally accredited  with  the  South  African  Council  of  Natural  and  Scientific  Professions (SACNASP).

## 15 ADJACENT PROPERTIES

Informal  small-scale  mechanised  mining  of  zinc  ore  has  taken  place  in  the  Hakkari district  over  the  last  5  to  10  years.  This  mining  has  been  conducted with excavators and dump trucks from a number of mining sites, with stockpiling of ore at various sites along  the  main  road  to  Hakkari.  Historical  mining,  as  evidenced  by  archaeological finds, dates back to Roman and Babylonian times and was focused on mining of lead which typically  occurs  towards  the top of the zinc mineralized zones.  Roman mining galleries have been observed at several localities in the Hakkari area.

Of importance to RCR are a number of small-scale mining sites between licenses 5 and 8 and licenses 8 and 10 (Figure 15-1). These represent mainly open cut workings with some exploratory shallow underground development, both of which have exploited high grade zinc mineralization. The workings are regarded as 'informal' as they are not based on a modern exploration program, Mineral Resource/Reserve base, or mine plan and have not been professionally surveyed to accurately record tonnages mined. Tonnages and grades are as reported to MSA by the operators and have not been independently verified. However, in MSA's opinion, these workings give an indication of potential orebody dimensions and grades that may be expected in the RCR license areas.

Five mining sites were visited by MSA in the area between licenses 5 and 8 and three in the hexagonal area between licenses 8 and 10, as indicated in Figure 15-1 and in the photographs in Figure 15-2.

The  area  between  licenses  5  and  8  is  held  by  Meskan  Ölmez  Madencilik  and  Ekin Madencilik.  At  localities  1  to  3  in  Figure  15-1,  up  to  3  prominent  non-sulphide  zinc mineralized  units  are  recognized,  which  dip  to  the  north-northeast  at  approximately 20 ° .  The upper two layers vary in thickness from 0.2 to 1 m with an overall grade of approximately 30% Zn, with the lowermost layer 7 to 13 m in thickness at an overall reported grade of approximately 35% Zn. The latter zone is reportedly underlain by a variable 2 m thick zinc sulphide layer; however this was not observed by MSA as the open cut has been partially in-filled. Fine-grained sulphide mineralization was however observed on a stockpile near the Meskan Ölmez Madencilik offices. A number of other sub-parallel  thin  discontinuous  non-sulphide  zinc  layers  are  developed  within  and overlying this sequence. Some 60 000 tonnes of ROM zinc ore at an average grade of 35% Zn are reported to have produced from the Meskan Ölmez Madencilik license in 2009.

Mining sites 4 and 5 in Figure 15-1 have exploited a steeply dipping to overturned 4 to 5 m  thick  non-sulphide  zinc  zone  which  strikes  west-northwest.  A  steeply  dipping mineralized  zone  is  being  exploited  at  sites  6,  7  and  8  within  the  hexagonal  area between RCR licenses 8 and 10. Mining site 8 is owned by the Seyitoğlu family.

The  deposits  being  worked  in  the  district  are  mined  intermittently  and  have  to  date produced  'lumpy'  ore,  which  is  sometimes  hand-sorted  (Schaffalitzky,  2009).  This

<!-- image -->

material  has  been  sold  to  metal  traders,  a  well-developed  business  in  Turkey.  The Seyitoğlu  family  run  of  mine  ore  is  crushed  and  transported  by  truck  to  the  port  at Mersin, some 900 km from Hakkari, at a cost of $185/tonne.

The following conclusions are drawn based on observations made at these workings:

-  Non-sulphide  zinc  mineralization  can  be  traced  for  substantial  distances  along strike.
-  Potential for sulphide and mixed oxide-sulphide mineralization exists.
-  Mineralized zones vary in thickness along strike, at a prospect scale.
-  The degree of oxidation of mineralization varies considerably, as does the iron content, often over short distances along strike and across the mineralized zone at  individual  localities.  Variations  in  zinc,  lead  and  iron  contents  over  short ranges should be expected.
-  These observations have implications for trench and drillhole spacing in defining a mineral resource base. Due to the inherent variabilities, it is anticipated that a close drillhole spacing and data density will be required for delineating Indicated and Measured Resources.
-  The presence of multiple mineralized layers on RCR licenses 5 and 8 will need to be  validated  by  mapping,  trenching  and  drilling.  Drillholes  will  need  to  be  long enough to intersect multiple mineralized horizons.

## 16 MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING

In  late  2009,  bench  scale  metallurgical  test  work  was  conducted  on  three  10 kg stockpile samples collected by RCR. These stockpiles represent material mined from the vicinity of the RCR license areas and the results therefore provide an indication of the  likely  metallurgical  characteristics  and  parameters  that  can  be  expected  in  the processing  of  future  RCR  ROM  material.    Subsequent  to  this,  in  2010,  the  use  of proprietary  mobile  gravity  concentrators  was  investigated  and  revealed  sustainable upgrading of feed material by up to 300%.  Neither the author nor MSA is qualified to comment extensively on the metallurgical testwork carried out to date.

## 16.1 Bench-scale metallurgical testwork

The test work was undertaken in South Africa under the direction of M.A. Plaskitt, a professional metallurgist, by Tangmere R&amp;D in Uvongo, with chemical analyses by Set Point Laboratories in Johannesburg and mineralogical investigations by SGS Laboratories  in  Johannesburg.  Check  analyses  were  done  by  UIS  Laboratories  in Pretoria and by Mintek in Johannesburg. The results are reported in Plaskitt (2010), and an independent review of the results reported on in Meyer (2010). The findings of the test work are reported on below.

The  samples  comprise  extensively  oxidised  material  with  the  dominant  zinc  mineral being  smithsonite  (31%  to  55%  of  sample  material)  and  substantial  amounts  of hemimorphite  also  present  (12%  to  35%  of  sample  material).    Neither  of  these minerals  is  difficult  to  process  hydrometallurgically.    Approximately  6%  sphalerite  is present  in  two  of  the  three  samples,  with  lead  present  as  cerrusite  (5%  to  6%  of sample material). The ore samples ranged in grade from 25.9% to 42.9% Zn and 4.7% to  8.0%  Pb.    The  gangue  consists  of  iron  oxide  minerals,  calcite,  barite  and  quartz. The iron content varied from 3.8% to 18.8% and comprises essentially goethite and siderite  weathered  to  limonite.  Chemical  analyses  were  conducted  by  XRF  and  ICP (OES/MS?) methods.

Smithsonite,  hemi-morphite  and  cerrusite  are  relatively  coarse grained  and  liberate between 220 and 380 μm. The goethite/limonite liberates at around 120 μm and the remaining gangue at about 200 μm.

The  iron  minerals  showed  no  response  to  magnetic  separation  attempts.  Oxide flotation was rejected due to the high grade of the samples, inherent inefficiencies in oxide flotation as well as likely cost.  Further, the minerals liberate at too fine a size for efficient gravity separation.  Cyclones and spirals were deemed to have some potential as pre-concentrators and future work on these options was recommended.

The results of calcining test work conducted on the samples are reported as not too useful.  In the latter regard it may be more productive to fume the material in Waelz kilns.

Direct acid leaching produced the following results:

-  As the feed ore is fairly soft it leaches very easily in weak sulphuric acid (10 to 15%);  zinc  dissolution  was  in  excess  of  90%  within  one  hour  under  ambient conditions.  Optimisation  of  these  leaching  conditions  as  well  as  some  heating should push these dissolutions into the mid-nineties. Very pleasing is the ready dissolution of hemimorphite without any silica gelling indications. Sphalerite will, however, not leach under such conditions.
-  Caustic  soda  leach  conducted  on  the  ores  gave  very  poor  dissolution  results (30%).
-  The 'weak' acid solution (15-20% sulphuric acid) is the favoured option as less iron will be dissolved than if stronger acid solutions are used. This fits well with the spent electrolyte, usually, obtained in zinc electrowinning operations.
-  Leaching  performed  satisfactorily  at  ambient  conditions;  the  stringent  winter temperatures in Hakkari should, however, be taken into account. Steam should be made available to the leach and the purification plants.
-  The study calculated  the acid consumption to be about 30kg per tonne of ore treated. Lower ore grades could influence this estimate significantly.
-  Although no filtration problems were experienced it will be prudent to conduct the necessary settling and filtration tests in future test work especially when higher silica containing ores are leached.
-  Purification test work is not complete but should pose no serious problems. The technology is standard practise in the zinc electrowinning industry. It is important to  oxidise  the  iron  to  the  ferric  state  prior  to  neutralization.  The  ferric  iron  can then  be  removed  in  a  variety  of  ways.  Iron  removal  will  assist  in  removing deleterious  elements  from  the  prospective  electrolyte.  It  will,  however,  be necessary to check the purified solution for Cu, Co, Ni, Cd, Ge, As and Sb as these  elements  can  seriously  influence  the  plating  of  zinc.  If  detected  these elements can be readily removed by cementation with zinc dust. Ion exchange is also a possibility for total solution purification but would have to be extensively tested especially for iron fouling of the resin. Whichever option is selected,  good  quality  electrolyte  is  a  prerequisite  for  optimum  electrowinning performance.
-  Impurities  such  as  Ca,  Cd,  Co,  Mn,  Ge  and  As  are  all  very  low  and  will  be removed  during  zinc  sulphate  solutions  purification  by  ion-exchange  and  /or precipitation  techniques.  Iron  (Fe)  will  be  precipitated  and  filtered  off  by  PH control which is a well-known practice.
-  In addition to iron precipitation, the silica/silicate content as well as  the calcium/magnesium  sulphate  (±60%)  and  barium  sulphate  (±3,0%)  can  be

<!-- image -->

separately  precipitated  and  by-products  barium  (Ba)  and  lead  (Pb)  further extracted.

-  The  environmental  situation  regarding  the  storage  of  acidic  leach  residues  in Turkey is not known and needs to be clarified.

The advantages of direct acid leaching include:

-  No  or  possibly  little  pre-concentration  is  required  for  this  high  grade  feed material.
-  Proven technology can be used throughout the design.
-  The capacity of the plant can easily be up-scaled to treat far larger tonnages.

The risks associated with direct acid leaching include:

-  Ore variability due to increased gangue material. This could result in higher acid consumption in the  leach and create potential filtration issues.  Stringent  grade control measures will be required on the mining side. Ore blending in the plant should also be part of the design.

## 16.2 Gravity concentration

RCR has undertaken significant testing of a wide range of HZP type ores at accredited mineral  processing  facilities  and  laboratories  in  South  Africa,  along  with  secondary verification  testing  with  a  Mobile  Concentrator  Machine  designer  and  manufacturer, who is specifically specialised in the field of Gravity concentration of oxide ores utilizing a number of mineral processing machines in a unique composite configuration.

Tests executed during 2011 have confirmed that the gravity concentration methodology is sustainable and as such RCR has ordered its first Concentrator Unit for 20tph feed (90 000 tonnes per annum), based on the design configuration supplied by  Mike  Plaskitt,  RCR's  metallurgical  consultant.  The  deployment  of  the  first  unit  is expected in April/May 2011 with a second unit planned for deployment in August/September 2011.

Testing has proven that a sustainable upgrade ratio of the feed between 1.5 and 3.1 times is possible dependent on the head feed grade, utilizing a constant configuration composite gravity concentrator. Significantly, the upgrade ratio favours the lower grade ores.  The original reports are included in Appendix 5.

Concentrator specifications are summarised below:

-  Feed characteristics of:
-  Zn ore/ROM (-150mm), plant feed (-80mm), crushed ore (-12.5mm), with a moisture content of 2 to 8%.

<!-- image -->

-  The aim was of the portable plant is to treat 20 dry tons/hr of 7.5% Zn Feed ore to a total concentrate of at least 3X Zn grade (therefore a minimum 22.5% Zn) in the size range -12.5mm.
-  Zn recovery must be at least 75%, i.e. 20tph feed at 7.5% Zn can yield at least 5tph concentrate grading 22.5% Zn, on a dry basis.
-  The coarse crushed material size is -12.5 mm + 1.50 mm and fine material size is -1.5 mm. The plant must be designed to treat -12.5mm to + 1.50mm feed in a suitable dense medium cyclone operating at an automatically controlled density of 2.80 to 3.00. The fine fraction of the feed must be treated on suitably designed gravity spirals, and with a feed capacity of 8tph of -1.5mm material.
-  Water consumption of the unit should be a maximum of 22m /hr for a dry feed 3 rate of 20tph ore. Raw water will be supplied by from boreholes, and therefore the plant must be designed to consume as little water possible through water recirculation, zero spillages, and curtailment of evaporation and pond seepage.
-  Maximum power demand of the plant should not exceed 160kw even though the emergency diesel generator supplied is 200kVa/200kw. A 380V, 3-phase 4 core cable  &amp;  copper  earth  system  is  proposed.  The  supply  cable  shall  run  above ground,  along  with  the  necessary  switchgear,  safeguard,  meter  and  lightning protection.
-  Diesel  consumption  of  the  200kW  emergency  generator  should  be  kept  to  a maximum of 40 litres/hr, given the high diesel price in Turkey in excess of US $2/litre.
-  The plant shall be designed for continuous operation and for operational ease since it will be operated in remote areas of Turkey by personnel of medium skill.
-  At  a  feed  of  20tph  at  Tufenbeyli,  a  5tph  concentrate  grading  22.5%  Zn  is required therefore three-fold Zn upgrading. Therefore, running hours of at least 4,500hr/per year are achievable.
-  Two  product  sizes  are  expected,  -12.5  +  1.5mm  (coarse)  and  -1.5mm  (fine). Product will probably be collected in 30kg bags for ease of handling, and shall contain a maximum of 15% moisture in the fines product.
-  Ferro-Silicon (FeSi) consumption/losses on the plant should be 1,0kg/t of product maximum.
-  ROM material  will  be  from  250mm  downwards  and  an  additional  jaw  crusher needs to be supplied alongside the portable plant to crush feed down to -80mm. Spilt and oversize feed between this crusher and the plant must be recycled and neatly stockpiled for recycling.
-  Dust generated during crushing and screening operations should be lightly water sprayed to suppress excessive dust.

<!-- image -->

-  Water supply will be at a premium and will probably come from boreholes, hence the  plant  must  be  designed  for  minimum  water  consumption  of  about  15  to 20m3/hr maximum.
-  Concentrate (product)  will  probably  be  bagged  in  30kg  bags  but  might  require sun-drying alongside the unit to reduce its moisture content.
-  With  a  20tph  ore  feed,  ±10tph  of  coarse  tailings  (-12.5  +  0.5mm)  containing appreciable  water  (±21m3/hr)  can  be  generated.  These  coarse  tailings  will require dewatering to ±4tph water (H2O) maximum and ± 14m3/hr H2O recycled for  process  use.  Fine  tailings  of  5,0tph  are  expected  (-0.5mm)  containing  ± 2.5m3/hr H2O, which will be lost in the tails slurry. Mixed with the coarse tailings will be ± 5kg of fine FeSi losses per 10tph of tailings.
-  Electrical equipment (relays/contactors/switches, etc) must be selected for easy and compatible replacement with switchgear/electronics available in Turkey.
-  Instrumentation  should  be  simple  and  robust  and  easy  to  repair  &amp;  service  in Turkey. Pumps, screens, pipes, valves must be easily replaceable with equivalents  in  Turkey  excepting  perhaps  for  the  Ni-hard  pump  casings  for pumping abrasive gravels. Conveyors must be standardised so that they can be easily  maintained  in  Turkey,  and  should  be  designed  for  zero  spillage.  Details and specifications of these are to be given in the technical manual so that they can be manufactured in Turkey as spares. The technical manual will specify and describe  all  other  equipment,  its  maintenance  and  safety  precautions.  The manual should contain, in the same manual or separately, the detailed operating procedure of the plant including required
-  The  entire  unit  shall  be  painted  or  coated  where  necessary  as  per  sound engineering practice in order to inhibit rusting/ corrosion for 5 years of operation.
-  Turkey  experiences  both  winter  and  summer  rains  and  an  adjustable  roof  is required over the critical areas of the unit. Since the unit is to be operated on a 24hr-day basis, suitable lights are to be supplied to ensure sound operation. For 3  to  4  months  of  the  year,  sub-zero  temperatures  are  experienced  in  Turkey. Maximum  summer  temperatures  can  reach  40ºC,  although  average  summer temperatures are ± 25ºC.

## 17 MINERAL RESOURCE AND MINERAL RESERVE ESTIMATES

A NI 43-101 compliant Mineral Resource estimate was undertaken for the License 5 area drilled during the 2010 exploration program. Geological and grade models were constructed incorporating known geological and structural controls on the mineralization as derived from the exploration results. In addition a non-code compliant Mineral Resource estimate was undertaken for the Pentagon License.

## 17.1 QAQC and Internal Database Verification

A full account of QAQC and data verification procedures are discussed in preceding sections  of  this  report.    Only  finalised,  verified  data  was  included  in  the  resource estimation exercise. A final database audit was undertaken and data exported on 11th February  2011  this  providing  the  input  into  the  geological  modelling  and  grade estimation routines. The input data for the resource estimation exercise consisted of diamond  drillholes  (DD)  with  collar,  downhole  survey,  lithology,  sampling  and  assay data.  Trench  data  were  also  included  and  treated  as  horizontal  or  shallow  plunging drillholes.  The  database  also  included  density  data  determined  on-site,  using  the Archimedes principle (wet and dry weighing method) on half-core samples. Geological mapping data including strike and dip information was also utilised for the geological modelling exercise.

## 17.2 Resource Estimates

The  Mineral  Resource  estimation  exercise  was  based  on  wireframe  envelopes representing  the  mineralisation  in  each  license  generated  from  drillhole  and  trench data extracted from the database compiled by MSA.

Datamine Studio 3  software was used for the three-dimensional geological modelling ® of  the  mineralized  zones  in  both  license  areas.  The  mineralisation  envelopes  were defined to encompass drillhole and trench intercepts of  0.5% Zn. Mineralisation was truncated at surface at the mapped outcrop traces and extrapolated to a maximum of 210 m down-dip in License 5 and to 105 m below surface in the Pentagon license.

Datamine Studio 3  was also used for the resource estimation. Snowden Supervisor ® ® software was used for the geostatistics and univariate statistical analysis.

## 17.2.1 Geological Interpretation and Modelling

## 17.2.1.1 License 5

MSA was provided with digitised topographic contours for License 5. Drillhole collars were  merged  with  these  contours  to  produce  a  combined  topographic  wireframe surface for modelling. Mapped outcrop traces of both mineralized zones were draped

<!-- image -->

onto this surface. Trenches, oriented according to their surveyed azimuth, were also draped onto the topographic surface.

The mapped outcrops were reinterpreted using a constant stratigraphic separation of the two mineralized zones.

Contact surfaces were constructed for the wireframes along west-east sections along grid northings, starting first where the trenches and drillholes were in alignment. This was first for the basal contact of the Lower mineralized zone, where the apparent dip was  extrapolated  to  other  sections,  at  40m  intervals  along  strike.  These  sectional interpretations were copied up to the upper contact of the Lower mineralized zone at  0.5% Zn.

These  interpretations  were  copied  upwards  to  the  Upper  mineralized  zone  and modified to fit the drilling data. The general thickness variations as seen in the Lower mineralisation were mirrored in the Upper mineralized zone.

Due to the wide data spread it was not considered important to invoke faulting at this stage. Based on field observations, it was concluded that open folding is the dominant structural  feature  at  Hakkari  (Figure  17-1).  In  addition,  no  intrusive  rocks  are  known from  the  license  area.    No  other  geological  features  were  incorporated  into  the geological model.

No geological losses have been modelled. It is believed that the effect of geological discontinuities  will  be  better  addressed  following  additional  drilling  and  possible  trial mining.

## 17.2.1.2 Pentagon License

No  topographic  surface  was  available  or  provided  for  the  Pentagon  License  as  the planned surveying activities were curtailed due to inclement weather and associated access issues. A rough ground surface wireframe was created from the drillhole collar coordinates, expanded outwards by 50 m from the collar positions.

The  modelled  mineralisation  (Lower  mineralized  zone)  at  the  Pentagon  project consists  of  a  single  steeply  (&gt;80  )  south  westerly-dipping  zone,  intersected  by  eight drillholes. The model was extended along-strike for half the average drillhole spacing from the last drillhole positions.

There has been some depletion of the mineralized zone by mining since the surveying of the Pentagon drillholes, which makes the accuracy of the collar doubtful. It has been assumed that a 5 m thickness of the mineralized zone has been extracted by mining since the drillholes were completed.

There are two isolated 1-2 m thick intersections of what may be an Upper mineralized zone  (as  at  License  5),  but  these  were  not  modelled  due  to  their  lack  of  defined continuity along-strike.

## 17.2.2 Block Model Creation

The  mineralized  zone  wireframes  were  used  to  generate  3D  block  models  for  both licenses and for each mineralized zone in License 5 in Datamine Studio 3 ® .

The origin for the block models for License 5 is 362,000mE, 4,149,500mN and 1000m AMSL. The block size used was 50 m (easting) x 50 m (northing) and a nominal 1 m for  the  Z  height.  Splitting  of  the  blocks  was  used  in  the  east-west  and  north-south directions,  creating  sub-blocks  with  a  minimum  size  of  6.25  m  (easting)  by  6.25  m (northing), to enable close block fitting to the zone wireframes. Exact vertical fitting to the wireframes was enforced.

The origin for the block model for Pentagon is 372,400mE, 4,150,950mN and 1500m AMSL. The block size used was 10 m (easting) x 10 m (northing) and 1 m for the Z height.  Splitting  of  the  blocks  was  used  in  the  east-west  and  north-south  directions, creating sub-blocks with a minimum size of 1.25 m (easting) by 1.25 m (northing), to enable close block fitting to the zone wireframe. Exact vertical fitting to the wireframes was also enforced at the pentagon.

Volume checks on the wireframes and block models returned the values in Table 17-1. The  volume  of  each  mineralized  zone  wireframe  corresponds  closely  with  the respective block model.

## 17.2.3 Exploratory Data Analysis and Compositing

The License 5 area is covered by surface drillhole data with a drilling density ranging from 60 m x 80 m to 120 m x 120 m spacing. This has had an effect on the grade estimation exercise resulting in areas of low confidence in grade estimation. There are only 25 samples in the License 5 Upper mineralized zone envelope.

Compositing of the drilling data was not undertaken for either license. The dominant sample  length  is  1  m  in  the  drillhole  and  trench  sample  database.  Exploratory  data analysis  (EDA)  per  elemental  constituent  was  undertaken  on  samples  weighted  by length.

The raw samples acted as the input data for the initial data analysis study. Statistics of the  input  data  for  selected  elements  are  tabulated  below  per  mineralized  zone  for license 5 (Figure 17-2 and Figure 17-3).

## 17.2.4 Variography

Variography  was  undertaken  on  each  separate  mineralized  zone.  There  are  201 samples within the Lower Mineralized zone, but only 25 in the Upper mineralized zone. The spatial arrangement of the samples in both zones is dominantly along-strike, with only a small across-strike component. As such, no reliable variographic modelling was achieved.

No  variography  was  attempted  on  the  Pentagon  License  due  to  the  limited  strike length  and  down-dip  dimensions  of  the  explored  area.  There  are  97  samples  in  the mineralized envelope at the Pentagon License.

## 17.2.5 Estimation Parameters and Grade Estimation

Due to the overall limited across-strike data spread in both mineralized zones, as well as the limited data contained within the Upper mineralized zone, grade estimation was undertaken  using  inverse-distance  squared  on  3-D  block  models  for  each  of  the mineralized  zones.  For  the  Pentagon,  due  to  the  limited  strike  length  and  down-dip

<!-- image -->

dimensions of the initially-explored area, grade estimation was also undertaken using inversed distance squared.

A  minimum  of  3  and  a  maximum  of  10  samples  were  utilised  for  an  estimate.  A maximum of five samples were used from individual drillholes. A multiplier of up to 12 was used for the search radii in order to populate all blocks with sample data, which would, in the absence of other data limitations, restrict the classification to the Inferred Resource status for the distal blocks.

Parent cell estimation at License 5 (25 m blocks) was applied to the sub-cells (down to a minimum of 6.25 m blocks).

## 17.2.6 Validation, Bias and Block Model Grade Distributions

The sparse drilling data in all areas led to the smearing of available grades within the mineralized  zones,  in  order  to  populate  all  blocks.  It  was  also  noted  that  there  had been smoothing of grade distribution data during the estimation process.

It  is  considered that the block estimates for the Lower mineralized zone at License 5 are appropriate at the current level of resource estimation confidence (Table 17-5).

For  the  Pentagon  License,  a  considerable  amount  of  low  grade  material  had  been removed from the block model by eliminating the mining depletion. Higher and more uniform Zn grades at depth have had a significant influence on the sparser data closer to surface during the grade estimation routine. As a result, the block model average grade is unduly elevated.

## 17.2.7 Resource Classification

On  License  5,  due  to  sparse  data  and  the  absence  of  variographic  continuity,  the Mineral Resource is limited to the Inferred category.

On  the  Pentagon  License,  due  to  a  lack  of  a  reliable  topographic  surface,  low confidence in the correlation between drillholes as well as a lack of collar surveys, the

Mineral  Resource  is  therefore  classified  in  the  Inferred  category,  but  is  considered non-code compliant.

## 17.2.8 Resource Reporting

NI 43-101-compliant Inferred Mineral Resources were declared for the two mineralized zones  at  License  5.  The  resources  are  reported  at  various  cut  offs  (Table  17-6  to Table 17-7). These include resources in each grade cut off category yielding greater than  10,000  tonnes.  Combined  resources  for  License  5  for  the  Lower  and  Upper mineralized zones are also shown in Table 17-8.

Grade-tonnage curves are presented in Figure 17-14 to Figure 17-16 to (License 5) and Figure 17-17 (Pentagon).

## 18 OTHER RELEVANT DATA AND INFORMATION

RCR plan to undertake initial mining within the HZP via a number of small open pits (estimated  at  5),  pending  the  results  of  ongoing  exploration  and  mineral  resource development.  This  is  likely  to  account  for  only  a  relatively  small  proportion  of  the ultimate  resource  base  on  the  HZP.  Alternatives  for  cost  effective  transfer  of  ROM material from the open pits to the road elevation of the valley will be addressed in a pre-feasibility/bankable feasibility study (PFS/BFS). The open pit stripping ratio cut off is  estimated  to  be  approximately  10  to  1.  The  bulk  of  the  material  will  in  future  be mined via suitable underground mining methods based on the dip, orebody thickness, and other factors.

Given the rugged terrain and mineralization outcropping at higher elevations, access to defined orebodies will probably be via numerous adits from suitable positions. Both the hanging-wall and footwall to mineralization on the licenses comprise very competent strata which should result in favourable mining conditions. However, the orebody itself appears  to  be  weathered  and  incompetent  and  this  will  be  factored  into  the  mine planning.  Observed  thicknesses  of  zinc-lead  mineralization  are  in  the  order  of  2 m. However,  based  on  information  obtained  from  surrounding  small-scale  mines,  the orebody width could increase to 10 m in some areas. This will positively impact on the cost  of  mining.   In  shallow  dipping  areas  the  ore  can  be  mined  via  mechanical  bord and pillar type mining or extraction with alternative support options (including possible cemented fill). Steeply dipping mineralized zones  i.e. +55 degrees could be mined via various mining methods relatively easily. The most appropriate mining method options will be identified during the PFS/BFS.

Over and above the zinc-lead potential of the HZP, a copper-bearing vein system is developed  immediately  north  of  license  7  and  is  reported  to  extend  onto  license  7. Exploration potential other than zinc plays therefore exists on the HZP, and should be investigated through systematic exploration.

## 19 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS

The non-sulphide zinc-lead deposits and occurrences within the Hakkari project area are  considered  to  represent  supergene  weathered  derivatives  of  primary  Mississippi Valley  Type  (MVT)  zinc-lead  sulphide  deposits.  These  deposits  and  occurrences extend intermittently over an east-west strike distance of approximately 60 km, and are hosted within a platform carbonate sequence preserved on the northern margin of the Arabian Platform within a fold and thrust belt known as the Border Folds.

In comparison, a series of carbonate-hosted mixed oxide-sulphide zinc-lead deposits are known from the 1 600 km long Zagros fold and thrust belt located in adjacent Iran. The Zagros belt represents the lateral extension of the Border Folds terrane in southeastern  Turkey.  The  most  notable  deposit  within  the  Zagros  belt  is  the  high  grade oxide-sulphide  Angouran  operation.  The  existence  of  this  zinc-lead  belt  represents further  evidence  for  the  potential  to  define  a  number  of  potentially  significant  and economic  oxide  and  mixed  oxide-sulphide  zinc-lead  deposits  in  south-eastern  and southern Turkey.

Although stratabound on a regional scale, deposit-scale mineralization in the Hakkari area is localized by geological features such as reef complexes, breccias, paleokarsts, depositional margins near carbonate-shale contacts, and faults. Within these settings, mineralization  ranges  from  zones  of  massive  replacement,  to  open  space  filling  of breccias  and  fractures,  to  disseminated  clusters  that  occupy  primary  pore  space. Mineralization occurs as both stratabound and cross-cutting highly irregular zones with consequent complex geometries. High grade smithsonite, hemimorphite and hydrozincite  dominant  zones  can  be  distinguished  from  more  iron-rich  and  variably leached lower grade zones. The iron content varies significantly both within the district and  on  a  deposit  scale,  ranging  from  iron-poor  zinc  gossans,  to  low-Fe  high-Zn smithsonite dominant zones to leached and high-Fe gossanous zones.  Results of the 2010 drilling program show  conclusively that mineralisation occurs in multiple mineralized  zones  over  greater  widths  than  initially  anticipated  and  confirms  fieldbased  observations  of  several  mineralized  horizons.    These  multiple  mineralized horizons are considered primary and, as such, extend the prospective portion of the stratigraphic sequence.

Recent  small-scale  mining has  focussed  on  high-grade  mineralization,  as  was confirmed  by  an  SGS  inspection  in  December  2007  of  3  stockpiles  comprising 12 400 tonnes at grades between 20-27% Zn and 4.5-7.3% Pb. According to RCR and the Seyitoğlu family, at least 400 000  tonnes  of  non-sulphide  zinc  ore  at an approximate  average  grade  of  25%  Zn  and  4%  Pb  has  been  mined  from  the  area between Licenses 5 and 8, 9, 10 over the past 5 years, and sold in an un-beneficiated state.  Of  this  tonnage,  approximately  85 000  tonnes  was  mined  from  five  small operations in 2009 (Schaffalitzky, 2009).

Although the region is known for small-scale mining, there has to date been little to no modern  systematic  exploration  on  a  larger  scale  aimed  at  defining  code-compliant

<!-- image -->

Mineral Resources and Reserves. Minor investigations, including drilling of two holes, was undertaken by Teck Cominco, however no records are currently available.  The maiden resource estimation for License 5 therefore represents the first code-compliant resource estimation for the district.  The stated resource of 2.4 Mt (0.5% Zn cutoff) at 1.92%  Zn  and  0.54%  Pb  is  considered  significant  given  that  the  2010  exploration program was not completed due to severe weather conditions and that the area tested by the program was known at the onset of activities to be of comparatively low grade but  was  prioritised  due  to  ease  of  access  for  drill-rig  mobilisation.    Significant  strike lengths of potentially higher grade material have been delineated from mapping and grab sampling activities on License 5 and will be prioritised for drill testing during the 2011 exploration season.

Despite  the  limitations  of  the  non-compliant  estimation  on  the  Pentagon,  the  noncompliant estimate of 198 kt (0.5% Zn cutoff) at 10.53% Zn, 1.11% Pb and 14.73 g/t Ag  demonstrates  the  existence  of  significant  high-grade  mineralisation  on  RCR's licenses with grades comparable with globally significant MVT deposits and with known zinc oxide deposits in the region.  Further work will be required to upgrade the tonnage of these resources.  Metallurgical studies carried out by RCR indicate the viability of gravitationally upgrading 7.5% Zn ROM to &gt; 22% Zn.

Furthermore, significant, shallow-dipping down-dip extension of the Pentagon mineralisation is interpreted to extend southwards towards License 8 and is apparently contiguous  with  mineralisation  currently  being  mined  by  another  operator  (Ismet Olmez)  to  the  west.  Owing  to  the  distribution  of  high  grade  zones  within  an  overall east-west striking mineralized unit, future formal mining operations by RCR may take the form of multiple variably sized operations with a mobile concentration plant.

The  various  licenses  in  which  RCR  has  an  interest  contain  numerous  zinc-lead opportunities, and represent a sizeable land position covering approximately 15 000 ha.  The  tested  parts  (License  5  and  The  Pentagon)  of  RCR's  mineral  rights holdings constitute significantly less than 1% of their total holdings and the potential for delineating additional compliant resources is considered significant.

## 20 RECOMMENDATIONS

Further exploration activities on the HZP should focus on achieving RCR's corporate objectives at Hakkari which aim to prove in excess of 10 Mt of zinc oxide ore at a Zn equivalent grade of 15%.  Furthermore, RCR aim to have in excess of 30% of their resources classified in the Indicated category.

In  order  to  attain  these  objectives  it  is  recommended  that  the  resource  definition programs embarked upon in 2010 are continued on both License 5 and The Pentagon. MSA  considers  it  optimal  for  these programs  to  run  concurrently  and  specific recommendations are documented below.

## 20.1 License 5

The planned drilling program not completed in 2010 should be completed, with the aim of  upgrading  a  part  of  the  declared  Inferred  Resource  to  Indicated  status.    It  is considered that this can be achieved with approximately 500-800 m of drilling which will allow  for  better  resolution  of  grade  continuity.    Furthermore,  anomalous  IP responses identified during the IP survey remain unresolved and should be drill tested in  order  to  determine  the  source  of  these  responses  and  the  potential  for  sulphidehosted mineralisation at depth below the current defined oxide-hosted resource.

The two steeply dipping mineralized zones (in the northeast  and west of License 5) should be mapped out fully to constrain their extent and be subjected to a systematic trench and  channel  sampling  exercise. The  most  significant consideration to advancing the exploration program in these areas is the development of safe access tracks in extremely mountainous terrain that will be required for drill rig mobilisation. Road development is considered a priority activity.  These steeply dipping zones have returned amongst the highest grab sample grade values to date and their systematic exploration should be prioritised.

## 20.2 The Pentagon

Geological  mapping  strongly  suggests  the  southward  flattening  of  the  mineralized horizon towards License 8.  As such, the south facing slope from the current mining highwall southwards to the Zap River valley approximates a dip slope with significant potential for comparatively shallow (&lt;100 m) continuation of mineralisation.  Sampling results  to  date  suggest  significantly  higher  grades  on  The  Pentagon  compared  to License  5  and  this  program  should  be  fast-tracked.    The  topographic  survey  of  the mining  area  should  be  completed  in  order  to  upgrade  the  Pentagon  resource estimation to a code-compliant estimation.  Drilling on the dip slope should allow for rapid  delineation  of  a  code-compliant  resource  at  confidence  levels  greater  than inferred resource status.

## 20.3 Other licenses

RCR  has  11  exploration  licenses  which  require  extension  during  the  2011  season. MSA  recommends  that  reconnaissance  mapping  in  undertaken  on  these  Licenses using  the  outcomes  of  the  remote  sensing  exercise  to  guide  mapping  activities. Furthermore, trenching should be undertaken on mapped mineralisation. Amendments  to  the  Turkish  Minerals  Act  require  the  declaration  of  an  inferred resource as part of the extension and MSA recommends the deployment of a reverse circulation  (RC)  rig  to  these  licenses  to  rapidly  assess  potential  after  trenching activities.

## 20.4 General recommendations

-  The RCR laboratory protocol must be revised to accommodate larger, variably sized batches.  This would allow for the inclusion of additional CRM's within each batch allowing for better QAQC monitoring and potentially negating the need for the rejection and re-assay of an entire batch on the basis of a single failed CRM sample.
-  The  value  added  by  geophysical  survey  techniques  should  be  assessed  as  a priority.  To date, these IP surveys have failed to show significant correlation with mineralisation  intersected  in  boreholes,  most  likely  due  to  the  oxide-  and carbonate-hosted nature of the mineralisation.  Furthermore, sphalerite, the most likely sulphide to be present is not known to be well-resolved by IP work.  While the  recommendations  made  regarding  testing  deeper  IP  targets  on  License  5 stand, should this drill testing prove unsuccessful it is recommended that the IP program be discontinued.
-  A  preliminary  financial  modelling  exercise  should  be  applied  to  the  data  to determine  to  what  mining  depths  (and  stripping  ratios)  the  potential  revenues support  economic  extraction,  as  well  as  indicate  the  likelihood  of  additional drilling adding value to each of the license areas tested during 2010.
-  The  use  of  zinc-scouts,  sourced  from  the  local  community  and  equipped  with GPS  units  and  cameras  is  strongly  recommended.    Reconnaissance-scale scouting and sampling of areas where access is a challenge will optimise more detailed mapping and sampling programs that are aimed at defining drill targets.
-  All drillhole  sitings  are  preceded  by  detailed  geological  mapping,  structural interpretation and trenching
-  Multiple drill-rigs are deployed to the HZP in order to fast-track progress
-  All core-drilling should be oriented in order to allow for better structural resolution in an extremely structurally disturbed area
-  Further  structural  work  should  be  carried  out  to  confirm  structural  controls  on mineralisation  and  then  use  this  as  a  predictive  tool  for  further  exploration  to

<!-- image -->

identify  extensions  to  the  mineralized  horizons.    Preliminary  observations  on License  5  suggest  that  wider  and  higher-grade  mineralisation  is  present  along fold hinges and that this attenuates on the limbs.

-  RCR  must  implement  a  suitable  methodology  for  bulk  density  determination. MSA recommends an in-situ volume replacement method is used on exposed mineralized outcrops in the field.
-  RCR need to take cognisance of the effect that the construction of hydropower dams in  the  lower  reaches  of  the  Zap  river  valley  will  have  on  potential  mine waste disposal locations.
-  Prioritisation of activities on License 26, which has good infrastructure, is located close to Hakkari and has been actively mined in the past

The  recommended  work  program  and  budget  is  in  line  with  the  RCR  exploration budget for 2011 on the HZP.

-  Drilling of fans from each collar position to maximise the number of intersections that  are  derived  from  a  single  drill  pad,  minimising  road  development  and allowing for enhanced structural resolution of the mineralisation
-  Completion  of  the  2010  infill  drilling program  on  License  5  that  was  not completed due to inclement weather and associated access problems

-  Issuance of a maiden, code-compliant resource

## 20.4.4 Other licenses

RCR  have  11  exploration  licenses  which  are  due  for  renewal/extension  within  the forthcoming exploration season. MSA recommends that a combination of reconnaissance mapping and sampling, detailed mapping and sampling, geophysics and  RC  drilling  be  undertaken  on  each  of  these  licenses  during  the  forthcoming exploration season in order for:

-  Apply for the required extensions or;
-  Relinquish licenses with limited potential.

## I. INTRODUCTION

This Report contains the results of the legal review conducted by Cakmak Avukatlik Burosu in connection with the status of the Licenses. It is not a legal opinion and does not contain specific legal advice on the matters covered.

This Report is addressed to RCR Seyitoglu and may not be relied on by any other person.  No responsibility, liability or duty of care is or will be accepted by Cakmak Avukatlik Burosu to any other party.

The legal review has been undertaken on the following basis:

- a. We have reviewed, and accordingly this Report is based only on, the documents which are provided by the governmental authorities and are available to public.
- b. We  have  relied upon  information provided by third parties, including various departments, in response to searches made, or caused to be made, and enquiries by us and have relied upon that information, including the results of searches, being accurate, current and complete as at the date of its receipt by us.
- c. References  in  the  Section  III  are  taken  from  details  shown  on  the  searches  we  have obtained from the Mining Department.
- d. We have not undertaken independent surveys for the lands subject to the Licenses to verify the accuracy of the status of the lands and permits. We have not reviewed those matters which are normally the subject of investigation by environmental consultants, insurance specialists, immovable  asset  specialists, engineering, structural or soil specialists, any operational or technical matters.

We report only as to the laws of Turkey and express no opinion and accept no responsibility as  to  the  law  of  any  other  jurisdiction  or  in  respect  of  any  documents,  agreements  or arrangements that may be subject to, or may be construed in accordance with, any such law.

## II. MINING LICENSES

## 1. General

Pursuant to the relevant provisions of the Turkish Constitution and the Mining Legislation, 'mines'  are  subject  to  the  exclusive  ownership  and  disposition  of  the  State  and  are  not considered  part  of  the  land  where  they  are  located.    Under  the  Mining  Legislation,  State delegates its right to explore and operate the mines to individuals or legal entities for specific periods by issuing licenses subject to payment of a royalty to the State.

## 2. Legislation

Mining regime is mainly governed by the Mining Law and the Mining Regulation.

The Amendment to the Mining Law was published in the Official Gazette on 24 June 2010 to regulate the details of the permitting process in the law and to amend the other provisions of the Mining Law.

For the purposes of this Report, references to Mining Law shall cover Mining Law as by the Amendment, however references will also be made to the relevant provisions of the Mining Law before the Amendment since the Licenses have been obtained prior to the Amendment.

## 3. Mining Licenses

## a. License Holders

Article 6 of the Mining Law clearly sets forth that the mining rights may only be given to either  Turkish  citizens  or  legal  entities  established  under  Turkish  laws.    Accordingly,  only Turkish  citizens,  who  are  entitled  to  use  their  civil  rights,  and  the  companies  established under Turkish laws specifically for mining purposes are entitled to hold mining rights.

Under  Turkish  Law,  foreign  persons  and  companies  domiciled  abroad  may  establish  a company  in  Turkey.  Companies  that  are  established  in  Turkey  with  foreign  capital  are deemed Turkish companies subject to the provisions of the TCC.  Therefore, they are entitled to hold mining rights.

## b. License Types

The  Mining  Law  divides  minerals  into  six  groups  and  separately  details  the  licensing procedures for each group of minerals.  The groups can be summarized as follows:

- i) sand and gravel [Group I(a)] and clay tile, cement tile or marl [Group I(b)];
- ii) grounded forms of stones such as calcite, limestone, granite [Group II (a)] and block stones or decorative stones such as marble, granite, travertine [Group II (b)];
- iii) salts in solution form that can be obtained from sea, lake and spring waters [Group III];
- iv) energy, metal and industrial minerals (including metals such as gold, silver, copper, brass…etc.) [Group IV];
- v) precious metals and gem stones [Group V]; and
- vi) radioactive minerals and other radioactive substances [Group VI].

The Mining Department is the authorized body to determine and announce the group of a mine,  which  is  not  listed  in  the  Mining  Legislation.    The  Mining  Law  provides  for 'certificate' to be issued only to the fifth group of minerals and 'license' to be issued to the other remaining groups.

- (i) Exploration License/Certificate.  The first step for the companies willing to engage in mining activities in Turkey would be to apply for an exploration license or certificate, as the case  may  be.    The  right  of  priority  is  essential  in  applications,  which  is  determined  in accordance with the date of application.  The exploration license is granted to the mine right holder by the Mining Department in accordance with the area limitations stated in the Mining Legislation  (for  example,  the  license  area  of  Group  IV  minerals  may  not  exceed  2000 hectares).  The exploration license is a certificate granting an authority for exploration of a mineral within the determined area.

The exploration license has three-stages, as follows:

- 1) ' Pre-exploration period ' is the first year after the issuance of the exploration license.
- 2) ' General exploration period ' is the period of two years for Group IV mines and one year for other groups starting from the expiration of the pre-exploration period.
- 3) ' Detailed Exploration Period ' (for Group IV and VI mines only) is the period of four years starting from the expiration of the general exploration period.

The exploration licenses obtained prior to the Amendment shall be subject to the previous regime,  where  an  exploration  license  is  granted  for  three-year  term  and  the  term  of  the exploration license may be extended for certain mines (i.e. Group IV) for another two years. If  the  license  holder  fails  to  conduct  sufficient  exploration  activities  within  the  three-year period, the license will be terminated.

A license granted for a certain group of mine does not create any right for the mines in other groups.  Thus, a separate license will be required to mine a separate group of mine within such  license  area.    However,  other  groups  of  mines  extracted  as  a  result  of  the  mining operations, may be extracted and produced with prior consent of the Mining Department.

The  license  holder  shall  be  considered  as  the  finder  of  the  mines  (notified  to  the  Mining Department in its technical reports) and will be entitled to 1% of the pit-head sale if the mine shall be operated by a third party.

The  operation  license  shall  only  be  given  to  the  exploration  license  holders.    If  the exploration license holder fails to apply for an operation license at the end of the license term, the exploration license shall be terminated and the security deposit shall be forfeited.

An exploration license holder is obliged to undertake certain obligations as required by the Mining Legislation.  These obligations can be summarized as follows:

- a) Duties and Security Deposit: The annual duty for 2010 is TL 544.25.  A security in the amount of 1% of the annual duty (which is TL 5.45 for 2010) times the hectare of such license must be deposited as a security for each license, which may not be less than TL 10,000.00.  The Council of Ministers is authorized to increase or decrease this rate by

50%.  In the event that the security deposit is registered as income or certain deductions are  made  pursuant  to  the  Mining  Law,  the  license  holder  must  deposit  the  deficient amount within three months.  If the license holder fails to deposit the deficient amount (which  shall  be  doubled  in  each  late  payment)  within  the  determined  period,  then  a second period of three months will be granted.  If the license holder fails to deposit such amount within the second period as well, the mining activities shall be ceased.  If the license  holder  fails  to  deposit  the  deficient  amount  by  the  end  of  the  subsequent  six months, the license shall be terminated.

The security deposit prior to the Amendment was equal to 0.3% of the annual license fee per hectare depending on the licensing stage and the term of license which was TL 1.64 for 2010.

- b) Submission of Documents: By the end of pre-exploration period, general exploration period  and  by  the  end  of  each  year  during  the  detailed  exploration  period,  a  report, including information regarding the mine reserve and investment expenditures made for the  exploration  activities  shall  be  submitted  to  the  Mining  Department.    Failure  to submit such report shall result in forfeiture of the security deposit and the cancellation of the exploration license.
- The license holder may, upon approval of the Mining Department, sell 10% of the mine reserve.  In such case, the license holder (like an operation license holder) must, by the end of April of each year, submit to the Mining Department all technical documents, sales  information  form,  and  activity  information  form  relating  to  its  operational activities  of  the  previous  year.    If  the  license  holder  fails  to  comply  with  this requirement,  the  security  deposit  will  be  forfeited  and  the  mining  activities  will  be ceased until satisfaction of this obligation.
- (ii) Operation License.  Before the end of the exploration license period, the license holder shall  apply  for  an  operation  license.    License  applications  made  through  post  will  not  be accepted by the Mining Department.  The individuals or legal entities will be entitled to an operation license by making an application.  Operation license is an instrument granting the license  holder  the  right  to  operate  a  mine  under  the  Mining  Legislation.    The  operation license is granted to the mining right holder by the Mining Department.

Term of an operation license for Group I (a) minerals may not be less than five years and for other  groups  may  not  be  less  than  ten  years  whereas  the  term  of  an  operation  certificate (issued  for Group  V)  may  not  be  less  than  five  years.    The  term  of  an  operation license/certificate  may  be  extended  under  certain  conditions  stated  in  the  Mining  Law. However  the  period  of  the  license  may  not  exceed  sixty  years  starting  from  the  date  of license.    The  Council  of  Ministers  is  authorized  to  extend  the  term  after  the  end  of  sixty years.  The extension duty for 2010 is TL 1,361.65.

The license  holder  may  continue  exploration  activities  during  the  operation  period.    If  the license holder fails to identify the mine reserves within five years (for Group IV mines) and three years (for other groups) upon issuance of the license, the license area shall be divided.

An operation  license  holder  is  obliged  to  undertake  certain  obligations  as  required  by  the Mining Legislation.  These obligations can be summarized as follows:

- a) Duties and Security Deposit: This is same with the obligation of an exploration license holder summarized above.  For 2010, annual duties are as follows:

| ANNUAL FEES FOR 2010          | ANNUAL FEES FOR 2010   |
|-------------------------------|------------------------|
| LICENSE                       | AMOUNT IN TL           |

| Up to 15 years (including 15) | 3,814.10               |
| Up to 40 years (including 40) | 5,499.25               |
| Up to 60 years (including 60) | 8,283.75               |
| 61-99 years (For each year)   | 10,899.55              |

For 2010, the security amounts per hectare are as follows:

| SECURITY AMOUNTS PER HECTARE  FOR 2010   | SECURITY AMOUNTS PER HECTARE  FOR 2010   |
|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| LICENSE                                  | AMOUNT IN TL                             |
| Up to 10 years (including 10)            | 32.70                                    |
| Up to 15 years (including 15)            | 38.15                                    |

- b) Submission of Documents: The operation license holder must, by the end of April of each year, submit to the Mining Department all technical documents, sales information form; and activity information form relating to its operational activities of the previous year.    In  the  case  exploration  activities  are  carried  out  within  the  license  area,  the exploration data and information must be submitted to the Mining Department.  If the license  holder  fails  to  comply  with  this  requirement,  the  security  deposit  will  be forfeited and the mining activities will be ceased until satisfaction of this obligation.
- c) Royalty:  The license holder must pay a royalty to be collected over the extracted mines in the rates provided below over the pit-head sale price ( ocak basi satis tutari) .

The royalty will be levied by an addition of 30% for the mining activities conducted on the  State  owned  lands.    If  the  state-owned  land  in  use  has  a  forest  status,  then  the royalty shall be paid directly to the Forestry General Directorate.  For forest areas of more than 5 hectares, license-holders will pay the requisite forest fees but will not be obliged to pay the additional 30% royalty.

The Mining Legislation provides an advantage to the license holders of not paying 50% of  the  royalty  if  the  extracted  ores  are  processed  in  Turkey  to  provide  an  additional value to the Turkish economy.  However, license holders of Group I mines are excluded from this advantage.  The Amendment also brings a new incentive which provides that 50% of the royalty shall not be paid for the Group IV(c) mines processed into metals in Turkey. The provision however excludes gold, silver and platinum mines. Accordingly,  gold  may  not  benefit  from  this  incentive  even  if  it  is  processed  into  a metal  in  Turkey.    However,  in  light  of  the  above  mentioned  incentive  which  is applicable for all groups except Group I mines, gold mines qualifying for this incentive shall still benefit from this.

25% of the royalty deposited by the license holder to the Mining Department will be paid and credited to the provincial administration of the relevant city as the provincial administration's  share,  25%  will  be  provided  to  the  Organization  of  Service  to  the Villages account for infrastructure investments and 50% will be credited to the account of  the  Treasury.    The  MENR  may  request  the  accounts  of  license  holders  to  be approved by a chartered accountant in terms of state royalties.

A royalty amount of 10% of the projected production amount in the project report shall be deposited by the license holder for each year of non-production.

- d) Declaration: All written declarations on technical and financial matters and all reports issued by authorized companies under the Mining Legislation shall be deemed final and true.    The  license  holders  shall  be  held  responsible  for  the  accuracy  of  all  of  their declarations  other  than  the  technical  matters.    If  a  license  holder  fails  to  correct  any error or causes any deficiency in declarations within two months upon being warned by the Mining Department, the security deposit shall be registered as income.  If a license holder  makes  untrue  or  misleading  statements  (which  are  listed  in  the  Mining Regulation),  its  security  deposit  will  be  forfeited  and  the  security  amount  to  be deposited again will be doubled.  In the event that the license holder does not comply with such declaration obligation three times within three years, the security deposit will be  forfeited  and  the  license  will  be  terminated.    Occasions  of  false  declaration  and unjust  benefit  are  provided  under  the  Law,  such  as  unpermitted  production  of  mines, avoiding  to  declare  production,  use  of  expropriated  land  for  other  purposes.    The technical supervisor is held responsible professionally for deficient declarations.
- e) Engineer  for  Record:  The  operation  license  holder  must  employ  at  least  one  mining engineer as a technical supervisor ( teknik nezaretci ) for supervision of mine extraction activities.  Project companies (i) employing at least 15 workers; and (ii) operating the mine  with  underground  production  method,  are  obliged  to  employ  at  least  one permanent technical supervisor.  In the event that mine production activities are carried out  without  supervision  of  an  engineer,  the  security  deposit  will  be  forfeited  and  the mining activities will be ceased.  Upon employment of an engineer and upon renewal of the security deposit, the mining activities may be resumed.

The  documents  displaying  that  a  technical  supervisor  has  been  employed  in  the previous  year  shall  be  submitted  to  the  Mining  Department  by  April  each  year.  Non compliance  with  this  obligation  shall  result in the same  consequences  as  false declaration, as explained above.  The technical supervisor is obliged to keep records as provided under the Mining Legislation.  In case of incompliance, this will be notified to the technical supervisor, and if repeated, will result in administrative fees to the license holder and will be considered as deficient declaration as explained above.

- f) Inspection  and  Supervision:  The  Mining  Department  has  the  authority  to  inspect  and supervise  all  technical  and  financial  aspects  of  the  mining  activities,  utilization  of mining  rights  and  fulfillment  of  mining  obligations.    If,  upon  inspection,  the  Mining Department  determines  inaccurate  or  misleading  declarations,  the  provisions  of  the Mining Law applicable to misleading and deficient declarations of license holders (as stated above), shall apply.
- g) Application  for Environmental  Permits:  Pursuant  to  the  Mining  Regulation,  the necessary permits shall be obtained in accordance with the relevant legislation for the areas on which mining activities are performed.  Otherwise the security deposit will be forfeited and the production will be ceased.
- h) Operation Permit: For the apparent/ proven reserve areas with an exploration license, an operation permit will be granted, following the issuance of the necessary environmental permits.    Operation  permit  can  only  be  assigned  or  transferred  by  the  transfer  of  the underlying operation license.
- Different  mines  may  be  operated  within  one  operation  license  area.    Activities concerning each operation permit covered by an operation license shall be carried out separately.  In other words, separate operation permits need to be obtained for different mines within the same area covered by the operation license.  Operation license covers the area in which the mining activities will be conducted and gives the legal right to use the  license  area,  whereas  the  operation  permit  gives  the  license  holder  the  right  to operate the mine.
- The  Mining  Legislation  does  not  regulate  the  duration  of  the  operation  permit. However in practice the duration of the operation permit is limited with the duration of the underlying operation license.
- i) Commissioning to Operation: The operation permit holder is obliged to commission the mine within one year upon the date of receipt of the operation permit.  Failure to start operation within the one-year period or mine production of less than 10% of the annual production quantity indicated in the operation project, is subject to a penalty of 10% royalty  on  the  projected  production  quantity  for  each  year  in  which  there  is  no operation.    Further,  licenses  under  which  the  relevant  mine  is  not  operated  for  more than  three  years  within  a  period  of  five  years,  except  for  force  majeure  events  and unexpected events, will be terminated and the license security thereof will be forfeited. In  case  the  production  made  during  such  three  years  is  less  than  10%  of  the  annual production  quantity  indicated  in  the  operation  project,  then  the  security  deposit  shall also be forfeited and the license shall be terminated.

## 4. Temporary Suspension of the Mining Operations

Temporary  suspension  is  a  special  type  of  force  majeure  under  the  Mining  Law,  and  it

provides  a  right  to  the  license  holders  to  suspend  mining  activities  due  to  force  majeure events,  without  having  their  licenses  cancelled.    In  cases  of  force  majeure  and  unexpected events, the Mining Department is authorized to issue a decision of temporary suspension of the  mining  operations  of  the  license,  upon  the  application  of  the  license  holder.    Force majeure  events  are  described  in  the  Mining  Regulation  as 'floods,  fires,  earthquakes, firedamp explosion, subsidence and landslide' .  The events included herein are not limited in number, and other cases may also be considered as force majeure or unexpected events.

A temporary suspension shall commence on the date of the application of the license holder and may be issued for a maximum period of one year.  The temporary suspension may be renewed  upon  the  application  of  the  license  holder;  there  is  no  limit  as  to  the  number  of renewals.  However, operation shall commence within three months following the cease of the force majeure or unexpected event, or the end of the temporary suspension period.

Temporary suspension periods do not interfere with the period of the operation license, i.e. shall be included in the calculation of the license period.  However, a temporary suspension of mining operations shall freeze other time limitations set forth under the Mining Law.  For example,  the  Mining  Law  regulates  that,  in  the  event  that  a  license  is  not  operated  for  a period  of  three  years,  within  five  years,  the  security  deposit  shall  be  confiscated  and  the license shall be cancelled, except force majeure events and unexpected events.

## 5. Merging of License Areas

As per the Mining Regulation, adjacent licenses, in the same group, and at the same stage can be merged.  The area resulting from the merger cannot be greater than the area boundary limit of which is determined in the Mining Law .  However, should the license areas pose a unity; 2 a merger application can be made by presenting a new operation project.  Area limitation is not sought for in approved applications.  The duration of the new license resulting from the merger  is  of  the  license  with  the  shortest  duration  among  those  being  merged  and  any restrictions and penalties incurred on separate licenses shall continue to be effective on the new license.

## 6. Transfer of Licenses

The mining license may be transferred to the qualified persons under Article 6 of the Mining Law only with the affirmative opinion of the Mining Department.  Pursuant to Article 6 of the  Mining  Law,  Turkish  citizens  and  the  companies  established  under  Turkish  laws  for mining purposes are entitled to hold mining rights.

Neither the Mining Law nor the Mining Regulation sets forth any explanation as to what kind of legal objections that the Mining Department may raise for not approving the transfer of mining  rights.    In  practice  mining  licenses  may  be  transferred  to  the  ones  qualified  under Article 6 of the Mining Law without any difficulty.  The transferee becomes the holder of the mining license after the transfer of the license in question and assumes all obligations and rights granted by the Mining Legislation.

The transferee is obliged to deposit a new security for the license in question and a transfer fee equal to the amount of the annual license fee.  The security deposit paid by the transferor will be returned to the transferor upon transfer.

## 7. Royalty Agreements

The royalty agreement is a kind of agreement which the mining license holder grants the right of  operation  of  its  mine  to  the  operator  based  on  its  mining  license  for  a  certain  period  in exchange of a royalty payment.  However, such agreement does not result in the legal transfer of the mining license.  The royalty agreement evidences that the right of the operation of the subject matter mine has been granted to the operator for the term of the royalty agreement. The  Mining  Law  does  not  require  registration  of  the  royalty  agreement  at  the  Mining Department. Accordingly, the royalty agreement shall operate to bind its parties contractually but shall not evidence third parties that the right of the operation of the subject matter mine has been granted to the operator for the term of the royalty agreement.

## 8. Termination, Abandonment of Licenses

An exploration or operation license may be terminated on grounds of incompliance with the obligations  provided  under  the  Mining  Law,  or  the  termination  of  the  term  of  the  subject mining license.

Upon  termination,  expiration  or  abandonment  of  an  operation  license,  all  assets  will  be transferred to the State; the license area will be automatically opened to new activities and the license will be tendered through public auctions.

Possible  outcomes  or  liabilities  arising  out  of  abandoned  or  terminated  licenses  can  be summarized as follows:

Financial Obligations : Financial obligations under the Mining Law include the license fees, the security deposit and the state royalty; and any other financial obligations arising from the nature of the mine, as the case may be.  The unpaid financial obligations of terminated or abandoned licenses shall be fulfilled from the security deposit.  If the security deposit is not sufficient  for  such  obligations,  then  the  Mining  Department  will  collect  the  remaining financial obligation, as a debt under the Law No. 6183 from the last owner of the license.

Environmental Obligations :  The license holder abandoning the license, or the holder of the terminated license, is liable  to  take  all  necessary  environmental  and  safety  measures  while leaving the license area.  The license holder shall take the measures and submit the necessary technical documents to the Mining Department within 6 months following the abandonment or termination.  This period can be extended for an additional 3 months.  In the event that the necessary measures are not taken, the measures shall be taken by the relevant Governorship, and the costs shall be reimbursed from the security deposit.  In the event that the security deposit is not sufficient, the Governorship will collect the remaining financial obligation, as a debt  under  Law  No.  6183  from  the  last  owner  of  the  license.    Environmental  obligations under the relevant legislation shall also be applicable.

Liabilities under General Principles : Under the general principles of Turkish Law, any real or  legal  person  shall  be  liable  to  compensate  damages  arising  out  of  its  wrongful  acts  or negligence or noncompliance of statutory obligations.  The general statute of limitation for torts is 1 year after the event of tort and person performing the tortuous act is learned and a maximum  period  of  10  years  starting  from  the  date  of  tortuous  act.    The  general  tort provisions  are  also  applicable  to  the  license  holder,  for  the  acts  or  negligence  conducted during the period which the license was held.

The penalties applicable to the license holder in case of the license holder's failure to operate the  mine  properly  or  in  the  event  license  holder  causes  any  error  or  deficiency  in  the operation  of  the  mine,  are  listed  in  the  Mining  Legislation  such  as  registering  the  security deposit as income and termination of the license.  However, further legal remedies (i.e. filing a lawsuit against the license holder for special performance or compensation) would also be available to the relevant administration (i.e. the MENR).

## 9. Exclusivity of Turkish Courts

Since minerals are subject to the exclusive ownership and disposition of the State, any matter relating  to  granting  or  transfer  of  any  kind  of  mining  right  is  exclusively  governed  by  the Mining Legislation.

Any matter including granting or transfer of a mining right and operation of mines are within the  exclusive  jurisdiction  of  Turkish  courts.    Since  exemption  to  the  jurisdiction  of  courts should be regulated clearly and not through analogy, we believe the jurisdiction of Turkish courts  over  the  mining  rights  are  exclusive.    Nevertheless,  contractual  obligations  of  the parties not relating to mining rights may be freely determined by the parties in accordance with the principle of freedom of contract.

18 March 2010

Mr M Robertson

c/o Red Crescent Resources

Turkey

## The Hakkari Zinc Deposit -A Review

##  Introduction

The author was requested by Mr D J Taylor, the CEO of Red Crescent Resources ( RCR )  to  give  a  review  of  their  desk  top  study  which  has  been  compiled  for  the Hakkari zinc mineral occurrence in SE Turkey.

##  The Study

The  study  was  conducted  on  four  batches  of  samples  sent  to  South  Africa  for evaluation and test work. The assaying was done by Set-Point and UIS Laboratories; the mineralogical investigations were carried out by SGS Laboratories and the test work  was  done  by  Tangmere  R&amp;D  and  Mintek.  Mike  Plaskitt,  a  professional metallurgist, coordinated all the work and compiled the reports.

##  Comments

## 1. Ore Quality and Variability

Ore  samples  varied  from  16.7%  to  42.95%  Zn  and  0.96%  to  14.1%  Pb.  The dominant  zinc  mineral  was  smithsonite  with  substantial  amounts  of  hemi-morphite present as well. Sphalerite content was minor. The lead mineral was cerrusite.

## 2. Gangue

The gangue consists of oxidised iron minerals, calcite, barite and quartz. The iron content  varied  from  0.15%  to  18.8%  and  is  essentially  goethite  and  siderite weathered into limonite.

<!-- image -->

## 3. Mineral Liberation Sizes

Smithsonite, hemi-morphite and cerrusite are relatively coarse grained and liberate between 220 and 380 micron. The goethite/limonite liberates at around 120 micron and the remaining gangue at about 200 micron.

## 4. Treatment Options Considered

Oxide  flotation  was  rejected  due  to  the  high  ore  grade,  inherent  inefficiencies  in oxide  flotation  as  well  as  likely  cost.  Gravity  concentration  techniques  considered were cyclone classification, spirals and shaking tables. Of these cyclone and spirals were deemed to have some potential as pre-concentrators and future work should be carried out. One may add dense medium separation techniques to this list. There is potential is such technologies but one should not be too optimistic in this regard. On the plus side they are relative inexpensive options.

The  iron  minerals  showed  no  response  to  magnetic  separation  attempts  and calcining test work conducted was not very useful. In the latter regard it may be more productive to fume the material in Waelz kilns. Waelz kiln fuming was at one stage very  popular  in  Eastern  European  Countries,  Russia  and  even  Japan.  In  these operations zinc/lead oxides, slags and tailings were successfully treated. The fume was sold to zinc refineries.

The RCR study decided that the direct leaching option, with diluted sulphuric acid, was the best option for treating the high grade Hakkari ore.

## 5. The Direct Acid Leach

Some detailed test work showed the following results:

-  Zinc dissolution was in excess of 90% with fast kinetics even in relatively weak acid solutions. Optimisation of these leaching conditions as well as some heating should push these dissolutions into the mid nineties. Very pleasing is the ready dissolution of hemi-morphite without any silica gelling indications! Sphalerite will, however, not leach under such conditions.
-  The 'weak' acid solution ( 15-20% sulphuric acid ) is the favoured option as less iron will be dissolved than if stronger acid solutions are used. This fits well with the spent electrolyte, usually, obtained in zinc electrowinning operations.
-  Leaching performed satisfactorily at ambient conditions; the stringent winter temperatures in Hakkari should, however, be taken into account. Steam should be made available to the leach and the purification plants.

<!-- image -->

-  The Study calculated the acid consumption to be about 30kg's per ton of ore treated. Lower ore grades could influence this estimate significantly.
-  Although no filtration problems were experienced it will be prudent to conduct the necessary settling and filtration tests in future test work specially when higher silica containing ores are leached.
-  It was surprising that the caustic soda leach conducted on the ores gave very poor dissolution results (30%). The caustic leach would have circumvented the iron removal problem.
-  Purification test work is not complete but should pose no serious problems. The technology is standard practise in the zinc electrowinning industry. It is important to oxidise the iron to the ferric state prior to neutralization. The ferric iron can then be removed in a variety of ways. Jarosite may be RCR's best option. The iron removal will assist in removing deleterious elements from the prospective electrolyte. It will, however, be necessary to check the purified solution for Cu, Co, Ni, Cd, Ge, As and Sb as these elements can seriously influence the plating of zinc. If detected these elements can be readily removed by cementation with zinc dust. Ion exchange is also a possibility for total solution purification but would have to be extensively tested specially for iron fouling of the resin. Whatever option is chosen good quality electrolyte is a prerequisite for decent electrowinning performance.
-  The environmental situation with the storage of acidic leach residues in Turkey is not known to the author but should be clarified.

## 6. Advantages of the Direct Leach Option

-  No or possibly little pre-concentration is required for this high grade ore.
-  Proven technology can be used throughout the design.
-  The capacity of the plant can easily be up-scaled to treat far larger tonnages.

## 7. Risks with the Direct Leach Option

-  Ore variability due to increased gangue. This could result in higher acid consumption in the leach and create potential filtration issues. Ore grade control in the mining division should be considered. Ore blending in the plant should also be part of the design.

.

## 8.Piloting

<!-- image -->

-  The Study conclusions are based on laboratory scale test work which will have to be verified in a pilot plant of a suitable size. This should be part of the feasibility study.

## 9 . Capex,  Opex  and Financials

-  The Capex and Opex for the 150000 tpa ROM case are based on likely Rand costs in South Africa and a specific plant, equipment and process point-ofview. Desk top studies of this type probably carry a 30% contingency. The Turkish equivalent costing model is not known to the author. It  should be understood that the technology can easily be up-scaled from a throughput point-of-view. Usage would then be made of economies of scale and fixed costs lowered accordingly.

Any by-product revenue, at this stage of the project, should be ignored.

## 10. Project Options

-  In evaluating this project it should be kept in mind that it may be financially advantageous to phase the project and to implement technology in stages. The following are possibilities:
- 1. Mine and sell ROM ore now. Approach ISF smelters in this regard.
- 2. Treat the ROM ore in a Waelz Kiln in Turkey or elsewhere and sell the zinc/lead fume to zinc refineries or Zn/Pb  smelters.
- 3. Produce LME grade zinc cathode and sell into the market. This would eliminate expensive melting and casting equipment.

## 11. Conclusions and Recommendations

-  The work carried by RCR under the supervision of Mike Plaskitt is of a high standard and although some detail and refinements need attention the correct choice of the direct leach option has been made. The direct leach includes conventional solution purification and electrowinning. Melting and casting into ingots would be the preferred choice if cathode cannot be sold directly.
-  The project has much appeal and potential and deserves more development. The focus should be on ore resource establishment and on ways of mining the deposit in the best possible way. Grade control is of the utmost importance to the direct leaching option.
