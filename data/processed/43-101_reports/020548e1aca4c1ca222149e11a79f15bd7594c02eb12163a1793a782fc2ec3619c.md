## Geological Setting and Mineralization

The syenite intrusion of Crater Lake is located in the Churchill Province. It intrudes or is coeval  with  the  southeast  end  of  the  Mistastin  Batholith,  which  covers  an  area  of approximately 5,000 km 2 . The dominant lithologies of the batholith are granite and quartz monzonite with pyroxene, which are cut by younger biotite-hornblende granite, which is in turn intruded by a smaller olivine syenite, the Crater Lake syenite. Uranium-lead dating of three zircons places the age of the batholith at approximately 1.4 Ga (Petrella 2011).

The Crater Lake syenites are interpreted to be a late differentiate product of the Mistastin Batholith.  The  dominant  exposed  lithology  is  coarse-  to  medium-grained,  massive syenite, which is mainly composed of perthitic K-feldspar and 1 to 10% by volume of interstitial ferromagnesian minerals (Petrella 2012). A magnetic and melanocratic unit, ferro-syenite, which commonly contains greater than 50% by volume of ferromagnesian minerals, occurs as large continuous to discontinuous subvertical and conical bodies, sills, narrow dikes and inclusions in the felsic syenites. Three large ferro-syenite bodies have  been  found  on  the  property:  TGZ,  Boulder  Lake  and  STG.  Petrella  (2012) interpreted the narrow ferro-syenite dikes as having formed by fractional crystallization of ferromagnesian minerals, leaving behind a residual magma that produced the felsic syenites. Assay results from surface samples and from 2014-2021 drill core indicate that the  different  types  of  ferro-syenite  are  the  main  host  to  the  scandium  and  REE mineralization at Crater Lake.

At  Crater  Lake,  scandium  was  enriched  in  the  residual  liquid  of  the  parent  Mistastin granite  magma  following  extensive  fractionation  of  feldspar,  in  which  scandium  is incompatible.  This residual  liquid  became the  Crater  Lake  quartz  monzonite magma, which was enriched in scandium and iron. Ring faults developed as a result of caldera collapse, and the magma and minerals were emplaced as a slurry into these faults. The ferro-syenite  formed  by in  situ fractionation  of  hedenbergite  crystals,  magnetite  and hastingsite, and their physical segregation with the previously crystallized minerals. The extremely high FeO/FeO+MgO content of the quartz monzonite liquid resulted in high partition coefficients for scandium  in  the  hedenbergite  and  hastingsite,  allowing scandium to be incorporated into these minerals at exceptionally high concentrations under magmatic conditions. The physical segregation of hedenbergite and hastingsite in ferro-syenite  cumulate  rocks  through  gravitational  settling  and/or  flow  differentiation spatially concentrated the Sc-bearing minerals within the intrusion, resulting in the first known scandium deposit hosted by syenite. (Beland, 2021).

The REE  mineralization is contained in small primary idiomorphic zircon and hydroxyapatite crystals (identified by XRD analysis). The latter locally form aggregates that were wholly or partly replaced by britholite-(Ce). Hydroxyapatite commonly occur as inclusions in pyroxene, amphibole and, less commonly, fayalite.

## Mineral Resource Estimates

The  mineral  resource  estimate  for  the  Crater  Lake  Project  (the  '2021  MRE')  was prepared by Marina Iund, P.Geo., Paul Daigle, P.Geo., and Carl Pelletier, P.Geo., using all available information.

The studied area covers the mineralized domains collectively known as the TGZ target.

The 2021 MRE was established for scandium, lanthanum, praseodymium, neodymium, terbium and dysprosium. Other REEs were not included in the estimate.

The resource area has a NE-SW strike length of 500 m, a width of 120 m, and a vertical extent of 250 m below the surface. The 2021 MRE was based on a compilation of recent diamond drill holes ('DDH') completed by the issuer.

The Surpac database contains all 25 DDH, which corresponds to all the holes drilled on the Project. The holes cover the strike length of the Project at a regular drill spacing of 50 m.

The geological model was modelled in Leapfrog. The main lithologies of the deposit are massive  syenite  ('SYN')  intruded  by  olivine  ferro-syenite  ('OLFESYN'),  four  (4) pyroxene  ferro-syenites  ('PXFESYN')  and  an  intermediate  syenite  ('INTSYN').  Later pegmatitic  dykes  ('PEG')  and  intermediate  porphyries  ('POM')  cut  all  units.  The OLFFESYN, PXFESYN and INTSYN solids were used as mineralized domains. These domains are subvertical with an NE-SW strike.

The  authors  believe  that  the  current  mineral  resource  estimate  can  be  classified  as Indicated and Inferred mineral resources based on geological and grade continuity, data density,  search  ellipse  criteria,  drill  hole  spacing  and  interpolation  parameters.  The authors  also  believe  that  the  requirement  of  'reasonable  prospects  for  eventual economic extraction' has been met by having a cut-off grade based on reasonable inputs amenable to a potential open-pit extraction scenario.

The  2021  MRE  is  considered  reliable  and  based  on  quality  data  and  geological knowledge. The estimate follows CIM Definition Standards.

The following table displays the results of the 2021 MRE for the Project at the official 110.8 C$/t NSR cut-off.

Notes to accompany the Mineral Resource Estimate:

- 1. The independent and qualified persons for the mineral resource estimate, as defined by NI 43 101, are Marina Iund, P.Geo. (InnovExplo Inc.), Paul Daigle, P.Geo. (InnovExplo Inc. associate) and Carl Pelletier, P.Geo. (InnovExplo Inc.). The effective date of the estimate is September 17, 2021.
- 2. These mineral resources are not mineral reserves, as they do not have demonstrated economic viability. The mineral resource estimate follows current CIM Definition Standards.
- 3. The results are presented in situ and undiluted and considered to have reasonable prospects of economic viability.
- 4. The estimate encompasses three mineralized domains using the grade of the adjacent material when assayed or a value of zero when not assayed.
- 5. High-grade capping supported by statistical analysis was done on raw assay data before compositing: La2O3 (3690 g/t), Pr2O3 (1380 g/t), Nd2O3 (2100 g/t), Dy2O3 (215 g/t). No capping was applied to Sc2O3 and Tb4O7.
- 6. The estimate was completed using a sub-block model in GEOVIA SURPAC 2021 with user block size of 5m x 5m x 5m and minimum block size of 1.25m x 1.25m x1.25m. Grades interpolation was obtained by ID2 using hard boundaries.
- 7. Bulk density values were applied by lithology (g/cm3): INTSYN, OLFESYN = 3.13; PXFESYN = 2.91; SYN = 2.7; POMSYN = 2.77; PEG = 2.63 and OB = 2.0.
- 8. The mineral resource estimate is classified as indicated and inferred. The Indicated mineral resource category is defined with a minimum of three (3) drill holes in areas where the drill spacing is less than 60 m, and reasonable geological and grade continuity have been demonstrated. The Inferred category is defined with a minimum of two (2) drill holes in areas where the drill spacing is less than 120 m, and reasonable geological and grade continuity have been demonstrated. Clipping boundaries were used for classification based on those criteria.
- 9. The mineral resource estimate is pit-constrained with a bedrock slope angle of 45° and an overburden slope angle of 30°. It is reported at a NSR cut-off of 110.8 C$/t .The NSR cut-off was calculated using the following parameters: processing cost = C$14.89; transportation cost (concentrate transportation from mine site to processing plant): C$7.19; refining and selling costs = C$ 88.71; Sc2O3 price = US$1,500/kg; La2O3 price = US$0.6/kg; Pr2O3 price = US$29/kg; Nd2O3 price = US$29/kg; Tb4O7 price = US$386/kg; Dy2O3 price = US$124/kg; USD:CAD exchange rate = 1.25; scandium recovery to high grade scandium oxide product = 76.0%; REE recovery to mixed REE carbonate = 63.0%. The cut-off grades should be re-evaluated in light of future prevailing market conditions (metal prices, exchange rates, mining costs etc.).
- 10. The number of metric tons was rounded to the nearest thousand, following the recommendations in NI 43 101 and any discrepancies in the totals are due to rounding effects.
- 11. The authors are not aware of any known environmental, permitting, legal, title-related, taxation, socio-political, or marketing issues, or any other relevant issue not reported in the Technical Report, that could materially affect the Mineral Resource Estimate.

## Interpretation and Conclusions

The authors conclude the following:

- · The database supporting the 2021 MRE is complete, valid and up to date.
- · The  geological  and  grade  continuity  of  scandium  and  REE  mineralization  in  the OLFESYN and PXFESYN domains has been demonstrated, supported by a 50-m drilling grid.
- · The  2021  MRE  is  classified  as  indicated  and  inferred  resources.  There  are  no measured resources.
- · The 2021 MRE was prepared for a potential open-pit scenario at an NSR cut-off of 110.80 C$/t.

The 2021 MRE for the TGZ target at the Crater Lake Project, at a 110.80 C$/t NSR cutoff grade, comprises:

- · Indicated Resource of 7,315,500 t grading 282 g/t Sc2O3, 66 g/t Dy2O3, 606 g/t La2O3, 596 g/t Nd2O3, 160 g/t Pr2O3, 12 g/t Tb4O7 equivalent to a 413 C$/t NSR
- · Inferred Resource of 13,158,400 t grading 264 g/t Sc2O3, 62 g/t Dy2O3, 569 g/t La2O3, 573 g/t Nd2O3, 154 g/t Pr2O3, 11 g/t Tb4O7 equivalent to a 386 C$/t NSR.

## Recommendations

Based on the results of the 2021 MRE, InnovExplo recommend that the Project move to an advanced phase of exploration, which would involve the preparation of a Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA) for the TGZ target.

InnovExplo recommends the following work program:

- · Complete a PEA.
- · Complete  a  4,000 m  drilling  program  on  the  southern  portion  of  the  TGZ  target (Sections  0N  to  350N)  and  at  depth  (sections  450N  and  500N).  The  goal  of  this program is to investigate the extensions of the TGZ mineralized domains.
- · Complete the exploration program currently underway at the STG target: detailed geological mapping, detailed channel sampling, collection of a 50t bulk sample of olivine ferro-syenite (15 t collected to date), and a 500 m drilling program.
- · Perform a Lidar topographic survey to cover the entire Property.
- · Perform the planned additional metallurgical testwork (solvent extraction flowsheet development  and  optimization;  development  of  Al-2%Sc  master  alloy  production technology; and mineral processing pilot program).

Update the mineral resource estimate for the Project using data from the recommended studies and test results. The Estimated cost for the recommended work program is 4,400,000 C$. InnovExplo believes that the recommended work program and proposed expenditures are appropriate and well thought out and that the character of the  Project  is  of  enough  merit  to  warrant  the  recommended  programs  and  activities. InnovExplo believes the proposed estimated budget reasonably reflects the type and number of contemplated activities.

## 4.2 Mineral Titles Status

The  issuer  supplied  all  maps  and  tables,  and  a  list  of  mineral  titles  comprising  the Property.  InnovExplo  verified  the  status  of  all  mineral  titles  using  GESTIM,  the Government of Quebec's online claim management system (gestim.mines.gouv.qc.ca: most recently viewed September 17, 2021).

The Property is made up of two contiguous mineral claim blocks: Crater Lake and Crater Lake Extension. The Property comprises 96 mineral claims and covers approximately 47.0 km 2 .

The Crater Lake claim block (the initial Crater Lake property) was acquired in December 2017. It consists of 57 contiguous claims owned 100% by Imperial, covering a total area of 27.9 km 2 . A 2% net smelter return ('NSR') royalty applies to these claims (see Section 4.4).

In 2018, Imperial acquired the Crater Lake Extension claim package, consisting of 39 mining claims covering a total area of approximately 19.1 km 2 . These 39 claims are not subject to any royalties and are 100% owned by Imperial.

All claims are current. There are no known outstanding issues at the time of writing.

The claim map is shown in Figure 4-2. A list of the claims is presented in Table 4-1.

## 4.3 Property Agreements

On December 28, 2017, Imperial completed the acquisition of a 100% interest in the Crater Lake claim block from Peak Mining Corporation ('Peak Mining') in consideration of 7,500,000 Imperial shares (the 'Crater Lake Acquisition').

The property acquisition agreement states:

- · Peak Mining  hereby  agrees  to  sell,  assign  and  transfer  to  Imperial,  and  Imperial hereby agrees to purchase and acquire from Peak Mining, an undivided 100% right, title and interest in and to the property, subject only to the royalties, in consideration of the purchaser issuing to Peak Mining 7,500,000 common shares in the capital of Imperial at a deemed price of $0.16 per share.
- · Imperial assumes from Peak Mining, their rights and obligations under the  Quest Rare  Minerals  Ltd.  (Quest)  Royalty  Agreement,  including  for  greater  certainty Imperial's assumption of all obligations of Peak Mining as 'Payor' under the Quest Royalty Agreement.

## 4.3.1 Imperial, Peak Mining and NQ Exploration Agreement

On July 11, 2017, Peak Mining signed a letter of intent with NQ Exploration Inc. ('NQ Exploration')  for  the  acquisition  of  the  Crater  Lake  claim  block  through  a  new  public company and wholly-owned subsidiary (Imperial). The new subsidiary was to be created for NQ Exploration's Quebec-based properties (the Carheil and Brouillan projects; not the subject of this report) and the Crater Lake property.

<!-- image -->

On September 11, 2017, NQ Exploration announced the execution of:

- · The  purchase  and  sale  agreements  as  well  as  the  arrangement  agreement  with Imperial, a wholly-owned subsidiary of NQ Exploration, which will be spun out as a separate  public  company  that  will  own  a  100%  interest  in  two  other  exploration projects (the Opawica and La Ronciere Gold projects; not the subject of this report), subject to the Option.
- · A share exchange agreement with AM Resources SAS, an arm's-length Colombianbased  private  coal  mining  exploration  company,  for  the  reverse  take-over  of  NQ Exploration.

Concurrent with the closing of the above two agreements, Imperial acquired the Crater Lake claim block from Peak Mining.

## 4.4 Royalties

Quest retains a 2% NSR royalty in the Crater Lake claim block from the acquisition and transfer of the mining rights from Peak Mining on December 28, 2017. Those royalties are  retained  from  the  original  acquisition  and  transfer  of  the  Property  between  Peak Mining and Quest on July 11, 2017 (Section 4.3.1). The royalty may be purchased at any time by the payor for an aggregate of $2,000,000 or in two transactions, each for 50% of the royalty in exchange for the sum of $1,000,000. Nothing herein shall prevent the payor from  simultaneously  completing  the  two  transactions,  being  100%  of  the  royalty  in exchange for the sum of $2,000,000.

## 4.5 Permits

Imperial has complete surface access to the Property. However, any new work programs will require that the appropriate permits and processes be completed under the MERN guidelines.

The author is not aware of any environmental liabilities on the Property.

## 4.6 Other Important Risk Factors

InnovExplo is not aware of any other significant factors or risks that could affect access, title, or the right or ability to estimate the mineral resources on the Property.

## 5. ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE AND PHYSIOGRAPHY

## 5.1 Accessibility

Access to the project area is restricted to fixed-wing aircraft or helicopters. Due to the lack  of  an  airstrip  at  the  camp,  fixed-wing  aircraft  are  equipped  with  floats  or  skis, depending on the time of year.

Aircraft  are  chartered  from  Schefferville,  QC  (200  km  southwest),  Nain,  NL  (190  km northeast)  or  Happy  Valley-Goose  Bay,  NL  (350  km  southeast).  There  are  several regularly  scheduled  flights  to  Schefferville  and  Goose  Bay  from  most  major  cities  in eastern Canada.

Fixed-wing flights from Schefferville are typically 60 minutes, and flights from Goose Bay are typically 90 minutes. Supplying for the Project is done from both Schefferville and Happy Valley-Goose Bay with support from Quest's Strange Lake Camp.

## 5.2 Climate

This  region  of  northern  Quebec  is  characterized  by  a  cool  subarctic  climatic  zone (Köppen climate classification) where summers are short and cool, and winters are long and cold with heavy snowfall.  Specifically, the project is located within the KingurutikFraser Rivers ecoregion of the Taiga Shield ecozone (Marsgall and Schut 1999). The ground is covered in snow for six to eight months of the year.

The closest historical weather data is taken from the Border A station from 1965 to 1979 (1965 to 1990 for annual rainfall; website: www.worldclimate.com) as displayed in Table 5-1.

Table 5-1 - Climatic data for the Project area

| Weather Type                             |   Borden A |
|------------------------------------------|------------|
| Minimum mean annual temperature (°C)     |      -10.4 |
| Maximum mean annual temperature (°C)     |       -1   |
| Average minimum January temperature (°C) |      -27.3 |
| Average maximum January temperature (°C) |      -17.4 |
| Average minimum July temperature (°C)    |        5.7 |
| Average maximum July temperature (°C)    |       16.2 |
| Average rainfall (mm)                    |      666   |
| Average snowfall (cm)                    |      350   |

Exploration activities may be conducted during the summer and autumn months (June to November) and during winter to early spring (January to April).

## 5.3 Local Resources

There are no local resources in or around the Property. Local labour may be hired out of Schefferville, Nain or Goose Bay; however, most skilled and professional labour must be sourced elsewhere.

The nearest mine is Vale's nickel-copper-cobalt mine at Voisey's Bay, roughly 155 km to the northeast, on the coast of Labrador.

## 5.4 Infrastructure

There is no developed infrastructure in or around the Property. The nearest development infrastructure is in the town of Schefferville and Nain. Nain is a coastal community that also serves as the local supply and service centre for Voisey's Bay mine. Nain has no road access, but it is serviced by regular, year-round flights from Happy Valley-Goose Bay and by coastal freighters during the summer months. Schefferville and neighbouring communities of Matimekush (pop. 850) and Naskapi (pop. 900) act as local service and supply  centers  for  several  iron  mines  and  hydro-electric  dams  in  the  area.  They  are serviced year-round by passenger and freight train service and have regularly scheduled flights to Quebec City and Sept-Îles, QC, and Wabush, NL.

The nearest seaport is in Nain, 200 km east of the Property, and the nearest railhead is in Schefferville, 200 km southwest of the Property, with access to the seaport of SeptÎles on the Bay of St. Lawrence.

There is no source of electricity on or near the Property. Power must be generated onsite. The nearest sources of electricity are in Schefferville, supplied by the hydro-electric generating stations of Menehek (200 km southwest) and Churchill Falls (210 km south).

Water sources are abundant on and adjacent to the Property.

## 5.5 Physiography

The Property is situated to the west of a major watershed that runs along the border between Quebec and Labrador. The terrain is glacially scoured with moderate rolling hills and lakes and elevation ranging from 450 to 700 m above sea level. Larger hills are present in the northwest part of the property.

Eskers and boulder fields are common throughout the Property. The exposure and lack of vegetation (short growing season) promote stunted and thinly spaced vegetation often confined  to  sheltered  valleys  and  enclaves.  The  vegetation  on  the  Property  consists mainly of tamarack trees, shrubs, and caribou moss.

Lakes, rivers or bogs cover approximately 30% of the Property.

## 6.1 1979-1980: Geological Survey of Canada

In 1979, an airborne gamma-ray spectrometry survey was run in the Mistastin Lake area, including the Property area (Geophysical Series Map 36313G).

In 1980, the Lac Chapiteau and Lac Ramusio map sheets were covered as part of an airborne  magnetic  survey  at  1:50,000  scale,  including  the  project  area  (Geophysical Series Map 6204G).

## 6.2 1996: Major General Resources Ltd. and Donner Resources Ltd

A  reconnaissance  geology  and  geochemistry  program  was  carried  out  on  the  Lac Chapiteau  property  to  evaluate  the  area  for  potential  Voisey's  Bay-style  Ni-Cu-Co mineralization. The result of this program identified the area as having limited potential to host base metal mineralization (Wares and Leriche, 1996).

## 6.3 2007-2009: Freewest Resources Canada Inc. and Quest Rare Minerals Inc.

In  2007,  as  part  of  a  regional  evaluation  program,  Freewest  Resources  Canada  Inc. ('Freewest') collected six (6) samples in the area of what is now the Property. There are no reports available on this program.

In  January 2008, Quest Uranium Corporation ('Quest Uranium') was formed. Part of Freewest's  uranium  property  assets,  including  the  Property,  were  transferred  to   this company. In April 2010, Quest Uranium changed its name to Quest Rare Minerals Inc.

## 6.4 2009-2012: Federal and Provincial Government Work and McGill University

## 6.4.1 2009: Geological Survey of Canada

In  2009,  the  area  was  covered as part of a joint Open File release by the GSC, the Geological  Survey  of  Newfoundland  and  Labrador,  and  the  Direction  Générale  de Géologie  du  Québec.  This  release  compiles  10  maps  covering  a  portion  of  western

Labrador, north of the Churchill Reservoir, and adjoining parts of Quebec. Results are available as 1:250 000 scale full-coloured maps in pdf format. Eight (8) of these are radiometric maps, the result of the new 2009 airborne survey (Open File 6532).

## 6.4.2 2009: Newfoundland and Labrador, Department of Natural Resources

In 2009, the Geological Survey of Newfoundland and Labrador released lake-sediment and lake-water geochemical data collected from historical surveys. These surveys were conducted in Labrador by the Geological Survey of Newfoundland and Labrador from 1978  to  2005.  Most  of  the  data  had  been  released  previously  in  various  Open  File reports. However, as new analytical methods became available, some samples were reanalyzed for additional elements. Some of these data had not been released previously (Open File LAB/1465).

## 6.4.3 2009-2012: MERN and McGill University

As part of a joint project between Quest, McGill University and MERN, a Master's thesis was undertaken to characterize the syenite intrusion and associated rare earth element ('REE') mineralization at Crater Lake. The thesis was submitted in October 2012.

This work concluded that the Crater Lake syenite (under the name of Misery Lake in the thesis) intrudes the Mistastin Batholith and consists primarily of coarse-grained syenite and lesser mafic syenite; the center of the circular intrusion consists of medium-grained syenite  with  lesser  mafic  syenite.  REE  mineralization  includes  allanite  and  gittinsite (Petrella, 2012).

## 6.5 2009-2014: Exploration and Drilling Activities (Quest)

## 6.5.1 2009 geophysics

Quest  retained  MPX  Geophysics  Ltd.  (MPX),  to  conduct  a  helicopter-borne  high resolution magnetic and radiometric survey.  The survey area was flown at a nominal mean terrain clearance of 70 m.  The survey block was flown along north-south (0°Az) flight lines separated by 400 m line spacings, and east-west (90°Az) tie lines at a line separation of 400 m (MPX, 2009).

## 6.5.2 2010 petrography, geochemistry and geophysics

## 6.5.2.1  Petrography

Quest contracted Applied Petrographic Services Inc. to complete a petrographic study on 14 thin sections taken from samples collected in 2009. Descriptions and observations were provided in an internal report.

## 6.5.2.2  Till survey

Between July and August 2010, a till survey was carried out by Vista Geoscience ('Vista') on behalf of Quest. A total of 1,222 samples of sandy till were collected, each 25-50 cm deep (Seneshen, 2011).

<!-- image -->

The survey revealed REE anomalies over the margins of and down-ice from the circular magnetic anomalies. Previous exploration by Quest and its contractors showed glacial transport distances of at least 7 km at Crater Lake. Most of the anomalies reflect short down-ice transport distances with till deposition at topographic barriers.

Figure 6-1 and Figure 6-2 display the light-medium REE ('LMREE') and heavy REE ('HREE') results and anomalies. Note that the LMREE results include europium and gadolinium.

## 6.5.2.3  Geophysics

PGW Consulting Geophysicists ('PGW') was retained by Quest to interpret the airborne geophysical data from four (4) standalone lines of ground magnetic data. The lines were completed  independently  of  each  other  over  the  outer  response  of  the  Crater  Lake magnetic ring.

## 6.5.3 2010-2012 drilling programs

In September 2010, an eight (8)-hole drilling program tested magnetic anomalies from the 2009 airborne magnetic survey. A total of 1,170 m was drilled, and 663 samples were collected.  The  main  unit  encountered  was  syenite.  No  significant  assay  results  were obtained.

<!-- image -->

In September and November 2011, a six (6)-hole drilling program continued testing the strong magnetic responses seen in the previous airborne geophysical surveys. A total of 1,894 m was drilled, and 1,171 samples were collected (Quest, 2013).

In September and October 2012, 2,498 m were drilled in 11 holes. All holes in the Crater Lake Intrusion intersected variably textured, medium-grained syenite. Two holes were drilled outside the Crater Lake Intrusion, testing weak circular magnetic features south of the Crater Lake magnetic ring feature (Quest, 2012).

Table 6-2 summarizes the 2010 to 2012 drilling programs. Figure 6-3 shows the collar position relative to the modelled ground magnetics data.

## 6.5.4 2011-2012 surface exploration

From July to August 2011, Quest conducted a surface exploration program to follow up the results from the 2010 geochemical till survey conducted on the Property. A limited mapping  and  prospecting  program  was  completed  with  a  total  of  101  stations;  199 samples were collected and submitted for assay, of which 40 returned grades greater than 0.50% TREO.

Between  August  and  October  2012,  geologists  from  Quest  and  prospectors  from Exploration Sans Frontière conducted a surface exploration program. The work focused on areas of historical work that included prospecting, mapping and a geochemical till survey.  The  till  survey  highlighted  property-scale  anomalies  over  the  margins  of  and down-ice from the circular magnetic anomalies.

Selected areas were chosen for more detailed work that included outcrop stripping and channel  sampling.  The  2011  program  highlighted  individual  samples  that  returned elevated REE values, and these were followed up. A total of 261 geological stations were sampled, yielding 231 samples, 80 of which were cut from 11 different channel locations.

Fourteen (14) of the channel samples returned values greater than 0.5% TREO, and 13 surface samples returned values greater than 0.5% TREO.

## 6.5.5 2012-2013 geophysics

In October 2012, Abitibi Geophysics was contracted by Quest to conduct a small ground magnetics survey to characterize the large circular airborne magnetic feature. The aim was to identify  any  internal  differentiation  and  to  delineate  potential  domains  of  REE mineralization related to the intrusion.

Two grids were laid out on the northeast and southwest sides of the magnetic anomaly. A total of 24.75 line-km was surveyed at a station separation of 25 m. The locations of the two grids are shown in Figure 6.4.

The survey identified several dyke-like structures and two NE-SW trending magnetic highs in the northeastern part of the property. It was found that the two grids correlate well with the previous airborne magnetics survey (Abitibi Geophysics, 2012).

## Figure 6-4 - Residual magnetic field, 2012 geophysical survey, showing Northeast and Southwest grids

During the winter of 2013, Quest retained Abitibi Geophysics to conduct a propertywide ground magnetics survey (Abitibi Geophysics, 2013). The data from 470.5 line-km were used to build an unconstrained 3D subsurface magnetic susceptibility model of the Property and several 2D models. The resulting 3D models and maps were used to plan the 2014 exploration and drilling program. The results of this interpretation are shown in Figure 6-5.

Overall,  the  ground  magnetic  geophysical  survey  correlates  very  well  with  the  less detailed  airborne  magnetic  survey.  Several  previously  unidentified  anomalies  were discovered as a result of the survey.

## 6.5.6 2014 drilling program

During the winter of 2014, a total of 1,446 m was drilled in 7 holes. Several previously untested exploration targets were chosen based on the 2013 geophysical survey and previous surface geochemistry data. The holes were sampled along their lengths for a total  of  879  collected  samples.  Downhole magnetic susceptibility data were collected upon the completion of each drill hole (Quest, 2014).

Table 6-3 summarizes the best composite drill intersections.  Figure 6-6 presents the collar locations.

## 7. GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND MINERALIZATION

The following geological summary is taken from Daigle (2017).

## 7.1 Regional Geology

The region is underlain by five structural provinces: Nain, Superior, Churchill, Makkovik, and Grenville. Together, they record a crustal history ranging from about 3.8 to 0.6 Ga. The Nain and Superior Archean provinces are bounded by the younger Archean and Paleoproterozoic Churchill and Makkovik provinces, which in turn are truncated by the early Proterozoic Grenville Province (Figure 7-1).

The Churchill Province is subdivided into three parts. The western part consists of lowgrade sedimentary and volcanic rocks in a west-verging fold and thrust belt (the Labrador Trough). The central part comprises predominantly reworked Archean rocks, which are juxtaposed against the Labrador Trough along mylonitic shear zones. The eastern part consists mainly of anorthosite and gabbro of the Rae Province (Swinden et al. 1991).

The syenite intrusion of Crater Lake is located in the Churchill Province. It intrudes or is coeval with the southeast end of the Mistastin Batholith (Figure 7-2), which covers an area of approximately 5,000 km 2 . The dominant lithologies of the batholith are granite and  quartz  monzonite  with  pyroxene,  which  are  cut  by  younger  biotite-hornblende granite, which is in turn intruded by a smaller olivine syenite, the Crater Lake syenite. Uranium-lead dating of three zircons places the age of the batholith at approximately 1.4 Ga (Petrella 2011).

## 7.2 Property Geology

The  Crater  Lake  intrusion  displays  a  gradational  contact  with  its  host,  the  Mistastin rapakivi  granite  (Figure  7-3).  Both  have  an  A-type  affinity  and  similar  trace  element composition. The Crater Lake syenites are therefore interpreted to be a late differentiate product of the Mistastin Batholith. The dominant exposed lithology (much of the intrusion is covered by a lake) is coarse- to medium-grained, massive syenite, which is mainly composed of perthitic K-feldspar and 1 to 10% by volume of interstitial ferromagnesian minerals, namely fayalite (iron chrysolite, Fe2SiO4), hedenbergite, ferro-pargasite and annite  (iron-rich  biotite),  accompanied  by  accessory  quartz,  iron  oxides  (magnetite, titanium-rich  magnetite,  and  ilmenite),  zircon,  fluorite,  apatite  and  britholite  (Petrella 2012).  A  magnetic  and  melanocratic  unit,  ferro-syenite,  which  commonly  contains greater than 50% by volume of ferromagnesian minerals, including cumulate fayalite, hedenbergite and ferro-pargasite, occurs as large continuous to discontinuous subvertical and conical bodies, sills, narrow dikes and inclusions in the felsic syenites. The large ferro-syenite bodies are elongated and concordant to subconcordant to the main contact between the Crater Lake syenite and the Mistastin granite intrusions. These large bodies can reach up to 700 m long, up to 120 m wide, and are open at depth. Three large ferro-syenite bodies have been found on the property: TGZ, Boulder Lake and STG. Petrella (2012) interpreted the narrow ferro-syenite dikes as having formed by fractional crystallization  of  ferromagnesian  minerals,  leaving  behind  a  residual  magma  that produced the felsic syenites. With continued fractional crystallization, the felsic syenites became  more  enriched in alkali and silica, and only became  saturated with ferromagnesian at a very late stage, which explains the interstitial crystallization of the latter in the perthite-dominated syenite.

Several major radial and concentric faults are observed in the field and drill core, and have  also  been  interpreted  from  magnetic  data  and  satellite  images.  Most  of  these subvertical and (less commonly) subhorizontal structures are concentrated inwards from the contact with the Mistastin granite to within the first 800 m of the Crater Lake intrusion. Major  faults are characterized by a very intense potassic alteration with local concentrations of biotite, chlorite, epidote and magnetite. Imperial's geologists do not yet know if these faults played a role in the ferro-syenite emplacement.

The Crater Lake intrusion was interpreted by Petrella et al. (2014) to be a ring dyke complex  due  to  the  concentric  lithological  zonation  of  quartz  monzonite  and  felsic syenite, the steep dip of the bodies toward the center of the intrusion, the presence of numerous intrusion-scale discontinuous concentric faults (interpreted from the magnetic data), and the occurrence of several late radial faults (occupied by pegmatites), all of which are characteristic features of ring complexes (e.g. Woolley, 2001; Coumans and Stix, 2016). Consistent with this interpretation, some of the Crater Lake felsic syenites feature a trachytic texture developed through the alignment of feldspar laths, indicative of flow before cooling.

There is a strong correlation between the location of known ferro-syenites and strong magnetic susceptibility. Indeed, a 3D magnetic susceptibility model (commissioned by Imperial) of the intrusion, from an iteratively reweighted inversion of data from a recent GPS-integrated ground magnetic survey, suggests that the ferro-syenite is a subvertical ring dyke with some local sill-like lateral extensions. So far, this model is supported by very thick  intersections of  ferro-syenite  in  several  drill  holes,  and  the  steeply  dipping layering in this unit (Beland, 2021).

## 7.3 Geological Units: Intersected from 2014 to 2021

Prior to the start of the 2021 drilling campaign, Imperial geologists reinterpreted previous drilling  results  and  reclassified  some  previously  intersected  units  to  better  reflect  the mineralogy of the Crater Lake lithologies. The following summarizes the units that were intersected during the drilling programs between winter 2014 through winter 2021.

## 7.3.1 Medium-grained syenite

Medium-grained syenite is the main unit throughout the central part of the Crater Lake intrusion. Predominately grey to pale pink-orange in colour, the mineralogy consists of approximately 70 to 90% perthitic K-feldspars, with the remainder of the unit comprising ferromagnesian minerals, including iron-amphibole and minor fayalite and titanium-rich magnetite (Petrella 2011). Trace interstitial quartz is rare. Zircon, fluorite, carbonate and pyrite can also occur at trace levels. Feldspar grains are mostly subhedral laths 1 to 1.5 cm long but can reach up to 2.5 cm. The mafic minerals are interstitial and are 5 mm in size. The unit is typically massive.

Relatively narrow (2 to 25 cm wide) mafic-rich sections occur throughout this unit. These bands  or  cumulates  are  5  to  15 mm  subhedral  amphibole  grains  with  interstitial

<!-- image -->

magnetite and olivine. Minor REE mineralization can occur in these accumulations as interstitial  cerium-britholite  (Petrella  2011).  These  mafic  bands/cumulates  often  have sharp contacts and low core angles (less than 25°).

Potassic  alteration  is  common  throughout  medium-grained  syenite  and  results  in  a patchy  appearance.  Feldspar  grains  often  exhibit  pink  colour.  Amphibole  commonly displays partial replacement by aegirine.

## 7.3.2 Fine-grained syenite

The fine-grained syenite is composed of K-feldspar and amphibole crystals &lt;1 to 4 mm in  size.  Feldspars  are  subhedral  and  make  up  approximately  90%  of  the  unit.  The remainder is interstitial amphibole, magnetite and olivine. Mafic minerals are concentrated near the upper and lower contacts of this unit in some drill holes. This unit often displays a weak preferred orientation defined by K-feldspar laths and can range from approximately 10 to 35°. Alteration can occur as pink potassic overprinting. The alteration can occur parallel to the fabric of the unit.

## 7.3.3 Coarse-grained syenite

The  mineralogy  of  the  coarse-grained  syenite  is  similar  to  the  fine-grained  syenite, differing only in grain size. Coarse-grained syenite is composed of approximately 90% subhedral K-feldspar. The remainder is interstitial mafic minerals. A minor amount of disseminated pyrite occurs locally. Feldspar grains range in size from 1 to 5 cm, but in local  megacrystic  sections,  they  can  exceed  10  cm.  Zonation  is  observed  in  some feldspar grains, especially megacrysts. Interstitial mafic minerals are usually 1 to 5 cm in size.  In  megacrystic  sections,  subhedral  amphibole,  if  present,  can  exceed  5 cm. Potassic  overprinting  is  common,  with  a  pink  to  orange  colour.  Amphibole  is  often replaced by aegirine. Complete replacement of the larger amphibole grains by epidote has  been  observed  in  several  drill  holes.  The  unit  is  weakly  magnetic  in  areas  with interstitial mafic minerals.

## 7.3.4 Variably textured syenite

As the name suggests, the variably textured syenite exhibits textural similarities with several other units. These textures, including medium-grained syenite, fine- and coarsegrained syenites and often pegmatite, are commonly  distributed in a chaotic arrangement. The size of each section can range from several centimetres to a metre in length  and  appear  to  have  no  order.  Contacts  between  each  section  can  be  sharp, irregular, or gradational.

## 7.3.5 POM syenite

The POM syenite ('POMSYN') consists of a grey to light grey, medium-grained syenite with  olivine  and  magnetite  phenocrysts  5  to  10 mm  in  size.  The  feldspar  laths  are interlocking. The rims of the magnetite and olivine phenocrysts are partially altered to biotite  and  pyroxene,  respectively.  This  unit  is  often  found  as  inclusions  in  the  ferro-

<!-- image -->

syenite and the coarse-grained syenite. The size of these inclusions ranges from a few centimetres to less than 2 m in size.

## 7.3.6 Blebby syenite

The  blebby  syenite  consists  of  a  medium-  to  coarse-grained  grey  syenite  with interlocking, medium-grained feldspar and interstitial pyroxene, amphibole, olivine and biotite.  Pyroxene  occurs  as  blebs,  either  rimmed  or  partially  altered  by  amphibole. Specks of olivine are also observed.

## 7.3.7 Trachytic syenite

The trachytic syenite consists of a dark grey to grey, very fine- to fine-grained, foliated (trachytic)  interlocking  feldspar  groundmass  with  up  to  15%  fine-grained  specks  of anhedral olivine and pyroxene.

## 7.3.8 Ferro-syenite

Different types of ferro-syenite units were identified during the 2014 through 2021 drilling programs.

## 7.3.8.1  Olivine ferro-syenite ('OLFESYN')

The olivine-rich ferro-syenite consists of a dark green to dark grey, mafic cumulates, fineto medium-grained olivine-rich unit with up to 40% olivine, up to 15 % pyroxene, up to 10% amphibole, and 10% magnetite. Mafic minerals form a net-like (interstitial) texture in the medium-grained (0.5-1 cm) feldspar groundmass. The latter also displays coarsegrained (1-3 cm) feldspar fragments that are locally digested. The mafic minerals are fine- to medium-grained, irregular and anhedral with the exception of black needle-like amphibole and amphibole clots. This unit is moderately to highly magnetic.

## 7.3.8.2  Pyroxene ferro-syenite ('PXFESYN')

The  pyroxene-rich  ferro-syenite  is  a  dark  green-grey,  medium-  to  fine-grained  unit composed of up to 40% pyroxene, up to 15% magnetite, 10% olivine and up to 10% amphibole. The mafic cumulates (pyroxene, magnetite, olivine and amphibole) form a net-like (interstitial) texture in the medium-grained (0.5-1 cm) feldspar groundmass. This unit  is  highly  magnetic.  The  PXFESYN  is  distinctly  olivine-poor  compared  to  the OLFESYN and seems to have more of a cumulate texture composed of pyroxene and magnetite.

## 7.3.8.3  Amphibole ferro-syenite ('AMPFESYN')

The amphibole-rich ferro-syenite is a black to dark grey, coarse- to medium-grained unit composed of up to 50% amphibole, up to 15% magnetite, 5% olivine and up to 5% pyroxene. The mafic cumulates (amphibole, magnetite, olivine, and pyroxene) form a net-like (interstitial) texture in the medium-grained (0.5-1 cm) feldspar groundmass. This unit is highly magnetic. The AMPFESYN unit is olivine- and pyroxene-poor compared to the  PXFESYN  and  seems  to  have  more  of  a  cumulate  texture  of  amphibole  and magnetite.

## 7.4 Mineralization

Assay  results  from  surface  samples  and  from  2014-2021  drill  core  indicate  that  the different types of ferro-syenite are the main host to the scandium and REE mineralization.

At  Crater  Lake,  scandium  was  enriched  in  the  residual  liquid  of  the  parent  Mistastin granite  magma  following  extensive  fractionation  of  feldspar,  in  which  scandium  is incompatible.  This residual  liquid  became the  Crater  Lake  quartz  monzonite magma, which was enriched in scandium and iron. Fluorapatite, zircon, fayalite, and the cores of zoned hedenbergite crystals saturated in this magma chamber. Ring faults developed as a result of caldera collapse, and the magma and minerals were emplaced as a slurry into these faults. The ferro-syenite formed by in situ fractionation of unzoned hedenbergite crystals, magnetite and hastingsite, and their physical segregation with the previously crystallized minerals. The  extremely  high  FeO/FeO+MgO  content  of  the  quartz monzonite liquid resulted in high partition coefficients for scandium in the hedenbergite and hastingsite, allowing scandium to be incorporated into these minerals at exceptionally high concentrations under magmatic conditions. The physical segregation of  hedenbergite  and  hastingsite  in  ferro-syenite  cumulate  rocks  through  gravitational settling and/or flow differentiation spatially concentrated the Sc-bearing minerals within the intrusion, resulting in the first known scandium deposit hosted by syenite. (Beland, 2021).

The REE  mineralization is contained in small primary idiomorphic zircon and hydroxyapatite crystals (identified by XRD analysis). The latter locally form aggregates that were wholly or partly replaced by britholite-(Ce). Two types of hydroxyapatite and one  type  of  britholite-(Ce)  have  been  identified.  The  first  type  of  hydroxyapatite  is magmatic and occurs as euhedral to subhedral, unzoned, transparent crystals that do not  show  evidence  of  having  been  altered.  This  type  of  apatite  is  very  frequently observed in the other rock types of the intrusion. The second type of hydroxyapatite also occurs as primary, magmatic crystals but is compositionally zoned, with its core similar in  composition  to  unzoned  hydroxyapatite  1.  This  indicates  that  hydroxyapatite  2 continued  to  crystallize  after hydroxyapatite  1.  Crystals  of  hydroxyapatite  2  are commonly replaced in their outer parts by britholite-(Ce). Both types of hydroxyapatite commonly occur as inclusions in pyroxene, amphibole and, less commonly, fayalite.

## 7.4.1 Scandium

Scandium is a silvery-white transition metal, often classified as a REE along with yttrium and the 15 lanthanides.  High-grade, large tonnage, easily mineable scandium deposits with favourable metallurgy and location are scarce, making it a commodity that is difficult to obtain in commercial quantities.  Scandium is often found in trace amounts in REE deposits and occurrences, but it has only been mined as a by-product in a few uranium and REE mines globally, such as Zhovti Vody in Ukraine and Bayan Obo in China.

Two projects hosted in nickel laterite deposits in Australia have NI 43-101 or JORCcompliant  resources  that  include  scandium  as  one  of  the  major  products.  They  are presented here for comparative purposes, despite the different geological context. The Nyngan Project (Scandium International Mining Corp.) has mineral reserves of 1.4Mt at 409 g/t and M+I mineral resources of 16.92 Mt at 235 g/t Sc at a cut-off grade of 100 g/t (Rangott et al., 2016). The Platina Scandium Project (Platina Resources Limited) has mineral reserves of 4.02 Mt at 570 g/t Sc (cut-off grade of 400 g/t) and mineral resources of 35.6 Mt at 405 g/t Sc (cut-off grade of 300 g/t) (Platina Resources Ltd, 2018).

## 8. DEPOSIT TYPES

The following is taken from Quest (2014) and Daigle (2014):

The Crater Lake Deposit is a large, scandium- and REE-bearing alkali igneous intrusive complex.    Carbonatite  and  alkaline  intrusive  complexes  (as  well  as  their  weathering products) are the primary sources of REE. Apart from REE, these rock types can also host deposits of niobium, phosphate, titanium, vermiculite, barite, fluorite, copper, calcite, and zirconium. Although these types of deposits are found throughout the world, only six are currently being mined  for REE:  five carbonatites (Bayan  Obo, Daluxiang, Maoniuping, and Weishan deposits in China, and the Mountain Pass deposit in the USA) and one peralkaline intrusion-related deposit (as a byproduct at the Lovozero deposit, Russia).

Carbonatite and alkaline intrusive complexes are derived from partial melts of mantle material.  Neodymium isotopic data of these deposits consistently indicate that the REE are derived from these parent magmas. These deposits and their associated rock types usually occur within stable cratonic settings, generally associated with intracontinental rift  and  fault  systems.    Extended  periods  of  fractional  crystallization  of the magma  in these settings led to enrichment in REE and other incompatible elements. In alkaline intrusive  complexes,  mineralization  of  REE  occur  as  primary  phases  in  magmatic layering or as later-stage dykes and veins (Verplanck et al., 2014).

REE deposits pose particular environmental challenges due to the associated uranium and  thorium.  There  is  also  uncertainty  surrounding  the  toxicity  of  the  elements themselves.  Acid mine drainage is typically not an issue due to the alkali nature of the rock types and minerals.  Uranium has the potential for recovery as a byproduct, but thorium  remains  a  waste  product  that  requires  management.  Additionally,  in  some deposits, fluorine and beryllium can pose environmental challenges (Verplanck et al., 2014).

## 9. EXPLORATION

## 9.1 Geophysical Surveys

## 9.1.1 2018 geophysical data modelling

In  February  2018,  geophysical  modelling  provided  a  better  understanding  of  the  3D geometry of the Crater Lake intrusive complex and the vertical and lateral extent of the known areas of scandium mineralization on the Property.

## 9.1.2 2020 magnetic ground survey

In July and August 2020, Abitibi Geophysics of Val d'Or, Quebec, completed a detailed ground magnetic survey on the western half of the Property. The survey covered 130 line-km at a line spacing of 50 m.

The  survey  better  defined  the  scandium-bearing  ferro-syenite  rock  units  and  fault structures  controlling  the  concentration  of  scandium  mineralization  on  the  Property. Several new magnetic bodies were identified to the east and south of the STG target.

## 9.2 Surface Program

## 9.2.1 2018 summer exploration program

Imperial's 2018 summer field program consisted of detailed prospecting and geological mapping over three highly prospective scandium targets: the TGZ, STG and North Target areas (Figure 9-1). The prospecting and mapping program was followed by mechanical stripping and channel sampling. Scandium-rich outcrops and boulders in the vicinity of the TGZ and STG targets confirmed that both zones correspond to a similar scandiumrich target discovered in 2014 at the Boulder Scandium Zone. A total of 39 grab samples and 41 channel samples were collected. An additional 24 historical core samples were selected  for  a  mineralogical  study  to  be  completed  at  McGill  University  in  Montreal, Quebec.  The  best  results  from  the  program  are  illustrated  in  Table  9-1.  Figure  9-2 displays the location of the field work results on the STG target.

## 9.2.2 2020 summer exploration program

A prospecting and mapping program was conducted over 38.2 km of unexplored terrain on  the  Property.  8  grab  samples,  304  historical  core  samples  and  17  new  channel samples were selected for a detailed mineralogical and geochemical study at McGill University in Montreal, Quebec.

Furthermore, strongly magnetic, boulders of ferro-syenite were found in the Hilltop target area and 300 m northeast of the STG target.

## 10. DRILLING

This item summarizes the issuer's 2019, 2020 and 2021 drilling campaigns (collectively, the '2019-2021 Program').

## 10.1 Drilling Methodology

The drilling was performed by Avataa Rouillier of Val-d'Or, Quebec, in 2019 and 2020, and by Cartwright Drilling of Happy Valley-Goose Bay, NL, in 2021. Collar locations were determined using a handheld GPS.

The drill was lined up using a Suunto compass. The downhole dip and azimuth were surveyed using a Reflex EZCOMII Shot tool. Surveys were taken at least every 30 m downhole. Prior to testing, at least 6 m of drill rods (2 rods) were removed from the hole to limit the chances of magnetic interference by the steel drill rods. Drilling contractors handled the instruments, and survey information was transcribed and provided in paper format to Imperial's geologists.

At the drill rig, the drill helpers placed core into core boxes and marked off each 3-m drill run using a labelled wooden block.

## 10.2 Collar Surveys

Casings were left in place with an identification tag. Collar locations were surveyed by Corriveau J.L. &amp; Assoc. Inc of Val-d'Or after the drilling campaigns were completed.

## 10.3 Logging Procedures

The drill core was delivered by ATV or snowmobile and, when necessary, by helicopter, to the core shack area by drillers or by Imperial's staff, where it was cleaned of drilling additives and mud. An Imperial geologist quickly reviewed the core, checking for zones of  mineralization  and  damaged  or  mislabelled  core  boxes.  After  fitting  the  core  back together, the meterage was marked on the core and the RQD was estimated.

All  data  were  recorded  by  the  geologist  using  MX  Deposit  logging  software.  Input included descriptions of all aspects of significance: rock type, mineralization, alteration, structure, textures of interest. Photographs of selected portions of the core were taken and uploaded into the drilling software.

After samples were marked on the core, the core boxes were transferred to the core-saw shack and sawed by a technician. At this time, any thin section chips or core samples for specific gravity (SG) measurements were also cut. All thin-section cuts or SG samples were placed in a labelled sample bag and set aside. Once all sample intervals  were sawed, the core technician placed one-half of the core in a labelled sample bag. The sampler stapled the sample tags to the core box underneath the half-core and re-wrote the sample interval's marks and the sample numbers on the remaining half with a red grease pencil. Bagged samples were loaded into rice bags to a total weight per bag between 10 and 20 kg. Each rice bag was labelled with the sample intervals and contact information (laboratory and company). The shipment data was entered into the shipment database.

<!-- image -->

Finally,  overview  photos  of  all  core  boxes  were  taken  and  uploaded  into  the  logging software.  The  boxes  were  then  transferred to  the  long-term  core  farm  or  temporarily placed in cross-piles.

## 10.4 Drill Programs

## 10.4.1 2019 drill program

A winter drilling program totalling 1,014 m in five (5) holes was completed in late April 2019 on the TGZ target to evaluate the scandium potential of a high-intensity magnetic anomaly (Figure 10-1). Drilling took place 600 m north of a historical drill hole that had returned scandium grades of up to 506 g/t Sc2O3 over 19 m along the western side of the Crater Lake intrusion along the same magnetic trend. The best assay results are shown in Table 10-1. Figure 10-2 illustrates some of those results.

## 10.4.2 2020 drill program

A drilling program totalling 676 m in four (4) holes was completed between August 14 and 31, 2020. The drilling program was designed to test the scandium potential of highintensity magnetic anomalies in the STG, TGZ and Northern target areas (Figure 10-3).

Results from the 2020 drill program include:

- · CL20036: Tested a strong magnetic anomaly parallel and west of the STG target (previous surface channel grading 289 g/t Sc2O3 and 0.364% REE over 7.04 m). The magnetic anomaly was explained by a 90 m interval of amphibole-rich ferro-syenite. No significant Sc or REE mineralization was intersected.
- · CL20037: Tested the lateral continuity of the TGZ target. The mineralized intervals (total  true  length  of  110 m)  show  excellent  lateral  and  vertical  continuity  of  the favourable TGZ target horizon. The best Sc and REE intervals from this hole are presented in Table 10-2.
- · CL20038: Tested a ferro-syenite unit that was previously intersected parallel and east of  the  main  TGZ  target.  The  hole  intersected  multiple,  narrow  scandium-bearing ferrosyenite intervals grading up to 244 g/t Sc2O3 and 0.71% TREO+Y over 2.6 m and 192 g/t Sc2O3 and 0.50% TREO+Y over 3.6 m.
- · CL20039: Tested a strong, 350-m-long by 100-m-wide magnetic anomaly over the Northern target. The geophysical anomaly was explained by the intersection of a

## 10.4.3 2021 drilling program

A 14-hole drilling program totalling 2,049 m was completed on May 9, 2021, on the TGZ target  (Figure  10-4).  The  objective  of  this  drilling  program  was  to  outline  mineral resources on 50- to 100-m centres.

All holes intersected the target mafic intrusive host rock and indicated that the TGZ target dips between 83° W to 70° E and strikes NNE. The true thickness of the mineralized zone  varies  between  55  and  135 m.  Drilling  has  defined  the  mineralization  on  50-m sections  between  sections  350N  and  650N.  The  mineralization  has  been  traced  by drilling over 300 m in total strike length down to a vertical depth of up to 200 m. The best assay results are reported in Table 10-3. Figure 10-5 and Figure 10-6 illustrate some of those results.

## 11. SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND SECURITY

This item describes the issuer's sample preparation, analysis and security procedures for the 2019-2021 diamond drilling campaigns (the '2019-2021 Program'). The issuer's geology  team  provided  the  information  discussed  below.  InnovExplo  reviewed  and validated the information for the 2019-2021 Program, including the QA/QC procedures and results.

## 11.1 Core Handling, Sampling and Security

The drill core is boxed and sealed at the drill rigs and delivered daily by road or helicopter to the logging facility where a technician takes over the core handling. Drill core is logged and  sampled  by  experienced  geologists  or  by  a  geologist-in-training  under  the supervision of a qualified geologist. A geologist marks the samples by placing a unique identification tag at the end of each core sample interval. Core sample lengths vary from 0.15 to 2 m, and sample contacts respect lithological contacts and/or changes in the appearance of mineralization or alteration (type and/or strength). The technician saws each marked sample in half. One half of the core is washed with clean water and placed in a plastic bag along with a detached portion of the unique bar-coded sample tag, and the other half of the core is returned to the core box with the remaining tag portion stapled in  place.  The  core  boxes  are  stockpiled  or  stored  in  outdoor  core  racks  for  future reference. Individually bagged samples were placed in security-sealed rice bags along with the list of samples for delivery to the assay laboratory.

QA/QC sample tags are also placed in the core boxes. Once core sampling is complete, the sampling technician adds the corresponding barren ('blanks') and standard samples (certified reference materials or 'CRMs') to the shipments. For each shipment of 100 samples,  no  less  than  two  (2)  blanks  and  four  (4)  CRMs  are  included  with  the  core samples.

## 11.2 Laboratory Accreditation and Certification

The  International Organization for Standardization ('ISO') and  the International Electrotechnical Commission  ('IEC')  form  the specialized system  for worldwide standardization. ISO/IEC 17025 General Requirements for the Competence of Testing and Calibration Laboratories sets out the criteria for laboratories wishing to demonstrate that they are technically competent, operating an effective quality system, and able to generate technically valid calibration and test results. The standard forms the basis for the accreditation of competence of laboratories by accreditation bodies.

For the 2019-2021 Program, samples were sent and prepared at Activation Laboratories Ltd.  ('Actlabs')  in  Ancaster,  Ontario  for  assaying.  Actlabs  received  ISO/IEC  17025 accreditation through the Standards Council of Canada ('SCC'). Actlabs is a commercial laboratory independent of the issuer and has no interest in the Project.

## 11.3 Laboratory Preparation and Assays

Samples  were  analyzed  for  REE  at  the  Actlabs  laboratory  in  Ancaster,  Ontario. Procedures  used  were  Inductively  Coupled  Plasma  ('ICP')  for  major  elements  and Inductively Coupled Plasma/ Mass Spectrometry ('ICP-MS') for trace elements.

<!-- image -->

The methodology is described as follows:

- · Samples are sorted, bar-coded and logged into the Actlabs Lims program. They are then placed in the sample drying room.
- · Samples are crushed to 80% passing 10 mesh (2.00 mm) and split using a Jones riffle  splitter.  A  250-g  or  500-g  split  is  pulverized  to  95%  passing  200 mesh (0.07mm). Only 50 g of the 500 g is used for the analysis itself (code RX-1: 500). The remaining 450 g is returned as pulp to the issuer's office, along with the reject from the original sample.
- · Assay  results  are  provided  in  Excel  spreadsheets  and  the  official  certificate (sealed and signed) as a PDF.
- · The pulverized pulp is placed in kraft sample bags, and the un-pulverized portions returned to their original sample bags.
- · The remainder of the crushed samples (the rejects) and the pulps are stored at Actlabs facility.

## 11.4 Quality Assurance and Quality Control (QA/QC)

The issuer's QA/QC program for drill core includes the insertion of blanks and standards in the sample stream of core samples. About 6% of the samples were control samples in the sampling and assaying process. Four (4) standard and two (2) blank samples of barren rock were added to each group of 100 samples as an analytical check for the laboratory batches. In addition, the issuer's QA/QC includes field duplicate samples that comprised 1% of the core selected as quarter core sample duplicates for comparison with the original core sample.

Imperial's geologists were responsible for the QA/QC and database compilation. Upon receiving  the  analytical  results,  the  geologists  extracted  the  results  for  blanks  and standards to compare against the expected values. If QA/QC acceptability was achieved for  the  analytical  batch, the  data  were  entered  into  the  project's  database;  if  not,  the laboratory was contacted to review and address the issue, including retesting the batch if required.

The discussion below details the results of the blanks and standards used in the issuer's QA/QC program.

## 11.4.1 Certified reference materials (standards)

Accuracy is monitored by inserting CRMs at a ratio of four (4) for every 100 samples (1:25). The standards were supplied by OREAS, Sudbury, Ontario. The definition of a QC failure is when the assay result for a standard falls outside three standard deviations ('3SD'). Gross outliers are excluded from the standard deviation calculation.

Between 2019 and 2021, three (3) different CRMs were used, two (2) for Sc only and one (1) for Sc and REE. Of the 82 CRMs inserted, four (4) returned results outside 3SD. From those four (4) fails, two (2) were identified as gross outliers, and the issuer took actions to explain the cause of the abnormal values. One (1) was a case of the incorrect standard  recorded  in  the  database  (O460  instead  of  O464),  and  the  other  was  an inversion between two samples (710032 and 710033). The database was corrected, and the gross outliers were removed from the QA statistics when they were identified as QC failures.

<!-- image -->

The  overall  success  rate  was  98%  (Table  11-1).  Overall,  outliers  did  not  show  a persistent analytical bias (either below or above the 3SD limit). They were close to the 3SD  threshold  and  appeared  to  be  isolated  errors,  as  other  standards  and  blanks processed  from  the  same  batches  passed.  Consequently,  no  batch  re-runs  were performed.

Figure 11-1 shows an example of a control chart for the standard OREAS 464 assayed by Actlabs. A similar control chart was prepared for each CRM to visualize the analytical concentration value over time.

For the scandium, the results exhibit a positive bias in terms of accuracy with an average of +7.7% and a precision of around 2.2% for representative standards. The accuracy bias can be explained by the difference of analysis methods used by OREAS and by Actlabs. OREAS standard value was defined with acid digestion while Actlabs used ICP to analyze samples. As ICP is a more precise analysis method than acid digestion, we can expect a more complete evaluation of the scandium content.

For  the  REE,  the  results  exhibit  a  slight  negative  bias  in  terms  of  accuracy  with  an average of -1.9% and a precision around 3.1% for representative standards.

Both parameters meet standard industry criteria.

## 11.4.2 Blank samples

Contamination is monitored by the routine insertion of a barren sample (blank) which goes  through  the  same  sample  preparation  and  analytical  procedures  as  the  core samples.

A  total  of  49  blanks  were  inserted  in  the  batches  from  the  2019  to  2021  drilling programs.  The  blanks  were  supplied  by  OREAS.  The  blank  material  consists  of ornamental silica pebbles. The source deposit is situated in Carboniferous sedimentary rocks of the Maritimes Basin in New Brunswick. Blank material contents in Sc and La were defined by OREAS using aqua regia digest analysis method. Dy, Nd, Pr and Tb contents were not analyzed. A general guideline for success during a contamination QC program is a rate of 90% of blank assay results not exceeding the acceptance limits of three times (3x) the detection limit. The detection limit was 1 g/t for Sc and 10 g/t for La with the aqua regia digest analysis method.

<!-- image -->

For the 2019-2021 Program, no sample returned grades higher than 3x the detection limit for Sc and La (Table 11-2, Figure 11-2, Figure 11-3). For Dy, Nd, Pr and Tb, no values are available for the blank material; therefore, it is impossible to define a precise detection limit for those elements. However, we can note that the blank material's Dy, Nd, Pr and Tb results from Actlabs are all homogenous and very low grade.

## 11.4.3 Field duplicates

The 2019 Program included quarter-core duplicate samples to assess the presence of a 'nugget effect' or heterogeneity of mineralization within individual intervals of sampled drill core. The issuer inserted nine (9) quarter-core duplicates into the sample stream. The difference between the original analysis and the quarter-core duplicate analysis is presented in Table 11-3. Figure 11-4 shows the scatter plots for Sc.

Results show a good precision with R 2 =0.98 for Sc and an average of R 2 =0.98 for La, Pr, Nd, Tb and Dy. Results also show a good accuracy monitored by the linear regression line  for  all  studied  metals  (between  the  10%  tolerance  limit).  This  good  repeatability shows that Sc and REE distribution in the core seems homogenous.

## 12. DATA VERIFICATION

This item covers the data verification of the diamond drill hole databases supplied by the issuer (the 'Imperial Database'). The database close-out date for this Technical Report is July 09, 2021.

The author's data verification included visits to the Property, drill sites and core logging facilities, as well as an independent review of the data for selected drill holes (surveyor certificates, assay certificates, QA/QC  program  and  results, downhole  surveys, lithologies, alteration and structures).

## 12.1 Site visit

The author, Marina Iund, visited the Project and the issuer's core shack from May 7 to May 9, 2021. She was accompanied by Pierre Guay, the issuer's VP Exploration. The site visit focused on the TGZ mineralized domains. Onsite data verification included a general visual inspection of the property and a review of drill collar location coordinates. At the core shack, the author examined selected mineralized core intervals, reviewed the QA/QC program and the descriptions of lithologies, alteration and mineralization. She also performed independent check assays on selected intercepts.

## 12.2 Core Review

The core boxes are stored on pallets. The core boxes were found to be in good order and properly labelled, and the sample tags were still present. The wooden blocks at the beginning and end of each drill run were still in the boxes, and they matched the indicated footage  on  each  box.  The  author  validated  the  sample  numbers  and  confirmed  the presence of mineralization in the reference half-core samples (Figure 12.1).

The author selected representative mineralized intercepts and collected five (5) samples for  independent  assaying.  The  samples  are  quarter  splits,  sawed  by  the  issuer's contractor (Figure 12-1 G). The samples were placed in plastic bags, sealed with plastic zip ties and packed in rice bags for transport to the independent assaying laboratory. Marina Iund transported the samples to the AGAT laboratory facility in Quebec City.

The  results  of  the  independent  re-assaying  show  a  general  correlation  between  the original  and  re-assayed  scandium  and  REE  values.  All  five  (5)  mineralized  samples yielded subeconomic to economic values for the intercepts (Table 12-1).

The author believes the field duplicates from the independent resampling program are reliable and consistent with the database.

## 12.3 Databases

## 12.3.1 Drill hole locations

The drill hole collars from the 2019-2021 diamond drilling campaigns (the '2019-2021 Program') were surveyed by Corriveau J.L. &amp; Assoc. Inc. using a GPS base station.

The  author  confirmed  the  coordinates  of  eight  (8)  selected  surface  holes  using  a handheld GPS (Figure 12-2 and Table 12-2), then compared them to the database. All results had acceptable precision.

The collar locations in the Imperial Database are considered adequate and reliable.

## 13. MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING

The process flowsheet developed for the Crater Lake Project consists of crushing and milling, magnetic separation, high-pressure caustic leach, followed by hydrochloric acid leach, solvent extraction and co-electrowinning of Al and Sc from alumina (Al2O3) and Sc2O3 to produce Al-2%Sc master alloy. A mixed REE carbonate will be produced as a co-product.

Between 2018 and 2021, a number of metallurgical testing programs focused on the development of an extraction flowsheet for the Crater Lake Sc/REE mineralized samples were completed:

- · Phase 1 Metallurgical Development Program:
- o Mineralogy  and  scoping-level  evaluation  of  several  mineral  processing technologies for producing a Sc/REE mineral concentrate - SGS Mineral Services ('SGS'), Lakefield, Ontario, Canada (SGS, 2018; SGS, 2019a).
- · Phase 2 Metallurgical Development Program:
- o An investigation into the magnetic separation of samples from the Project - SGS (SGS, 2019b).
- o Mineralogy and bench-scale mineral processing program focused on the magnetic separation and flotation of two drill core bulk samples from the TG Zone to generate a Sc/REE mineral concentrate - M.Plan International Ltd ('M.Plan'), Hirschau, Germany (M.PLAN, 2019; M.PLAN, 2020a).
- · Phase 3 Metallurgical Development Program:
- o Hydrometallurgical  extraction  of  Sc/REE  -  M.Plan  (M.PLAN,  2020b; M.PLAN, 2020c).
- o Evaluation  of  carbochlorination  for  the  extraction  of  REE  and  Sc  from Crater  Lake  mineralization  -  Hazen  Research  Inc.  ('Hazen'),  Golden, Colorado, USA (Hazen, 2021).

## 13.1 Phase 1, Metallurgical Development Program - SGS

A mineralogical investigation was conducted on a small bulk sample of drill core from Quest's 2014 program (the 'Master Composite') and several core pieces at SGS from May  to  July  2018.  The  program  was  conducted  in  conjunction  with  a  scoping-level mineral beneficiation test program that was also conducted at SGS. The main objective of the mineralogical investigation was to determine the overall mineral assemblage, the elemental deportment of the scandium, and for the Master Composite, determine the liberation characteristics of the various minerals phases to aid the magnetic and gravity beneficiation program.

The  mineralogical  study  showed  that  the  Master  Composite  primarily  comprised  of pyroxene (36.2%) and olivine (25.6%) with moderate amounts of amphibole (13.1%) and K-feldspar  (9.7%),  and  minor  levels  of  plagioclase  (3.5%),  titanomagnetite  (4.3%), ilmenite (2.7%), britholite (1.8%), and zircon (1.8%). The electron microprobe analysis ('EMPA') and QEMSCAN deportment data revealed that about 82% of the scandium is hosted primarily by pyroxene and to a lesser extent (18%) in the amphiboles. The iron concentrations between the various silicates and oxides are variable.

This work was motivated by microprobe and mineralogical studies at McGill University, which showed that 100% of the scandium associated with the ferro-syenite unit is related

<!-- image -->

to a single mineral, Hedenbergite, a highly magnetic clinopyroxene mineral that should be amenable to concentration through magnetic separation techniques. This offers the possibility of a relatively low-cost initial production scenario involving near surface open pit mining and production of a scandium mineral concentrate at site.

Under  the  Phase  1  Metallurgical  Development  Program,  SGS  evaluated  a  series  of scoping-level mineral processing techniques, including Davis Tube  low-intensity magnetic separation ('LIMS'), Mozley Table (gravity separation), and wet high-intensity magnetic separation ('WHIMS').

SGS concluded the following based on the results of the Phase 1 scoping tests:

- · Among  the  grind  sizes  of  100%  passing  20 mesh  (850 µm),  35 mesh  (500 µm), 48 mesh (300 µm), and 150 mesh (105 µm), the finest grind size of 105 µm was found to perform best for the evaluated mineral processing techniques.
- · Magnetic  separation  was  identified  as  the  primary  process  technology  for  the recovery and concentration of scandium.
- · The Davis Tube was found to recover a fairly small amount of ferromagnetic material, likely titanomagnetite, achieving a titanium recovery of 40.8% with only 3.9% of the scandium.
- · WHIMS recovered the scandium-bearing minerals, pyroxene and amphiboles, but with  poor  selectivity  versus  olivine  in  the  ore.  The  finest  grind  that  was  tested (-105 µm) attained a scandium recovery of 78% in 57% of the mass.
- · Gravity separation on a Mozley Table recovered the majority of the zirconium (69%) in the sample, but achieved poor selectivity. A substantial amount of scandium (26%) was lost to the gravity concentrate.

## 13.2 Phase 2, Metallurgical Development Program

## 13.2.1 SGS

SGS completed its component of the Phase 2 Metallurgical Development Program on the Master Composite from October 2018 to March 2019, following the conclusion of Phase  1  test  program.  The  Phase  2  program  included  magnetic  separation,  gravity separation, and mineralogical analyses. The goal was to build on the results of the Phase 1  test  program  to  develop  a  preliminary  flowsheet  for  scandium  beneficiation,  with  a particular focus on the optimization of magnetic separation.

The target for the concentrate produced was the recovery of &gt;80% of the scandium in &lt;50% of the feed mass. A series of magnetic separation tests was conducted as part of the program, along with a handful of gravity separation tests on a Wilfley Table and a Mozley Table.

The following conclusions were drawn:

- · LIMS  is  an  important  pre-concentration  step  to  reject    the  majority  of  the  titanomagnetite in the sample, as well as a proportion of the ilmenite. Scandium losses to the LIMS magnetic concentrate were fairly low (~1.5%).
- · WHIMS tests in an Outotec SLon-100 resulted in a scandium upgrade at certain magnetic intensities. However, the selectivity of the WHIMS for scandium, against olivine in particular, remained a significant challenge.

<!-- image -->

- · The  WHIMS  operating  parameters  had  a  significant  impact  on  the  magnetic separation  test  results,  particularly  in  terms  of  the  mass  yield  to  the  magnetic concentrate  and  magnetic  intensity  at  which  different  minerals  were  captured. However, the highest scandium upgrade was consistently achieved in the magnetic concentrate generated at a magnetic intensity of 0.8 Tesla.
- · Gravity separation tests using a Wilfley Table and a Mozley Table displayed poor selectivity for scandium.  Gravity  separation  may  be  a  suitable  technique  to concentrate zircon from the sample.

## 13.2.2 M.Plan

In continuation of the physical processing flowsheet development of the Project, Imperial, in September 2019 commissioned M.Plan to undertake further metallurgical testwork on the mineralization from the recently discovered TGZ target M.Plan, based in Toronto, Ontario, is a joint venture of the metallurgical service group Dorfner ANZAPLAN GmbH (Germany) and the mining consultancy Micon International Limited.

The testwork was completed on two (2) drill core bulk samples collected from the TG Zone during the 2019 drilling program. The samples represent different mineralization types encountered in the zone, yielding a best assay of 474 g/t scandium oxide (Sc2O3) over 12.5 m in an interval grading 341 g/t Sc2O3 over 74.9 m.

Two  100-kg  samples,  MET1  and  MET2  from  the  TG  zone,  were  used  for  this  test program:

- · The MET1 sample represents a pyroxene-rich ferro-syenite with decimetric to metric clasts of pegmatitic or coarse-grained felsic syenite.
- · The MET2 sample represents an olivine-rich ferro-syenite with several centimetric clasts of fine-grained felsic syenite.

The objective of the current test work was to reject the major portion of olivine from the samples  by  testing  different separation  methods,  including  magnetic  separation, electrostatic separation and flotation. The testwork program consists of two parts:

- · Mineralogical characterization of both (MET1 and MET2) scandium-bearing samples
- · Physical processing of the samples, targeting the production of a highly concentrated scandium mineral concentrate.

## 13.2.2.1  Mineralogical Characterization

Polished sections, about 40 by 25 mm in size and about 25 µm thick, were prepared and petrographically analyzed. The samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction ('XRD'). Mineral liberation analysis ('MLA'), a quantitative analytical technique, was conducted using a scanning electron microscope ('SEM').

The  mineralogical  characterization  showed  that  the  MET1  sample  represents  a pyroxene-rich  ferro-syenite  with  decimetric  to  metric  clasts  of  pegmatitic  or  coarsegrained felsic syenite, which is interpreted to be the cumulate variety of the ferro-syenite. The MET2 sample represents an olivine-rich ferro-syenite with centimetric clasts of finegrained felsic syenite. It is interpreted to represent a more evolved variety. The studied

<!-- image -->

thin sections from each  sample  are  quite distinct, documenting  the  significant mineralogical and textural variability of these rocks.

The main mafic phases in both samples are yellow olivine (fayalite), green clinopyroxene (hedenbergite,  Figure  13-1),  brown  and  green  amphibole  (ferropargasite,  see  Figure 13-2), and opaque titanomagnetite and ilmenite. The main felsic phases are feldspars, micro-perthite and anorthoclase to albite, and especially red-brown biotite (annite) in the more  evolved  MET2  sample.  The  minor  to  accessory  igneous  and  possibly  latemagmatic-hydrothermal phases comprise zircon, apatite (always zoned and sometimes with britholite inclusions), various sulphides  (mostly  pyrrhotite, chalcopyrite, and sphalerite)  and  minor  graphite.  Texturally  late  alteration  phases  in  fractures  include calcite, mica, a series of unidentified Fe-rich silicates and a Ca-silicate.

The scandium content of samples MET1 and MET2 was 243 mg/kg and 238 mg/kg, respectively. The total rare earth element (TREE) content in MET1 was 4,330 mg/kg and 4,030  mg/kg  for  MET2,  respectively.  Scandium  was  depleted  in  the  fine  fraction  (0.02 mm) in both samples, while TREEs were enriched in this fraction.

XRD  analyses  showed  the  presence  of  pyroxene  (hedenbergite)  and  amphibole (ferrohornblende/  ferropargasite),  which  are  recognized  as  the  Sc-bearing  minerals. Different  feldspars,  namely  albite,  microcline  and  anorthoclase,  fayalite  and  mica (biotite), were identified as main components. Ilmenite, magnetite and the REE-bearing phases (hydroxyl-)apatite and zircon were also identified in the samples.

Based on MLA, the modal mineralogy of the samples was determined (Figure 13-3). Scandium-bearing minerals pyroxene and amphibole were found to account for approx. 30 wt. % in all samples, while pyroxene (15 to 20 wt.-%) dominates over amphibole (9 to 14  wt.-%).  The  most  dominant  gangue  mineral  in  both  MET1  and  MET2  samples  is anorthoclase (23 to 29 wt.-%), a Na-Ca-rich 'ternary' K-feldspar. MET1 was found to contain K-feldspar (23 wt.-%) as the second most dominant phase; in MET2, fayalite (15 and 19 wt.-%), an iron-bearing olivine, is very prominent.

Mineral locking was determined for samples +0.02 -0.1 mm and +0.1 - 0.3 mm of MET1 and MET2. The amount of unlocked minerals was low. In both samples, approximately 65% pyroxene and amphibole in fraction +0.02  -0.1 mm and about 40 to 50 wt% in

fraction +0.1 -0.3 mm were unlocked, with the remainder of scandium-bearing pyroxene and amphibole being mostly intergrown with each other.

## 13.2.2.2  Mineral Processing

Various mineral processing technologies including sensor-based ore sorting, as well as magnetic, density and electrostatic separation techniques and flotation were evaluated under this program for the production of Sc-REE bearing mineral concentrate from MET1 and MET2 samples.

MET1 and MET2 samples were crushed in a jaw crusher and further grain size reduction of  the  samples  was  achieved  by  a  double  roll  mill.  The  gap  between  both  rolls  was adjusted step by step after every passage of coarse material. The gap width was set between 1 mm at the beginning and 0.2 mm at the end of the comminution sequence. After each passage through the mill, the ground sample was screened to separate the product fractions. The oversized material was added to the next grinding step. Dry and wet  screening  was  applied  to  separate  various  particle  size  fractions.  The  screening machine was equipped with removable screening decks. Screen cloths made of steel were used. For desliming of fraction -0.1 mm, a 1 inch diameter hydrocyclone was used and for desliming of fraction -0.15 mm, a 50 mm diameter hydrocyclone was deployed.

## Magnetic Separation: LIMS and WHIMS

A low intensity, SALA type wet drum magnetic separator, was used for the LIMS tests. The maximum magnetic field of the low intensity magnetic separator is 110 mT.

For WHIMS, a wet magnetic separator manufactured by Eriez Magnetics was used to run the tests. The nominal maximum magnetic field of the magnetic separator was 2 T.

## Flotation

Three  (3)  and  five  (5)  litre  laboratory  flotation  cells  manufactured  by  HUMBOLDT WEDAG was used for the flotation tests. SM15 collector was the main flotation reagent. Flotation pH was adjusted with the addition of sulphuric acid and acidified water glass ('AWG') or sodium silicate was used as the depressant.

## Electrostatic Separation

Minerals can be separated by electrostatic (high tension) method due to differences in surface  conductivity.  A  pilot  plant  free  fall  electrostatic  separator  was  used.  The electrostatic field of 70 kV was generated by an electrostatic generator. The feed material was  initially  heated  in  some  tests  to  temperatures  up  to  200°C  and  dosed  with  a preheated vibration feeder to feed the electrostatic separator. In one test, the material was activated  by  heating  the  sample  and  by  the  addition  of  diluted  acid  to  the  feed material prior to heating.

## Heavy Liquid Separation ('HLS')

Fraction +0.8 -6 mm was used for HLS testing. Prior to HLS tests, the sample material was washed to remove adherent fines to minimize contamination of the heavy liquid solution. HLS test work was carried out using sodium metatungstate as heavy medium. The liquid SG was adjusted downwards or upwards by diluting with water or by boiling off  excess  water  respectively.  The  SG  of  the  sodium  metatungstate  solution  was adjusted to 2.85 g/cm3.

## Sensor-based Ore Sorting

Twenty-five (25) rock pieces from each ore type (MET-01 and MET-02) were used for bench scale testing. Each rock sample was assigned an identification number and tested with  regards  to  sensor  response  in  optical  (colour)  and  X-ray  transmission  ('XRT') analysis in cooperation with TOMRA Sorting, one of the most advanced providers of sensor-based sorting solutions in the world.

For the colour camera analyses, a high-resolution photo of each sample was taken. The COLOUR image of each sample was then analyzed using TOMRA's image-processing software. This analyzing technique is restricted to surface features, and requires clean surfaces making a washing step prior to colourmetric sorting mandatory. The material was discriminated with reference to brightness, colour and other geometric features such as size and shape.

For the XRT analysis, the samples were exposed to high energy X rays, thus allowing the sensor on the opposite side of the sample to detect transmitted X-rays. The X-ray sensor  signal  depends  on  the  atomic  density  and  material  thickness  and  yields information  about  the  chemical  composition  of  the  particles.  This  method  does  not require  washing  the  mineral  surface  for  it  to  be  effective.  Using  TOMRA's  imageprocessing software, changes in the intensity of X-ray passing through the samples are classified, either as high atomic density or low atomic density.

## Test Results

The  individual  fractions  +0.1  -0.3  mm  and  +0.02  -0.1  mm  of  MET-01  sample  were subjected to separate beneficiation tests. Flotation, magnetic separation and electrostatic separation were applied to fraction +0.1 0.3 mm. Electrostatic separation was shown to be unselective regarding the scandium bearing minerals (hedenbergite

<!-- image -->

and  ferrohornblende).  Due  to  the  favourable  liberation  of  pay  minerals  in  the  finer fraction, the focus in processing was on flotation and magnetic separation of fraction +0.02 -0.1 mm.

WHIMS tests in fraction +0.02 -0.1 mm showed that a magnetic field strength of 0.2 T was sufficient to separate the scandium bearing minerals in the magnetic fraction, while feldspars,  being  the  major  gangue  mineral,  reported  to  the  nonmagnetic  fraction, resulting in a magnetic fraction containing 94 wt.-% of the scandium in 53 wt.-% of the feed  mass.  Scandium  and  TREE  recoveries  and  their  upgrade  factors  for  tested magnetic field strengths are presented in Figure 13-4. While a magnetic field strength of 0.2 T was sufficient to recover scandium at a high upgrade factor, a higher magnetic field strength of 0.8 T was necessary to separate apatite, the main REE bearing mineral, together with the scandium bearing minerals to the magnetic fraction. Further increase of the magnetic field strength (1.5 T) did not result in an additional increase of recoveries nor a significant improvement to the upgrading of scandium and TREE.

Flotation kinetic tests showed that Flotinor SM15, a phosphoric acid ester as the main flotation collector reagent had the highest selectivity for the scandium bearing minerals. In the first thirty seconds of a kinetic flotation test with SM15 collector, a concentrate of 49 wt.-% of the mass was separated containing 80 wt.-% of the scandium, resulting in a scandium upgrade factor of 1.63.

In an attempt to simplify the flow sheet, fractions +0.02 -0.15 mm and -0.02 mm were tested besides fractions +0.1 -0.3 mm, +0.02 -0.1 mm and -0.02 mm. LIMS, WHIMS and flotation were applied to fraction +0.02 -0.15 mm while fraction -0.02 mm was subjected to wet high intensity magnetic separation only.

<!-- image -->

MET1 sample response  to  the  following  processing  options  which  combine  different beneficiation methods was evaluated.

- · LIMS  followed  by  WHIMS  of  +0.01  -0.15  mm  size  fraction  combined  with  the magnetic  stream from WHIMS of -0.02mm fraction
- · LIMS, followed by cleaner flotation of +0.01  -0.15 mm size classification plus the magnetic product of -0.02 mm fraction.
- · Flotation  only  of  fraction  +0.02  -0.15  mm  combined  with  the  magnetic  product  of WHIMS for -0.02 mm fraction.

The mass pull and recoveries of scandium and TREE to mineral concentrate for the different  processing  options  and  the  upgrade  factors  for  scandium  and  TREE  are presented in Table 13-1.

Table 13-1 - Sc and TREE  Recoveries and Upgrade Factor for process options for fraction -0.15 mm, MET1

| Mineral  Beneficiation  Techniques   | Recovery      | Recovery    | Recovery      | Upgrade factor    | Upgrade factor       |
|--------------------------------------|---------------|-------------|---------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| Mineral  Beneficiation  Techniques   | Mass  (Wt.-%) | Sc  (Wt.-%) | TREE  (Wt.-%) | Sc Upgrade Factor | TREE Upgrade  Factor |
| LIMS +WHIMS                          | 38.8          | 87.5        | 67.9          | 2.3               | 1.8                  |
| LIMS + Flotation                     | 39.6          | 81.9        | 70.4          | 2.1               | 1.8                  |
| Flotation+ WHIMS                     | 45.6          | 82.8        | 87.9          | 1.8               | 1.9                  |

The combination of LIMS and WHIMS (Option 1) represents the simplest of the three considered options as it involves magnetic separation only and does not require addition of any chemicals. It results in a scandium recovery of 87.5 wt.-% and an upgrade factor of 2.3. TREE recovery was 67.9 wt.-% at an upgrade factor of 1.8. With this option, only magnetic  separation  at  different  magnetic  field  strengths  is  required.  The  slimes (-0.02 mm) fraction can be treated together with the nonmagnetic product from LIMS of +0.02 -0.15 mm size classification in the wet high intensity magnetic circuit.

The option of combining LIMS with cleaner flotation for fraction +0.02  -0.15 mm and WHIMS of fraction -0.02 mm (Option 2) involves both magnetic separation and flotation thus presenting a more complicated flow sheet requiring the addition of acid and flotation agents in the flotation step. It resulted in a scandium recovery of 81.9 wt.-% and upgrade factor of 2.1. TREE recovery at the identical upgrade factor of 1.8 was slightly higher (70.4  wt.-%)  for  Option  2  compared  to  magnetic  separation  only  (Option  1).  Two processing steps (LIMS and flotation) were applied to fraction +0.02 -0.15 mm and a third  processing  step  (WHIMS)  to  fraction  -0.02  mm.  Due  to  the  higher  scandium recovery and reduced complexity of magnetic separation only, the combination of LIMS and WHIMS (Option 1) is favourable compared to Option 2 which involves the integration of flotation after LIMS.

Option 3 in which cleaner flotation only was applied to fraction +0.02  -0.15 mm and WHIMS was applied to the slime fraction -0.02 mm presents a combination exhibiting a reduced complexity of the flow sheet compared to Option 2, but still requires the use of acid and flotation reagents. Option 3 achieved relatively high scandium recovery of 82.8-

<!-- image -->

wt. % and a significantly superior TREE recovery of 87.9 wt.-% in comparison to Options 1 and 2. The mass rejection for this option is lower, resulting in reduced upgrade factors of 1.8 for scandium and 1.9 for TREE.

For both options including flotation (Options 2 and 3), recovery rates are based on the cleaner concentrate of the third cleaner stage, without considering recirculation of the cleaner tailings. Recirculation of cleaner tailings has a good potential for the optimization of scandium and TREE recovery. Locked Cycle Tests ('LCT') are recommended as a next step in order to determine yield optimization potential.

Beneficiation tests for MET2 were based on the results of tests completed on MET-01 sample. For MET2, the tests were also carried out on different size fractions. Flotation and magnetic separation were applied to fraction +0.02 -0.1 mm.

WHIMS tests showed that a magnetic field strength of 0.2 T was sufficient to separate the Scandium bearing minerals to a magnetic product from MET2 sample. In comparison to MET1, the feldspar content in MET2 was lower while the amount of fayalite present in MET2 was higher than in MET1. Since fayalite shows magnetic properties, in contrast to feldspar, a higher mass pull to the magnetic product fraction was achieved compared to MET1, resulting in a magnetic fraction containing 95.9 wt.-% of the scandium in 70.1 wt.% of the  feed mass.  Scandium  and  TREE  recoveries  and  upgrade factors  at  higher magnetic field strengths are presented in Figure 13-5. The general effects of WHIMS on MET1  are  also  true  for  MET2.  While  0.2  T  was  sufficient  to  separate  most  of  the scandium bearing minerals, 0.8 T was needed to separate the TREE bearing mineral apatite to the magnetic fraction as well.

Flotation kinetic tests on MET2 sample showed that SM15 reagent collector presents the highest selectivity regarding the scandium bearing minerals. In the first thirty seconds, a concentrate  of  55.6  wt.-%  of  the  mass  was  separated  containing  66.7  wt.-%  of  the scandium.  The  scandium  recovery  was  significantly  reduced  compared  to  the  same flotation  scheme  applied  to  ore  type  MET1,  which  was  due  to  a  slightly  different mineralogical  composition  and  the  reduced  mineral  liberation  in  MET2  compared  to MET1.

In order to simplify the flow sheet, fractions +0.02 -0.15 mm and -0.02 mm were tested. Two processing options were considered for MET-02 sample:

- · LIMS of +0.02 -0.15 mm fraction followed by WHIMS of the magnetic product from LIMS and slime fraction -0.02mm.
- · Cleaner flotation of fraction +0.02 -0.15 mm combined with WHIMS of the slimes (0.02 mm fraction).

The response of MET2 sample to different processing options are presented in Tables 13.3 and 13.4. The combination of LIMS and WHIMS (Option 1) resulted in a scandium recovery of 77.8 wt.-% and upgrade factor of 1.5. TREE recovery was 57.5 wt.-% at an upgrade factor of 1.1.

In the Option 2, flotation only was applied to fraction +0.02 -0.15 mm and WHIMS was used  to  process  the  slimes  (-0.02  mm).  Compared  to  the  combination  of  LIMS  and WHIMS only (Option 1), acid and flotation reagents have to be used. Flotation of fraction +0.02 -0.15 mm and WHIMS processing of the slimes (fraction -0.02 mm) resulted in a similar scandium recovery of 74.1 wt.-% but at significantly increased TREE recovery of 83.3  wt.-%.  The  mass  reduction  for  both  options  is  similar,  resulting  in  comparable upgrade factors of 1.5 for scandium but at significantly superior upgrade of 1.6 for TREE due to the increased TREE recovery with flotation.

Table 13-2 - Sc and TREE  Recoveries and Upgrade Factor for process options for fraction -0.15 mm, MET2

| Mineral  Beneficiation  Techniques   | Recovery      | Recovery    | Recovery      | Upgrade factor      | Upgrade factor       |
|--------------------------------------|---------------|-------------|---------------|---------------------|----------------------|

| Flotation + WHIMS                    | 50.9          | 74.1        | 83.3          | 1.5                 | 1.6                  |

In contrast to the flotation tests carried out for ore type MET1, AWG, a mixture of 80% sodium silicate and 20% oxalic acid was used in the flotation step as depressant for MET2 sample. The aim of using AWG was to depress fayalite, as shown in the work of Yang et al. (2016) for the case of ilmenite flotation. In the case of MET2 flotation with SM15 as collector, AWG was not effective in depressing fayalite, but was successful in limiting  the  amount  of  magnetite  that  deported  to  the  Sc-REE  mineral  concentrate. Therefore, a combination of LIMS and flotation in case of MET2 was not necessary. AWG depressant could be tested on MET1 sample to depress magnetite instead of using LIMS as a separate processing step in order to reduce the complexity of the flow sheet and to

increase the scandium recovery, in case flotation is selected as the preferred option to increase the yield of both TREE and scandium.

Recovery rates of the flotation process are based on the cleaner concentrate of the third cleaner  stage,  not  considering  recirculation  of  the  cleaner  tailings.  Recirculation  of cleaner tailings present a potential for the optimization of scandium and TREE recovery. LCT  are  recommended  as  a  next  step  in  order  to  determine  the  potential  for  yield improvement.

As a pre-concentration step, HLS was used to check the general suitability of dense media separation in lab scale. HLS was applied to fraction +0.8 -6 mm of ore type MET1. For this fraction a scandium recovery of 90.6 wt.-% was achieved at an upgrade factor of  2.1.  TREE  recovery  was  89.2 wt.-%  at  an  upgrade  factor  of  2.0.  Dense  media separation ('DMS') is mainly used as a first concentration method prior to flotation and/or magnetic separation. HLS resulted in similar upgrade factors compared to flotation and magnetic separation at high recoveries for both, scandium and TREE. Therefore, DMS could be an option to serve as single option used in fraction +0.8 -6 mm or as a preconcentration  step  prior  to  magnetic  separation  and/or  flotation.  In  both  cases,  for concentration  of  fraction  -0.8  mm  magnetic  separation  and/or  flotation  must  be considered. Since HLS in lab scale was performed under ideal conditions, a DMS test is strongly recommended to verify recoveries and mass reduction that can be expected at industrial scale.

Colourmetric  and  XRT  sensors  were  tested  on  a  bench  scale  sensor-based  sorting program.  Good  results  were  achieved  with  both  sensors,  however  XRT  showed  an enhanced waste detection and therefore better potential for the scandium ore sorting. For classification, a cut-off grade of 100 mg/kg scandium was applied. By using XRT methodology all 38 product species were classified correctly by the sensor. Only one out of 12 waste pieces was erroneously referred to the product fraction. COLOUR sensor referred  all  the  38  product  samples  to  the  right  group  but  missed  2  waste  species recognizing them as product. An additional advantage of XRT sorting is that, in contrast to colourmetric sorting, no water is required to clean the surface of the particles as the bulk of the mineral sample is probed.

In order to present the correlation of XRT sensor response and scandium grade, images visualizing XRT sensor response are presented in Figure 7 with scandium grade (in ppm) indicated for the individual rock pieces. Blue colour represents high density, while red colour represents low density. The higher the blue portion in the XRT sensor response, the higher the scandium grade. XRT sorting perhaps has a good potential to be used as a stand-alone processing option or as a pre-concentration step at coarser particle size prior  to  further  comminution  and  upgrading  of  the  scandium  grade  by  other  mineral processing techniques.

In  summary,  the  mineral  processing  test  program  completed  as  part  of  Phase  2 metallurgical  development  by  M.Plan  confirmed  that  pyroxene  (hedenbergite)  and amphibole (ferrohornblende/ ferropargasite) are the only scandium bearing minerals in the mineralization. Different feldspars, namely albite, microcline and anorthoclase,  as well  as  fayalite  and  mica  (biotite)  were  identified  as  main  components.  Ilmenite, magnetite and the REE bearing phases (hydroxyl-) apatite and zircon were also identified in the samples.

A Sc mineral concentrate can be produced from Crater Lake mineralization by using simple low-cost magnetic separation techniques. A combination of LIMS and WHIMS produced a mineral concentrate yielding 88% Sc recovery as well 69% recovery of TREE for MET1. A combination of LIMS and WHIMS on MET2 sample with differing mineralogy also yielded 78% Sc and 56% TREE. Additional test work utilizing Sensor-based ore sorting  and  HLS  methods  confirm  that  XRT  sensor-based  sorting  and  DMS  offer additional  low-cost  alternatives  for  inexpensively  producing  a  mineral  concentrate without the need of grinding, chemical reagents or extensive water consumption. DMS separation yielded recoveries of 90.6% Sc and 89.2% TREE in the mineral concentrate.

## 13.3 Phase 3, Metallurgical Development Program (Hydrometallurgy)

In  July  2020,  Imperial  engaged  M.Plan to  carry  out  the  Phase  3  of  the  metallurgical development program. This program was focused on the development of an efficient

<!-- image -->

hydrometallurgical  process  to  recover  a  high-purity  scandium  oxide  product  from  the scandium-rich mineral concentrates.

The Phase 3 Metallurgical Development program consists of:

- · Bulk production of representative magnetic concentrate products from the MET1 and MET2 composite samples to be used in subsequent downstream hydrometallurgical flowsheet development.
- · Development of a hydrometallurgical flowsheet for the extraction of scandium into a scandium oxide product and REE into a bulk mixed REE concentrate.

## 13.3.1 Bulk mineral processing

Two mineralized MET1 and MET2 composites, weighing 100 kg each, were submitted for bulk processing to produce Sc/REE mineral concentrate for downstream hydrometallurgical  test  program.  MET1  composite  graded  180  g/t  scandium  and 2,735 g/t TREE, whereas the MET2 composite graded 150 g/t scandium and 3,307 g/t TREE. Jaw and roll crushing to 100% passing 3 mm was completed prior to blending and splitting into 10 kg test charges. A single confirmatory test charge of each composite was ball mill ground to 100% passing 150 microns subjected to magnetic separation, first by  LIMS  and  then  WHIMS  of  the  LIMS  non-magnetics.  Once  the  response  of  the composites was confirmed, the remaining 90 kg of each sample was processed through the same scheme.

A summary of the head assay results including whole rock analysis and an ICP scan for the two samples used in this program is presented in Table 13-3. Composite head grades from MET1 and MET2 samples evaluated in the Phase 2 program are also provided for comparison.

LIMS test work completed on -150 µm grind particle size of MET1 and MET2 samples indicated  that  an  iron  rich  fraction  could  be  generated  that  is  low  in  scandium, representing approximately 7% of the initial sample mass. WHIMS test work at 0.8 T confirmed that high scandium recoveries could be achieved to a magnetic concentrate with up to 50% of the mass rejected to the non-magnetics.

The results of the magnetic separation tests for the 10 kg test charges of composites MET1 and MET2 are presented in Table 13-4 and Table 13-5.

Low  intensity  magnetic  separation  yielded  comparable  mass  recoveries  for  both composites  of  approximately  7.0%.  The  main  component  of  the  LIMS  magnetic concentrate  appears  to  be  iron  minerals,  with  Fe2O3  grades  of  74.1%  and  75.3%. Scandium grade in LIMS concentrates was well below the head grade, whereas the TREE grade was close to that observed for the head samples.

WHIMS separation of the LIMS magnetic tailings was carried out in two passes, at 0.2 T and 0.8 T. Both passes resulted an upgrading of scandium to the magnetic fraction, with

combined scandium recoveries of approximately 90%. For MET1, 61% of the scandium was recovered in the first pass at 0.2 T, and an additional 31% was recovered from the first pass tailings at the higher intensity of 0.8 T. The scandium recovery for MET2 was essentially evenly split between the two passes.

Mass rejected to non-magnetic tailings was 50% for MET1 and 33% for MET2. As a result,  MET1  achieved  a  better  upgrade  ratio,  reaching  381 g/t  scandium  for  the combined WHIMS concentrate, compared to 244 g/t scandium for MET2. Only minor upgrading of TREE to the concentrate was observed for either composite.

Based on the positive results achieved with the 10 kg batch tests, the remaining 90 kg of sample was processed through a similar flowsheet consisting of a LIMS separation followed by a single pass through the WHIMS at 0.8 T. Results of the 90 kg tests are presented in Table 13-6 and Table 13-7 respectively for MET1 and MET2 samples.

The  90  kg  tests  achieved  very  similar  mass  recoveries  and  grades  to  the  LIMS concentrate. For both samples, scandium and TREE recoveries to the single WHIMS concentrate were slightly better than those observed for the combined concentrate in the 10 kg tests. Improved recovery may be the result of longer running time (minimization of start/end effects). Compared to the Phase 2 test results, the upgrading of scandium to concentrate for MET1 was lower in the present program, however, the recovery was

higher despite the lower initial head grade of the samples. This suggests that the two results may lie on the same grade-recovery curve. For composite MET2, the scandium recovery and gangue rejection realized in the present program was virtually identical to that of the Phase 2 program.

Development  programs  for  further  optimization  of  the  mineral  processing  flowsheet including evaluation of sensor ore sorting technology at large scale, removal of olivine, and  fine-tuning  the  relationship  between  particle  size,  magnetic  field  strength  and concentrate's scandium grade and recovery are planned for the near future.

## 13.3.2 Hydrometallurgical flowsheet development - M.Plan

## 13.3.2.1  Primary leach solution

The bulk mineral concentrates prepared from MET1 and MET2 samples were used as feed for the Sc/REE hydrometallurgical flowsheet development program conducted at M.Plan laboratory in Hirschau, Germany. The objective of the program was to develop an efficient hydrometallurgical process to recover a high-purity scandium oxide product and a mixed REE concentrate.

The  following  mineral  decomposition  methods  were  tested  at  bench  scale  to  extract scandium from the mineral concentrate and ore samples:

- · Acid bake of mineral concentrate with concentrated sulphuric acid at a temperature range of 250°C to 300°C, followed by water leach of the acid bake calcine.
- · Heap leach of ore sample crushed to -6 mm in 20 wt-% sulphuric acid solution at ambient temperature and at 60°C for several weeks.
- · High pressure acid leach of mineral concentrate in aqueous sulphuric acid solution at temperature greater than 150°C in an autoclave.
- · Caustic (NaOH and/or Na2CO3) roasting of concentrate at 900°C, followed by water leach and wash at 90°C. The resulting residue from the roast - water leach stage was subsequently leached in mineral acid.
- · High pressure caustic ('HPC') leach of concentrate, followed by water wash and mineral acid leach of the solid residues from the caustic leach stage.

While apatite, the major REE-bearing  mineral  in the concentrates, was  easily decomposed with most of the method listed above, yielding REE extraction in the range of  43%  to  74%  to  primary  leach  solution  ('PLS'),  the  decomposition  of  Sc-bearing minerals, ferro-hornblende and hedenbergite, was quite challenging, with Sc recovery to PLS less than 5%.

The Sc-bearing minerals remained largely unaffected by acidic decomposition methods. Scandium extraction to PLS for acid bake - water leach was very low at less than 5%. Only  heap  leaching  and  high-pressure  acid  leach  are  the  two  acid  decomposition methods that showed Sc recoveries above 20 wt-% but below 50 wt.-%.

A caustic roast, followed by a mineral acid leach of the solid residue, also showed very poor Sc extraction between 18 wt-% and 25 wt-%, while REE extractions to PLS were also poor between 23 wt-% and 46 wt-%.

A high-pressure leach, followed by a mineral acid leach of the solid residues, showed remarkable recovery of scandium and the REE from Crater Lake Sc/REE mineralization:

- · The method showed scandium recovery to PLS of 91 wt-% for MET1, and 84% for MET2 mineral concentrates.
- · The  recovery  of  TREE  including  yttrium  (TREE+Y)  of  94  wt-%  and  83  wt-% respectively for MET1 and MET2 samples.
- · The high recoveries of Sc and TREE+Y from both samples show that the method has excellent  efficacy  in  extracting  Sc  and  REE  from  samples  representing  different mineralization.

## 13.3.2.2   Solvent Extraction ('SX') / Ion Exchange ('IX')

The bench scale development of the Sc/REE recovery flowsheet by SX and/or IX from Sc/REE primary leach solution is ongoing at M.Plan at the time of writing this report. Extraction  shake-out  tests  for  reagent  screening  were  completed  on  four  organic reagents diluted in kerosene. The organic reagents tested for extracting Sc from the hydrochloric  acid  leach  solution  include  D2EHPA,  TBP,  Cyanex  272,  and  TOPO. D2EHPA, plus TBP as the modifier and Cyanex 272 are the reagents that have shown remarkable Sc extraction, while Cyanex 272 appears to have better selectivity for Sc over the REE.

Purolite MTS9300, a polystyrenic macroporous, iminodiacetic acid chelating resin with high capacity was the IX resin tested under this program. Two-stage scrubbing of the loaded resin was performed with 2 moles HCl solution and water.

Ethylenediaminetetraacetic  acid  (EDTA)  was  used  as  the  stripping  agent.  Initial evaluation showed that the loading capacity of MTS9300 IX resin was inferior to the three of the SX extraction reagents that were tested, hence further development work on IX was discontinued.

The loaded organic from the SX reagent screening tests was used in a series of scoping level scrubbing tests which focused on the removal of co-extracted impurities such as iron, titanium, magnesium, calcium, potassium and aluminum. Two moles of sulphuric acid, plus 5% hydrogen peroxide (2M H2SO4 + 5% H2O2), oxalic acid and 120 g/L NaCl salt solutions were the scrubbing reagents tested on D2EHPA, TOPO, Cyanex 272, and TBP. For the TBP reagent, 130 g/L magnesium nitrate (Mg(NO3)2) solution was tested in place of the NaCl salt solution. The data showed that the best scrubbing regime that provided adequate impurity removal without significant loss of scandium is sulphuric acid plus hydrogen peroxide at ambient temperature.

It  is  well  known  that  scandium  is  difficult  to  strip  from  D2EHPA.  Others  have  used different stripping agents, including ammonium bifluoride, phosphoric acid and sodium hydroxide solution to strip scandium from loaded organics. It was decided to focus on sodium hydroxide as the preferred stripping reagent, hence several concentrations of sodium hydroxide are being tested for stripping scandium from the organic at the time of writing this report. The REE remaining in the SX raffinate will be precipitated as a mixed REE carbonate product with sodium carbonate.

Optimization of the hydrometallurgical flowsheet will be completed in future development programs, prior to the commencement of the pilot program.

## 13.3.3 Carbochlorination of Crater Lake mineral concentrate - Hazen

The carbochlorination technique, similar to the technology used in the titanium industry to produce titanium pigment from titanium slag, was explored as an alternative process for extracting scandium and REE from Crater Lake mineral concentrate. Carbochlorination  of  Crater  Lake  mineral  concentrate  and  aqueous  leaching  of  the calcine was tested at Hazen from April to July 2021.

About 5 kg of MET2 mineral concentrate produced at M.Plan for the hydrometallurgical development program was used for this program. The techniques for extracting REE and refractory  metals,  such  as  titanium  by  carbochlorination  have  been  developed  and practiced at an industrial scale for decades. The concept of the process is that at 800°C or higher, the majority of the metals in the mineral concentrate can be easily converted to  chlorides.    The  chloride  of  impurity  metals  such  as  iron,  titanium,  phosphorous, aluminum, silica and zirconium have low boiling points (less than 340°C) and are quite volatile,  which  allows  them  to  be  easily  separated  from  scandium  and  REE.  The summary of carbochlorination experiments on MET2 mineral concentrate is presented in Table 13-9, and the response of payable metals and major impurities to chlorination temperature is presented in Figure 13-7 and Figure 13-8.

The program findings are summarized below:

- · Scandium mainly reported to the gas phase together with zirconium and titanium after carbochlorination for 2 hours or longer. While Sc and REE chlorination rates rose with increased temperature, Sc chlorination rates were relatively low at less than 60% at temperatures up to 1000°C.
- · The chlorination conversion of Sc was below expectation.  This is attributed to its coexistence  with  silicates  in  the  concentrate  since  the  Sc-bearing  pyroxene  and amphibole  are  silicates.    The  low  reactivity  and  dense  structure  of  the  silicate particles probably hindered the extraction of Sc by carbochlorination.
- · The REE were relatively easily converted into their chlorides and were recovered into primary  leach  solution  by  leaching  the  calcine  with  dilute  HCl  solution.  The  REE chlorination rates increased with increasing temperature, from 78% at 700°C to 93% at 1000°C after 2 hours of chlorination.
- · A substantial amount of the major impurities such as Al, Si, Fe, and Mn were removed as volatile chlorides into the gas phase.  Their concentration in the primary leach solution was low, which resulted in fairly clean PLS with very low impurity content, from which a mixed REE product can easily be produced. The concentration of Mn and Fe in the  primary  leach  solution  decreases  with  increasing  carbochlorination temperature.
- · An  increase  in  carbochlorination  temperature  and  reaction  time  is  beneficial  for improving  the  chlorination  conversion  of  Sc,  but  this  also  results  in  more  REE chlorides deporting to the gas phase.

## 13.4 Process Flowsheet Selection

The process selected for the production of high-grade scandium oxide and mixed REE products  is  based  on  the  metallurgical  development  programs  completed  by  M.Plan between 2019 and 2021. The flowsheet consists of crushing and milling of the  ROM materials,  followed  by  magnetic  separation,  using  LIMS  and  WHIMS  techniques  to generate  a  Sc/REE-rich  mineral  concentrate.  The  mineral  concentrate  is  processed through high-pressure caustic leach to liberate scandium from the Sc-bearing silicate minerals.  The  solid  residue  from  the  HPC  process  containing  the  Sc  and  REE  is subsequently leached with hydrochloric acid solution to extract the Sc/REE content into a primary leach solution. Scandium is extracted from the PLS with solvent extraction, while  REE  remaining  in  the  SX  raffinate  is  precipitated  as  a  mixed  REE  carbonate product.

The scandium SX will use organophosphorus extractant (D2EHPA or Cyanex 272) to recover Sc into the organic phase. The Sc-loaded organic will be scrubbed with a solution of sulphuric acid plus hydrogen peroxide to remove impurity metals that co-extract with Sc. Scandium is stripped from the scrubbed organic with concentrated sodium hydroxide solution. The stripped scandium hydroxide is re-leached in mineral acid from where it is precipitated with oxalic acid. The scandium oxalate is calcined to produce a high-grade 99.9% scandium oxide product that can be used for the production of Al-2%Sc master alloy.

The Al-2%Sc master alloy production technology will be based on co-electrowinning of Al and Sc from alumina (Al2O3) and Sc2O3 to form a master alloy. This method offers higher recovery of scandium (90%-95%) and improved energy efficiency as it can be

performed at a lower temperature, and it minimizes the formation of intermetallic with high Sc content in comparison to the aluminothermic method, which is the current stateof-the-art technology for Al-2%Sc master alloy production.

## 13.5 Future Metallurgical Development Programs

Most of the processes in the flowsheet have been tested at bench scale. The mineral processing flowsheet, the high-pressure caustic leach and the hydrochloric acid leach for Sc dissolution have all been tested. At the time of writing, work is ongoing on the hydrometallurgical recovery of Sc and REE from PLS at M.Plan. Another hydrometallurgical program focused on finalizing the Sc SX circuit and optimizing Sc solubilization processes is currently being planned to start in the fourth quarter of 2021 or early 2022. The Al-2%Sc  master alloy development work focused on coelectrowinning of alumina and Sc2O3 is planned to start in 2022.

Imperial  Mining  Group  has  collected  16 t  of  sample  from  Crater  Lake  as  part  of  the planned 50 t sample to feed its planned pilot programs. The pilot plant sample will feed a mineral processing pilot program which will focus on producing a Sc/REE-rich mineral concentrate.  The  Sc/REE  mineral  concentrate  will  feed  the  hydrometallurgy  pilot program, commencing in 2022.

Metallurgical development programs currently planned to start in the next six months are summarized in Table 13-10.

## 14. MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATES

The  mineral  resource  estimate  for  the  Crater  Lake  Project  (the  '2021  MRE')  was prepared by Marina Iund, P.Geo., Paul Daigle, P.Geo., and Carl Pelletier, P.Geo., using all available information.

The studied area covers the mineralized domains collectively known as the TGZ target.

The 2021 MRE was established for scandium, lanthanum, praseodymium, neodymium, terbium and dysprosium. Other REEs were not included in the estimate.

The effective date of the 2021 MRE is September 17, 2021.

## 14.1 Methodology

The resource area has a NE-SW strike length of 500 m, a width of 120 m, and a vertical extent of 250 m below the surface. The 2021 MRE was based on a compilation of recent diamond drill holes ('DDH') completed by the issuer.

The 2021 MRE was prepared using Leapfrog GEO 2021.1 ('Leapfrog') and GEOVIA Surpac 2021 ('Surpac') software. Leapfrog was used for the 3D geological modelling. Surpac was used for the estimation,  which  consisted  of  3D  block  modelling  and  the inverse distance square ('ID2') interpolation method. Statistical, capping and variography  studies  were  completed  using  Snowden  Supervisor  v8.13  and  Microsoft Excel software.

The main steps in the methodology were as follows:

- · Review and validation of the database;
- · Validation of the geological model and interpretation of the mineralized units;
- · Validation of the drill hole intercepts database, compositing database and capping values for the purposes of geostatistical analysis and variography;
- · Validation of the block model and grade interpolation;
- · Revision of the classification criteria and validation of the clipping areas for mineral resource classification;
- · Assessment of the resources with 'reasonable prospects for economic extraction' and selection of appropriate cut-off grades and pit shell; and
- · Generation of a mineral resource statement.

## 14.2 Drill Hole Database

The diamond drill hole database contains 25 DDH, which corresponds to all the holes drilled on the Project. The Surpac database contains all 25 DDH (Figure 14-1 and Figure 14-2).

The holes cover the strike length of the Project at a regular drill spacing of 50 m. A total of 2,414 intervals were sampled (1,244 samples in mineralized domains), representing 2,667 m of drilled core (1,426 m drilled in mineralized domains). The resource database includes  scandium,  lanthanum,  praseodymium,  neodymium,  terbium  and  dysprosium assays, as well as lithological, alteration and structural descriptions.

In addition to the basic tables of raw data, the Surpac database includes several tables containing the calculated drill hole composites and wireframe solid intersections required for the statistical analysis and resource block modelling.

## 14.3 Geological Model

The drill  hole  data  were  used  to  create  the  2021  geological  model  (Figure  14-1  and Figure 14-2). All geological solids were modelled in Leapfrog and snapped to drill holes.

The main lithologies of the deposit are massive syenite ('SYN') intruded by olivine ferrosyenite ('OLFESYN'), four (4) pyroxene ferro-syenites ('PXFESYN') and an intermediate  syenite  ('INTSYN').  Later  pegmatitic  dykes  ('PEG')  and  intermediate porphyries ('POM') cut all units.

The 2021 geological model was included in the Surpac block model to assign densities to the blocks. The OLFFESYN, PXFESYN and INTSYN solids were used as mineralized domains. These domains are subvertical with an NE-SW strike.

Two  surfaces  were  created  to  define  the  topography  and  the  overburden/bedrock contact.  The  surfaces  were  generated  from  surveyed  drill  hole  collars  and  a  Lidar topographic survey.

## 14.4 High-grade Capping

Basic univariate statistics were performed on the raw assay datasets for the OLFESYN domain.  The  datasets  for  other  mineralized  domains  were  too  low  to  yield  relevant results.  The  results  obtained  for  OLFESYN  were  applied  to  the  other  domains.  The following criteria were used to decide if capping was warranted:

- · The coefficient of variation of the assay population is above 2.0.
- · The quantity of metal contained in the top 10% highest grade samples is above 40%, and/or the quantity of metal in the top 1% highest grade samples is higher than 10%.
- · The probability plot of  the grade distribution shows abnormal breaks or scattered points outside the main distribution curve.
- · The log-normal distribution of grades shows erratic grade bins or distanced values from the main population.

The capping threshold decided for all domains is consistent with the combination of three criteria:

- · A break in the probability plot.
- · A coefficient of variation below 2.0 after capping.
- · The total metals of the top 1% highest grade samples is below 10% after capping.

Capping was applied to raw assays. Table 14-1 presents a summary of the statistical analysis  by  metal.  Figure  14-3  shows  an  example  of  graphs  supporting  the  capping threshold decisions.

## 14.5 Density

Densities are used to calculate tonnage from the estimated volumes in the resource grade block model.

From 2019 to 2021, the issuer submitted a total of 176 samples for specific bulk gravity ('SG') analysis. Table 14-2 presents a summary of the statistical analysis by lithological unit.

For each lithological unit, the median result was used to code the SG attribute in the block model. An arbitrary value of 2.00 g/cm 3  was assigned to overburden.

## 14.6 Compositing

In  order to minimize any bias introduced by variations in sample lengths, the capped assays were composited within each mineralized zone. The thickness of the mineralized solids,  the  proposed  block  size,  and  the  original  sample  length  were  taken  into consideration when selecting the composite length.

The intervals defining each mineralized domain were composited to 1.5 m equal lengths with  any  tail  length  equally  distributed  within  each  lithology.  A  grade  of  0.00  g/t  was assigned to missing sample intervals. A total of 2,073 composites were generated.

Table 14-3 summarizes the basic statistics for the raw data and composites.

## 14.7 Block Model

A block model was established to enclose a sufficiently large volume to host an open pit. The model corresponds to a sub-blocked model in Surpac, rotated 42° clockwise (Y axis oriented at N042° azimuth).

The user block size was defined as 5m x 5m x 5m with a minimal sub-block size of 1.25m x  1.25m  x  1.25m.  Block  dimensions  reflect  the  sizes  of  mineralized  domains  and plausible mining methods. All blocks with more than 50% of their volume falling within a selected solid were assigned the corresponding solid block code.

## 14.8 Variography and Search Ellipsoids

3D variography, carried out in Supervisor, yielded the best-fit model along an orientation that  roughly  corresponds  to  the  strike  and  dip  of  the  mineralized  domains.  The variography analysis was inconclusive for INTSYN and PXFESYN due to  insufficient information.  The  variography  was  also  inconclusive  in  defining  the  range  for  the scandium in the Z-axis due to the lack of information. A value of one-third (1/3) of the major axis was arbitrarily applied. Variography results obtained from OLFESYN were then applied to other mineralized domains.

<!-- image -->

The search ellipsoid  was  based  on  the  variography  study.  The  interpolation  strategy counts  two  (2)  cumulative  passes.  The  first  pass  corresponds  to  half  (0.5x)  of  the variography ranges and the second pass is 1x the ranges.

Table 14-6 summarizes the parameters of the ellipsoids used for interpolation.

Figure 14-4 illustrates the shape and range of the scandium search ellipsoids for the first pass.

## 14.9 Grade Interpolation

The variography study provided the parameters for interpolating the grade model using capped composites. The interpolation was run on point area workspaces extracted from the composite datasets (flagged by zone) in Surpac. A cumulative 2-pass search was used for the resource estimate. Pass 1 corresponds to half (0.5x) the variography ranges,

<!-- image -->

and Pass 2 is 1x the variography ranges for blocks not estimated during the first pass. The interpolation profiles were applied to each mineralized zone using hard boundaries.

Several models were produced using the nearest neighbour ('NN'), inverse distance square ('ID2') and ordinary kriging (OK) interpolation methods to choose the method that best respects the raw assay and composite grade distribution for each metal. Models were compared visually (on sections, plans and longitudinal views), statistically, and with swath plots. The focus was to limit the smoothing effect to preserve local grade variations while avoiding the smearing of high-grade values. The ID2 method was selected for the final resource estimate.

For Dy2O3, La2O3, Pr2O3, Nd2O3 and Tb2O3, high-grade values did not show continuous distributions. The interpolation distance for the high-grade values was restricted to avoid high-grade smearing and grade over-estimation in the block model. The top grades were defined by studying the grades frequency histogram for each element. The interpolation restriction distance was defined as one-third of the major variogram range. Table 14-7 presents the restriction parameters.

The strategy and parameters for the grade estimation are summarized in Table 14-8.

## 14.10 Block Model Validation

Block model grades and composite grades were visually compared on sections, plans and  longitudinal  views  for  both  densely  and  sparsely  drilled  areas.  No  significant differences  were  observed,  and  a  generally  good  match  was  noted  in  the  grade distribution without excessive smoothing in the block model. The process confirmed that the block model honours the drill hole composite data (Figure 14-5).

The OK and NN models were used to check for local bias in the models. The OK model matches well with the ID2 model. The differences in the high-grade composite areas are within  acceptable  limits.  The  trend  and  local  variation  of  the  estimated  ID2  and  OK models were compared to the NN models and the composite data using swath plots in three directions (North, East and Elevation). The ID2, NN and OK models show similar trends  in  grades,  with  the  expected  smoothing  for  each  method  compared  to  the composite data.

Table 14-9 compares the global block model mean for three (3) interpolation scenarios (OK, ID2 and NN) and the composite grades for each metal. Generally, the comparison between composite and block grade distribution did not identify any significant issues.

Figure 14-6 shows an example of the swath plot used to compare the block model grades to the composite grades. In general, the model correctly reflects the trends shown by the composites, with the expected smoothing effect.

## 14.11 Mineral Resource Classification

No Measured resources were defined.

Indicated resources were defined for blocks estimated in the first pass (minimum of 3 DDH) and at the boundaries, within 30 m of a drill hole, or at mi-distance to the last drill hole meeting the indicated criteria. Inferred resources were defined for the  remaining interpolated blocks (minimum 2 DDH).

The resource category was assigned using clipping boundaries. In some cases, isolated blocks  were  upgraded  or  downgraded  to  homogenize  the  model  with  respect  to  the geological and grades continuity.

## 14.12 Cut-off Grade for Mineral Resources

Under CIM Definition Standards, mineral resources should have 'reasonable prospects of  eventual  economic extraction'. Given the nature of the mineralization (polymetallic content, large zone width and widespread grade distribution), the cut-off grade of the Project is expressed as net smelter return ('NSR') and the assumptions made for its calculation apply to a potential open pit scenario.

An NSR value was calculated for each element in the block model with the following formula: Metal price (C$/t) x Block Value (g/t) x recovery (%) /10 3 . An NSR total was then calculated using the following formula: NSR Total (C$/t) = NSR Sc2O3 + NSR La2O3 + NSR Pr2O3 + NSR Nd2O3 + NSR Tb4O7 + NSR Dy2O3 - Concentrate Transportation Cost.

Detailed parameters used for each element are described in Table 14-10.

For  the  2021  MRE,  an  NSR  cut-off  of  110.8  C$/t  has  been  selected  based  on  the assumptions  described  in  Table  14-11.  The  selection  of  reasonable  prospective parameters, which assume that some or all of the estimated resources could potentially be extracted, is based on an open-pit mining scenario (470,000 tpy). This is also based on  the  assumption  of  onsite  mineral  concentrate  production  and  transport  of  the concentrate from the mine site to a processing plant.

## 14.13 Mineral Resource Estimate

The  authors  believe  that  the  current  mineral  resource  estimate  can  be  classified  as Indicated and Inferred mineral resources based on geological and grade continuity, data density,  search  ellipse  criteria,  drill  hole  spacing  and  interpolation  parameters.  The authors  also  believe  that  the  requirement  of  'reasonable  prospects  for  eventual economic extraction' has been met by having a cut-off grade based on reasonable inputs amenable to a potential open-pit extraction scenario.

Notes to accompany the Mineral Resource Estimate:

- 1. The independent and qualified persons for the mineral resource estimate, as defined by NI 43 101, are Marina Iund, P.Geo. (InnovExplo Inc.), Paul Daigle, P.Geo. (InnovExplo Inc. associate) and Carl Pelletier, P.Geo. (InnovExplo Inc.). The effective date of the estimate is September 17, 2021.
- 2. These mineral resources are not mineral reserves, as they do not have demonstrated economic viability. The mineral resource estimate follows current CIM Definition Standards.
- 3. The results are presented in situ and undiluted and considered to have reasonable prospects of economic viability.
- 4. The estimate encompasses three mineralized domains using the grade of the adjacent material when assayed or a value of zero when not assayed.
- 5. High-grade capping supported by statistical analysis was done on raw assay data before compositing: La2O3 (3690 g/t), Pr2O3 (1380 g/t), Nd2O3 (2100 g/t), Dy2O3 (215 g/t). No capping was applied to Sc2O3 and Tb4O7.
- 6. The estimate was completed using a sub-block model in GEOVIA SURPAC 2021 with user block size of 5m x 5m x 5m and minimum block size of 1.25m x 1.25m x1.25m. Grades interpolation was obtained by ID2 using hard boundaries.
- 7. Bulk density values were applied by lithology (g/cm3): INTSYN, OLFESYN = 3.13; PXFESYN = 2.91; SYN = 2.7; POMSYN = 2.77; PEG = 2.63 and OB = 2.0.
- 8. The mineral resource estimate is classified as indicated and inferred. The Indicated mineral resource category is defined with a minimum of three (3) drill holes in areas where the drill spacing is less than 60 m, and reasonable geological and grade continuity have been demonstrated. The Inferred category is defined with a minimum of two (2) drill holes in areas where the drill spacing is less than 120 m, and reasonable geological and grade continuity have been demonstrated. Clipping boundaries were used for classification based on those criteria.
- 9. The mineral resource estimate is pit-constrained with a bedrock slope angle of 45° and an overburden slope angle of 30°. It is reported at a NSR cut-off of 110.8 C$/t .The NSR cut-off was calculated using the following parameters: processing cost = C$14.89; transportation cost (concentrate transportation from mine site to processing plant): C$7.19; refining and selling costs = C$ 88.71; Sc2O3 price = US$1,500/kg; La2O3 price = US$0.6/kg; Pr2O3 price = US$29/kg; Nd2O3 price = US$29/kg; Tb4O7 price = US$386/kg; Dy2O3 price = US$124/kg; USD:CAD exchange rate = 1.25; scandium recovery to high grade scandium oxide product = 76.0%; REE recovery to mixed REE carbonate = 63.0%. The cut-off grades should be reevaluated in light of future prevailing market conditions (metal prices, exchange rates, mining costs etc.).
- 10. The number of metric tons was rounded to the nearest thousand, following the recommendations in NI 43 101 and any discrepancies in the totals are due to rounding effects.
- 11. The authors are not aware of any known environmental, permitting, legal, title-related, taxation, socio-political, or marketing issues, or any other relevant issue not reported in the Technical Report, that could materially affect the Mineral Resource Estimate.

Table  14-13  shows  the  NSR  cut-off  sensitivity  analysis  of  the  2021  MRE.  The homogeneity of the grade of the elements across the deposit as well as the high-grade nature of it makes the mineral resource low sensitive to variation of NSR cut-off.

The reader should be cautioned that the numbers provided in should not be interpreted as a mineral resource statement. The reported quantities and grade estimates at different NSR  cut-off  are  presented  in-situ  and  for  the  sole  purpose  of  demonstrating  the sensitivity of the resource model to the selection of a reporting NSR cut-off.

## 25. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS

The objective of the mandate assigned to InnovExplo was to generate a mineral resource estimate for the scandium-rare earth TGZ target on the Crater Lake Property (the '2021 MRE')  and  to  prepare  a  supporting  NI 43-101  Technical  Report  for  the  Project. InnovExplo  believes  that  the  information  presented  in  this  report  provides  a  fair  and accurate picture of the Project's potential.

The QPs from InnovExplo conducted site visits that included but were not limited to a review and validation of the data used for the 2021 MRE, including the geology and mineralization,  and  a  review  of  the  drilling  and  sampling  procedures  and  processing methods. The QPs also validated the geological information provided by the issuer or obtained from public sources.

The  Project  is  situated  in  northern  Quebec,  near  the  border  of  Newfoundland  and Labrador,  approximately  200  km  northeast  of  Schefferville,  Quebec.  The  Property consists of 96 contiguous mineral claims (two claim blocks) that cover the northwestern portion of the Crater Lake syenite batholith and the four principal exploration targets: TGZ, STG, North and Boulder Lake.

Current exploration and drilling on the TGZ target cover an area approximately 500 m along strike and 120 m wide, to a depth of approximately 250 m. The scandium and REE mineralization  occurs  mainly  within  the  olivine  ferro-syenite  (OLFESYN),  with  minor mineralization in the pyroxene ferro-syenite (PXFESYN).

The Hill Top, STG and SCL targets cover an approximate strike length of 700 m based on geophysical surveys. Previous results and current geological observations for the STG target show a similar geological context as TGZ. An exploration program, including channel sampling and two (2) drill holes, was underway on the STG target at the time of writing. No exploration work was being planned for the SCL and Hill Top targets.

For the TGZ target, InnovExplo created a lithological model for the mineralized domains using all available geological and analytical information. To provide accurate resource modelling, the QPs based their wireframe model of mineralized domains on the drill hole database and the interpretation provided by Imperial's geologists.

The following conclusions are based on a detailed review of all pertinent information and results:

- · The database supporting the 2021 MRE is complete, valid and up to date.
- · The  geological  and  grade  continuity  of  scandium  and  REE  mineralization  in  the OLFESYN and PXFESYN domains has been demonstrated, supported by a 50-m drilling grid.
- · The  2021  MRE  is  classified  as  indicated  and  inferred  resources.  There  are  no measured resources.
- · The 2021 MRE was prepared for a potential open-pit scenario at an NSR cut-off of 110.80 C$/t.

The 2021 MRE for the TGZ target at the Crater Lake Project, at a 110.80 C$/t NSR cutoff grade, comprises:

- · Indicated Resource of 7,315,500 t grading 282 g/t Sc2O3, 66 g/t Dy2O3, 606 g/t La2O3, 596 g/t Nd2O3, 160 g/t Pr2O3, 12 g/t Tb4O7 equivalent to a 413 C$/t NSR
- · Inferred Resource of 13,158,400 t grading 264 g/t Sc2O3, 62 g/t Dy2O3, 569 g/t La2O3, 573 g/t Nd2O3, 154 g/t Pr2O3, 11 g/t Tb4O7 equivalent to a 386 C$/t NSR.

Table  25.1  identifies  important  internal  risks,  potential  impacts  and  possible  risk mitigation measures that could affect the economic outcome of the Project. It does not over the external risks that apply to all mining projects (e.g., changes in metal prices, exchange rates,  availability  of  investment  capital,  change  in  government  regulations, etc.). Significant opportunities that could improve the economics, timing and permitting of  the  Project  are  also  identified  in  this  table.  Further  information  and  evaluation  are required before these opportunities can be included in the project economics.

## 26. RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on the results of the 2021 MRE, InnovExplo recommend that the Project move to an advanced phase of exploration, which would involve the preparation of a Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA) for the TGZ target.

InnovExplo recommends the following work program:

- · Complete a PEA.
- · Complete  a  4,000 m  drilling  program  on  the  southern  portion  of  the  TGZ  target (Sections  0N  to  350N)  and  at  depth  (sections  450N  and  500N).  The  goal  of  this program is to investigate the extensions of the TGZ mineralized domains.
- · Complete the exploration program currently underway at the STG target: detailed geological mapping, detailed channel sampling, collection of a 50t bulk sample of olivine ferro-syenite (15 t collected to date), and a 500 m drilling program.
- · Perform a Lidar topographic survey to cover the entire Property.
- · Perform the planned additional metallurgical testwork (solvent extraction flowsheet development  and  optimization;  development  of  Al-2%Sc  master  alloy  production technology; and mineral processing pilot program).
- · Update  the  mineral resource  estimate  for the Project using data from  the recommended studies and test results.
