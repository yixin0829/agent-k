## 1 . 0 S U M M A R Y

Located in north central Manitoba, the Mel property is situated within the Nelson House Resource Management Area, approximately 25 kilometres (km) north of the city of Thompson and 764 km north of the provincial capital of Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.

The Mel property comprises one mineral lease (ML-007) and 37 unpatented mineral claims totalling an aggregate of 9,516.973 hectares (ha).  Both the Mel lease and the Mel claims are held and 100% owned by Inco Limited (Inco), subject to an option/buy-back letter of agreement with Victory Nickel Incorporated  (Victory) dated August 27, 1999, as well as subsequent agreements and amendments.

Victory has commissioned Wardrop Engineering Inc. (Wardrop) to carry out an independent resource estimation of the nickel development potential of the Mel deposit.  The work entailed estimating mineral resources in conformance with the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (CIM) Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve definitions referred to in National Instrument 43-101 (NI 43-101) Standards and Disclosure for Mineral Projects.

Road access to the property is provided by Provincial Highway 391, which crosses the extreme southwest corner of the Mel claims.  In the summer months, access to the property is possible by boat on the Odei River that meanders throughout the entire length of the Mel property.  Access to most of the property is restricted primarily to the winter months when the ground is frozen due to much of the area being covered by muskeg.  Access to the property is also possible via helicopter from the city of Thompson.

In the city of Thompson, Inco conducts nickel mining, milling, smelting and refining operations.  The city of Thompson, known as a regional trade and service centre of Northern Manitoba, boasts an excellent transportation system of scheduled daily air service, overnight truck delivery, paved roads, and a railway system that connects Thompson with other communities throughout the province.  It has all of the services and amenities that would be expected in a much larger, urban centre.  There is no mining infrastructure on the Mel property.

The first record of exploration in the vicinity of the Mel property was in 1961, when the Canadian Nickel Company Ltd. (a wholly owned subsidiary of Inco) first discovered the Mel deposit on what is now mineral lease ML-007.  Numerous companies were active in the area beginning in 1961; however, activity ceased in 1971 with the advent of exploration prohibitive legislation.  The region remained dormant until 1999 when Inco staked the Mel claims.  Until recently, Inco along with Victory, have actively explored the Mel property.

The Mel property is situated within the Thompson Nickel Belt; a northeast-southwest trending 10 to 35 km wide belt of Early Proterozoic sedimentary rocks interfolded with

Archean age basement gneisses.  The nickel deposits are associated with ultramafic intrusions that occur within the Proterozoic rocks, which have been metamorphosed to schists and gneisses and have subsequently been folded into complex patterns.  The Thompson Nickel Belt is fault bounded on both the eastern and western margins.  To the east along the Superior Rift fault zone, Archean Superior Province rocks are in contact with the Thompson Nickel Belt (Peredery et al., 1982).  To the west, the Thompson Nickel Belt is in direct contact with the Kisseynew domain, located within the Trans-Hudson Orogeny tectonic domains of the Churchill Province (Bleeker, 1990).  The Kisseynew paragneisses have been interpreted to represent the metamorphosed remnants of a back-arc or inter-arc basin.

At the Mel deposit, nickel-bearing massive and stringer sulphides occur within and in contact with an ultramafic intrusion.  The sulphides are dominantly pyrrhotite with lesser amounts of pentlandite and chalcopyrite.  Mineralization strikes approximately 345 degrees (¬∞) for a distance of 1500 metres (m), dips from 70¬∞ to 80¬∞ east and extends to a known depth of 825 m below surface.  The deposit consists of folded, continuous to discontinuous higher-grade nickel bearing sulphide layers up to 15 m thick (horizontal) within a broader mineralized zone with horizontal thicknesses locally exceeding 30 m.  Folding appears to have locally caused thickening of the mineralized layers.

Diamond drilling from 1961 to 1971 was AXT size core except for a few holes of AQ size core drilled at the end of the 1971 campaign.  Core from that period has been preserved and is stored by Inco in Thompson as abbreviates only with generally one representative sample approximately 10 centimetre (cm) long collected approximately every three metres in the hole.  Diamond drilling from 1999 to 2006 is NQ core size.  The core is logged, sampled and stored by Inco in Thompson.  Mineralized sections of the core are subdivided into sample intervals not exceeding 1.5 m of core length based on rock type, alteration, sulphide abundance and textural variations.

## 1.1 RESOURCE STATEMENT

Wardrop completed an estimation of the mineral resource on the Mel Deposit for Victory. This has resulted in an Indicated resource of 4,279,000 tons grading 0.875% nickel (Ni) plus an Inferred resource of 1,010,000 tons grading 0.839% Ni at a cut-off of 0.5% Ni.

Wardop carried out data verification on 5% of the drillhole database from drill logs and assay values.  The database verification conducted by Wardrop found no discrepancies with the original information.  Wardrop concludes that the database meets industry standards for resource estimation.

Estimation of the resource included the interpolation methods of nearest neighbour, inverse distance squared and ordinary kriging.  The methods were validated by comparison of global mean grades, visual review of coded block grades and swath plots.  No significant discrepancies exist between the methods.  Ordinary kriging methodology was selected for grade estimation on the deposit.

## 1.2 RECOMMENDATIONS

Additional drilling is recommended on the Mel deposit in order to improve the resource classification and to increase confidence in grade continuity.  Wardrop suggests performing infill drilling along strike as well as bracket holes at depth where the higher grade material is identified.

Wardrop recommends exploration on the Mel lease to extend the Mel deposit along strike thereby potentially increasing the tonnage estimates and drilling on Mel mineral claims to further explore the lower Pipe Formation.

This resource estimate only included nickel (Ni) values but the assay database includes values for copper (Cu) and cobalt (Co).  Wardrop recommends that all samples be assayed for Ni, Cu, Co and Platinum Group Elements (PGE) as well as all potential payable and deleterious elements.

Additional bulk density determinations of the mineralized material should be carried out so that specific gravity data can be incorporated into resource block model for estimation.

Additional drilling is recommended so that samples can be collected for metallurgical testing and mineral processing at Mel deposit.

Wardrop believes that the current resource block model honours the high grade values well and that local grade variations are reasonably well represented.  However, more work is required to improve the local grade estimation within the block model estimation, possibly multiple indicator kriging and unfolding to compare with the current estimation method. Globally, the Wardrop resource compares well with previous Inco estimates.  For preliminary economic assessment or feasibility type study work, where selective mining methods or detailed engineering design work will be required, Wardrop recommends updating the current resource block model.  This exercise will be beneficial once new drilling data becomes available.

Located 25 km north of the city of Thompson, Manitoba, Victory's Mel deposit is one of many nickel deposits that characterize the Thompson Nickel Belt region.  Comprising one mineral lease and 37 mineral claims, the Mel property has a surface area totalling 9,516.973 hectares.

At the present time, the Mel deposit is actively being explored.  Past drill programs have tested numerous geophysical anomalies associated with known nickel bearing geology.  In 2000, a 24-hole diamond drill program verified and improved delineation of the Mel deposit. Most recently, in 2005, diamond drilling tested prospective stratigraphy and electromagnetic anomalies.  In addition, geotechnical studies and metallurgical test work have been completed.

## 2.1 TERMS OF REFERENCE

Victory has commissioned Wardrop to carry out an independent resource estimation of the Mel deposit.  The work entailed estimating mineral resources in conformance with the CIM Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve definitions referred to in NI 43-101, Standards and Disclosure for Mineral Projects.  It also involved the preparation of a Technical Report as defined in NI 43-101, and in compliance with Form 43-101F1.  The inventory of resources represents an update to the existing resource estimate delineated from historical drilling data as prepared by Inco.  The work necessitated an independent review of the geology, exploration history, historical resource estimates and the potential for discovery of additional nickel mineralization.  The report also provides recommendations for specific areas for follow-up definition drilling in order to complete a NI 43-101 compliant reserve estimation.

Shah√© Naccashian, P.Geo., directed the resource estimation and reviewed the geological data.  Tim Maunula, P.Geo. and Gilles Arseneau, P.Geo. have carried out peer reviews of all work associated with this report.  Shah√© visited Inco's exploration office in Thompson, Manitoba from November 16 th to 17 th , 2006.  He met with Boris Shepertycky, P.Geo. and conducted data verification on the Mel deposit at Inco's office.  Due to inaccessibility to the property, Shah√© visited the site for the second time from January 8 th to 10 th , 2007.  During this visit Shah√© performed core review and visited the Mel Property.  This visit was intended to fulfil the NI 43-101 requirement of a site visit by a Qualified Person.

According to the Mines and Minerals Act of Manitoba [The Mine and Minerals Consequential Amendment Act, Part 5, Division 2, 73( )], the holder of a mineral claim is granted: 1

- ¬∑ The exclusive right to explore for and develop the Crown minerals other than quarry minerals, found in place on, in, or under the lands covered by the claim.
- ¬∑ Subject to certain Ministerial considerations, the holder of a mineral claim may enter, use and occupy the surface of the land that is governed by the claim for the purpose of prospecting or exploring or developing, mining or producing minerals on, in or under the land.

## 4.2 OWNERSHIP

Mineral lease ML-007 and the 37 mineral claims that comprise the Mel property are 100% owned by Inco subject to an option/buy-back letter of agreement between Inco and Victory and the subsequent agreements and amendments described below in the following section.

## 4.2.1 AGREEMENTS

The letter agreement dated August 27, 1999 as amended by three letter agreements dated August 23, 2001, December 20, 2001 and January 15, 2002 was replaced and superseded by an agreement (the Agreement) that was executed in October 2002 and made effective as of August 31, 1999.

The Agreement has been amended by one letter agreement dated February 23, 2004.

Under the terms of the Agreement and the subsequent amendment, Victory has the right and option (The Option Period) to earn a 100% interest in the Mel property by incurring 100% of an aggregate of $6,000,000 of expenditures, as follows:

- i) 100% of an aggregate of $4,000,000 of expenditures on the Mel property by the February, 28 2005.  At least $2,600,000 of the expenditures must be on the Mel claims.
- ii) 100% of an aggregate of $6,000,000 of expenditures on the Mel property by February 28, 2006.  At least $4,600,000 of the expenditures must be on the Mel claims.

The option was not exercised by February 28, 2006 and consequently the Agreement was amended a third time on May 9, 2006.  The third amendment states that in order to maintain the option granted under the Agreement and two subsequent amendments and in order for the option to be exercised, Victory agrees to:

- i) Incur aggregate expenditures up to $2,000,000 by February 28, 2008 of which $500,000 must be spent on the Mel claims.

Once Victory has earned a 100% interest in the Mel property, Inco has the right to buy back (the Inco Option Period) up to 51% interest in the Mel property by funding 100% of the next $6,000,000 of expenditures.

Inco is the manager during the Option Period, the Inco Option Period and thereafter until a feasibility study has been submitted.

Following the submission of a feasibility study and provided Victory has become a participant as per the Agreement, Victory has the right to become the manager.

## 4.2.2 CURRENT STATUS OF THE AGREEMENT - EXPENDITURES

Up to September 30, 2006 an aggregate of $4,095,498 of expenditures have been incurred by Victory on the Mel property of which $1,561,261 has been spent on the Mel Lease and $2,534,237 has been spent on the Mel claims.  In addition, Victory has a cash call credit balance of $237,801 paid to Inco that is to be applied against future expenditures.

## 4.2.3 CURRENT STATUS OF THE AGREEMENT

In December 2006, Nuinsco Resources Limited ('Nuinsco') notified shareholders of its intention to hold a Special Meeting of shareholders on January 26, 2007 to consider a special resolution approving the restructuring (the 'Arrangement') of Nuinsco and its assets. Pursuant to the Arrangement, which was approved by shareholders, Nuinsco's interest in its Mel, Minago and Lac Rocher sulphide nickel projects along with approximately $12.0 million in cash were acquired by Victory Nickel Inc. ('Victory Nickel').  The effective date of the Arrangement was February 1, 2007, and all individuals holding shares ('old Nuinsco common shares') as of the end of trading on February 5, 2006 received, in exchange for each old Nuinsco common share held, one new Nuinsco common share and 0.75 common shares of Victory Nickel.  Shares of Victory Nickel commenced trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange on February 5, 2007 under the ticker symbol Ni.

## 4.3 PERMITS, NOTICES AND AGREEMENTS

Prior to initiating any exploration field activity, a work permit must be obtained by Victory from a representative of Manitoba Conservation in Thompson, Manitoba.  In addition, Victory must notify the chief of the Nisichawayasihk Cree Nation as well as the Nelson House Resource Management Board.  Victory must also provide the same notification upon completion of the work.  Furthermore, a letter of advice must be acquired by Victory from the Federal Department of Fisheries and Oceans and the Manitoba Water Stewardship Board must be advised of the work activities.

## 4.3.1 TREATY LAND ENTITLEMENT AGREEMENT

There are no current known claims on the Mel property under the terms of the Treaty Land Entitlement Agreement between the governments of Canada, Manitoba and the Treaty Land Entitlement Committee Manitoba Inc., representing First Nations.

## 5.1 TOPOGRAPHY, ELEVATION AND VEGETATION

The topography of the Mel Property is quite typical of the extreme northern Manitoba physiography.  It is gentle in terrain, with relatively low topographic relief.  Elevation of the property is similar to that of the Thompson airport; approximately 222 m above sea level. The region can be described as somewhat swampy with numerous ponds, small lakes and creeks.  The Odei River crosses the Mel claims.  Local vegetation is characteristic of boreal forest; covered primarily with black spruce, willows, poplar, scattered birch and some stands of jack pine.  There is very little aspen, occurring only in very small patches.  Overburden cover is generally at least 15 m thick and comprises predominantly clay and sandy clay that contain boulders.  Up to 60 m of clay and sandy clay are present within the vicinity of the Mel deposit.  Outcroppings of bedrock are rare.

## 5.2 ACCESSIBILITY

Road access to the property is provided by Provincial Highway 391, which crosses the extreme southwest corner of the Mel claims.  From Highway 280, the eastern part of the property can be reached via two winter roads; one 5.8 km in length and the other 9.5 km in length.  In the summer months, access to the property is possible by boat on the Odei River that meanders throughout the entire length of the Mel property.  Access to most of the property is restricted primarily to the winter months when the ground is frozen due to much of the area being covered by muskeg.  Access to the property is also possible via helicopter from the city of Thompson.  The Thompson Airport, with a 3000 foot (ft) runway is located approximately 9 km northwest from the Thompson town site.  It was developed originally by the International Nickel Company in 1961, in support of their mining operations.  There is a number of private helicopter charter companies located within the city of Thompson.

## 5.3 CLIMATE

Average temperatures at the Mel property range between -26.6√ª Celsius (C) in January and 15√ªC in July.  The mean temperature in the town of Thompson is -3√ªC, with an average temperature of 16√ªC in July, and -24√ªC in January.  Maximum precipitation occurs during the winter months, with annual rainfall averaging 351 millimetres (mm) and an annual snowfall average of 202 cm.

## 5.4 I N F R A S T R U C T U R E

The Mel property is located 25 km from the city of Thompson, Manitoba where Inco conducts nickel mining, milling, smelting and refining operations.  The city of Thompson, known as a regional trade and service centre of Northern Manitoba, boasts an excellent transportation system of scheduled daily air service, overnight truck delivery, paved roads, and a railway system that connects Thompson with other communities throughout the province.  The city has a population of 13,256 residents and serves as a trade centre for an additional 36,000 to 65,000 Manitobans.  As such, it has all of the services and amenities that would be expected in a much larger, urban centre.

There is no mining infrastructure on the Mel property.

## 6 . 0 H I S T O R Y

The first record of exploration in the vicinity of the Mel property was in 1961 when the Canadian Nickel Company Ltd. (a wholly owned subsidiary of Inco) first discovered the Mel deposit on what is now mineral lease ML-007.  Numerous companies were active in the area beginning in 1961; however, activity ceased in 1971 with the advent of exploration prohibitive legislation.  The region remained dormant until 1999 when Inco staked the Mel claims.  Until the present, Inco along with Victory, have actively explored the Mel property.

Work conducted on the property, as well in within the vicinity of the property, is summarized in the following list.

1961: Canadian Nickel Company Limited (Canadian Nickel) flew a 18,750 km Airborne Electro Magnetic (AEM) survey; 20 drill holes were completed with Hole 22549 intersecting 2.75% Ni over 0.51 m.

- 1962: Canadian Nickel completed ground magnetic and Vertical Loop Electro Magnetic (VLEM) surveys and drilled an additional 157 diamond drill holes totalling 3,350 m in the area.

Conwest Exploration acquired two blocks of claims in the area and completed magnetic and Horizontal Loop Electro Magnetic (HLEM) surveys, followed by three diamond drill holes totalling 369 m.

Hudson Bay Exploration &amp; Development flew an AEM survey over the southwest portion of the Mel property.

## 6.1 MEL LEASE EXPLORATION 1999 TO 2001

In preparation for an Audio Magneto Telluric (AMT) survey, 3.2 line kilometres of picket line were cut over the Mel lease during January 2000.

During February 2000, AMT data was collected from 22 stations along four lines that cross the Mel lease as part of a larger survey area.

A mineral resource estimate that does not conform to CIM Standards on Mineral Resources and Reserves, August 20, 2000, was competed in May 2000 for the Mel deposit.  The resource estimate was based on an underground mining concept.

## 6.2 MEL CLAIMS EXPLORATION 1999 TO 2000

In preparation for geophysical surveys 166 km of grid lines were cut.

AMT were conducted on 115 km of line representing approximately 65% of the Mel claims.

Surface University of Toronto Electro Magnetic (UTEM) surveys were conducted on six grids.  The grid locations and geometry were surveyed by Global Positioning System (GPS).

## 6.3 MEL CLAIMS EXPLORATION 2001

Eighty-seven kilometres of grid lines were cut in preparation for AMT surveys.

AMT surveys were conducted on 81 km of line that covered the remaining 35% of the Mel claims.

## 7 . 0 GEOLOGICAL SETTING

## 7.1 REGIONAL GEOLOGY

The Mel property is situated within the Thompson Nickel Belt, a northeast-southwest trending 10 to 35 km wide belt of Early Proterozoic sedimentary rocks interfolded with Archean age basement gneisses (see Figure 7.1).  The nickel deposits are associated with ultramafic intrusions that occur within the Proterozoic rocks, which have been metamorphosed to schists and gneisses and have subsequently been folded into complex patterns.  The Thompson Nickel Belt is fault bounded on both the eastern and western margins.  To the east, along the Superior Rift fault zone, Archean Superior Province rocks are in contact with the Thompson Nickel Belt (Peredery et al., 1982).  To the west the Thompson Nickel Belt is in direct contact with the Kisseynew domain located within the Trans-Hudson Orogeny tectonic domains of the Churchill Province (Bleeker, 1990).  The Kisseynew paragneisses have been interpreted to represent the metamorphosed remnants of a back-arc or inter-arc basin.

To the southeast of the Thompson Nickel Belt, the Superior Province Archean age rocks include low to medium grade metamorphosed granite-greenstone and gneissic terranes, as well as the high grade metamorphosed Pikwitonei Granulite Belt.  The variably reworked Archean age basement gneisses represent the dominant rock type (volumetrically) in the Thompson Nickel Belt.  The Pikwitonei Granulite Belt is interpreted to represent exposed portions of deeper level equivalents of the Superior Province rocks.  The Superior Province Archean age gneisses are intruded by multiple mafic to ultramafic dikes of the Molson Swarm dated at 1883 Ma.  Dikes of the Molson swarm occur within the Thompson Nickel Belt, but not within the Kisseynew domain located to the northwest.

Along the western margin of the Thompson Nickel Belt, the early Proterozoic rocks are a geologically distinguishable stratigraphic sequence of rocks referred to as the Opswagen Group.  The Opswagen Group hosts the nickel deposits of the Thompson Nickel Belt, with almost all of the deposits occurring within the lower Pipe Formation Rocks.  The Opswagen Group supercrustal rocks were deposited during subsidence and possible east-west rifting along the edge of the Superior Province.

A stratigraphic nomenclature for the Proterozoic rocks found within the Thompson Nickel Belt was proposed by Bleeker and Macek (1990).  This stratigraphic column is summarized in Figure 7.2.

## 7.1.1 STRUCTURE AND METAMORPHISM OF THE THOMPSON NICKEL BELT

Three major deformational events have affected the Thompson Nickel Belt, producing fold interference patterns on a regional scale.  The earliest event (F1) was interpreted by Bleeker (1990) as isoclinal folding, due to compressional tectonism, forming a series of regionalscale nappe-like folds with metamorphic grades of lower amphibolite facies.  F1 preceded the emplacement of the Molson dike swarm, providing an upper age constraint of 1,883 million years (Ma) (Heaman et al., 1986).  This event was followed by a period of higher temperature, isoclinal recumbent folding (F2) causing the overprinting of F1 and subsequent folding of the Molson dikes (Bleeker, 1990).  The thermal peak of metamorphism later overprinted F2.  Approximately 30 Ma later, and at much lower temperatures, intense,

sinistral transposition of the sedimentary pile produced high amplitude, near-upright, doubly plunging F3 folds (Naldrett, 2004).  These folds transposed the pre-existing recumbent fold pile into a steep gneiss and schist belt.

Concurrent with F3 overprinting, or soon afterwards, the main phase of mylonization occurred.  Mylonization is confined to shear zones that tend to be parallel to the steeply dipping limbs of the upright F3 folds.

## 7.2 PROPERTY GEOLOGY

The following section has been summarized from Chornoby (2004).  Due to extensive overburden cover, the Mel property has been largely extrapolated from diamond drill core logging and interpreted by Inco exploration personnel from geophysical surveys.

## 7.2.1 STRATIGRAPHY

The Archean basement rocks and the stratigraphically overlying Manasan Formation, which includes Quartzite (M1) and pegmatite-saturated sillimanite-biotite schist (M2), form an unconformable contact on the property.  Where present, the thickness of this unit is comparable to the thickness of Manasan Formation found elsewhere in the Thompson Nickel Belt.

Thompson Formation skarn is mainly olivine-carbonate, with lesser microcline-diopside and phlogopite-carbonate skarn.  The skarn, which has been intersected in drilling in a number of areas, has a mineralogical content identical to those in the main Thompson Belt, but the units are somewhat thinner.

The Lower Pipe Formation (P1), not always recognizable, includes thin layers of silicate and sulphide facies iron formation, pelitic schist and quartzite.

The Medium Pipe Formation (P2) is comprised of medium to coarse grained mineralized graphitic sillimanite-garnet-biotite schist, overlying Thompson Formation skarns.  In contrast to the main Thompson Belt, the P2 schist is typically coarser grained with less sillimanite and more garnet.

The Upper Pipe Formation (P3), comprising largely chemical sediments, includes garnetsillimanite-biotite schist, garnetiferous quartzite/greywacke and silicate with minor oxide and sulphide facies iron formation.  In contrast to their main Thompson Belt counterparts, the iron formations contain more pyrrhotite and the schists are coarser grained with more garnet.  In the past, drilling has focused on strong conductors within the upper Pipe Formation iron formations and mineralized schists (barren pyrrhotite).

The Setting Formation consists of an immature clastic sequence of interlayered quartzites and pelitic schists.  Calcareous concretions are diagnostic.  Mafic volcanic rocks occur in the upper part of the formation.

On the eastern limb of the easternmost dome in the Mel area, volcanic rocks of the Bah Lake Formation are present.  These rocks consist of fine-grained amphibolites that are interpreted to be the pro-grade metamorphic products of basalts.  Locally, they have a striped appearance due to silification and carbonatization and, in places, contain auriferous quartz veins (0.86 opt Au/0.2 ft in drillhole BH 38708).  In contrast to the main Thompson Formation Belt, the Mel deposit area volcanic rocks are less abundant and less magnesium rich.

The basal stratigraphic sequence less than 100 ft above the unconformity with the Archean gneisses is characterized by ultramafic bodies.  In some areas the ultramafic bodies are also completely enclosed in Archean gneiss.  In the Mel area, the ultramafics are primarily pyroxenite with minor peridotite.

## 7.2.2 STRUCTURE

The rocks of the Mel property have been complexly folded.  The main structural style is refolded, inward facing, synformal keels flanking gneiss domes with local truncations by major faults.  The major faults are concentrated on the eastern margin of the easternmost margin of the easternmost dome and may reflect a major mylonite zone.  Another major fault appears to truncate the southern part of the Mel Dome.  These faults add a significant drag/shear component to original F3 textural folds.  Other minor shears in the Mel area produce minor offsets of the stratigraphic sequence.

With respect to the inward-facing synformal keels separated by gneiss, the structural style of the Mel Area is similar to elsewhere in the Thompson Nickel Belt.  Other areas with this structural style include the Birchtree-South Manasan and Moak-Mystery synforms.

## 8 . 0 DEPOSIT TYPE

Sediment hosted nickel sulphide mineralization and magmatic hosted nickel sulphide mineralization are the two distinct and economically important deposit types that occur within the Thompson Nickel Belt.  The two deposit types can be distinguished on the basis of field observations as well as structural, textural, mineralogical and chemical criteria.  This is especially important because the deposit types are often intimately spatially related due to the interaction of sedimentary, magmatic, metamorphic and deformational processes.

Within the Thompson Nickel Belt, the nickel ores are found almost exclusively within the lower Pipe Formation rocks of the Opswagen group.

Thickening of sulphide layers is directly caused by the formation of dilatent zones in the noses of folds which trap mobilized nickel sulphides.  Sulphide enrichment is closely associated with pegmatite melts and breccias derived from existing sedimentary or magmatic sulphides.  Pegmatites, formed by partial melting during deformation, accumulated within the same dilatational zones as the remobilised sulphides.  In some cases, the sulphide has been removed or disrupted by pegmatite emplacement, forming blocks of sulphide within the pegmatite melt.  Multiple deformations of primary magmatic sulphides and the resulting mechanical and/or hydrothermal processes are thought to be the main mechanism for nickel enrichment.

## 8.1 SEDIMENTARY SULPHIDE MINERALIZATION

Sedimentary sulphides may be barren or enriched in nickel.  Barren sulphides characterized by nickel concentrations below 500 parts per million (ppm) occur beyond the immediate vicinity of significant nickel enriched zones.

Sedimentary sulphides enriched in nickel by later magmatic processes are visually indistinguishable from barren sedimentary sulphides but occur in close proximity to significant nickel enriched zones.

## 8.2 MAGMATIC SULPHIDE MINERALIZATION

Magmatic nickel sulphide mineralization can be intraparental or extraparental, based on whether it occurs within or external to the ultramafic parent rocks.  Typically massive, extraparental mineralization occurs as pods and lenses of variable size within host pelitic schist adjacent to ultramafic boudins.  The less competent nature of the pelitic schists provides a suitable conduit for magmatism.  In order to explain the amount of nickel sulphide within the deposit, nickel-rich magma would need to pass through the system for an extended period of time, exposing as much melt to sulphide rich sediment as possible

<!-- image -->

(Constable et al., 2005).  High-energy conduit systems or komatiiatic flows could provide sufficient exposure and assimilation of sulphide-rich country rock.

The interpretation of the magmatic affinity of the extraparental mineralization is based on certain shared chemical characteristics with the intraparental mineralization.  Intraparental mineralization occurs as lower abundances of interstitial sulphide and semi-massive to massive concentrations of sulphide in veins and breccias all within ultramafic rocks.

## 9 . 0 MI N E R A L I Z A T I O N

The Mel deposit contains barren sedimentary sulphide formation that is known locally to be nickel bearing.  This fact is consistent with sulphide mineralization located elsewhere in the Thompson Nickel Belt.  Nickel mineralization is associated with pelitic schists of the lower Pipe Formation.  Rapid passage from the mantle through fractured crust, and interaction with sulphide-rich sediments, produced a nickel-rich, immiscible, sulphide melt (Wilson and Brisbin, 1961).  Subsequent deformation mechanically and/or hydrothermally remobilised nickel sulphides into favourable structural traps.

At the Mel deposit, nickel-bearing massive and stringer sulphides occur within and in contact with an ultramafic intrusion.  The sulphides are dominantly pyrrhotite with lesser amounts of pentlandite and chalcopyrite.  Mineralization strikes approximately 345¬∞ for a distance of 1500 m, dips from 70¬∞ to 80¬∞ east and extends to a known depth of 825 m below surface. The deposit consists of folded, continuous to discontinuous higher-grade nickel bearing sulphide layers up to 15 m thick (horizontal) within a broader mineralized zone with horizontal thicknesses locally exceeding 30 m.  Folding appears to have locally caused thickening of the mineralized layers.

The purpose of the current period of exploration is twofold: to explore for nickel deposits by locating and testing more deeply buried high conductivity zones that may be indicative of large volumes with high sulphide content, primarily on the Mel claims; and to better explore, delineate and quantify the mineral resource of the Mel deposit.  The former objective is a logical extension of the pre-1971 exploration on the Mel property that identified near surface (generally less than 100 m below surface) geophysical anomalies that were subsequently tested by diamond drilling resulting in the discovery of the Mel deposit. The latter objective is a necessary requisite for upgrading the mineral resource estimate of the Mel deposit prior to initiating a feasibility study.  Integration of modern electromagnetic geophysical surveys with improved geological understanding of the Thompson Nickel Belt is an effective exploration approach.

Exploration on the Mel claims consists of line cutting and regional scale AMT surveys followed by preparation of site-specific grids and surface UTEM surveys to identify anomalies characteristic of massive sulphides.  Compilation of these data with all of the available geological information is then undertaken to assess whether specific conductors warrant follow-up diamond drilling (see Figures 10.1 and 10.2).

Exploration on the Mel lease is predominantly diamond drilling directed at areas within and adjacent to the Mel deposit that require additional information to enable a higher level of confidence in the mineral resource estimates.  Generally the targeted areas are lacking data or are geologically complex.  Drill hole targets are selected on the basis of interpretations of the favourable lithologies and mineralization observed in earlier diamond drill holes.  More distant from the Mel deposit, where geological information is scarce or absent, geophysical data is utilized in the selection of drill targets.

Inco personnel either conduct or supervise all of the work performed on the Mel property.

All line cutting on the Mel property has been conducted by Durama Enterprises of LaRonge, Saskatchewan.

Representative points along loop lines and survey lines are located with GPS receivers by Inco technicians using two Trimble Geo Explorer III rovers and a Trimble LS4600 base station at Inco's office in Thompson, Manitoba.  Field data are differentially post-process corrected using the base station's data thereby giving positional accuracies to within approximately one metre.

AMT surveys are designed and utilized as a reconnaissance exploration geophysical method capable of detecting conductive bodies with an anticipated target size in the order of ten million tonnes to a depth of approximately 1,000 m.  The AMT surveys were conducted

on cut grid lines spaced 1,219 m apart with readings at 244 m station intervals by Geosystem Canada Inc. of Ottawa, Ontario under the supervision of Inco Area Geophysicist, B. Czornobay, P. Geo. who was based in Thompson, Manitoba.  Resolution and characterization of AMT anomalies is coarse and requires better definition prior to drill testing.

AMT surveys cover all of the Mel claims and a portion of the Mel lease.

Multiple AMT anomalies have been detected.

Surface UTEM surveys are utilized to better define AMT anomalies with respect to their quality and location, and subject to the integration of geological information, identify those anomalies that warrant diamond drilling.  The UTEM surveys are read on cut grid lines that are 1,829 m in length spaced 305 m apart with readings taken at 61 m station intervals. Vertical component magnetic data is collected in the typical 10-channel configuration utilizing twin 914 m by 1,290 m loops and a base frequency of approximately four hertz. The UTEM surveys were conducted by Lamontagne Geophysics Ltd., of Kingston, Ontario under the supervision of Inco Area Geophysicist, B. Czornobay, P. Geo. who was based in Thompson.

UTEM surveys have been completed on the Mel lease and the Mel claims.

The UTEM surveys have detected multiple conductive zones.

In-hole electromagnetic surveys are used to detect off-hole conductors and to characterize in hole conductors.

The in-hole UTEM surveys collect three component electromagnetic data at regular intervals (no greater than 36.58 m) in a 10 channel configuration typically utilizing twin 1,219 m by 914 m loops and a base frequency of one hertz.

An in-hole three component BHEM survey was conducted in one drill hole (102596-0) by Crone Geophysics, Mississauga, Ontario.

Mineral resource estimates have been conducted by Inco personnel.

## 10.1 MEL LEASE EXPLORATION 2001 TO JULY 31, 2004

In preparation for surface UTEM surveys four grids totalling 51.82 km and covering the entire Mel lease were cut and chained during January and February of 2004.  The grid locations and geometry were surveyed by GPS.

In February of 2004 surface UTEM surveys were conducted on the four grids (see Figure 10.2).

An in-hole UTEM survey was completed on drill hole 102599-0 but was unsuccessful on drillhole 102596-0 due to a blockage in the hole.

A mineral resource estimate that conforms to CIM Standards on Mineral Resources and Reserves, was completed in July, 2004 for the Mel deposit based on an open pit mining concept.

## 10.2 MEL LEASE EXPLORATION AUG 1, 2004 TO NOVEMBER 2006

An in-hole UTEM survey was completed on drillhole 102596-0 indicating the presence of two strong conductors:

- ¬∑ A 396 m sized, steeply west dipping (700), north striking, shallow south plunging (300) conductor intersected at a depth of approximately 360 m near the middle of its bottom edge;
- ¬∑ A 198 m sized, steeply west dipping (700), north striking, shallow north plunging (200) conductor intersected at a depth of approximately 399 m in its bottom northern quadrant.

## 10.3 MEL CLAIMS EXPLORATION 2002

One hundred and eight kilometres of grid lines were cut in preparation for surface UTEM surveys.

Surface UTEM surveys were conducted on seven grids (see Figure 10.2).  The grid locations and geometry were surveyed by GPS.

3-D inversions were performed on the AMT data collected in 2000 and 2001.

## 10.4 MEL CLAIMS EXPLORATION 2003

In preparation for surface UTEM surveys 263.93 km of line were cut and chained.  The grid locations and geometry were surveyed by GPS.

In January and February, 18 surface UTEM surveys totalling 171.56 km were conducted on the 18 grids (see Figure 10.2).

## 10.5 MEL CLAIMS EXPLORATION 2004

In preparation for surface UTEM surveys 94.31 km of line were cut and chained.  The grid locations and geometry were surveyed by GPS.

Surface UTEM surveys totalling 61.96 km were conducted on six grids (see Figure 10.2).

## 10.6 MEL PROPERTY CHANGES

On August 27, 1999, when the option/buy-back agreement between Inco and Victory was formed the Mel property consisted of the Mel lease and 91 Mel claims.  Currently the Mel property comprises the Mel lease and 37 Mel claims. Based on exploration merit some mineral claims have been dropped and others added as follows:

1999: The original 91 Mel mineral claims were staked in March 1999.

2002:

Three new claims were staked and added to the south end of the Mel property in January 2002.

In March 2002, 16 low priority claims were allowed to lapse.

2003: In March 2003, 18 low priority claims were allowed to lapse.

2005: In March 2004, one low priority claim was allowed to lapse.

2006: In March 2006, 22 low priority claims were allowed to lapse.

## 11.1 I N C O   1 9 6 1   T O   1 9 7 1

Diamond drilling from 1961 to 1971 was AXT size core except for a few holes of AQ size core drilled at the end of the 1971 campaign.  Core from that period has been preserved and is stored by Inco Limited in Thompson as abbreviates only with generally one representative sample approximately 10 cm long collected approximately every three metres in the hole.

Collar locations of diamond drillholes are surveyed. In hole location surveys are limited to acid etch tests. All surveys have been performed by Inco personnel.

## 11.2 VICTORY-INCO 1999 TO 2006

Since 1999 the diamond drilling has been NQ size core.  Major Midwest Drilling of Thompson, Manitoba has performed all of the diamond drilling under the supervision of Inco geologists, Scott Mooney P.Geo., Mars Napoli, P. Geo., H. Mahony P. Geo., and L. Larson, P. Geo., (now retired), all based in Thompson.

Collar locations of diamond drillholes are surveyed.  Down hole surveys have been conducted on most of the holes using a light-gyroscopic survey instrument.  All surveys have been performed by Inco personnel.

Three holes have been auger drilled over the Mel deposit by AMEC Earth &amp; Environmental to determine the geotechnical properties of the overburden.

## 11.3 MEL LEASE DRILLING 1999 TO 2000

In the winter of 1999-2000, twenty-four holes totalling 3,284 m were diamond drilled to verify and better delineate the Mel deposit and to test for the presence of shallow extensions of the mineralization (see Table 11.1 and Figure 11.1).

Permanent and useable survey points did not exist on the Mel lease when the drilling began. A drillhole in the area that had been surveyed in the past was relocated and used as a starting point for a new survey.  A traverse was carried from this point and 12 old drillholes in the Mel deposit area were surveyed.  All of these boreholes fell within one foot of the known co-ordinates and confirmed the accurate relocation of survey points.  All of the 2000 and 2004 diamond drillhole collar locations were based on this survey.

The data was incorporated into a mineral resource estimate completed in May 2000 that does not conform to CIM Standards on Mineral Resources and Reserves, August 20, 2000.

## 11.4 MEL LEASE DRILLING 2004

In February and March of 2004, twenty-one holes totalling 4,366 m were diamond drilled on the Mel lease (see Table 11.2).  Twenty of the holes were intended to further delineate the Mel deposit and of these, 19 holes reached their targeted depths.

One drillhole (102596-0) tested a moderate conductivity UTEM anomaly located approximately 760 m north of the Mel deposit drillhole 102596-0 intersected numerous intervals with anomalous nickel content over an interval of 39.56 m (core length).  The best interval assayed 1.31% Ni over 0.94 m (core length).

The data were incorporated into a mineral resource estimate completed in July, 2004 that conforms to CIM Standards on Mineral Resources and Reserves, August 20, 2000.  The resource estimate was based on an open pit mining concept.

A total of 94 m of overburden drilling was completed in three solid stem auger boreholes on the Mel deposit.  Only two of the holes reached suspected bedrock.  Nilcon Vane tests were completed in one hole.  The drilling encountered approximately four metres of peat and thereafter approximately 29 m of predominantly water saturated clay and some patchy perma frost with weak shear strength.  Approximately 1.5 m of sand was encountered at the bottom of one hole.

## 11.5 MEL CLAIMS DRILLING 1999 TO 2000

Four diamond drill holes totalling 2,574 m were drilled to test UTEM anomalies (see Table 11.3).  No significant nickel intersections were found.

All of the available lithology and assay information on the Mel property has been obtained from diamond drill core.

## 12.1 1961 TO 1971 INCO

Diamond drilling was AXT size core except for a few holes of AQ size core drilled at the end of the 1971 campaign.  Core has been preserved and is stored by Inco Limited in Thompson as abbreviates only with generally one representative sample approximately 10 cm long collected approximately every three metre in the hole.

## 12.2 1999 TO 2006 INCO-VICTORY

The diamond drilling is NQ core size.  The core is logged, sampled and stored by Inco in Thompson.  Mineralized sections of the core are subdivided into sample intervals not exceeding 1.5 m of core length based on rock type, alteration (style and intensity), sulphide abundance and textural variations.  Each sample interval is cut in half lengthwise using a diamond impregnated cutting blade.  One half of the sample interval is placed in a sample bag with the appropriate sample tag, closed and shipped for assay.  The remaining half of the sample interval is put back into the core box.

## 13.1 1961 TO 1988 INCO

All of the drill core samples from drilling which was completed prior to 1988 was submitted to Inco's own labs, either in Thompson, Manitoba or Copper Cliff, Ontario, for preparation and analysis for Cu, Ni and Co.  All pulps were retained and placed in long-term storage.

## 13.2 1999 TO 2006 INCO-VICTORY

Samples were shipped to ALS Chemex in Thunder Bay, Ontario for preparation prior to analysis by weighing, crushing, splitting and pulverizing each sample as follows:

- ¬∑ Each sample was weighted in kilograms;
- ¬∑ Each sample was assigned a unique bar core identifier allowing for complete traceability;
- ¬∑ The entire sample was crushed to 70% &lt; 2 mm (-10 mesh) in two stages;
- ¬∑ The sample was split with a Jones riffle splitter (standard procedure);
- ¬∑ Up to 250 grams (g) of the split for each sample was pulverized to 85% &lt; 75 microns (-200 mesh).

ALS Chemex uses barren wash material between sample preparation batches.

The pulps were then shipped by ALS Chemex to their analytical laboratory in either Mississauga, Ontario or North Vancouver, British Columbia for analyses as follows:

- ¬∑ Assaying for nickel, copper, cobalt, iron (Fe), arsenic (As), lead (Pb), zinc (Zn) and sulphur (S) are performed using fusion sample decomposition and ICP-AES analytical procedures.  Typically a prepared sample (0.2 g) is added to sodium peroxide flux (2.6 g), mixed well and then fused in a 670¬∞C furnace.  The resulting melt is cooled and then dissolved in 30% hydrochloric acid.  This solution is then analyzed by inductively coupled plasma - atomic emission spectrometry and the results are corrected for spectral inter-element interferences.
- ¬∑ Both total carbon and sulphur content are determined by a Leco combustion method.
- ¬∑ When required, samples are also analysed for low-level As and Pb using the MEAA45 procedure.  The samples are digested with aqua regia in a graphite-heating

block.  After cooling, the resulting solution is diluted with demineralized water then analysed by atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS).

- ¬∑ Select samples are also analysed for Au, Pt and Pd by a lead collection fire assay/ICP (Optima Induced Couple Plasma) technique on a one assay/ton sample.

Table 13.1 summarizes the detection limits for various elements.  Note that any result that exceeds the upper limit is re-assayed.

Chemex employs comprehensive and transparent QA/QC protocols.  Control charts for standards assayed at Chemex show routine performance within two standard deviations of the certified values.  The relative precision for Cu, Ni, Co, Fe and S meets contract specifications of no more than 7%.  The relative precision for As and Pb is within established limits of 10%.  The relative precision for Pd is within the contract limit of 15%, but Au (39%) and Pt (19%) are outside this specification.  However, it should be noted that Au and Pt are affected by a moderate nugget effect.

The Inco QA/QC program consists of monitoring ALS Chemex's internal quality control samples (reference materials, duplicates and blanks) and randomly selecting samples for check analysis at third party laboratories, including the Inco control lab.  Results from external check assays show adequate analytical accuracy and precision in 2003.

The Chief Chemist submitted pulp duplicates and commercial standards within samples shipments going to Chemex, including blanks for the same packages used for the diamond drill core samples.

Wardrop has not reviewed the QA/QC data.

ALS Chemex is ISO 9001:2000 registered. ISO 9001:2000 requires evidence of a quality management system covering all aspects of the registrant.  To ensure compliance with this system regular internal audits are undertaken by staff members specially trained in auditing techniques.  ALS Chemex Vancouver laboratory is also accredited ISO 17025 by Standards Council of Canada for a number of specific test procedures including fire assay Au by AA, ICP and gravimetric finish, and multi-element ICP and AA Assays for Ag, Cu, Pb, and Zn.  In addition to twice yearly proficiency tests, auditors experienced in minerals analysis have performed detailed technical reviews at the laboratory.  An audit was last carried out on the Chemex Laboratory in September 2004.  In 2005, QC check results did not reveal any material issue (see Appendix A for complete laboratory audit).

## 14.1 ASSAYS

Wardrop carried out an internal validation from the original drillhole logs against the Datamine drillhole database on 16 (5.4%) of the 296 drillholes in the total database.  Data verification was completed on collar co-ordinates, length of hole, down-the-hole survey measurements (including azimuth and dip), from and to footage measurements of geology and assay sampling intervals, lithological units and nickel percentages as compiled from assay certificates merged into a database.

The two areas of the database that exhibited errors were the assay values; most errors were insignificant (six of the eight errors involved entering 0.005 when the actual value was &lt;0.005) and the survey portion.  These survey errors are related to the attempt to compare point measurements taken while drilling as compared to a line segment that was generated from the block model.

Another consideration involved the collar coordinates.  The verification process compared the coordinates as determined by the universal INCO grid (grid 11).  The coordinates from the database were compared with the coordinates as entered in the drill logs.  These checks showed no discrepancies, but it was not possible to verify the coordinates (local grid) as used in the block model.

Details of the verification are set out in the Table 14.1.  The data verification had less than 1% errors.

## 14.2 2004 INCO-VICTORY

Victory has not performed any assay data QA/QC but rather relies on the QA/QC program maintained by Inco as described (below) and under the direction of Herb Mackowiak, Area Chemist, Copper Cliff, Ontario, (2004).

'All of the Inco diamond drill samples, including those from the Mel area, are currently prepared and analysed by ALS Chemex.  The samples are analysed for Cu, Ni, Co, Fe, S, As, Pb and Zn by their A6 procedure and designated samples are also analysed for Au, Pt and Pd by fire assay/ICP.  The quality control program consists of monitoring ALS Chemex's internal quality control samples, monitoring the Inco lab's internal quality control samples and randomly selecting samples for check analysis.

Periodically (every two weeks) ALS Chemex sends a digital file, which includes all standards that have been used with the Inco samples and the results of any analytical duplicates.  The control samples are plotted and compared to the expected values for Cu, Ni, Co, Fe, S, As, Pb and Zn.  Any trends and outliers are brought to the attention of ALS Chemex for rectification.  The duplicates are examined to ensure that no outliers outside of the contract specifications have occurred.

Every four to six weeks the ALS Chemex analytical data for all Inco samples are combined in a spreadsheet by department.  Five percent of the samples are randomly selected for check analysis.  A filter (Cu+Ni&gt;0.5%) is used to avoid checking the low-grade samples.  ALS Chemex is requested to create a new pulp from the crushed reserve for the selected check samples.  The new pulps are sent to the Inco Process Technology lab in Copper Cliff for check analysis using a method similar to the one used at ALS Chemex (Na2O2 fusion/ICP).  Any of the samples that were originally analysed for Au, Pt and Pd at ALS Chemex are also analysed for the same at the Inco lab.  All the quality control samples (standards and duplicates) are reported by the Inco lab, along with the results of the check samples.  The quality controls are compiled to ensure that the Inco results continue to meet the highest standards.  In the event of outliers in the check results or the Inco quality controls, a request is sent for the affected samples to be repeated.  A comparison of the Inco samples (both graphically and tabular) compares the original ALS Chemex results to the Inco check results for all elements.  Any outliers outside of the contract specifications are sent to the attention of the quality control department at ALS Chemex with a request for follow-up.  Upon reconciling the differences, corrections are issued by the lab.  This program checks both the sampling and assaying procedures of the contract lab and encourages the lab to minimize systematic errors and to eliminate those errors that occur most frequently. Precision and accuracy of these checks are routinely examined to ensure acceptable levels.

Occasional assay checks of the original pulps at the Inco lab ensure that accuracy at the assaying stage is acceptable.  However, care must be taken to avoid selecting older samples that have oxidized, thereby introducing a source of error.'

## 14.3 SITE VISIT

Shah√© Naccashian, P.Geo, visited Inco's exploration office in Thompson, Manitoba from November 16 th to 17 th , 2006.  He met with Boris Shepertycky, P.Geo. and conducted data verification on the Mel deposit at Inco's office.  Due to inaccessibility to the property, Shah√© visited the site for the second time from January 8 th to 10 th , 2007.  During this visit Shah√© performed core review and visited the Mel Property.  This visit was intended to fulfil the NI 43-101 requirement of a site visit by a Qualified Person. Site visit photos are in Appendix B.

The Mel deposit diamond drill core is stored at the Thaw Shed building on core racks.  The remainder of the drill core boxes were well organized in numeric order on outside racks at the Core Farm.  All core boxes are clearly labelled with aluminium tags.

Wardrop carried a complete geological core review on lithology, mineralization and sampling, checking against drill logs and assay database for the holes shown in Table 14.2.

In addition to the two drill holes completely reviewed, Wardrop visually checked the mineralized sections from the drill holes in Table 14.3 and no discrepancies were found.

Victory has not performed mineral processing or metallurgical testing on the property. However, Inco has conducted ore test work on the Mel deposit.  This test work provided a quantitative analysis of the nickel recovery of Mel ore samples, as well as generated a recovery equation on the basis of ore grade.

A 'time of grind' and float tests were conducted on a high, medium and low grade samples and compared to the sample collection in 2001 from drill hole BT 84   A time of grind was conducted in the lab rod mill for each sample in order to conduct the float test at the current plant setting for Birchtree ore of 18% +100 mesh.  Float tests were then carried out using the same quantities of reagents for each run.

## 17.1 I N T R O D U C T I O N

Wardrop conducted a mineral resource estimate of the sediment and magmatic hosted nickel sulphide mineralization at Mel deposit.  The estimation was completed for nickel at Mel deposit using data from historic and more recent drilling.

## 17.2 DATABASE

The historic database consisting of cored drilling information in the vicinity of the sulphide mineralization totals 296 drillholes comprised of collar, survey, lithology and assay information and is summarized in Table 17.1.

## 17.3 EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is the application of statistical tools to elucidate characteristics of the data such as the shape of the relative frequency distribution and cumulative frequency distributions, as shown on histograms and probability plots, and statistics such as the mean, standard deviation and coefficient of variation.

The coefficient of variation (CV) is the standard deviation divided by the mean.  This is a useful tool to measure the relative dispersion of a distribution.  A CV, which is less than one generally depicts syngenetic deposits.  Coefficients of variation of one to two are typical of hydrothermal processes.  The presence of "bonanza" high-grade shoots or veins may cause the CV to reach three.  Where the CV is greater than three, the mixture of two or more distinct ore-forming processes (or mineralization) can often be identified.

In polymetallic deposits, scatterplots can be useful in demonstrating correlations (positive and negative) between the assays.

Identification of the spatial continuity by means of variography is an EDA tool which is later used to perform kriging and to adjust frequency distributions for change of support (volume) of units considered.

In general, EDA is done on composite-sized volumes, which are nominally of equal length. This is because the variance of a distribution is inversely proportional to the volume of sample used.  Use of unequal length composites can distort the frequency distributions and make variography very noisy.

## 17.3.1 ASSAYS

A total of 4,066 assay intervals from 126 drillholes were selected and defined the zone of mineralization on the deposit.  Data analysis was conducted by creating probability and histogram plots of the data (see Table 17.2). Results of complete probability and histogram plots are in Appendix C.  Non assayed intervals were assigned a value of zero and are included with the assayed values.

Table 17.2 Range of Ni Grades and Ni * Length Values

|             |   Records |   Minimum |   Maximum |   Mean |
|-------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| Ni          |      4066 |         0 |      5.21 |   0.65 |
| Ni * Length |      4066 |         0 |      5.21 |   0.4  |

## 17.3.2 CAPPING

When frequency distributions are skewed, a very small number or proportion of samples may represent a large amount of the contained metal in the resource.  Frequently these samples may be scattered through the deposit and not restricted to spatially identifiable or continuous zones.  Sometimes small clusters of high-grade mineralization may be present, and it may or may not be possible or practical to restrict their influence.  Other times the very high-grade samples may be the result of laboratory errors; pulps sometimes segregate high specific gravity materials like electrum or pyrite and may produce biased results if the pulps are not re-homogenized prior to aliquot selection for analysis.

Even when the assays are valid, linear interpolation (weighted average) grade estimation methods can be adversely affected.  When these methods are used, the inclusion of a highgrade sample will have a greater influence on the estimate than a lower grade sample.  This can lead to undue projection (or smearing) of the effect of high-grade material into areas for which there is no evidence in hand that the high-grade material continues to occur.  Under such circumstances, restriction of the influence of the higher grade material is mandatory.

On the basis of a review of probability and histogram plots and a decile analysis of the assays, it was concluded that there is a reasonable justification for capping of the Ni values. Breaks in the slope of the cumulative probability imply that a few higher grade samples are spatially discontinuous from the remainder of the data set.  The samples were then further investigated by decile and percentile analysis where often the top decile (greatest 10% of the sample population) contained more than 40% of the metal.  Table 17.3 displays the capping limitations of the resource estimation by Ni statistics for the capping exercise. Based on this analysis, capping was applied at 4% Ni, where a total of seven samples were capped.

## Table 17.3 Capping of the Assay Grades

|    |   Records | Percentile   |   Minimum |   Maximum |   Mean |
|----|-----------|--------------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| Ni |         7 | 99 th        |      3.64 |         4 |  3.805 |

## 17.3.3 COMPOSITES

The selected assay information was composited into five foot downhole lengths while honouring the interpreted mineralization type boundaries.  Commonly the compositing of down hole assays results in a fractional length for the last sample in a given hole.  Typically these fractional composites are not used in the resource estimation if they are less than half the composite length.  Box plots were created to compare the composite values based on downhole lengths for the deposit (see Appendix D).  A decision was made to exclude the fractional composites of less than 2.5 ft down the hole near the edge of the mineralized zones.  The fractional composites (54 in total) have no material impact on the resource and were not added to the preceding composites.

Table 17.4 Summary of Composite Data by Sample Length

|    | Composite Length   |   Records |   Minimum |   Maximum |   Mean |
|----|--------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| Ni | All                |      3280 |         0 |     3.826 |  0.39  |

## 17.4 BULK DENSITY

The following paragraph has been extracted from A. Aubut's memo, dated July 2004:

Based on Specific Gravity (SG) measurements made at other deposits in the Thompson area it has been shown that there is generally a linear relationship between Ni grade and SG.  As such several equations have been used over the years to populate the SG filed in the Thompson drillhole database automatically.  Using a polynomial linear regression a formula was determined with which to generate average SG values for the Mel drillholes, based on Ni grade.  A maximum value of 4.65 (the SG for pyrrhotite) was used.  The regression formula used for the drillhole data set is follows:

SG = Ni * 0.4244 + 2.5440

For the resource estimation Wardrop used a tonnage factor of 0.083009 tn/ft  as instructed 3 by A. Aubut.  Wardrop recommends that Victory carry out SG determination prior to carrying out a Preliminary Economic Assessment of the Mel deposit.

## 17.5 GEOLOGICAL INTERPRETATION

The geological interpretation of the Mel deposit was conducted by A. Aubut.  Wardrop verified the interpretation. The wireframe was build using Datamine version 2.1.1633.0.  The mineral envelope represents a single domain.  The mineralization at Mel based on the

drilling to date cannot be easily broken into multiple domains reflecting differences in either grade (high or low) or mineralization type (massive or disseminated).

The total volume of the wireframe compares very well with the block model volume.  The differences between the geological solids and the block model is 1 %.  Table 17.5 tabulates the wireframe and the associated volume.

Table 17.5 Summary of Wireframe Volumes

| Volume (ft )  3   | Volume (ft )  3    |                   |                    |
|-------------------|--------------------|-------------------|--------------------|
| Wireframe         | Model within Block | Volume Difference | Percent Difference |
| 437,311,026       | 431,746,731        | 5,564,295         | 1.29%              |

## 17.6 VARIOGRAPHY

Geostatisticians use a variety of tools to describe the pattern of spatial continuity, or strength of the spatial similarity of a variable with separation distance and direction.  The correlogram measures the correlation between data values as a function of their separation distance and direction.  If we compare samples that are close together, it is common to observe that their values are quite similar and the correlation coefficient for closely spaced samples is near 1.0.  As the separation between samples increases, there is likely to be less similarity in the values and the correlogram tends to decrease toward 0.0.  The distance at which the correlogram reaches zero is called the "range of correlation" or simply the range.  The range of the correlogram corresponds roughly to the more qualitative notion of the "range of influence" of a sample; it is the distance over which sample values show some persistence or correlation.  The shape of the correlogram describes the pattern of spatial continuity.  A very rapid increase near the origin is indicative of short scale variability.  A more gradual increase moving away from the origin suggests longer scale continuity.

Directional sample correlograms were calculated along horizontal azimuths of 0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 210, 240, 270, 300 and 330 degrees.  For each azimuth, sample correlograms were also calculated at dips of 30 and 60 degrees in addition to horizontally. Lastly, a correlogram was calculated in the vertical direction.  Using the thirty-seven correlograms an algorithm determined the best-fit model.  This model is described by the nugget (C0), two nested structure variance contributions (C1, C2), ranges for the variance contributions and the model type (spherical or exponential).  After fitting the variance parameters, the algorithm then fits an ellipsoid to the thirty-seven ranges from the directional models for each structure.  The final models of anisotropy are given by the lengths and orientations of the axes of the ellipsoids.

Variography, using Sage 2001 software, was completed on the Mel deposit for Ni. Downhole variogram was created to determine the nugget effect and the correlograms were modeled to determine spatial continuity of the composited mineralization.  Table 17.6 summarizes the results of the variography and individual variography plots for Ni is in Appendix E.

## 17.7 BLOCK MODEL

The resource block model was created using Datamine version 2.1.1633.0. Table 17.7 summarizes the block model limits of the mine grid system.  The block model was not rotated.

Table 17.7 Resource Block Model

| Coordinate   |   Origin |   Number of Blocks |   Block Side (ft) |   Model Extent (ft) |

The drillhole spacing varies from 50 to 200 foot across the deposit.  A block size of 25 * 25 * 25 foot was selected in order to accommodate the widely spaced drilling and the open pit and underground mining block size.

## 17.8 I N T E R P O L A T I O N   P L A N

The interpolation plan of the Mel deposit resource estimation was completed using the following estimation methods: nearest neighbour (NN), inverse distance squared (ID) and ordinary kriging (OK).

The estimations were designed as a three pass system.  Table 17.8 below summarizes search distances and rotations for estimating a block as well as minimum and maximum number of composites required.

## 17.9 RESOURCE CLASSIFICATION

Several factors were used in the determination of the mineral resource classification as follows:

- ¬∑ CIM requirements and guidelines;
- ¬∑ Experience with similar deposits;
- ¬∑ Spatial continuity of mineralization.

No known environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, socio-economic, marketing or other relevant issues are known to the authors that may affect the estimate of a mineral resource.  Mineral reserves can only be estimated on and economic evaluation that is used in a preliminary feasibility or a feasibility study on a mineral project, thus no reserves have been estimated.  As per NI 43-101, mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have economic viability.

Table 17.9 Resource Classification Criteria

| Indicated                                            | Inferred                                                |
|------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Distance to nearest composite  is less than 125 feet | Distance to nearest composite  is greater than 125 feet |

Figure 17.2 shows a three dimensional view of Mel Deposit.  Red blocks represent the indicated blocks and green blocks represent the inferred blocks.

## 17.10 RESOURCE TABULATION

The mineral resource estimation at Mel is tabulated in Table 17.10 for the Indicated and Inferred resources respectively.  Ordinary kriging interpolation is used for the resource tabulation for Mel deposit.

| Inferred         | 0.5-999       | 1,010,000 |   0.839 | 847,390   |

## 17.11 MODEL VALIDATION

The Mel deposit resource estimation was validated by the following methods:

- ¬∑ Comparison of global mean grades based on ID and OK estimation methods;
- ¬∑ Visual comparisons of colour coded block grades and drillhole composite for the three estimation methods of NN, ID and OK;
- ¬∑ Swath plot comparisons of estimated methods of NN, ID and OK.

## 17.11.1 GLOBAL COMPARISON

The global block model estimation of the OK method was compared to that of the global estimation of the model values.  Table 17.11 shows the comparisons for the three estimation methods using all blocks.  The contained metal differences between the methods were 5% between ID and OK.

## 17.11.2 VISUAL COMPARISON

The visual comparison of block model grades against composite grades of the metal display a reasonable correlation between the values (see Figure 17.3).  No significant discrepancies were apparent between the sections.  Appendix F contains representative sections for the OK model estimates and drillhole composites.

## 17.11.3 SWATH PLOT COMPARISON

Swath plots of the estimated blocks by Easting, Northing and Elevation (see Figures 17.4, 17.5 and 17.6 respectively) were another mode of direct comparison between the models. Generally, OK reflects the greatest smoothing followed by ID and then NN estimation methods.  Along the margins of the deposit and in areas of extreme data density the apparent relationship between the drillhole grades and estimated grades may change.  This is reflected in the areas of lower number of blocks being estimated in the swath plots.

Wardrop has conducted a mineral resource estimate on the Mel deposit.  The deposit is sediment and magmatic hosted sulphide deposit consisting mainly of nickel.  The resource was based on composited assayed data derived from cored drilling.  The estimate was restricted to a 3D wireframe of the interpreted mineralized envelope.

The Mel property is underlain by Opswagan Group rocks notably the lower sections of the Pipe Formation that contains most of the nickel deposits in the Thompson Nickel Belt (TNB). The history of deformation at the Mel deposit is similar to that described at nickel deposits elsewhere in the TNB.  The Mel deposit is considered a favourable geological environment for nickel mineralization.

The location, size and shape of the lenses of nickel mineralization of potential economic interest is erratic and somewhat unpredictable at this stage of delineation and additional drilling is required to better define the deposit.  As a consequence the Mel deposit remains incompletely delineated and the mineral resource estimates should be upgraded by diamond drilling.  Potential exists to modestly increase the tonnage of the Mel deposit within the currently defined limits and to extend the deposit along strike.

The 3D wireframe of the mineralized envelope contains all mineral intersections related to the main mineral zone at Mel.

Data verification of the drillhole database suggested that the information is reliable and adequate for resource estimation.

The specific gravities of the various types of nickel mineralization have not been measured at Mel deposit. For the resource estimation Wardrop used a tonnage factor of 0.083009 as recommended by Inco geologists.

The resource was estimated using three interpolation methods: nearest neighbour, inverse distance and ordinary kriging.  No significant discrepancies exist between the methods and ordinary kriging is used for the resource tabulation.

At a cut-off of 0.5 % Ni, the Mel Deposit has resulted in an Indicated resource of 4,279,000 tons grading 0.875 % Ni plus an Inferred resource of 1,010,000 tons grading 0.839 % Ni.

Additional drilling is recommended on the Mel deposit in order to improve the resource classification and to increase confidence in grade continuity.  Wardrop suggests performing infill drilling along strike as well as bracket holes at depth where the higher grade material is identified.

Wardrop recommends exploration on the Mel lease to extend the Mel deposit along strike thereby potentially increasing the tonnage estimates and drilling on Mel mineral claims to further explore the lower Pipe Formation.

This resource estimate only included nickel (Ni) values but the assay database includes values for copper (Cu) and cobalt (Co).  Wardrop recommends that all samples be assayed for Ni, Cu, Co and Platinum Group Elements (PGE) as well as all potential payable and deleterious elements.

Additional bulk density determinations of the mineralized material should be carried out so that specific gravity data can be incorporated into resource block model for estimation.

Additional drilling is recommended so that samples can be collected for metallurgical testing and mineral processing at Mel deposit.

Wardrop believes that the current resource block model honours the high grade values well and that local grade variations are reasonably well represented.  However, more work is required to improve the local grade estimation within the block model estimation, possibly multiple indicator kriging and unfolding to compare with the current estimation method. Globally, the Wardrop resource compares well with previous Inco estimates.  For preliminary economic assessment or feasibility type study work, where selective mining methods or detailed engineering design work will be required, Wardrop recommends updating the current resource block model.  This exercise will be beneficial once new drilling data becomes available.

DATE

September 28,2004

## SUBJECT ALS CHEMEX \_ AUDIT OF SAMPLE PREPARATION AND LABORATORY

## Introduction

Diamond drill core samples from Sudbury, Thompson and Voisey's are prepared and analysed by ALS Chemex under a three-year contract.  That contract was renewed September 1; 2004 for a three-year period To ensure that the lab is operating in a sound manner;, periodic audits are carried out. During the August  16-18, 2004, Mickael Cabon (Goro Ni chemist)   and H. Mackowiak   visited the ALS Chemex analytical laboratory at 212 Brooksbank Avenue in North Vancouver, and between August 24 and August 25, Mickael Cabon, Jean-Yves Cloutier (Project Manager; Goro Support) and H. Mackowiak visited the ALS Chemex sample preparation facilities located at 5175 Timberlea Blvd. in Mississauga. Bay period

## Executive Summarx

This audit identified several significant problems in the ALS Chemex procedures that are used for Inco samples The findings were passed on to ALS Chemex at a closing meeting at each facility and most of this summary will be e-mailed to them for their records. being key

In the sample preparation area, the following significant problems were identified:

- 1 . Inco (Sudbury Operations) samples continue to arrive with electronic submittals that are either sent several weeks before or several weeks after the samples arrive. This results in ALS Chemex having to constantly update an inventory of forms and samples: This has gone on for some time and requires a change in the way the forms are generated at Inco and sent to ALS Chemex.
- 3 Currently the initial label that ALS Chemex for the samples when arrive (which eventually becomes the for the reject) does not identify the Inco sample Id. This is a result of their operating system and a lack of bar codes on our end. Where feasible we should switch to bar-coded sample tags as soon as possible. prints they tag
- 2 on the outside of the in addition to having the Inco sample Inco should refrain from writing the sample number on the outside of the forcing ALS Chemex to rely on the sample tag: This avoids a possible error on the Inco end resulting in an error at ALS Chemex.  We must ensure that the is visible without having to take the apart. bag, tag bag
- 4 was witnessed for the Inco samples indicated poor techniques: The material was poured too quickly, which resulted in plugging the riffle and spilling crushed material on the table. The situation would be far worse with the larger Inco samples. It is recommended that ALS Chemex initiate additional training for sample preparation staff, stressing the importance of this and increase the supervision in this area until the problem is rectified: A larger riffle may also help to alleviate the problem. step,
- 5 Crushed rejects as old as three years  are requested by Inco to be stored in the ALS Chemex freezer. These rejects may be oxidized to the where the identification of the sample is difficult being point

and if that is the case the material would be of little use in any mill test; It is recommended that rejects be placed in the freezer as soon as possible after the results are reported and that nothing older than one year be placed in the freezer.

In the laboratory in Vancouver; the following were considered significant: findings

- 1 . The calibration solutions for the ME-ICP8I procedure are created incorrectly- Although this was rectified by the use of a factor in the program for this analytical package, the procedure for creating the calibration solutions should be corrected and the factor should be taken out.  This should also result in a reduction of the allowable limits on the QC solutions for this procedure. It should be stressed that creating the calibration solutions by weight is an excellent idea. being
- 3 The limits for the elements in the lab's de-ionized water as listed in the document ~DI Water Testing 1.00 Jan. 8, 2003" these limits are too high. The lab should examine these and rectify the document,
- 2 The program that controls the weighing of the samples allows a sample to be weighed out of sequence which sample is weighed, it is not enough to ensure that the technician realizes the sample is out of sequence. This should be rectified. being
- 4 A addition the short document for the ME-ICP81 procedure incorrectly specified the temperature of the furnace. large
- 5 Examination of the ALS Chemex Internal Duplicates found some cases that were failures and were not followed up by the technician: These were noted by Michele Ramshaw and were to be followed up. The ALS Chemex internal duplicates will now be examined on monthly basis the ALS Chemex fommula to determine if the failures have been followed up. It is also recommended that the follow-up results should be part of the QC certificate so that the customer is aware of the follow-up. using

## ALS Chemex Mississauga

During the aftemoon of August 24 and the moring of August 25, Jean-Yves Cloutier, Mickael Cabon and H. Mackowiak visited ALS Chemex's sample preparation facility in Mississauga.   Walter Spooner; Manager of Sample Preparation; accompanied the group for the entire time. These facilities are used for the   preparation of all diamond drill   samples from Thompson (both   Manitoba Division and ITSL Thompson) and Sudbury (both Sudbury Operations and ITSL Basin Exploration). The Voisey's core is prepared at Eastern Analytical in Goose who then forward a 100 g split of the pulps to ALS Chemex in Mississauga. The ALS Chemex sample preparation lab has seen an increase in the number of samples and is currently operating seven a week on 10 hour shifts and are processing 2,000-3,000 samples per week. Bay Bay, days

## Sample Receipt

Upon receipt of an Inco shipment of core samples; a unique shipment number is assigned to the shipment (Figure 1). The submission forms are used to out the samples in the order indicated on the submission forms and to check for extra or missing samples: Once complete, the various groups of samples on the submission form are assigned a unique ALS Chemex work order number, which is controlled by GEMS, their in-house LIMS software which controls all aspects of the sample flow at ALS Chemex . lay

The work orders assigned to a particular shipment are entered into a (Figure 2) During the visit examples were given of Sudbury Operations shipments that do not always have a submission sheet: As a result; ALS Chemex cannot proceed with these samples. The problem; a result of the shipping forms generated by the logging program; can behind a shipment by several weeks depending on the length of the hole and whether a technician has completed sampling the hole by the time the form is generated and sent to ALS Chemex. This must be remedied at our end. log being lag

## Sample Entry

Labels indicating the work order number and the sequence number of the sample (Figures 3 and 4) are printed for the received samples. There is no reference to the Inco sample number and that is a result of the configuration of the Chemex system and the fact that we do not have bar-coded tags. Implementation of bar-coding at Inco should be actively pursued. The labels are applied to the sample are then weighed (Figure 5) and logged into the system The Inco sample Ids are then entered into the system: In addition it was noticed that the technicians do not necessarily check the Inco sample tag; but rely on the sample number written on the by Inco. It is recommended that Inco refrain from writing the sample number on the This avoids mistakes at our end and forces ALS Chemex to check the actual sample Once the Inco sample Ids are entered into the system, labels are printed for the Master pulp and split pulp that will go to Vancouver for analysis. bags, they bag bags. tag bag

## Crushing

The Inco samples are crushed in two stages; regardless of the sample size. Prior to commencing a work order, the crushers are cleaned by passing through a piece of granite. The two pulp the reject and the Inco are checked against each other and pinned to the wall next to the crusher (Figure 6). This ensures that the proper bags and Id follow the sample through the preparation process The Inco samples that were prepared at the time of our visit were relatively small and virtually no cleaning of the primary crusher was occurring; When queried, the response was that the cleaning of the primary crusher was left to the discretion of the operator. The secondary crusher was also cleaned to use. Upon completion of the primary crush; the tray containing the crushed sample was pulled out and the material was fed into the secondary crusher. The bags and from the primary station were then transferred to the wall beside the secondary crusher (Figure 7) It was noticed that the transfer of the material from the secondary crusher to the riffle, that the crusher tray had a pinhole in it that allowed fines to turned down to 35 in order to minimize airborne dust and to avoid personal injury. The minimal cleaning can be a source of cross contamination; particularly for exploration samples that at times can be very small (i.e, 100 g) bags, bag tag being prior tags during psi grab

The crusher operator does a QC check (screen on 10 mesh) of the quality of the crush within the first three samples of a work order. If the test fails (70% &lt;10 mesh), then the crusher is adjusted.  The results are entered onto a slip of paper (Figure 8) which are compiled on a monthly basis and plotted for a visual verification of the crush QC (Figure 9) The crushing of the samples on a work order is also entered onto a crusher log which permits tracing back with respect to samples prepared before and after the samples in question; who prepared the samples; which crusher was used, the and time the samples were prepared and how many samples were in the work order. day

The results of the cleaning material which are assayed once a month, were examined during the visit. It was found that the black granite used to clean the crusher exhibited elevated levels of Cu (up to 100 ppm) Ni (up to 400 ppm) and $ These elevated levels have been present for most of this year and it still had not been determined if this was a case of the material having elevated levels rather than carry-over from the previous work order or contamination from the preparation equipment. In addition; it was noted that one of the procedures examined in Vancouver implicitly mentioned that crusher cleaning material must be tested to used. prior being

## Splitting

The and tags   are transferred to the splitting station. The protocol for Inco samples is to recombine the initial split this is intended to be a homogenizing Those directions were visibly posted (Figures 11 and 12). The riffle and pans were cleaned with compressed air between samples. It was noted that the operator was the bags step. filling

riffle too quickly, resulting in the chutes becoming plugged and in one case, the crushed material spilled onto the bench top. The poor splitting technique can result in a pulp that is not truly representative of the whole: The reject continues to be split until approximately 250 g of material is obtained. This is then poured into the Master pulp for pulverizing: The remaining reject is into the original reject if it is useable; along with the Inco sample for storage. bag put bag; tag

## Pulping

The pulverizer (Figure 13) is cleaned with quartz at the beginning of each work order, There are two pots for each pulverizer, each pot a different color; which matches the color of the sample holders. The color coding is used to minimize mix-ups in this part of the operation: A of acetone is added to the material in each bowl to minimize plating of the fines. The Inco samples are typically pulverized for 140 seconds. One of the first three samples in a at 200 mesh to determine if the pulverization is adequate. Each work order is also entered into a station log (Figure 14), which lists the work order; the client code; the number of samples; name of the operator and the date. bag squint

## Storage

The rejects are stored in one cubic metre wooden boxes with lids in the back of the building (Figure 15)

Rejects that may require mill testing in the future are requested to be stored in ALS Chemex' s freezer storage; Recently there have been requests to store some older rejects; Figure 16 is an example of a three year old reject the sulphides have oxidized to the point where the canvas is disintegrating (this also happens with plastic bags) making identification difficult and affecting the integrity of the sample: If rejects are to be stored in the freezer;, must be placed there as soon as possible there is no point in storing something that is two years old or older (Figure 17, two year old rejects) . bag they

Currently the freezer storage is at Imperial Freezers Inc. (Figure 18). Examination of the facilities found the material to be stored at -139C. All material in the freezer is catalogued by both Imperial and ALS Chemex. The samples are in 5 gallon pails, 27 pails to a shrink-wrapped skid (Figure 19)

## Training

As in Vancouver; the tasks for a particular area are broken down into jobs. The training is broken down into three categories: ~Under Training' ~Under Supervision" and #Competent? . Figure 20 is a summary of the skills of the sample preparation staff. Although everything seemed to be in order, we did find that one of the technicians was not trained to do s0 was seen operating the forklift.

## Health and Safety

In the work area, the workers were all wearing protective eyewear, hearing protection and dust masks, as required. The work area was posted with respect to the required protection. However, during the visit and in a discussion with Walter it was found that:

- No silica program or monitoring of silica is in place:
- Some of the equipment (crusher and compressor) did not have belt guards.
- No safety talks or meetings have taken place.
- The repair area had an open pan of cleaning fluid on the floor, which may pose a fire hazard.
- A 45 gallon drum of acetone was not grounded.

## ALS Chemex, North Vancouver

During the three-day visit at the facility in North Vancouver; Mickael and Herb were accompanied by Michele   Ramshaw,   Manager of   Quality   Systems; ALS Chemex . The first was spent on a familiarization tour covering the entire facility and then closely examining the documentation .  It was apparent that ALS Chemex is in the midst of massive renovation; which includes reorganizing the various departments so that the samples flow in an orderly fashion: It will also isolate the instrumentation (ICP's, ICP-MS, AA and XRF) from the sample preparation and digestion areas day

ALS Chemex s documentation of their quality system and procedures is extensive:. We reviewed the main printed documents held by Michele's Quality group.

Although this is critical with respect to documents for procedures, the bench apparently has the most recent version; which is obtained from the server . Comparison of these methods to the abbreviated methods available for customers found that the abbreviated version could also be out of date and incorrect an example is the incorrect temperature of the furnace for the abbreviated method for ME-ICP8I.

During the examination of the documentation; a document (DI Water Testing 1.00 Jan. 8, 2003) was encountered where a procedure was put in place to ensure that the water used in the lab was of sufficient quality to allow determination of trace elements . However, examination of the table found the limits to be of the lab.

## Procedures\_Used on Inco Samples

The entire ALS Chemex   operation is controlled by an internally   developed Laboratory   Information Management System (LIMs) known as GEMS. The software controls the entry of samples into the lab, the procedures required, scheduling of the samples for the various procedures; handling and evaluation of the data from the instruments and invoicing: It allows a customer to view live all of their work orders and their   current status including the parameters determined, current results, the lab's internal QC' including standards and duplicates and the performance of a particular parameter with respect to the QC currently obtained for this customer and others . This software and the use of bar coding at the sample' s entry to the lab has allowed the lab to efficiently handle the current elevated levels of sample submissions (~50,000 samples/week, which is double last year's volume) being of ~100 g is sent from Toronto by courier to Vancouver and automatically tracked by Vancouver. The Inco samples usually go straight into the process do not need to be opened andor examined at reception (Figure 21) All samples are weighed in one central weighing room. Each weighing station is equipped with a scanner, since all samples are bar coded by the time reach this stage in the lab. Weigh sheets (Figure 22) accompany the boxes of samples indicate the client code, the work order, the procedure, the desired weight range and the sample Id, which is the sequence number of that sample in that work order. As each sample is taken out of its the sample is scanned and then weighed. The weight is electronically captured. When examining this area of the lab, I requested that the technician weigh a sample out of sequence the program automatically entered the weight into the appropriate slot but it now was up to the technician to recognize that the sample was out of sequence and that the weighed sub-sample did not belong in the next crucible. This is a weakness in the process and a possible source of mix-ups. The lab was requested to examine the process. split they they box,

The maintenance sheet for one of the balances (Figure 29) was examined; it had been routinely checked and all was in order. The balance was checked on a monthly basis for two weight ranges (30 g and 200 g) appropriate for that particular task (weighing fire assay sub-samples) being

## ME-ICP8I Procedure

This procedure involves the fusion of the samples t0 determine Ni, Fe, S, Pb, Zn, Ca and Si in ore samples. Other elements that are also determined but not reported to Inco include Al, Cr;, K, Ti, Zr and Eu. The Europium (10 ppm final solution) is used as an internal standard and is introduced at the nebulization stage by the use of a peristaltic pump as the solutions are introduced to the ICP . The procedure entails the following steps: Cu, Co, As, Mg; grade Mn,

- Each set of samples consists of 40 positions. The first position is a reagent blank followed by the certified standard SUla. The second weighing of SUla is randomly selected by the program followed by another standard at the end of the set.
- Weigh ~0.2 g of sample into zirconium crucible. If the sample weight is outside of the allowable range (allowable range of 0.15-0.25), the program will not allow the of the sample until the weight has been appropriately adjusted. entry
- Load crucibles into crucible Place a lid on each crucible. tray .
- Add 1 scoop (~2 g) of NazOz into each crucible (Figure 23). Homogenize by slowly shaking:
- Cool and place each crucible and lid into a covered 250 ml beaker.
- Leach fused cake with warm deionized water .
- Rinse twice with warm deionized water and 10% HCI.
- Add 75 mls of concentrated HCI.
- Transfer to 250 ml flask. Cool and bulk up to volume and 'bubble" .
- Transfer solutions to 20 mm x 150 mm plastic test tubes.

The entire procedure was observed.  The samples are weighed into the crucibles on a flat and after homogenizing the NazOz and sample, the crucibles are transferred to a metal tray for insertion into the furnace (Figure 24). Again this could be another source of mix-ups and it is suggested that there be enough trays s0 that the weighing stage is done with the crucibles in the fusion trays. Discussion with the technician handling the fusion and dissolution of the cakes (Figure 25) did not leave a comfortable feeling regarding the outcome of samples that exhibited a poor fusion; residue in the bottom of the flask. Although it was suggested that the method of questioning did not elicit the correct response, solutions were present where a residue was clearly present. It was also noted that for the set of samples observed through the procedure no visible check of the solutions for residue was made. The technician did indicate that when encounter crucibles that had leaked during the fusion stage due to a pinhole in the crucible, the samples were redone. It had been noted that in the official methods, a document labelled 'Vancouver Advanced Spectroscopy Weighing Table April 22, 2002" indicated that the sample weight for the ME ICP8I was 0.199-0.201 grams and that the standards to be used were SUla and GS2305 . The current weight range used is 0.15-0.25 g and the standard GS2305, which was an internal Inco standard, has been exhausted and is no longer available. tray ie, they unique of the procedure was which is the present   method of homogenizing the bulked up solution; replacing manually mixing of the 250 ml volumetrics. The solution is then decanted into plastic test tubes and logged into the network as ready for the ICP determination. The entire procedure appeared to be tuned and able to handle large volumes of samples. part

The instrument room; which was crowded, is to be moved to one of the upper floors. ALS Chemex currently has 13 new Vista Pro ICPs (Figure 28) with several of the older Optimas. The Optimas were on their last Two more Vistas were on order. Each instrument had a vented enclosure for the solutions legs.

analysed this avoids excessive corrosion of the instruments . For the ME-ICP81 determination the testing of the Vistas with respect to response and linearity was examined . Mickael, who also operates a Varian Vista in the Pilot Plant lab in Goro, indicated that the operating parameters were in order. being

The preparation of the calibration solutions for the ME-ICP8I was observed. In order to ensure accurate creation of the calibration solutions the aliquot of the stock solution is done based on weight rather than pipetting a set volume (50 mls in this case) . However, closer examination of the procedure found that the method was flawed the final solution was brought up to 500 g Since the solution was not pure water; the 500 g did not equate to 500 mls. A theoretical calculation of the five calibrations solutions used for the ME-ICP8I procedure indicated that were probably high by a range of 7.7% relative to 9.3% relative; which would have resulted in results low by the same amounts\_ When confronted, ALS Chemex admitted that realized that something wasn't right but couldn't see their error. In any case inserted a hidden factor of roughly 7.5% to compensate for the error in creating the calibration solutions. During the examination of several runs on the ICP, it was found that the factor to a run based on the QC solution did not match the results of the QC solution The reason was the hidden factor for the calibration solutions. During the analytical run; if GEMS encounters a result for the QC solution outside set limits it automatically  recalibrates   and reruns the samples. solutions and samples simplifying the reviewer's task of ensuring the results can be released.  The QC solution has 200 ppm 100 ppm S, 50 ppm of Cu and Ni and 1 ppm of Co. Given that we are routinely getting results for it is suggested that the QC solution include Mg. they they applied Fe,

A system is in place to automatically check new calibration solutions. It includes determining if a bias is developing over time in the new solutions; thus ensuring the highest accuracy possible. The attention paid to creating the calibration solutions is a welcome sight, given that all of the final results depend on this critical process. The results of the checks of the solutions are documented and retained.

## PGM-ICP27 Procedure

The samples are weighed (~30 g) and the weight is electronically captured as in the ME-ICP81 procedure. The weighed sample is placed in small coin envelopes and forwarded to the fire assay department. The fire assay facility then adds the pre-made flux and any other required reagent (flour, niter) according to what the technician perceives as required for the samples on hand.  Crucibles   are automatically cleared by GEMS at a cut-off of 1 ppm for either Pt or Pd. The fire assay facility uses three gas 45-50 minutes. A fusion set includes one blank, two in-house standards, three sample duplicates and three Cu markers. The Cu markers, which are randomly placed, ensure that one set cannot be mixed with the sheet of another set The fusion set is loaded with pneumatic forks that load the entire set at once (Figure 27). At the completion of the fusion; each column (seven fusion pots) is poured at once: Once the lead button is extracted, the samples are cupelled for one hour to one hour and 10 minutes at 9809C. Again the entire set is loaded into the furnace. The fire assay supervisor maintains a board indicating which person is to load and unload which furnace at a particular time. It is the only way that you can eight people to handle 4,000 fire assays in one shift. The fire assay department relies heavily on those that pour the fusions and pick the beads in the cupelling stage. Its at these points in the procedure that problems with the process for a given sample would be noticed. However; it depends heavily on complete co-operation amongst the staff: In the entire lab, this is probably the weakest link. being Au, get

The Ag beads containing the PMs are digested in a microwave with 0.5 mls of 50% HNO; for 2 minutes. The solution is bulked up to a total of 4 mls. The bulk up solution contains Europium, which is used as an internal standard. The QC solution for the PMs is a 7 ppm concentration of Pt and Pd. Au,

## AA45 Procedure Trace Pb and As

The last procedure that was examined was the AA45 method used for both trace Pb and As. A sub-sample of 0.5 g is digested with a mixture of aqua regia and Aerosol OT-B solution: After sitting for 60-90 a hot block for 45 minutes. De-ionized water is used to bulk up the solutions to 12.5 mls. The Pb is determined on an AA with the following parameters: 4 ma; slit 0.5 nm; ^ = 283.3; background corrected; air-acetylene flame. The As is determined on an AA with the following parameters: 10 ma; slit = 0.5 nm; ^ 193.7; background corrected; nitrous oxideacetylene flame: It was noted that the room for the AA determination for Pb-AA45 was next to the fire assay room. Although I was assured that were under separate air systems; it still is a little too close for comfort given the pure PbO that is used in fire assaying: lamp lamp they

## Fire Assay Training

Given the high volume of samples; a discussion focused on employee turn around, how the lab maintains trained staff and their training program. An example of the records kept is attached as Figure 30. A given department is broken down into jobs or tasks. There are three levels of training assigned to each All staff must undergo training to ensure that work in a safe manner. During the visit all of the workers that required personal protective were wearing them (eyewear, dust masks; gloves and hearing protection). Workers in the fire assay area were wearing separate workwear that was laundered by a contract firm for ALS Chemex. they

## Database

Some time was spent examining the database from the perspective of the employee: In addition; some time was spent looking at samples that had failed Inco's check program and cases where the Chemex internal duplicates indicated a significant difference. In the case of poor duplicates; where it appeared that the run was approved   without any reason   given; follow up was requested. In addition; a closer examination of all Chemex internal duplicates   was initiated. determine a failure for the duplicates is:

IF abs (Assayl Assay2) &gt; Average (Assayl &amp; Assay2) X Precision 100 + 2* LOR then FAILURE where LOR limit of reporting

It was also recommended that in cases where follow up was carried out, the follow-up results should be reported to the customer as evidence of good QA practices. One incident found that the P channel had failed (with the loss of the ICP purge gas, the P results which are measured in the UV region become excessively elevated and erratic) . This also results in S results, particularly at lower concentrations. noisy
