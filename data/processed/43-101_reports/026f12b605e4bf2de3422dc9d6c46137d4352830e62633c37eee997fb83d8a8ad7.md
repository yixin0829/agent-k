## SUMMARY

The preliminary economic analysis is preliminary in nature and includes inferred mineral resources that are considered to be too speculative; geologically; to have the economic considerations applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as a mineral reserve and there is no certainty that the preliminary economic analysis will be realized.

This Technical Report on the Springer Tungsten Project in Imlay, Nevada; USA; was originally prepared for EMC Metals Corp. (EMC), a Canadian TSX-listed mining company, headquartered October, 2012 AGL changed its name to DMT Geosciences Ltd. as part  of a worldwide corporate re-branding of the DMT Group.

EMC's wholly owned subsidiary, Springer Mining Company (SMC), has been acquired by Silver Predator Corp. of Reno; Nevada in a related-party transaction with Americas Bullion Royalty Corp. DMT Geosciences has been asked to amend and restate the technical report in the name of Silver Predator Corp. There have been no material   changes in the technical information contained in this report and the effective date of the report remains the same.

DMT Geosciences has reviewed all of the pricing assumptions in the current report and finds them to be current and reasonable.

This Technical Report has been independently prepared for Silver Predator as an NI 43-101 compliant Technical Report by DMT Geosciences Ltd. (DMT); of Calgary; Alberta; Canada; with Report, or the Technical Report)

This Technical Report represents a resource update on the Springer property, where resources were previously   reported in NI EMC by Simpson (2008) and by SRK (2009):

"Technical Report on the Springer   Mine Property  Pershing County, Nevada, USA Vernon; BC for Golden Predator Mines Inc.,

"NI 43-101 Technical Report on Resources, EMC Facility - Sutton Beds, Nevada, USAprepared by SRK Consulting of Lakewood, CO. for EMC Metals Corp., Effective Date 15, 2009. May

Where there has been no change in the previously disclosed status; DMT has drawn freely from these reports, which were available from EMC and from the SEDAR website at WWW.sedar.com: DMT summarized information from these earlier   technical  reports where appropriate; and quoted directly on other occasions. Quoted text is indented, but may not be otherwise referenced .

This Technical Report also represents an initial Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA) on the economics of the restart of the Springer Tungsten mine and mill facility .

This Technical Report was also prepared in an attempt to establish the following objectives for Silver Predator management and investors:

Preliminary Economic Assessment of the Springer Tungsten Mine, Project No. 2012CMAA.034 Pershing County, Nevada, USA Prepared for Silver Predator Corp., Reno, Nevada

<!-- image -->

- Define the feasibility of an economic restart of the existing facilities and mine; 
- Revise resource estimates to reflect current   tungsten market   prices; market demand, and new  data on the western side of   the property not included in previous resource estimates;
-  Review and define the opportunities to develop mine production from areas mined historically, but not incorporated in the existing minelmill infrastructure developed by the last ownerloperator on the property (General Electric Company) , and
-  Establish a base for both project restart and operations. line

## 1.1 Property Description and Location

The Springer Facility is located approximately 30 miles southwest of the city of Winnemucca, 130 miles northeast of Reno, Nevada. The drive from Interstate 80 near Mill   City , is approximately 15 minutes north. The mine has year-round access by a gravel road in fair condition:. The mine site at geographic   coordinate's 40946'56"N latitude and 118*07'58"W longitude; (UTM coordinates are 404,438E,4,515,212N, Zone 11T, WGS84) .

## 1.2 Ownership

The Springer Facility is 100% owned by Springer Mining Company, a wholly owned   subsidiary of Silver Predator Corp. It is   comprised of 340 lode mineral claims totaling approximately 7,024 acres; 25 placer claims totaling approximately 500 acres and fee lands   totaling   approximately 3,756 acres: The total area of the Springer Facility is approximately 11,280 acres, including all mineral claims and fee lands. The mineral resources described in this report are located entirely on private fee lands.

## 1.3 Geology and Mineralisation

The Springer facility is located on the eastern flank of the Eugene Mountains; a block-faulted horst of the Basin and Range tectonic province. The underlain by Mesozoic; rocks intruded by Cretaceous granitic rocks; which were later overlain by Tertiary volcanic rocks. The metasedimentary rocks are composed of pelitic sediments with thin beds of micritic limestone. These limestone beds host scheelite-bearing; contact metasomatic skarn deposits.  These are arranged in two general horizons each with several individual beds. The horizons  strike north-northeast and dip steeply to the northwest and to the southeast. Scheelite is the only tungsten mineral identified localized marble fronts. It is also associated with later alteration of garnet and pyroxene; where it occurs as coarse-grained aggregates and fine to mediumgrained, euhedral dipyramidal crystals.

## Exploration 1.4

There were three main phases of exploration work conducted on the Springer Facility by three different ownerloperators. These exploration periods include:

- Exploration drilling and underground sampling  Nevada Massachusetts Corporation (NMC) between 1925 and 1958,
-  underground channel   sampling completed by General Electric Company (GE) and Utah International Inc. (UII) between 1973 and 1982, and
-  Diamond drilling and reverse circulation drilling  completed by EMC in 2007 and 2008.

The NMC exploration work focused mainly within the mineralized beds located at the any of the drifting, mining or drilling is available for any of these areas.

The exploration drilling and sampling completed by GE and Ull focused primarily on the Sutton and Sutton II areas The vast majority of the modern exploration data was collected during this phase of work. GE and Ull compiled most of the older NMC data; rehabilitated the historic underground workings, drilled 119 diamond core holes from surface and underground, extended the underground workings and analyzed approximately 3,200 samples.

seven diamond core and 251 reverse circulation (RC) drill holes were completed in three main areas. EMC drilled 81 holes in the George beds; 79 holes in the Mill Beds and 51 holes in the Sutton Beds. AII of   this   drilling focused on near surface mineralization in order to evaluate the open pit potential. A few diamond core holes were located in the Sutton areas for confirmation and expansion of the historical resources.

## 1.5 Mineral Resource Estimate

DMT has audited the Sutton and Sutton Il resource estimates prepared by SRK and detailed in their 2009 Technical Report on Resources (op. cit.) DMT considers that the SRK estimate has been reported in accordance with the National Instrument 43-101 Standards for Disclosure for Mineral Projects and prepared according to the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum Best Practices and Reporting Guidelines"

The 2009 SRK resource estimates were based on a cut-off grade for WO of 0.3%. Stronger current prices (2009 was a tungsten price low-point for the last 7.5 years) since the time of the last resource estimate now support a lower cut-off level in the resource calculations. DMT has applied a 0.2%, cut-off over all resources in this updated estimate.

## Financial Analysis 1.6

The economic evaluation the Project considered all capital and development costs to reestablish Springer Tungsten Mine as a modern long-hole mine (also referred to as end slicing) . This includes capital and capitalized development costs to establish ramp connected levels, and adit access for both mining operations; and to complete a refurbishment of the mill facility which has been partially refurbished, along with contemplated new mill circuits to produce scheelite concentrates for world markets. on

The mine plan calls for two separate mining operations:

- The primary mine operation at Sutton (the existing GE mine) on the eastern side of the property, and 
- A new, smaller, high grade mine at on the western side of the property accessed by adit. 

The mine life presented in all economics is defined by the NI 43-101 resource estimate; and limited to approximately 5 years (4.8 years) of production.

A summary of financial and operating parameters is included in the following two tables; Table 1.3, and Table 1.4, below. key

## INTRODUCTION AND TERMS OF REFERENCE

## Description of the Issuer 2.1

Silver Predator Corp. (The Company) of Reno; Nevada is listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange (trading symbol SPD). Silver Predator was established as a silver explorer with projects in the Western United States and the Yukon Territory in Canada. In a press-release dated December 17t 2013 The Company announced the acquisition of the Springer Tungsten Mine and Mill as well as a basket of assets held by Nevada Royalty Corp. The Springer project includes an historic  underground tungsten mine; a previously  operated tungsten ore milling  facility, all support infrastructure and approximately 11,280 acres of mineral claims and fee lands.

Silver Predator   Corp. has entered into an Agreement to acquire all of   the issued and outstanding shares of each of the Springer Mining Company and the Nevada Royalty Corp. from Golden a wholly owned  subsidiary of Americas Bullion Royalty Corp. Consideration for the acquisition will be USS5,000,000 payable over five years and the grant by the Company of various royalty interests in its' properties held at closing. Concurrent with the acquisition Americas Billion will commit an additional USS1,800,000 via a private placement to fund the Company. Corp.,

Americas Bullion (AMB) intends to complete a pre-closing reorganization resulting in AMB becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Newco. All of AMB's existing royalties in Springer Mining and Nevada Royalty will be transferred out to Newco who will subsequently cause Golden Predator to transfer all of the issued and outstanding shares of Springer Mining and Nevada Royalty to Silver Predator .

such number of SPD common shares having an aggregate value of USS500,00O together with a convertible promissory note in the principal amount of US4,500,00 bearing interest at 4% and payable over a period of three years.  The balance of the purchase price will be satisfied by the grant to Newco of a royalty interest in each of the properties held by Silver Predator at the time of closing. The royalty interests in the Nevada Royalty Corp. properties are not germane to this report. Newco will reserve a 2% net smelter royalty on the Springer Mine.

The Springer Tungsten Mine; located in Nevada; holds significant value to be captured via recently announced plans to restart   operations. Increasing   global   tungsten demand and declining tungsten exports from China a supplier are currently driving the metal's price upward, creating considerable opportunity and economic viability . key

## PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION

The property description and location is as previously reported by SRK (2009). There has been no change in the mineral title; other than maintaining them in good standing, nor has there been any change in the land-holding: On April 12t, 2012 staff from DMT met with Mr. George Putnam (President and CEO), Mr. Ed Dickinson (CFO) and Ms. Nancy McMillan (Environmental Consultant) to review mineral land tenure; permitting status and environmental issues. DMT was provided access to all of the legal documentation and verified that it was in good-standing and Mr. George Putnam reviewed the status of mineral land tenure and DMT can confirm that title remains in good standing. The following paragraphs are extracted from SRK (op cit:) .

## 4.1 Property Area and Location

The Springer Facility, comprising 11,280 acres of lode and placer claims and fee lands, is located approximately 30 mi.  southwest of the city in Pershing County, Nevada; and approximately 130 mi. northeast of Reno; Nevada (Figure 4-1). The north-bound drive from Interstate 80 near Mill City takes approximately 15 minutes. The mine has year around access by an excellent gravel road. The mine site is located at geographic   coordinate's 4094656"N. latitude and 118907'58"W  longitude; (UTM coordinate is 404,438E, 4,515,212N, Zone 11T, WGS84) .

## 4.2 Mineral Tenure

DMT has relied on EMC staff for verification of the status of lands and mineral claims. Legal title documents were reviewed by DMT staff during the site visit.

The Springer Facility is composed of two types of mineral titles. These include; private fee lands for which Silver Predator Corp. owns both the surface and mineral rights and lode mineral claims for which only the mineral rights are owned. Surface ownership of the lode mineral claims is retained by the federal government and administered by the Winnemucca   field office of the Bureau of Land   Management  (BLM). The fee land property boundaries are located by standard land survey monuments composed of cement or rebar corner markers. The lode mineral claims are marked by 2 X 2 inch wooden posts 4 ft. high; hammered into the ground and labeled with an aluminum describing the mineral   claim number corner   description and   bearings to the adjacent corners. each tag

The Springer Facility is comprised of 340 lode mineral claims totaling approximately 7,024 acres, 25 placer claims totaling approximately 500 acres and fee lands totaling approximately 3,756 acres as listed in Table 4-1 and Table 4-2 below.  The total area of the Property is approximately 11,280 acres; including all mineral claims and fee lands (Figure 4-2). The lode mining claims are unpatented and un-surveyed.

## Title; Access and Obligations 4.3

DMT has had sight of both the tax and minerals title fee payment records and has confirmed that the titles are in good standing at the time of the site visit.

Silver Predator has unfettered access to their property over their access road and is subject to the usual statutory and regulatory provisions regarding exploration permits and construction: DMT believes that there are no hindrances to the operation of the Springer Mine Project in this regard.

The fee lands are subject to county property taxes to retain ownership: The lode mineral claims are subject to annual assessment fees of $125 per claim at the Reno office of the Department of the Interior on or before October 31st each Additionally, Silver Predator must file a Notice of Intent to hold with the Pershing County Recorder on or before October 31st of each year . These fees are $8.50 per claim. The filing details of each lode mineral claim can be found in Appendix 1 of Simpson and Sandberg 2008 Report. paid year. filing

## 4.4 Agreements and Encumbrances

On December 5, 2006, EMC announced that Golden Predator Mines Inc. had completed the acquisition of Springer Mining Company from GE. Total consideration consisted of $4.5 million dollars as well as the assumption of certain reclamation obligations in the amount of $981,411. The reclamation obligations are secured by way of escrowed funds; which will be released periodically upon completion of various   stages of reclamation work The fee lands that constitute the eastern one-half of Section 1, T.3ON. R.34E. are subject to a royalty in favor of Nevada Land and Resource Company, LLC. The production royalty is 5% of the net smelter returns (NSR).

The WO claims are subject to a royalty in favor of Geological Services Inc. a Utah corporation; as follows: "A mineral production royalty on the production of tungsten minerals equal to a percentage of the average daily price of a tungsten trioxide short ton unit, ranging from 3 % if the per unit is less than $200.00, 4% if the price per unit is more than $200.00, but less than $320.00, and 5% if the price per unit is $320.00 or more The royalty percentage applicable to all other minerals is 3% of the net smelter returns. Springer Mining Company has the option to purchase one-half of the royalty for the price of $2,000,000. The royalty also obligates Springer Mining Company to pay a minimum royalty payment of $30,000 on the first anniversary, $40,000 on the second anniversary and $50,000 on the third and each subsequent anniversary of the Effective Date of the Deed with Reservation of Royalty . price

Americas Bullion (AMB) intends to complete a pre-closing reorganization resulting in AMB becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Newco. Mining and Nevada Royalty will be transferred out to Newco who will subsequently cause Golden Predator to transfer all of the issued and outstanding shares of Springer Mining and Nevada Royalty to Silver Predator .

Silver Predator will satisfy the purchase price; in part; by the issuance to Newco, at closing, of such number of SPD common shares having an aggregate value of USS500,00O together with a convertible promissory note in the principal amount of US4,500,00 bearing interest at 4%

Page 16

the grant to Newco of a royalty interest in each of the properties held by Silver Predator at the time of closing. The royalty interests in the Nevada Royalty Corp. properties are not germane to this report. Newco will reserve a 2% net smelter royalty on the Springer Mine.

## Environmental Liabilities 4.5

The Springer tungsten property has a long history of and milling with substantial surface and underground impacts. The historic mine and mill will be re-opened and refurbished for near term production: Both of these aspects are subject to environmental liabilities: All of the environmental liabilities pertaining to Silver Predator's operation of the mine or mill have been or will be bonded with the appropriate authority: Predator's title properties and not reactivated by mining operations are not the responsibility of Silver Predator under current statutes and regulations. mining

## 4.6 Permitting

DMT has relied on EMC staff and documents for descriptions of the permitting status and additional permits required to begin operations. Discussions were held with Springer's former environmental and permitting staff.

The mineral resources discussed in this report are all located on private fee land. Exploration drilling required for their delineation is governed under Nevada Administrative Code Chapter 519a. This regulatory code is defined as a plan of operation and reclamation permit for an exploration project: It is a simple; seven-page application describing the project ownership and proposed   exploration activities. The terms of the permit   define specific   requirements for reclamation and drill hole abandonment.

EMC Metals Corp. conducted exploration drilling in 2007 and 2008 under an NAC-519a permit.

The Springer facility holds all permits necessary to operate at its full production capacity.

DMT reviewed a list of all of the environmental permits required for the restart of the mine and mill and discussed the details of permits; costs, action items and schedules with Springer staff during the site visit   in April, 2012. At that time; DMT was of the opinion that permitting presented no significant obstacle to the re-opening of the mine and mill, subject to usual due diligence from Silver Predator. Environmental permits are discussed in more detail in Section 20.

## Other Significant Factors 4.7

After   review of  the information available; DMT is of the opinion that   there are no other significant factors to be disclosed.

## ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE AND PHYSIOGRAPHY

As of DMT's site visit there have been no major changes under this heading since the previous technical  report was published in 2008 (Sandberg, op. cit) and 2009 (SRK, following sections are reproduced from that report; modified for the 2011 reporting format.

## 5.1 Topography, Elevation and Vegetation

The   Springer property lies within the Basin and Range'   physiographic   province of the southwestern United States. The topography comprises moderate to high relief, northerly trending mountain ranges typically 5 to 15 miles wide; and intervening broad, alluvium-filled valleys or basins   from 10 to 20 miles wide. The mountain   ranges are drained by short perennial; intermittent and ephemeral streams that disappear into broad alluvial fans at the foot of the mountain ranges. Many of the intervening basins are closed and not drained by outlet rivers. The  only major   waterway within   Pershing   County is the southwesterly from Humboldt County, through Pershing County, terminating at the Humboldt Sink, on the boundary with Churchill County

Elevations range from 3,500 to 4,500 ft. above sea level in the valley bottoms to 5,000 to 9,800 ft. in the ranges. Relief of 3,500 to 4,000 ft. within a distance of a few miles is common.

grazing Vegetation is typical of the Basin and Range' province; varying locally between none and sparse desert vegetation: The north facing slopes are slightly more vegetated than the south   facing   slopes. Typical   vegetation   found at the site includes Pinion Creosote bush, Sagebrush and a variety of desert grasses and flowers.

## 5.2 Accessibility

The Springer facility is located approximately 30 miles southwest of the city of Winnemucca; in from Interstate 80 near Mill City is approximately 15 minutes north: The mine has year around access by an excellent   gravel road. Numerous roads and bulldozer   trails cross the mine property providing good access within it.

## 5.3 Local Resources

The Property is serviced by Interstate Highway 80 and eight miles of gravel surfaced State Road 400. The Southern Pacific  railway parallels Interstate Highway 80 and the Cosgrave Siding is located 18 miles from the mine site. by

## 5.4 Climate

The climate of the Basin and Range is typically arid with annual rainfall of about 4.0 in. in the valleys and 20 in. or more in the mountains. Winter snowfall may total up to 22 in., mainly in the mountains. Valley bottoms are hot and dry in the summer months, while cooler temperatures prevail at higher elevations. Temperatures range from below freezing during the winter to over

## HISTORY

The following sections are repeated from the previous reports by Sandberg (2008, op. cit) and short ton unit (STU) is equivalent to 20 Ib of WO

## Ownership 6.1

Tungsten was first discovered in the Eugene Mountains in 1914 by prospector Emil Stank (Segerstrom; 1971). Stank returned to the Eugene Mountains in 1917 and staked claims in the area now known as Stank Hill. Numerous other claims were staked in the area, and by 1918, three companies were mining tungsten within the present boundaries of the Springer Property: the Humboldt Corp., the Pacific Tungsten Co. and the Mill City Tungsten Mining Co. The district was renamed the Mill  City District' In 1925, the Nevada-Massachusetts Co. (NMC), under Charles H. Segerstrom; purchased the   holdings of   the Pacific and Mill companies; and in 1928, those of the Humboldt Corp. In 1958, NMC closed the mine and in 1962, decided to allow the mine to flood. The mill and other facilities were dismantled and sold at auction: In 1969, NMC was dissolved and the claims were acquired by Tungsten Properties Ltd. (TPL), a partnership   composed of the survivors of the late Charles H. Segerstrom; Sr. General Electric appears to have become involved in what was then known as the Nevada-Massachusetts property in 1969, and optioned the property from TPL in 1970. GE held ownership of the property until December 2006, when it was purchased by EMC Metal's parent company, Golden Predator Mines. Sr., City they

EMC Metals was formed on March 6, 2009, when the parent company, Golden Predator Mines, Inc., spun off its precious metal assets as Golden Predator Royalty and Development Corp. and was then renamed, EMC Metals Corp. Silver Predator Corp. currently holds 100% of the Springer Mine Project. Corp.

## 6.2 Past Exploration and Development

The record of modern exploration begins in 1970, when Hazen Research Inc. (Hazen) of Golden; Colorado was retained by GE to examine the property and evaluate the potential as an exploration project. A preliminary report prepared by Hazen in 1971 reported encouraging results, and recommended expanding the exploration program (Perry and Hammond, 1971). In 1972, GE signed an option lease with TPL, which included certain work commitments. In 1973, Hazen issued a second report; which correlated geological records of the different historical operations within the property to assist in locating new exploration targets. summarized the potential of each mineralized zone based on production records and geological potential then made exploration recommendations. Hazen concluded that the Sutton and Sutton areas had the most potential for tungsten mining. In particular , Hazen recommended the down dip extensions of the Sutton and Sutton Il beds that were in production when the mine shut down in 1958 as the most promising areas for resource development. Hazen recommended a program of dewatering; underground rehabilitation; surface and underground diamond drilling, drifting and underground sampling (Tingley and Hamling; 1973) . They

GE's exploration program began in 1973 with surface diamond drilling and rehabilitation of the Sutton Il underground workings. By June 1975, the Sutton Il shaft (actually a winze internal to

Preliminary Economic Assessment of the Springer Tungsten Mine, Project No. 2012CMAA.034 Pershing County, Nevada, USA Prepared for Silver Predator Corp., Reno, Nevada

<!-- image -->

Page 20

the Sutton Il adit) was dewatered and rehabilitated.  Exploratory drifts were developed to the north and south of the existing   workings. Underground   drilling,   chip sampling and bulk sampling continued throughout 1978. Surface diamond drilling continued to extend mineralization beyond the limits of the underground development:. In 1977, Utah International Inc. (UII) signed an exploration agreement with GE and became the operator of the project. Around this time; the property was renamed Springer, after the Springer Stock in the central portion of the Property.

The following discussion of exploration and development of the Springer Mine by Ull and GE is from Park (1978):

"After the mine rehabilitation was complete; drifting began in early June of 1977. Horizontal face chip samples were taken after every drift round on the bed. Grab samples were taken off the muck in the development headings to assist in determining grade dilution and moisture content: Nine, approximately 30 t; fullround bulk samples were taken at 45-50 m intervals along the drift for a more accurate grade determination and to supply metallurgical testing material to the Sunnyvale lab facility . Two additional hanging wall bed bulk samples were taken from the 500 level north and south of the shaft. To date; more than 2,000 highly reproducible samples have been generated from the program:  The underground diamond drilling program generated 4,800 m of core (approximately three miles) from 6 hanging wall cross-cut drill stations. the stations; a series of 3, 3-hole fans were designed from each station: The drilling explored the ore body at intervals 45 m above and below the exploratory drift and at 90 m below. To establish greater depth potential;, Station No.5 was placed 122 m into the hanging wall.  Additional surface drilling augmented the underground by covering areas   along the Sutton zone not reached by the exploratory drift. Two holes were drilled in the Uncle Sam area (North Sutton No. Il) and four in the Sutton II.  Five relatively deep holes were completed in the Sutton mine area which resulted in the largest single reserve tonnage for the entire zone Since the project began 6,064 m (nearly four miles) of core have been logged.  The initial task in the sampling program was to set-up standard sampling and preparation techniques to assure consistent results. Tungsten ore standards were carefully prepared and sent out in a round robin to several wellknown analytical   labs to determine standard   grades to be used in X-ray fluorescence (XRF)  analysis. A sample preparation facility was  designed and built to accommodate several practical size reduction steps recommended for ores with   high   "nugget-effects Both G.E (Cleveland) and UII   (Sunnyvale) analytical labs were used to insure consistent results.  Underground sampling of the levels during the mine dewatering phase called for confirming the ore grade in the drifts and the amount of broken ore remaining in the stopes:  This was done by collecting chip samples from the back and pillars of the old drifts and stope ore from chute lips.

## 6.3 Historic Mineral Resource and Reserve Estimates

the   period of GE and UII exploration activity, several   "reserve estimates" were completed by various parties.  The estimates were used historically as a guide for exploration

for further   project   development. The  significant historical reserve estimations are summarized in Table 6-1.

These estimates are historic in nature and do not meet current reporting standards; are provided solely for project historical recounting and should not be used as an indication of current or future potential. they

A significant amount of the information included in this technical report was originally reported in NI 43-101 compliant technical reports prepared for EMC by Simpson (2008) and by SRK (2009):

"Technical Report on the Springer   Mine Property Pershing County;  Nevada; USA prepared by Discovery Consultants; Vernon; BC for Golden Predator Mines Inc., Vancouver; BC. Effective Date January 28,2008.

"NI 43-101 Technical Report on Resources; EMC Metals   Corp., Springer Facility - Sutton Beds, Nevada; USA prepared by SRK Consulting of Lakewood; CO. for EMC Metals Corp., Effective Date 15,2009. May

DMT Geosciences completed a full technical audit of both these reports and remodelled the resources using different cut-off grades, dilution and recoveries.

No additional exploration has been conducted on the property since the 15 effective date of the SRK report, although additional work has been completed on the processing method and the land position has been maintained in good standing: Some additional work has been completed towards permitting requirements. May

Where the status at the property is unchanged since the 2009 report; DMT has drawn freely from these reports; which are available from EMC and from the SEDAR website at Www.sedar.com. We have summarised them where appropriate and quoted directly on other occasions. Quoted text is indented but not be otherwise referenced. may

In 2009, SRK (op. cit:) produced an NI 43-101 compliant resource estimate for the Sutton and Sutton Il areas of the property (Table 6-2). The estimate was based on a 0.30 WO3% cutoff

<!-- image -->

grade; chosen for   resource reporting based on an approximated mining cost of s4O/ton; processing cost of $17/ton, administration cost of $13/ton, mill recovery of 82% and a WO3 price of $11.50/lb. The results reported in the resource statement were rounded to reflect the approximation of   grade and quantity which can be achieved at this level of resource estimation:.

Table 6-2: Sutton and Il Mineral Resource Statement

A reserve estimate was not made because a prefeasibility study had not been completed on the property .

## Historic Production 6.4

In 1918, resulting   from the original claim   staking and subsequent   tungsten rush;   three ceased in 1919 when the price of tungsten dropped following the end of World War (Stager and Tingley; 1988). Limited activity re-commenced in 1924 and by 1928, all of the mines had been consolidated by NMC. Under the consolidated ownership; operations were continuous until 1958, except for 4 months in 1932. During the Korean War, the US government started a policy of stockpiling tungsten; but when this program was terminated in 1956, a collapse in tungsten prices occurred (Stager and Tingley, op. cit): As a result, NMC closed the mine in 1958, and placed the  operation on a care and maintenance basis until 1962 when abandoned the operation and let it flood. they

Records indicate that total production from 1925 through 1958 was 3,100,000 tons of material from which 1,786,138 short ton units (STU) of WO were recovered.  The average grade of mill feed prior to 1944 was 1.17% WOsAfter 1944, the production tonnage increased and the average mill feed grade dropped to about 0.42% WO (Perry and Hammond 1971) According to Stager and Tingley (op. cit:), this change was related to a shift in production from the Stank a number of open Underground operations include the Sutton I, Sutton II, Humboldt-Springer and the Stank. Open pit operations include the George Pit, Sutton North Pit, Sutton South Pit, Sutton Il Pit, Humboldt North Pit; Humboldt South Pit; Springer Pit and the Uncle Sam Pit (Perry and Hammond, 1971). pits.

GE optioned the property from TPL in 1970. In 1971, a pilot mill was constructed to test retreatment of some 3,000,000 tons of accumulated tailings (Segerstrom; 1971). From 1973 to 1982, GE rehabilitated and expanded the underground workings; constructed a new mill and a STU in 1977. The mine went into production in March 1982 and closed in October 1982 as prices plummeted.  Tungsten prices bottomed out at $28 per STU in 1986 but production was

## GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND MINERALISATION

## Regional Geology and Geologic Setting 7.1

The Springer Mine &amp; Mill Facility is located on the eastern flank of the Eugene Mountains in the Basin and Range tectonic province (Figure 7-1). A thick sequence of Late Triassic marine sedimentary rocks was deposited in a subsiding slope to lower slope back-arc basin. The Triassic Raspberry Formation consist of up to 7,000 ft. of grey-green, lavender and black pelitic strata intercalated with thin (3-50 ft.) lenses micritic limestone: The limestone beds serve as marker horizons within the sedimentary sequence.

The sediments were intruded during  the Cretaceous Period by differentiated   granodiorite stocks which have been cut by associated andesitic and porphyritic andesite sills and dikes: Two metamorphic events have been identified. The first is a low-grade regional event that resulted in pervasive re-crystallization and the development of a strong foliation due to CO incident compressional tectonics. The pelitic rocks were transformed to slates and phyllites; however the limestones appear to have been largely unaffected. The second event is localized, contact thermal metamorphism and metasomatism associated with the emplacement of the granodiorite stocks resulting in the formation of hornfels, calc-silicates and marbles. Contact metasomatism proximal to the limestone beds have replaced them with skarn and contain primary economic mineral of interest.

The meta-sedimentary rocks are preserved in a complex package of south-east directed thrust plates. The deformational history of the Eugene Mountains is complex. During the Tertiary Period the structural changed from a compressional one to an extensional one resulting in a horst like structure typical of the Basin and Range Province. regime

## 7.2 Local Geology

At the Springer Mine, skarn formation and the tungsten mineralization is associated with the emplacement of the Springer Stock and nearby Olsen Stock (Figure 7-1: Regional Geology; Springer Project

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Figure 7-2). Superimposed on the north-northeast   trending structural fabric are folds associated with the emplacement of the granodiorite. The Springer Stock has intruded the meta-sediments in a fairly passive manner with the skarn beds clearly truncated. Northeast of the Springer Stock skarn beds outline a broad fold that conforms to the shape of the Olsen Stock suggesting a more forceful intrusion: Some faulting is associated with de-volatilization of the stocks.

4 major normal fault (Stank Fault) has been identified at the Springer Mine with up to 1,000 ft. of throw (vertical displacement) . The fault cuts the skarn beds as well as the granodiorite but with only a few feet of displacement. This suggests that the majority of the displacement occurred prior to the intrusive event. The Stank Fault is part of a series of anastomosing

faults may be the result of the intrusion of a large, regional granodiorite batholith.

A number of post-intrusive faults with throws ranging from 100-500 ft. with a north-south strike have resulted in minor displacements of the Springer ore bodies.

## 7.3 Mineralization

Mineral deposits within the Eugene Mountains consist of tungsten-bearing skarns; base-metal veins and replacement deposits and small, epithermal gold-silver deposits.  The mineralization

of economic interest at the Springer Mine is the tungsten-bearing (+ Mo) skarns; although some low-grade sphalerite (ZnS) occurrences have been noted.

Up to twelve limestone with   varying   degrees of skarn   development have been identified. The most important beds or groups of beds are listed in stratigraphic order from oldest to youngest are:

-  West Beds,
-  Seel Bed,
-  Ribbon Beds,
-  Stank Bed,
-  Sutton Beds,
-  West Mill Beds;
-  East Mill Beds
- 

The early stage of skarn formation is characterized by very high temperature anhydrous Mg-Al metasomatism  resulting in fine grained marble being replaced by coarse grossular garnetquartz-calcite for a strike distance of approximately 2,000 ft. from the intrusion. As temperatures  increased anhydrous Fe metasomatism occurred. It is during this stage that tungsten (scheelite)  pyrite;  chalcopyrite; and molybdenite were emplaced proximal to the stock. Sphalerite was   deposited in the more distal margins of  the limestone beds. The deposition of sulphides continued for some time.

## 7.4 Alteration

Exposed granodiorite exhibits argillic and quartz-sericite alteration. Skarn beds are typically cut by small adularia rich quartz veins. Around the contact between the granodiorite and the pelitic meta-sediments two different   metamorphic facies have been identified. An albite-epidotehornfels facies has developed in the outer margins of the contact aureole Lower temperatures have   resulted in incomplete re-crystallization  and the   regional foliation in the slates and phyllites has been preserved. This facies passes inward to a more intensely altered zone of hornblende-hornfels where recrystallization is complete and the foliation obliterated. These facies are generally fine grained and can only be identified by thin-section work.

Where the limestone beds have been replaced by skarn the mineral assemblages are quite coarse. A quartz-grossular granite-diopside-calcite assemblage has developed in the hornblende-hornfels facies and a quartz-epidote-actinoliteltremolite-calcite assemblage in the albite-epidote-hornfels facies. Transitional   assemblages have been observed. Along the intrusive contact, in addition to hornfels, a spotted schist can be observed which has developed a foliation resulting from forceful emplacement of the granodiorite.

Page 30

A final stage of low temperature hydrous retrograde alteration has resulted in garnet being altered to calcite; quartz-chalcedony, epidote and pyrite with diopside being altered to calcite; quartz, tremolite-actinolite; chlorite and talc. This alteration is associated with the formation of scheelite-quartz-sulfide veinlets.

## DEPOSIT TYPES

At the Springer Mine scheelite (tungsten) bearing calc-silicate assemblages have been formed by contact intrusion Stock and concurrent thermal event, hydrothermal fluids were released from the differentiating granodiorite magma that resulted in the formation of new mineral assemblages at the contact of the intrusion with the meta-sedimentary strata.

Skarn formed by the replacement of the micritic limestone beds. Tungsten-bearing skarns form at depths of 5-15km and at temperatures in excess of 500 C. Skarn occurrences typically display quite a degree of variability resulting from the composition and structure (effective permeability) of the original sedimentary bed. In some cases, locally, observable skarn grades into altered   limestone. Mineralised material   typically extends out about 2,000 ft. from the granodiorite.

## EXPLORATION

All of the exploration conducted on the property was completed before and reported in the on this information; as provided below in its entirety, for the purposes of this updated technical report.

There were three main phases of exploration work conducted on the Springer Facility by three different ownerloperators. These exploration periods include:

-  Exploration drilling and underground sampling by Nevada Massachusetts Corporation (NMC) between 1925 and 1958;
-  Exploration   drilling and underground channel   sampling completed by General Electric (GE) and Utah International Inc. (UIl) between 1973 and 1982; and
-  Diamond   drilling and reverse EMC

The NMC exploration work focused mainly within the mineralized beds located at the Stank and Springer-Humboldt Mines. No specific NMC sample or assay data of from any of the drifting, mining or drilling is available for any of these areas.

The exploration drilling and sampling completed by GE and Ull focused primarily on the Sutton and Sutton II areas. The vast majority of the modern exploration data was collected during this phase of work. GE and Ull compiled most of the older NMC data, rehabilitated the historic underground   workings; drilled 119 diamond core holes   from surface and underground, extended the underground workings and analyzed approximately 3,200 samples.

EMC Metals Corp. completed the most recent exploration work in 2007 and 2008. During this time; seven diamond core and 251 reverse circulation (RC) drill holes were completed in three main areas. EMC Metals Corp. drilled 81 holes in the George beds; 79 holes in the Mill Beds and 51 holes in the Sutton Beds. All of this drilling focused on near surface mineralization in order to evaluate the open pit potential:. A few diamond core holes were located in the Sutton II areas for confirmation and expansion of the historical resources.

The 1976 to 1978 exploration drilling and sampling programs were responsible for advancing the property from a historic   mining camp to a producing mine. These programs focused primarily on the Sutton and Sutton skarn units. Extensive documentation of this work illustrates that it was conducted in a careful and professional manner . All of the drill collars were located by a professional surveyor and the majority of them were surveyed for down hole deviation: The core was logged, split and sampled properly as described below. All samples were analyzed appropriate assay procedures of the time. The drill logging and assay results were correctly compiled onto cross-sections and level plans. The exploration work described above resulted in the delineation of   anomalous tungsten mineralization   located within several west dipping beds; which average approximately 3ft in true thickness along 5,6OOft   of strike length extent. In some locations; the tungsten mineralization thickens to a maximum true thickness of 1Oft.  The drilling and assay results of the exploration work described above were subsequently incorporated into historical resource using

estimates as discussed in Section 4.3. also have provided much of the technical data supporting the resource estimation discussed in Section 15. They

The exploration work conducted by EMC Metals Corp. has delineated small areas of mineralization within the George beds; it has  confirmed near   surface mineralization at the Sutton Beds, but has failed to find significant near surface mineralization within the Mill Beds. This   exploration work was conducted   according to current   industry best practices. As described below, the holes were drilling and sampled by reputable contractors; the samples were   analyzed using appropriate techniques and were accompanied by a proper   QAQA program. two

## DRILLING AND SAMPLING

All of the exploration conducted on the property was completed before and reported in the SRK (2009) Technical Report. DMT has relied on this information; as provided below in its entirety, for the purposes of this updated technical report.

## 10.1 and Extent of Drilling Type

Three major   drilling campaigns were completed at the   Springer   facility. The Nevada Massachusetts   Company completed   approximately 115 diamond drill   holes; mainly   from underground, between 1939 and 1946. GE and Ull drilled 119 diamond drill holes from surface and underground between 1976 and 1978. EMC Metals completed 7 diamond core drill holes and 251 RC drill holes from surface during 2007 and 2008. Gorp.

## 10.2 Drilling Procedures

## 10.2.1 NMC Drilling

The NMC drill holes were located mainly in the Humboldt; Stank and Springer Mines all located within the western horizon of mineralized beds. The drill hole were all   diamond core of unknown diameter . Drill logs consists of typed pages describing the drill hole ID; a generalized The descriptive log consists of from-to intervals with notes on lithic types, mineralization; and alteration: Some of the logs have notes describing assay results but most do not. All of the logs note core recovery. The general locations are referenced to the mine name,   heading, level and drill station. No   specific coordinates of assay data is available for any of the drill holes. None of these holes are located in the area of the current resource estimation described in this report.

## 10.2.2 GE and UII Diamond Drilling

The NM and SU Series of diamond drilling were both completed by GE and same phase of exploration from 1973 to 1978. The drill series notation was used only to differentiate the NM Series; which were drilled from surface; from the SU series drilled from underground. The NM series drill holes are designated NM-1 through NM-49. The current data set contains information from all 49 drill holes totaling 38,201ft. Drill hole NM-49 was drilled as a geotechnical hole at the location of the Sutton Ill shaft adjacent to the Sutton Il mineralization SU-1 through SU-70. The current data set contains information from 66 drill holes   totaling 16,408 ft. There is no collar or assay information from drill hole SU-69. Drill holes SU-60, SU-64 and SU-68 do have collar and survey information; but do not have any assays. These were all drilled at an unnamed prospect located approximately 2.0 miles southwest of the Springer Stock. Based on the information contained in the current database there does not appear to be any material gaps in the NM and SU series drill holes.

Drill logs are available for all of the drill holes described above. These consist of hand written drill forms containing the following: drill hole ID, property name; county, state; coordinate locations in local mine grid, bearing; dip; date started and completed; sheet # and logged by. have designated columns including: from- depth; to- depth, recovery, alteration; structure mineralization; assay results and remarks. In general; the drill logs are completed in detail with log They

general rock types and characteristics of the mineralization. Some of the coordinates are not filled in on the individual logs; instead are provided on a separate sheet. they

The NM series holes were drilled by Boyles Brothers Drilling Company and were predominantly NQ size producing 1-7/8 in. diameter core. The SU Series were drilled by Longyear Drilling Company and were predominantly AX size producing 1-3/16 in. diameter core. Drilling reports indicate that a wire line core drill was used. The core recovery was excellent typically ranging between 95 to 100% .

The drill hole coordinates were surveyed by the mine surveyor in local mine EMC Metals Corp. subsequently transposed the mine collar locations into State Plane Nevada West, NAD83 Cones Cors96 coordinates. The drill holes were surveyed down hole using a SingleShot Kodak Directional Drilling Star Recordings. Down hole surveys are available for 62 of the 119 drill holes including most of the longer holes. grid. grid

The core from all of the NM and SU series drilling remains on site at the Springer Facility arranged by drill hole and box number. Most of these drill holes are located in the Sutton and Sutton II areas. Their data was used to support the current resource estimation described in Section 16 below. The drill holes were oriented at a wide range of bearings and dips in order to intercept the mineralization at regular intervals from a limited number of drill stations. Because many of the drill holes were arranged in a fan pattern from a single drill station or were drilled at oblique angels to the mineralized beds; the sample length of most drill holes do not represent   the true thickness of the mineralization. The geometry of  the mineralization   is however, well defined by the various drill hole intercepts and the underground sampling. they

## 10.2.3 EMC Metals Corp. Drilling

During 2007 and 2008, EMC Metals Corp. completed 7 core and 251 RC holes on the Springer facility. The drilling program was designed to serve several purposes. The seven core holes were targeted on resource confirmation and expansion in the Sutton and Sutton Il areas. The RC holes were pre-collars for some core holes and general exploration drilling at several targets on the property.

The core drilling was all conducted from surface by Major Drilling Company. The core was HQ size producing 2-12 in. diameter core. A single drill rig was and was conducted during both and night shifts. The holes were all drilled from the hanging wall side of the All of the holes were surveyed for down hole deviation; generally at 150 ft. intervals. Seven drill holes were completed for 3,592 ft. The core was processed and logged on site. Paper drill logs were used to capture geotechnical and geological data including: from-to intervals; core recovery; rock type; alteration; mineralization and structures. In general, core recovery was excellent. used drilling day

The RC drilling was all conducted by Eklund Drilling Company. A standard buggy-mounted drill was to create 5-1/5 in   diameter holes. The   drilling was conducted at   six different prospects including; Sutton and II, George Beds, Mill Beds, Moly Pit, Orphan Pit and Uncle Sam.  The majority of the drilling was conducted in the first three areas listed above. The holes were arranged in a wide variety of orientations, typically with at least two holes drilled in a fan pattern from the same location:.  The drilling crew at the drill rig sampled the drill holes on 2.0 ft used

by to determine the rock types, mineralization and to define the horizons which were to be sent out for analysis.

For all of the EMC Metals Corp. drill   holes, the collars were marked in the field with a permanent monument.  The northing and easting of the collars were surveyed with a Trimble GeoXH GPS unit and post process to +1.5 ft horizontal control:. Once the northing and easting was established, the collars were located on the topographic surface model for determination of elevation.  This provided elevation control to within +1.0 ft.

## 10.3 Drilling Results

A total of 377 drill holes   totaling 144,171 ft were completed in the two modern drilling campaigns. GE and 119 diamond core drill holes totaling to 58,046 ft. EMC Metals   Corp.   completed 7-diamond core and 251 RC holes   totaling to 86,125 ft. The interpretation of all drilling results indicates that anomalous tungsten mineralization is located within several planar, west-dipping beds; which average 3 ft. in true thickness along 5,600 ft. of strike length and 1,500 ft. of down dip extent. In some locations; the tungsten mineralization thickens to a maximum true thickness of 10 ft. The drill holes are arranged in a variety of orientations and most of the drill sample lengths do not   represent true thickness of mineralization.

SRK is of the opinion that the drilling operations were conducted by professionals, the core or cuttings were handled;   logged and   sampled in an acceptable manner   by   professional geologists; and the results are   suitable for   support of a NI 43-101   compliant resource estimation.

## 10.4 Sampling Methods

There are three sample types of material importance to the current resource estimate of this report.  These include; core drilling samples; underground channel samples and RC samples. drilling

## Core Drilling samples 10.4.1

All drill core in the 2007 to 2008 drilling program; and in SRK's opinion likely for the 1973 to 1978 program, was first inspected under short-wave, ultra-violet   light for scheelite mineralization: Observations on the nature of the scheelite mineralization occurrence and visual estimates of the percentage of WO content were noted in drill logs. Mineralized core was marked with a marking pen for sampling in variable lengths:. The original assay lengths range from 0.3 ft to 11.0 ft with an average of 3.6 ft. typically; samples were collected only from the skarn-altered beds and not from the surrounding hornfels: The GE and UII core was first with a mechanical splitter, whereas the EMC Metals core was sawn into halves. One-half of the core was then gathered into a pre-labeled sample The sample bags were sent directly to the analytical laboratory for assay. The remaining half core and all un-sampled core was placed in core rack storage for future reference. prior split bag.

The chain of custody of the GE and UII core drilling is unknown. However, SRK is of the opinion that the Boyles Brothers and Longyear drilling staff and GE/UII geological staff ensured that all drill samples met GE/UII's and industry standards for production; delivery , and security.

kept in a secured location until were transported to the ALS Chemex sample preparation facility in Winnemucca; Nevada. The core samples were transported by EMC Metals Corp , whereas the RC samples were gathered onsite into bins supplied by ALS Chemex; and then transported by ALS Chemex to its Winnemucca; Nevada preparation facility . they

## 10.4.2

The underground channel   samples consist back   samples   from  preexisting workings and face samples from active development.  During GE's and Ull's rehabilitation of the collected back samples from five levels of   historic mining.  These were taken from relatively widespread locations and were designed for general confirmation of grade. All of the samples are described by location and width. they

As GE and Ull expanded the underground workings in particularly on the 4,100 ft. elevation; an extensive sampling program was conducted.  The sampling procedures are described by Koch and Link (1977) as follows:

- "1) Country rock without mineralization; i.e. hornfels of dike rock, will not be sampled.

centered one meter above the sill. Chips of as uniform a size as possible will be taken with the air hammer, collected on the canvas; labeled and sacked.

- 3) Individual samples will weigh at least 4.0 kg.

The current database contains information for 684 channel samples: Approximately 600 of these channel samples are from the lower two levels of the mine where the majority of the current resource estimate described in Section 16 is located.  The minimum sample length is 0.33 ft., the maximum is 10.8 ft. and the average is 3.1 ft. The chain of custody of the GE and Ull channel sampling is unknown however, SRK is of the opinion that the GE geological staff ensured that all channel samples met client and industry standards for production; delivery and security.

- 4) Widths will be measured horizontally.

## RC Drill sampling 10.4.3

The EMC Metal Corp RC drilling was sampled by the drilling contractor at the drill rig. The drill cuttings were first passed through a wet splitter to reduce the sample size. After every 2.0 ft. of drilling advance; the hole was blown clean and a sample was taken. The sample was collected into a labeled with a blind sample number. A sample book tag was also placed into the sample bag and it was tied closed immediate The interval distances were recorded in the sample books. After the drill hole was completed; EMC Metals Corp. staff would   perform a quick   logging and lamping of the sample   cutting and select   only the mineralized intervals to be sent out for analysis.  The sample bags were stored at the drill until were selected for analysis. The selected intervals were gathered by EMC Metals Corp. staff and transported by pick-up truck to transport bins supplied by ALS Chemex. All the drill and the storage bins were located behind the project security gate; which is manned at all times. Of the 251 holes drilled by EMC Metals sample assays for only 140 holes were available at the time of this report. bag pad they pads Corp.,

## Factors Affecting Accuracy 10.5

The sampling programs were conducted by professional geologists and drillers who performed to the standards of the mining industry. The core recovery as recorded on the drill logs; shows that nearly all of the mineralized intervals produce 90 to 100% core recovery assuring a sample was collected. The underground channel   sampling procedure as described above meets current industry standards for the method employed. With core recovery and thorough channel sampling methods; factors affecting accuracy of results are positive. good good

## 10.6 Sample Quality

The core handling, logging and sampling procedures described above combined with good sampling described above combined with the large sample size ensure that the sample quality of the channels is also very good. The drill and channel sample lengths are appropriate for the mineralization widths in order to accurately characterize the mineralization and to distinguish any zones internal to the mineralization; which may have anomalously high or low grades. The mineralized beds  vary between 1.0 ft to 10 ft wide and average about 3.0 ft. The average lengths of the drilling, and channel samples is equal to the average width of the mineralization:

## 10.7 Relevant Samples

The relevant samples are the drill and channel samples of the skarn altered micritic limestone beds within the pelitic sediments of the Raspberry Formation.

## SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSIS AND SECURITY

All of the sample preparation; analysis and security information was reviewed and reported on in the is considered to be  reliable. DMT reviewed all of the available geological information during the site visit.

## 11.1 Sample Preparation and Assaying Methods

None of the samples used to support the mineral resource estimate of this report were prepared by any employees or subcontract personnel of EMC Metals Corp. or its parent company Golden Predator Mines Inc Drilling and sampling techniques are consistent with industry best practice and a detailed review of the database showed data consistency and correlation: good

The drilling and channel samples taken by GE and UII were prepared primarily on site in a facility designed and tested by GE under the direction of consultant Dr. George Koch of the University of Georgia. Sample preparation is described in a memorandum by Leonard (1977) as follows:

- chip samples  Dry
- Jaw Crush to %4 inch. 
- Gyratory crush to -28 meshes. 
- Split down to about 2 Ibs in Jones riffle 
- Disc pulverize. 
- Split down to about 130 g; 
- Shatterbox pulverize for 3 minutes. 
- Split down to about 60 g. 
- Shatterbox pulverize for 3 minutes. 
- Halve and final assay pulps. bag 

The samples were analyzed at three different labs including GE's Cleveland Ohio Laboratory; Ull's Sunnyvale Minerals Lab, and the Rocky Mountain Geochemical Corp. Laboratory (RMGC) in West Jordon, Utah.

RMGC determined WO colormetrically . This  procedure involves fusing of the material in a sodium peroxide solution followed by development of the tungsten thiocyanate complex using potassium thiocyanate: WO content is then determined on a spectrophotometer .

<!-- image -->

GE and UII both experimented with colormetrical determination; but settled on XRF determination of WOs: The GE XRF procedures and apparatus are described by Smith (1978) as follows:

-  Hydraulic pellet press with 1-1/4 in. diameter die.
-  Aluminum sample cups; Spex Industries; Number 3619 or equivalent.
-  X-ray Spectrometer, GE XRD 730, operated as follows:
-  Platinum X-ray target.
-  X-ray powder supply set at 5OKVCP and 3Omu.
-  0.005 in. Soller slit.
- 
- Xenon proportional counter is operated at 2570 V. 
- The pulse height selector is operated in the differential mode with a base line 0.25 V and a window of 2.00 V. 
- The amplifier is set at 4x.  gain
- The instrument is run using a vacuum atmosphere. 
- The samples are rotated during analyses. 

The EMC Metals samples were all prepared at the ALS Chemex sample preparation facility in Winnemucca; Nevada. The sample preparation routine involved drying; crushing to 90% passing a ~2 mm screen and pulverizing a kg  split  until 85% Independent   consultant; William Gilmore   (2008) of   Discovery Consultants   designed these procedures specifically for the Springer Tungsten samples. There are slight modifications of the ALS Chemex standard procedures. Corp.

The sample pulps prepared in Winnemucca; Nevada were shipped to the ALS Chemex Lab in North Vancouver, B.C. Canada for analysis. The samples were analyzed for WO using a by GE and Ull during the earlier sampling programs.

## 11.2 ISO 9000 Certification

Most of the analytical work by previous workers GE and UII, was done by the XRF technique in the respective company-owned laboratories. The assays of EMC Metals were sent to ALS Chemex for XRF determined tungsten analyses. ALS Chemex; at its North American laboratories, holds ISO 9002.1994 and ISO 9001.2000 certifications.

## Quality Controls and Quality Assurance 11.3

on the diamond drill and channel samples. recognized very early in their exploration program that the nature of the tungsten mineralization made absolute assay reproduction very difficult and adopted a standard policy of duplicate check assays at three laboratories. The QAQC program is summarized by Parks (1978) as follows: They

"The initial task in the   sampling program was to set up standard sampling and preparation techniques to assure consistent results. Tungsten ore standards were carefully prepared and sent out in a roundrobin to several well-known analytical labs to determine standard grades to be used in x-ray fluorescence analysis. A sample preparation facility was designed and built to accommodate several practical size reduction steps   recommended for ores with high "nugget effects. Both GE (Cleveland) and UII   (Sunnyvale) analytical labs were used to insure consistent results.

The drill hole database contains 731 samples. Of these; 424 samples were analyzed by both GE and UII. The RMGC lab was used as the private; referee check for both GE and UII. There are 88 samples analyzed by both GE and RMGC and 56 samples analyzed by both Ull and RMGC. The results of the duplicate check analyses are presented in Figure 11-1 to Figure 11-3. The results show that there was no systematic bias at any of the laboratories and that the analytical results were reproducible within typical standard for the style of mineralization:

EMC Metals Corp. conducted an industry standard QAQC program throughout its sampling and analysis program.  The program included a blank sample; a standard reference sample and th a field duplicate inserted every 20' sample The results of the standard reference material analyses are presented in Figure 11-4. These show that ALS Chemex consistently reported elemental tungsten above the expected value. On average, the ALS Chemex values are 7.4% higher than the expected value. Since the EMC Metals analyses support only a very small portion of   the current resource estimate described in Section 15, this deviation is not considered material.

## Interpretation 11.4

SRK is of the opinion that the analytical work performed by GE, UII, RMGC and ALS Chemex Labs on Springer Facility tungsten mineralization was good, and suitable for use in resource estimation. The colorimetric method, as well as XRF , were methodologies commonly used for tungsten analysis in that era. Tungsten determinations today typically utilize XRF spectroscopy or Neutron of tungsten values. There are no references  in any of the documents  supplied to SRK pertaining to   security not a standard component of   project   reporting to document these routines of project to prohibit any outsiders to handle or inspect fresh drill core or channel samples at any stage of exploration operations. The drill core was typically picked up at the drill site by the geologist or designated assistant; or delivered by the driller at the end of shift. At the core logging facility, only the geologist and assistants are permitted to handle and prepare the core. Commercial carriers in bulk form of boxes, larger sacks, pallets; or buckets usually handle transportation of the split bagged core and channel samples to a laboratory facility . SRK assumes that the drill core and channel samples for the 1974 to 1978 program were handled in the customary industry manner by drill contractors, geologists; and transportation carriers; and was not compromised by outsiders.

The drilling samples collected by EMC Metals Corp. were maintained in a secured manner until were transported to the ALS Chemex sample preparation facility in Winnemucca, Nevada. GE and UII conducted routine QAQC analysis during their sampling programs. This QAQC included duplicate assay checks at three different laboratories. The results of this work showed that there was no systematic bias from any of the labs. EMC Metals has conducted a modern QAQC analysis on their drilling at the Springer Facility. This consisted of insertion of they Corp.

The laboratory employed industry standard sample preparation and the techniques of analyses were appropriate for the level of tungsten mineralization. The results of the QAQC study verified that no systematic   assay bias was   present in the vast   majority of the samples supporting the resource estimate in Section 15 of this report.

## DATA VERIFICATION

data verification work was completed before and reported in the SRK (2009) Technical Report.

The database prepared by EMC Metals and verified by SRK relies on the   industry professionalism of information supplied by GE, UII, RMGC, EMC Metals and ALS Canada. No discrepancies  were noted to source Metals has obviously taken significant internal QAQC while compiling it.

SRK noted that assembled the data with utmost regards to accurate transfer and data but did not take responsibility for the quality of the source data. they they entry ,

DMT has conducted limited auditing of the original data but the various databases show remarkable consistency with reported production grades.

The mineralization and data of the Springer Facility has been verified in two ways. The Simpson and Sandberg 2008 Report describes verification of the mineralization by re-sampling of core drilled by GE and UII. The data verification conducted by SRK focused   entirely on the electronic database used to support the resource estimate in Section 15 of this report below .

## 12.1 Quality Control Measures and Procedures

Simpson and Sandberg   (2008) collected 84 samples   comprised of   V-core spits off the by ALS Chemex and the results were plotted on an x-y scatter plot against the original assay results. The plot showed "a moderate positive correlation; with considerable scatter. The scatter was attributed to the fact that the V-core re-samples represented a smaller volume of It was  also reported that  "Overall, the historic assays averaged 17% lower than the ALS results" .

SRK's data verification focused on comparing the electronic database's drill collar locations; orientations   and assay results to the   original The electronic database was compiled by EMC Metals as follows: The original drill logs and a listing of collar coordinates GE, mine coordinates. A licensed surveyor from Aero-Graphics provided a translation solution to convert the mine to State Plane Nevada West; NAD83 Conus Cors96 coordinates. The mine coordinates and translation solution were then input to the Blue MarbleTM geo-calculator software and the State Plane Nevada coordinates were generated. The drill hole orientations were input from individual drill  logs and the down hole survey readings. The assay database was compiled from each individual drill log file. The assays were input directly from the hand recorded sample log sheets generated by GE and UII. About 50% of the drill collar locations in local were verified to the scanned copies of the original drill logs or collar coordinates  lists. The same amount of down hole surveys in the electronic database were also verified to the scanned copies of the drill logs. No errors were found in either data set. SRK was able to locate original signed assay certificates from RMGC and assay lab reports from GE and UII for approximately 86% of the core drilling and channel sampling results.  These were spot checked against the electronic drill hole database and no errors were found. grid grid grid grid

## MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING

DMT has relied on EMC documents for descriptions of the proposed beneficiation process and their laboratory tests leading to recovery efficiencies. DMT Geosciences staff reviewed the proposed beneficiation process at the Springer Mine plant site and had several discussions with the Company's metallurgist.

## Historic Processing Methods 13.1

Several   gravity   separation mill facilities were established on the   Springer property and employed by the miners in the area, as early as 1918, and extending through 1958. All of these early mills preceded modern milling methods employed today, and the remnants of these historic wooden structures were destroyed in a significant brush fire in 2007, which did no damage to the modern mill constructed from 1979-1981, and remains on site today. prior

The on-site tungsten processing facility commissioned by GE and Ull in 1981 was considered state-of-the-art at particularly of ammonium   paratungstate 0], known as APT. The existing Springer mill process (the GE' process) was capable of making two distinct tungsten products:

-  Synthetic scheelite (CaWO) concentrate; suitable as feedstock for a tungsten carbide (WC) product, and
-  APT, suitable manufacture of tungsten wire filament, used specifically in lighting applications and in numerous other tungsten applications.

The synthetic scheelite process employs a continuous digester, which is an autoclave system employing high temperaturelhigh pressure in an alkali environment; to dissolve a low grade (510%) tungsten concentrate feed provided from a standard three stage flotation circuit.  The dissolved silica and  molybdenum are then preferentially   precipitated out of the resultant solution; which can be finished and packaged to a marketable 75% WOs concentrate grade; or better. This process typically generates recoveries and a high grade   tungsten concentrate; at the expense of both added capital and operating costs; when compared to simpler gravity and flotation-only processes. good

The APT process is a solvent extraction process ("SX') which generally starts with a relatively clean and relatively high grade (+50%) WO concentrate as feedstock; to make a virtually pure tungsten product, in a powder form. APT process technology is a conventional,  chemical refining step; considerably different from standard and flotation technology. It adds significant cost to the final product; and generates a higher value end product which is typically one step closer to many end user tungsten applications. milling

A traditional scheelite tungsten mill contains neither of these two systems. Historic processing technology for scheelite tungsten typically employed a grinding circuit; followed by a low cost gravity concentration step that generates a high grade concentrate but typically achieves low recoveries (&lt;60%) from the feed. The tungsten-laden tails from this   process are then reprocessed using flotation systems; with varying success as to both concentrate grades and recovery , depending on the specific characteristics of the material.

A traditional wolframite (Fe,Mn)WO) tungsten mill is similar, with higher recoveries from the gravity producing a wolframite concentrate that is, because of its iron and manganese content, somewhat less valued by customers in end use markets; particularly for refining to APT. step,

## Original Mill Process Plans 13.2

From late 2006 through 2008, EMC (and its predecessor company, Golden Predator MinesGPM) worked to restart the Springer mine and mill, utilising all of the existing equipment and upgrade steps in place. Work was done to replace seals and pumps; update filters throughout the mill, and over $2 million was spent on automation controls to improve process quality. In the grinding circuit, these controls will allow for more careful control of sizing of material, recognizing the ease with which friable scheelite ores can readily be over-ground and affect downstream   recovery results. In the flotation   circuit, reagent   consumption and air flow parameters were considered and optimized,  with the intent of improving both concentrate grades and recoveries.

Improvement capital was spent on both the continuous digester circuit and the APT plant. The continuous digester was converted from a rotating unit to a stationary unit with internal mixing impellers. Numerous control upgrades were carried through both the digester circuit and the APT circuit; although certain missing elements in the SX step within the APT plant were not farm was reconditioned, and the location where the tanks were to be re-installed has been readied for a full concrete spill containment and berm system; consistent with current permitting regulations. It was estimated that approximately $1 million in additional work was required to make the APT plant operational, and approximately $2-3 million in additional work was required to ready the digester circuits and the remainder of the mill rehabilitation. pad

## 13.3 Testing and Analytical Procedures-Original GE Mill Process

Work done to optimize the traditional processing flowsheet was initiated in 2007 at Montana Technical University's Centre for Advanced Mineral  and Metallurgical Processing ('Montana Tech' or CAMP') and completed in March of 2008. CAMP received Springer tungsten ore samples along with 8 chemical flocculants to determine which reagent and pH would produce the best flotation recoveries for scheelite minerals. The following is a summary of the work performed.

-  Samples were supplied to CAMP having been initially processed through a jaw crusher followed by roll crushing. The samples were then blended in order to obtain a representative sample. Next, the sample was pulverized using a disc until a Pøo of 200 mesh was achieved.
-  The sized crushed ore was then directly introduced to scheelite flotation; where a 1 kilogram charge was placed into the flotation cell along with 1.5 liters of water obtaining a pulp density of about 40% solids. The sample was mixed in the flotation cell for 10 minutes. Next; 0.2 grams per ton xanthate was added and the pH of the system was adjusted to between 5 and 6. The mixture was tap

allowed to condition for 5 minutes followed by 6 minutes of flotation for removal and concentration: pyrite

- For rougher flotation; 1 of 8 received collectors; at 0.3 grams per ton; was used along with pH adjustment of 7.5, 8.5, 9.5, or 10.5.  conditioning time of 5 minutes   followed by a flotation  time of 6 minutes was used to produce scheelite rougher concentrate. The targeted pH was maintained with lime or sulfuric acid as needed.

The results of this test work done were nearly identical to the test work records available from Springer's historic files; done by GE in 1978 &amp; 1979. The results in both cases confirmed that only a low grade concentrate could be generated using the existing grind and flotation circuits; necessitating further processing to meet minimum market product specifications.

The conclusion drawn from the first stage of the CAMP work was that the existing continuous digester (autoclave) circuit in place at Springer was required to make a marketable concentrate product. No improved flotation techniques were discovered to avoid the cost and complexity of the digester circuit.

Additional testing followed at CAMP , followed by testing by EMC, to further evaluate alternate separation processes augmented by gravity pre-concentration systems.

## 13.4 Revised Mill Process Concepts

The EMC restart of Springer was halted in late 2008, a direct result of declining tungsten pricing and a collapse of the financial markets required to provide additional capital investment CAMP earlier in the year, specifically flotation work that experimented with suppressing calcites. In early 2009, the metallurgy team began new work on a revised mill flowsheet that was capable of making a scheelite concentrate of 65% grade or better, with 80%   recoveries or better, and do without   reliance on the continuous   digester  and a synthetic scheelite process. Despite continued low prices for tungsten (APT), market demand for scheelite concentrates was encouraging enough that the APT circuit was no longer seen as a requirement for making a readily saleable 'finished' product. The digester system and APT plant represented complexity and manpowerlcost elements in the flowsheet that would be helpful to sideline in any new system---although the APT plant could be commissioned at some future time if economically desirable.

## Testing and Analytical Procedures-Revised Mill Process 13.5

The characteristic in the Springer ore that created grade problems in flotation is the calcite content. Calcites float with scheelites; making the final float con a lower grade than desirable for customers. CAMP work suggested that a combination of gravity separation techniques could effectively select out calcites and other deleterious elements from the scheelite feed, allowing for a more concentrated and selective flotation feed to be delivered and ultimately generate a higher grade float concentrate. key

The EMC team conducted both internal and external independent testwork on various gravity separation and centrifugal systems to determine their effectiveness at separating calcites (s.g. 2.7) and silicates (s.g. 2.6) from scheelite mineral (s.g.&lt; 6.1). While several gravity-based systems were evaluated, a system from Downer EDI Mining-Mineral Technologies (Downer), of Carrara, Queensland; Australia was pre-selected for specific additional testwork and trials. The Downer unit, a Kelsey Centrifugal Jig (KCJ) showed excellent results with Springer resource material,   indicating overall scheelite recoveries exceeding 90% on de-slimed feed material. Testing was based on a bulk sample of 250 kg of Springer laboratory-crushed resource taken from on-site ROM stockpiles.

EMC intends to keep confidential the specific testwork, optimum sizing fraction results; and recommendations for associated mill equipment which were completed by Downer for EMC in late 2009. However, the general conclusions of the Downer testwork were as follows:

-  Based upon the samples tested, a standard KCJ unit should be expected to reject better than 80% of the overall gangue materials and achieve significantly better than 80% total scheelite recoveries for Springer scheelite resources;
-  The KCJ unit can be expected to operate at a higher efficiency; and generate improved overall scheelite recoveries; if supplied with a de-slimed material feed,
-  The use of Derrick screens rather   than traditional   cyclone units to classify resource material will likely do a superior job of controlling and optimizing the grinding/re-grinding circuits and   achieving maximum recovery of scheelite product for four reasons:
-  Better size control will reduce the re-circulating load on the circuit, thereby reducing overall milling costs, grind
-  Better  size accuracy will   generate an optimized size fraction in the process stream for the   centrifugal jig, thereby   optimizing the effectiveness of   jig throughput; recoveries and grade;
-  More precise sizing will carry over into optimizing flotation recoveries as well, and
-  Minimized over-grinding of friable scheelite particles slimes generation; keeping fine WO;

Page 52

laboratory gear   that had a propensity to  over-grind, thereby generating a greater   slimes fraction in the 250 kg test sample; and consequently greater losses of scheelite material that ended up in that slimes component. The test results therefore may be conservative as to recovery calculations when compared to what is likely possible in a wellcontrolled mill using Derrick screens. The over-grinding would, as noted above; also reduce recoveries in both the jig and flotation testwork which followed with this material.

The results of the KCJ testwork, on de-slimed material, were as follows:

-  90% WO recovery to concentrate
-  &lt;5% concentrate mass yield
-  &gt;95% and Mgo
-  Only 500 ppm WO reported to the tailings

The Springer metallurgical team also did additional testwork on recovery of scheelite from slimes; the ultra-fine fraction removed prior to processing in the centrifugal jig systems. Work was done with Met-Solve Laboratories of Burnaby, Canada in 2009, and those   results suggested that multiple stage gravity separation with appropriately sized equipment could liberate an additional 32% of scheelite materials.

Met-Solve Laboratories; Vancouver CA also did testwork on screen sizing and effectiveness of classification of Springer resource material at various mesh sizes and particle size distributions.

Final test work was undertaken in late 2009, and focused on producing a high grade flotation concentrate using a combination of gravity and flotation. The ultimate of these tests was to produce a concentrate with grade of 65% or better while achieving overall recoveries (on de-slimed ore) greater than 85%. goal

The Downer EDI   gravity testwork   generated the source of the feed material which was subsequently tested in the Springer lab facility for amenability to flotation: Details of flotation reagents applied in the testwork were as follows:

-  Initial sulfide suppression NaHS at a high pH.
-  Secondary element and gangue suppression CO, and sodium silicate.
-  pH adjustment NaOH:.
-  Final scheelite float/collector GP 07 and frother.

The internal results of this work were that flotation recoveries on the scheelite were excellent; in excess of 95%. with  flotation response dramatically improved both the scheelite recoveries and also concurrently the grade of scheelite concentrate produced, meeting the target recoverylgrade results.

## Overall Mill Recovery Estimate 13.6

Based on this testwork on Springer resource material; the overall mill recovery estimate for scheelite is 79% in the first year and 82% thereafter. This estimate is based on recognized as-tested   partial   recovery from slimes, KCJ gravity concentration results and final flotation work; as reported.

The critical factor, as indicated; is fines generation from friable scheelite resource material due to over-grinding in mill circuits. Fines generation is expected to be between 5% and 109. Centrifugal jig recoveries (KCJ) are estimated at 91%, and flotation recoveries are estimated at 96%. If centrifugal unit is applied to recover scheelite from the slimes tails; the recovery is estimated at 35-50%. Table 13-1 below illustrates the various overall recoveries, based on the fines generation and subsequent fines recovery circuit; if that secondary circuit is applied.

Figure 13-1, Figure 13-2 and Figure 13-3 show the revised processing circuit devised for the Springer Project.

## MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATES

DMT has audited the Sutton and Sutton Il resource estimates prepared by SRK and detailed in their 2009 Technical Report on Resources (op. cit.)  DMT considers that the SRK estimate has been reported in accordance with the National Instrument 43-101 Standards for Disclosure for Mineral Projects and prepared according to the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum Best Practices and Reporting Guidelines'

The Sutton 14-1 below.

## Drill Hole Database 14.1

DMT compiled the drillhole database based on the previous iteration prepared by EMC and SRK and supported according to recent and historical  documents. The current Microsoft Access@ database consists of collar, lithology; structure; and survey tables.

Drill hole collar and channel sample locations are listed as State Plane Nevada West, NAD83 Conus Cors96 coordinates (some of the drill holes were converted from known mine grids). Collar table includes 1045 entries of which 684 represent channel samples and 361 represent

drill  holes. Drill holes were conducted through various campaigns (see exploration history), include both diamond drill core and RC as well as both surface and underground drilling: Survey table includes orientations with down hole deviation surveys.

results from GE and UII drilling included assays from three different laboratories. The assay table includes 5835 records with WO; analyses of which the bulk (5151 samples) are drill hole results and the remainder are channel sample results. Samples   with no recovery, or sample intervals missing from the database; were not utilized for compositing affect the results of resource estimation:. Assay

The database quality is considered to be better for Sutton areas than the West area based on relative confidence in the data (older drilling occurs in the West with less confidence in the drill hole surveying) with the exception of the West 'George' area where drilling has occurred in recent years.

Overall the entire database is considered to be suitable for resource estimation when considering the extensive mine history across the project and the existence of known workings to support historic drillhole locations.

## 14.2 Geological Model

## 14.2.1 Sutton

Geological modeling for the Sutton areas was conducted by SRK and audited by DMT;

through cross sections and level plans by DMT and are deemed to be good representations of the drill hole mineralization. Details pertaining to the SRK Sutton   geological model are presented in their entirety below, as outlined in the SRK (2009) Technical Report.

The resource estimation is based on a generalized  geologic model consisting of just one mineralized rock type; namely the tungsten skarn, also referred to historically as tactite; which occurs in four distinct beds. These have a sheet like geometry, which ranges from 1.0 to have been drill testing along strike for 5,600 ft and down dip for 1,500 ft.  The mineralized beds at Sutton strike along west, the beds at Sutton Il strike at azimuth 5' and dip 705 west. The three dimensional geometry of the mineralized beds is based entirely on WO analysis results. For the resource estimation; the mineralized beds were constructed based on a minimum WO threshold of 0.15%. The polygonal outlines based on channel sample data were first digitized on all   level plans. Where the underground channel   sampling terminated into un-sampled workings; the polygons were projected along strike for the distance of the average sample spacing. In the upper levels of the mine areas, these polygon outlines were linked directly between levels to define the geometry of the mineralized beds. In the lower parts of the mine, where only diamond drill   information was available; the bottom level (4100) outlines were projected down to each drill intercept, the width of mineralization was modified at the drill intercept and the polygon was then projected to the next intercept etc. This method was to emulate the geometry of the bed in the drift, where the most information was available. Where only diamond drilling was available; the polygons were extended along strike and dip a maximum of 100 ft. beyond the drill hole intercepts. They used

Detailed geologic drift maps were geo-registered into the model and compared to the channel sampling. In general, the skarn alteration shown on the geologic mapping is much more extensive both in width and along strike than that reflected by the channel sampling. It is reported that on the upper levels of the historic workings; the channel samples were collected only to confirm historic muck samples not to necessarily map the grade of the mineralization:. For this reason, the skarn outlines from the geologic plans could not be used to define the mineralized beds because could not be justified by the sampling: The wire frame solids of the mineralized beds boundary formed a geologic constraint to limit the assignment of grade regardless of the search distance. The wireframe solid shapes were used to code each bed into the block model. Only the blocks whose centroids were located within the vein wireframes were estimated. they

Six levels of mine development were input to the model and   triangulated into threedimensional solids. The x-y locations of these were digitized by EMC Metals and converted to Nevada State Plan coordinates using translation solution input to Blue Marble geo-calculator . SRK imported the 2-D plans into the model and then adjusted their elevations based on x-y-z survey coordinates taken by NM and UII. The drift elevation coordinates were assigned as an average level for each of the workings: The long section stope plans from the Park (1984) reserves report were geo-registered and draped onto the 3-D mineralized bed solids so that all areas of historical mining could be removed from the model. The same was done for the underground drifts. AII blocks whose centroids were located within the underground development or stopes were assigned a zero specific gravity.

## 14.2.2 West Springer

Similar to SRK's Sutton model; DMT prepared a generalized geologic model consisting of just one mineralized rock type; namely the tungsten skarn; for the West area using Gemcom SurpacTM modeling software;

The West skarns have a sheet like geometry; ranging from one to ten feet thick with an average of about three feet.  They have been drill tested along strike for 5,600 ft and down dip for 1,500 ft.

azimuth and dip between 70 (in the north) and 85"  (in the south) The most  continuous mineralized cluster occurs along 2,600 ft of strike length; and while mineralization appears continuous down-dip in the West area, increased faulting appears to affect continuity on the mineralization along strike;

Mineralized wireframes were constructed using a minimum WO threshold of 0.1% as a guideline (reduced from the previous SRK mineralized outline of 0.15% WO at Sutton due to of   tungsten). Historical level   plans were brought into   modeling software as geo-referenced images and used as guidelines to supplement the drill hole assay data while building mineralized wireframes. In general, the skarn alteration shown on the geologic level plans is much more extensive both in width and along strike than that reflected by the existing drilling;

The wire frame solids of the mineralized beds boundary formed a geologic constraint to limit the assignment of grade regardless of the search distance. The wireframe solid shapes were

used to code each bed into the block model such that only the blocks whose centroids were located within the vein wireframes were estimated.

As witnessed during the site investigation; abundant small-scale   mining has occurred throughout the property at surface level which was not accounted for during the West area geological modeling- these area are deemed to have relatively little impact on the overall West area resource as the majority of resources are at depth;

## 14.3 Compositing

Similar to the SRK Sutton model, the DMT West model utilized a composited dataset for resource estimation. The diamond core drilling,  RC drilling and channel samples were all composited into straight intervals equal to the original sample length of two feet. Cumulative probability plots were used to assess capping levels resulting in a 4% WO; cap (samples above 4% were recoded as 4% for compositing purposes);

## 14.4 Specific Gravity

A specific gravity of 0.0933 tft was utilized for the resource modeling based on the Ull testing. This specific gravity was also used for the Sutton model.

UII conducted a detailed specific gravity analysis of the mineralized material at Springer in collected 100 samples from the mineralized Sutton beds from the underground workings. The samples were weighed in air and again in water; specific gravity was determined by the resulting ratio: The results of the study showed an average specific gravity of 3.02 g/cm with a standard deviation of 0.211 g/cm;\_ The metric specific gravity was converted to imperial They

## 14.5 Variogram Analysis

Both Sutton and West models were estimated using an inverse distance squared estimation technique rather than   Ordinary Kriging: SRK   (2009) contains a detailed discussion on variogram   analysis and validation; which remains  relevant and is presented in its   entirety below;

Variogram construction was attempted using the WO sample data. No valid variograms could be obtained. Experimental variograms oriented down the drifts where abundant sample data was available turned out to This indicates no correlation between samples even at minimum sample spacing and highlights the extremely variable nature of the mineralization. For this reason, the deposit was estimated using an inverse distance squared estimation   technique rather than   Ordinary   Kriging. Variograms are commonly   difficult to construct in tungsten deposits. The lack of reasonable variography is more likely a function of grade variance rather than a reflection of the continuity of mineralization. Cross-sections and bench plans clearly indicate that mineralization is continuous between drill holes;, along drifts and down-dip; however the grade is highly variable.

## Block Model 14.6

The block model was constructed within the State Plane Nevada coordinate limits and other parameters listed in Table 14-3. grid

## Block Model Parameters

The wireframe solids of the mineralized beds were used to sub-cell the block model as were topography and any available mine workings. Once the block model was constructed, blocks situated above topography were assigned a zero density .

## Grade Estimation 14.7

## Sutton 14.7.1

A detailed description of the grade estimation methods for Sutton and Il is presented in the SRK (2009) Report; and as remain relevant, also in their entirety below: they

Statistical analysis showed that the average grades within the Sutton I, East and West beds were nearly identical whereas at Sutton II, the Hanging Wall bed is higher than the Main Bed. For these reasons; geologic hard boundaries were used at Sutton Il to confine the grade estimation to within each bed using only the composites from the same bed. At Sutton the model was allowed to chose the closest composite from either bed to assign grade in the block model. extrapolation. grade

The grade estimate was completed using the inverse distance squared weighting algorithm; conducted in two passes. The first required a minimum of 3 and maximum of 12 samples which were less than 5Oft from the block centroids. The second pass only considered unestimated blocks and required a minimum of 1 and maximum of 12 composites which were were length weighted to accommodate for sample length. No octant-search restriction was applied and no limit of the number of samples from a single drill hole was The results showed that during the first pass estimation; an average of eight composites were used within an used.

A distance restriction was applied during the second pass estimation whereby any assay greater than 1% WOs at Sutton was restricted to less than restricted to 2OOft of extrapolation. A long section of the interpolated block model grades from each bed is shown in Figures 14-1 through 14-4. used

## Model Validation 14.8

## Sutton 14.8.1

A detailed description of the model validation methods for Sutton and Il is presented in the remain relevant; also in their entirety below: they

Three techniques were used to evaluate the validity of the block model. First, the interpolated block grades were  visually checked on sections for comparison to the composite assay grades.  Second, statistical comparisons were made between the interpolated block grades and composite data within each bed.  These results are presented in Table 14-4 and show block grades slightly less than composite grades as desired. Third, swath plots were generated to compare model blocks and composite grades at regular section spacing through the deposit. The results are presented in Figure 14-5, Figure 14-6 and Figure 14-7. These show an acceptable amount of grade smoothing with the majority of the block grades very close to the composite grades.

Various   techniques were used to evaluate the   validity of the block model. Firstly, the interpolated block grades were visually checked on sections for comparison to the drill hole database. The interpolated block   grades were also visually checked on sections for comparison to the composite assay grades.

Further statistical comparisons were made between the interpolated block   grades and composite data within each bed.

## 14.9 Mineral Resource Classification

## 14.9.1 Sutton

The Mineral Resources at Sutton and Sutton Il are classified by SRK under the categories of Indicated and Inferred Mineral Resources.

performed according to CIM guidelines and the Mineral Resources to be at an acceptable confidence level for Indicated and Inferred resources.

The Mineral Resources are classified under the categories of Indicated and Inferred Mineral Resources according to CIM guidelines. Classification of the resources reflects the relative confidence of the grade estimates. This classification is based on several factors including; sample spacing relative to geological and geo-statistical observations regarding the continuity of mineralization, data verification to original sources, specific gravity determinations, accuracy of drill collar locations; accuracy of topographic surface; quality of the assay data and many other   factors, which influence the confidence of the mineral   estimation: No single factor controls the resource classification rather each factor influences the result. Generally, most of the factors influencing the resource classification The resources have been classified as Indicated and Inferred based primarily on sample spacing as indicated by drilling and sample density. For the resource classification; solid shapes were constructed around the parts of the beds where most drill holes are spaced approximately 100 ft apart and where abundant channel samples were taken: All blocks located within these areas were classified as Indicated resource. All blocks located outside of these areas, about the periphery of the drilling were classified as Inferred resource.

## MINERAL RESERVE ESTIMATES

No mineral reserves have been estimated or reported for the Springer Mine

## MINING METHODS

## Ore Production 16.1

The Springer scheelite beds vary in width, from a few feet up to 20 feet or more; and dip from 60 degrees to near vertical.  The beds are located adjacent to intrusive stocks and can be traced up to several thousand feet along strike. are locally cut by crosscutting faults with minor displacements. They

Shrinkage   stoping was the sole  mining method   employed by the Nevada Massachusetts Company throughout the district. Rail haulage levels were typically mined at 100 to 120 ft. vertical intervals. If the stope was not bounded by offsetting structures, hanging wall exposures of over 200 ft. longitudinally and 100 to 120 ft. vertically were successfully mined.

End slicing is the modern equivalent to shrinkage stoping and is proposed as the mining method to be employed at Springer . The geotechnical conditions and conducive to shrinkage stoping are also conducive to end slicing. Incorporating cemented sand fill into the method allows recovery of 100% of the resource when the value of the necessary support pillars exceeds the cost of sand fill. A typical stoping arrangement is shown in Figure 16-1. day

End slicing is similar to longhole stoping with one exception. An end slicing stope mines the full width of the mineralized zone where as in longhole stoping; the mineralized zone is much wider than one stope and several stopes are required to extract the full width of the mineralization

Figure 16-1: Long Section View of End Slicing Stoping Arrangement

<!-- image -->

Level spacing for end slicing will be the same as that for shrinkage stoping, or approximately 110 ft. vertically. Stope lengths will be limited to 150 ft. to backfilling but there may be opportunity to extend these lengths further, after evaluation of the local jointing and hanging wall conditions exposed in each stope. prior

Page 76

## Backfill 16.2

Backfill will be manufactured by mixing the mill tailings greater than 0.007 inch diameter (80 mesh)   with cement and then pumped underground to the stope being filled.   Since mining below backfill is not required, the fill strength necessary is only that to support the height of fill exposure This corresponds to an unconfined compressive strength (UCS) for the backfill of between 150 and 200 (pounds per square inch) . When mining is only planned above; and not adjacent to, a stope; it may be filled with un-cemented sand fill. psi

## 16.3 Stope Development

Stope development drifting dimensions will be nominally 10 ft. x 10 ft., which is large enough to accommodate the proposed 312 cubic LHDs and 15 ton trucks. The existing rail haulage drifts in the Sutton Mine will be cleaned out and enlarged to accommodate the trackless mining equipment where these drifts are required to access new stopes. Rehabilitation of old workings will not be required in the O'Byrne Mine. yard

All of the stope development drifting will be supported with split set rock bolts and wire mesh and miners will not be exposed to unsupported ground. The required rock bolt length is a function of drift width. Typical values for bolt length range from 1/4 to 1/3 of the drift width. At Springer the minimum rock bolt length is 5 feet.

Spacing of rock bolts depends on out resistance developed between the rock and the bolt and on the ability of the wire mesh to support any loose rock that may accumulate on it. Typical values for rock bolt spacing range from 3 ft. in severe loading conditions up to the rock bolt length. Five feet is the planned rock bolt spacing at Springer . pull

## 16.4 Stope Sequencing

Stope   mining will commence at the lowest   elevation in the stoping block and progress upwards. Thus the or drilling  level will become the mucking level for the subsequent stopes. Stope mining on or level access point and retreat in the direction of the shaft or level access point. In the Sutton mine where there are two parallel beds the footwall bed will be mined to mining the hanging wall bed. top prior

This sequencing arrangement has principle advantages. The first is to limit the buildup of mining induced rock stress by minimizing the need to mine secondary stopes or pillars. The second advantage is to reduce the amount of waste development required since reestablishing access to the beds will not be required as is normally the case when secondary stopes are mined. two

The disadvantage of this arrangement is to limit the selectivity and flexibility of stope mining: The stopes must be mined in the direction of retreat without exception:

## Capital Development 16.5

The skip load out is located below the last station at the 1125 level and is connected to each shaft station by twin muck passes.

To access to the intervening levels it will be necessary to drive inter-level development ramps from the levels serviced by the Sutton 3 shaft.  The existing (green) and planned (orange) capital and stope development drifting is shown in Figure 16-2 gain

Figure 16-2: Long Section of the Sutton Mine Looking S 76 E

<!-- image -->

The new methods and modern rubber-tired diesel powered mining equipment; shared between various production levels; necessitates a modern, interconnected design; which is now the intended design. Internal ramps will be necessary to connect the levels accessed by the Sutton #3 shaft to the intervening levels and to extend the mine 2 levels down dip from the existing 1125 level. Additional ramps will be required to access the resource defined down dip from the Sutton #1. Internal raises will provide ventilation and secondary egress from all the planned development. mining

In addition to the existing shaft and hoist system at Sutton;, a new portal is planned for access directly into the 125 and 250 levels constructed southeast of the mill. Access   ramps will connect the portal to both levels.

The O'Byrne mine will be accessed by two portals; located east of the mineralized bed, and interconnecting ramps. Internal ventilation and escape raises will connect all of the ramps and both portals. Portal locations are shown in Figure 16-3 and a long section of the planned mining is shown in Figure 16-4.

<!-- image -->

The Capital development drifting will also be a standard 10 ft. by 10 ft. to accommodate the rubber tired haulage fleet.  The gradient of the ramps will range between +15% and -15% as required. As with the   stope development   drifting; all capital   development drifts will be supported with set rock bolts and wire mesh Resin rebar; cable bolts andlor shotcrete can also be used to supplement the primary ground support where needed. split

## Mine design and Production Plan 16.6

The Sutton and O'Byrne resource block models were imported into Vulcan Mine   design software. Stope design polygons were created on 25 ft. centers and extending between levels throughout the un-mined regions of the deposits. The polygons were constructed to be either the larger of (1) the mineralized bed width plus 1 or (2) a 5 ft. minimum mining width; thus incorporating dilution factors into the designs. After completion of the polygons three dimensional solids were produced from each of polygons. The tons and grade of each solid was calculated from the block model and any solid with an average grade below the 0.2% cutoff grade was excluded from the mine plan. ft., pair

Figure 16-5 and Figure 16-6 are long sections through the Sutton 2 Mine looking S 76 E. The mined out zones are illustrated by the hatched areas and the planned stopes exceeding 0.2% WOs are shown in magenta. All of the planned stopes are either below or along strike from the historic workings.

## Infrastructure 16.7

## Hoist and Shaft 16.7.1

The Sutton #3 hoist and shaft was constructed in the early 1980's by General Electric Corporation. The shaft is serviced by a double drum production hoist driven by twin 325 hp AC motors. The production hoist is connected to two 9 ton capacity bottom dump skips.

The service hoist is a balanced single drum hoist driven by a 1500 hp DC motor. DC power is supplied by a motor generator set consisting of a 1250 hp AC motor driving and a 1250 kw DC generator. The hoists the summer and their recommendations for refurbishing the hoists and controls have been included in the capital cost estimates.

All of the conveyances were carefully removed from the shaft when it was decommissioned and are securely stored on site. Shaft rehabilitation will consist of re-blocking the steel sets, replacing the guides; repairing the compressed air, water supply and water discharge lines. Finally the feeder power cable will be replaced and communications lines installed.

## Dewatering 16.7.2

The Sutton   Mine is currently flooded to approximately 500 ft. below the #3 shaft   collar. Dewatering will be accomplished by staging the mine water between pump stations located on each level. The total flooded volume of the mine is estimated to be 40 to 50 million gallons and the historical water inflow rates averaged approximately 100 to 150 gallons per minute (gpm): It is estimated that mine dewatering will take 2 to 3 months to complete at sustained pumping be evaporated or reclaimed as needed for process water makeup.

## 16.7.3 Backfill Plant

GE constructed a sand fill system along with the process plant and other facilities in 1981. The plant consist of a large concrete lined holding basin; associated tanks; pumps and piping necessary to mix cement with the tailings and deliver it to the stopes being filled.  Sand fill, either cemented or un-cemented; will be pumped from the plant through a cased borehole to the mine level and then through piping to the of the stope being filled. top

## RECOVERY METHODS

## History 17.1

Refer to a section on milling activities at Springer in Chapter 13. Mineral Processing. prior

## Revised Springer Mill Process-Overview 17.2

EMC will employ a revised process to directly   produce a 65% WO scheelite concentrate; which will not rely on the existing digester circuit, nor will not it employ the APT plant facility on site. The new process will utilize the existing grinding circuits, consisting of a rod mill and a ball  mill, along with Derrick screens to accurately size material for optimum scheelite liberation from gangue material.  The sized material will be processed through a flotation circuit to first remove molybdenum disulfide (MoS;), and then delivered to a centrifugal jig to separate gangue minerals and deleterious elements from the feed using specific gravity differences. The pre-concentrated tungsten feed will next move to a three-stage flotation unit operation; using existing flotation cells in place in the existing mill. A scheelite concentrate product will then be recovered, filtered, dried and bagged for sale to customers. milling

The digester circuits on site today are anticipated to never be reactivated, as the upgrade systems based on the centrifugal jig process represent a better, cheaper alternative. The jig is best located inside the   existing mill   building, where it can be protected   from   freezing conditions and desert elements.

The APT plant also resides inside the existing mill building, and the intent is to preserve this product capability in the event Springer ever decides to produce APT at some future time. The APT plant is incomplete; as certain minor SX circuit systems components were removed by GE in the years to EMC ownership. The associated reagent tank farm storage units have been reconditioned to current environmental standards and remain on site, with a concrete catchment and berms plus tank re-installation required.  Capital cost to re-activate the APT plant; sized to process Springer's entire concentrate product; is estimated at approximately $1 million; however this cost is not included in the restart capital figures, or the restart plan. Springer's permitting and utility services remain in place; and have been preserved to allow a APT circuit restart, should that be desirable. prior rapid

## 17.3 Overview of Unit Operations

Based on the revised EMC flowsheet; the major process steps for scheelite concentrate production are as follows:

-  Mill feed preparation
-  Resource grinding circuit (rod &amp; ball mills)
-  Molybdenum flotation circuit
-  Gravity separation circuit (Kelsey Jig, KCJ)
-  Residual sulfide flotation circuit

- Scheelite flotation circuits 
- Product finish and packaging 

Major unit operations are illustrated on the following flowsheet; Figure 17-1 .

Figure 17-1: Conceptual Preconcentration Flowsheet EMC

## 17.3.1 Mill Feed Preparation

Resource material is lifted (via   production   hoist) into two 400 ton surface material bins (currently one resource; one waste) or delivered (from adits) to a secondary crusher tower and platforms. ROM material is initially crushed through a 100 hp Telsmith gyratory crusher (set at 4 inches)   rated at 200 tph, followed by a secondary 250 hp Telsmith cone crusher (set at 5/8 inches) rated at 180 tph. Material is then moved by a series of crushed material conveyors, further  screened and sized to specification; and dropped onto a material  stockpile with a capacity of approximately 50,000 tons. A remote-operated hydraulic rock breaker unit is also installed adjacent to a sizing grisly to receive and properly reduce over-size resource material from adits; via separate conveyor; to the cone crusher, where it joins the material flow with underground material.

The pre-crushed and sized resource material is pulled from the stockpile by five underground over a belt scale and delivered to the mill building.

retrofitted.

## Resource Grinding Circuits 17.3.2

Resource material enters an elevated   platform and is delivered to a hopper-fed 450 hp Dominion rod mill (9 ft. by 12 ft:) The rod mill grinds to specification; and will deliver material to a Derrick screen sizer unit selected to out target sized material and pass that on to moly flotation. Oversize material is then returned to a hopper-fed 750 hp Dominion ball mill (11.5 ft. by 10 ft:) where it is re-ground to specification; screened and joins the feed flow at the moly float circuit. pull

The milling circuit is rated for 1,000 tpd, and with current horsepower ratings would not be able to meet the current 1,200 tpd throughput intended for the mill. New, higher horsepower motor drives (750 hplrod mill &amp; 800 hp/ball mill) have previously been purchased; are located on-site; and will be installed to meet production targets.

## 17.3.3 Molybdenum Flotation Circuit

Molybdenum is historically present in the Springer resource; was removed by GE when then they operated the mill facility in 1982, and is considered a deleterious element in a tungsten concentrate; subject to a quality penalty unless removed. A conventional flotation system will be employed using single stage flotation cells to separate molybdenite (molybdenum disulfide or MoS from the mineral feed prior to delivery to a gravity separation circuit.  The existing equipment   may be partially   re-applied to this process, but   this step is expected to be an addition to the existing sulfide removal systems in place.

As no molybdenum resource has been established in this updated resource estimate; no economic recovery of moly products (MoS)) has been assumed in this PEA.

## 17.3.4 Gravity Separation Circuit

Springer   intends to add a centrifugal   gravity  separation system into the existing   process flowsheet to separate and reject gangue materials from the mineral stream to flotation:. prior

A 50 tph modular Kelsey Jig unit (Model J1 800) is the largest presently available; and is appropriately sized for mill throughput. The Kelsey Jig is delivered as an integrated, near-fully assembled unit (five shipping containers) for erection on site in this case inside the existing Springer mill.

Prior to the gravity circuit process;  feed material will   initially be introduced into a slimes classifier , such as a cyclone unit; to remove &lt;10 pm material from the feed. This   slimes separation is an integral element of the Kelsey Jig system. The de-slimed feed will then be pumped to the high speed rotating centrifugal drum where it will separate approximately 80% step

of feed material to tails and reduce overall flotation feed tonnages to less than 20% of initial volumes (depending on slimes generation). grind

Slimes will be directed from the hydrocyclone tailings stream to a Falcon concentrator system; where part of the higher specific gravity scheelite can be selectively separated, while rejecting the lower density gangue material to the final tailings stream.

Slimes scheelite recovery is relatively poor (35-50%). Depending on the effectiveness of screening; full mill stream automation; and the in-line sampling system updates which have been installed, slimes   generation has the potential to be substantially minimized. This   will improve overall recoveries and is the operational objective. Success from slimes reduction through proper control may actually further reduce the economics of scheelite recovery from a smaller   slimes volume. The PEA assumes no slimes recovery in year one of the economic analysis; and the Falcon system is shown in the flowsheet as a possible addition; only if justified in later years based on experience minimizing slimes generation: grind

## 17.3.5 Flotation

As in the previous Springer mill process flowsheet, a sulfide removal flotation circuit is also jig concentrate alongside scheelite; so their removal prior to scheelite flotation is warranted. The upgraded mineral stream from the Kelsey Jig moves first to the sulfide removal flotation step; and then on to a standard scheelite flotation circuit. Scheelite flotation is anticipated to be a conventional four stage process involving rougher, scavenger, cleaner, and re-cleaner steps, designed to float scheelite and reject any residual sulfides. The existing flotation cells in the mill   today represent substantial excess capacity for this   planned circuit, and it is anticipated a portion of the current 1,000 tpd throughput on this circuit will be applied to moly and sulfide flotation.

## 17.3.6 Product Finish

Scheelite concentrate (~65% WO moves from flotation to a series of leaf filters and material drying units to generate a substantially concentrate for shipping: Concentrate product will be bagged, weighed, and stored on pallets in a finished product area of the existing mill for shipment to customers; by truck or sea/rail container, as required. dry

## 17.3.7 Laboratory Facilities

The Springer mill includes a fully equipped laboratory and sample preparation facility; to enable continuous   sampling of resource feeds, and finished product   specifications. Laboratory facilities include an X-Ray Fluorescence unit (XRF) and an Inductively-Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry unit (ICP-MS) to fully sample and document product quality on-site and provide customer quality assurance.

## 17.3.8 Mill Electrical Consumption

Power consumption for the mill is estimated based on current Nevada Energy rates and based on the connected load levels for the main components within the mill, as shown in Table 17-1.

Mill &amp; Mine Water Consumption 17.3.9

The mine and mill facility have current ownership rights to the necessary water to operate; from the State of Nevada. The mine is expected to make as much water as is required for any process needs underground and around the surface facilities for dust control and road maintenance. The mill water consumption; based on the PEA operational rate of 1,200 tpd, is estimated to be approximately 300 gpm or 484 The Springer   facility has approximately 2.2 times that required amount of water assigned from the State; enough to support expansions of the mill (to 1,500 tpd) and a restart of the APT plant; if either of these two possibilities are pursued.

Detail on minelmill water consumption and the available water resource is shown in Table 17-2 below.

## PROJECT INFRASTRUCTURE

## Access Road and Transportation 18.1

The Springer Mine property is serviced by Interstate Highway 80, and is located approximately 130 miles east of Reno, Nevada and approximately 30 miles west of Winnemucca; Nevada. The property is accessed off the Interstate by State Road 400, a paved/gravel two lane 8 mile road used by mine traffic and local ranchers. The Southern Pacific railway parallels Interstate Highway 80 and a track cut-out and short siding is located at Cosgrave; approximately 18 miles from the mine site.

## 18.2 Electric Power and Natural Gas Supply

Nevada Power supplies a 69 kV; 3 phase, 60 Hz power source to the Springer Mine facility. Springer maintains the electrical infrastructure from the metering station to the mine, and water well pumps on adjacent property. This infrastructure includes over poles and three main transformers. A significant range fire burned on the property in 2007, destroying most of the utility-owned electrical delivery poles; which have all been replaced. Natural gas is provided to the mine   facility by Southwest Gas. Natural gas was significant when GE operated the digestion and APT processes in the mill, but will be much less so with the current operating plan for scheelite concentrate production:  The gas service will find use in the facility, and is in place should future plans call for its application. fifty

All of the electrical transformers on site have been refurbished to current standards; and none on the property contain PCB's.

## 18.3 Water Supply

Water for the Springer mill and surface facilities is supplied by two wells in the valley; both capable of pumping in excess of 1,000 gpm. The water is delivered across a BLM right of way through an existing water pipeline. Well water was stored in a 550,000 gallon storage tank on a hill  above the mill facility . The mine and mill facility is designed to consume 400 gpm on average;   assuming a 1,200 tpd processing   rate; and depending on cleanup work being performed in and around the mill and property. Mill tailings will be piped in slurry to a tailings facility, where a significant portion of the contained process water will be reclaimed as make-up water for re-use in the mill. Net water requirement for the mill, supplied from wells; is estimated at 200 gpm. pond

Water quality from existing wells is not to drinking water standard. Potable water requirements on site, specifically for mine shower facilities; will require a clean water standard that will need to be met by reverse osmosis water purification systems; which is onsite and will be installed in year zero.

Sub-surface water quality on the property is monitored by 11 groundwater monitoring water wells, sampled and serviced as required to maintain reporting standards. Extensive baseline water quality data is available for comparison; beginning with acquisition of the property from GE in 2006.

## Shipping Facilities 18.4

A 60 foot truck scale is located at the mine gate; to establish delivery weights on material arriving on site. The nearest major port facility is located on the transport.

## 18.5 Buildings and Ancillary Facilities

The existing infrastructure at the Springer Mine consists of a 1,360 ft (440 m) vertical shaft and underground workings (currently flooded), a resource stockpile; a 950 tpd mill with tungsten; molybdenum; and sulphide flotation circuits, an (unlined) tailings pond and numerous outbuildings. The Springer mill is currently configured to produce either ammonium paratungstate (APT) or calcium tungstate (synthetic scheelite), although changes are underway to produce a standard scheelite concentrate; at an up-rated 1,200 tpd mill throughput.

The current mine and mill facilities were constructed between 1978 and 1981\_ commissioned and operated in 1982. Initial construction cost was   approximately   $70 million, managed through a joint venture between GE and Utah International Inc.

Specific infrastructure and facilities are as follows:

-  Shaft is a 5 compartment unit, with head frame; two 9 ton production skips and one 20 ton service cage; and two 400 ton material bins (one for resource; one for waste),
-  Hoist house, pre-engineered steel, 10,560 sf, includes a Nordberg 350 hp (AC) 7 ft. double drum production hoist (130 tph), and a Nordberg 1,500 hp (DC) 7 ft. single drum service hoist (10 ton) with separate control stations; plus stationary air compressors;
-  Administration building, pre-engineered steel, HVAC, plumbing, 10,800 sf, with approximately miners map and engineering rooms; storage facilities, and meeting rooms. dry ,
-  Warehouse   building;   pre-engineered steel, HVAC, plumbing; 10,000 sf, with approximately 10 offices, part mezzanine; plus machine electrical and weld shop facilities . shop, shop
-  Mill building, pre-engineered steel, HVAC; plumbing, mezzanine; 30,000 sf, includes rod regrind mill; digester circuit and full APT and XRF) and two  sample preparation areas. part
-  Various storage sheds; core sheds; and equipment shelters.

EMC Metals spent two years (2006-2008) rehabilitating and expanding the mill facility. Work is nearly complete to make the primary milling and flotation circuits operational: Work remaining to make the tungsten processing facility operational includes the addition of a gravity circuit;

stockpile of resource material extracted from the mine by Utah International Inc. in 1982 is present on site. The stockpile contains an estimated 25,000 t of crushed mill feed material and an additional 15,000 t of run of mine material. Sampling by EMC Metals along the surface of both stockpiles has shown the material to have an average of 0.5 WO, % grade

## 18.6 Tailings Storage Area

A tailings impoundment was constructed by General Electric Corp. during the development of the mine site in the 1980s. The original design was for a total volume capacity of 85 Mft capable of accommodating 192,000 t of tails per year for a 13-year mine life. The actual as built capacity is reported to be the same as its design; or approximately 2.5 Mt:.

## 18.7 Waste Disposal Area

There are numerous historical waste dumps located on site. The majority of these waste piles are small spoil piles located at the adits of historical workings.  There are adequate locations available on private land to accommodate the anticipated mine waste production: The site is permitted for solid waste landfill disposal; and for a large capacity septic system:

Hazardous waste is handled, stored and disposed of in accordance with applicable regulations.

## 18.8 Manpower Availability

Winnemucca is the closest population center to the mine site, approximately 30 miles east. It is a community of 18,000 in the town and surrounding area; which includes schools and two hospital facilities. Winnemucca is a regional   mining center, with 1,150 hotel rooms considerable mining support services and mining businesses. Mining staff and an experienced mining workforce are attracted to the area and availability of trained staff is considered good.

## MARKET STUDIES AND CONTRACTS

DMT has relied on EMC staff for information pertaining to markets; off-take agreements and the potential revenue stream, however, DMT Geosciences and Practical have reviewed these agreements and the pricing assumptions and finds them to be reasonable.

## Market Size 19.1

World annual demand for tungsten is estimated unchanged from 2008 figures (source: USGS), and equating to roughly $3.5 billion in traded value as APT. Some relevant statistics:

-  2011 global tungsten production is estimated at 72,000 tpa (source: USGS),
-  about 30% of consumption; and considerably exceeding this level in certain countries.
-  World tungsten consumption in 1970 was about 28,000 tpa, so roughly one third of consumption levels today, representing about a 3% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the last 40 years,
-  Very little new tungsten supply has been brought online since 2008 (6,000 t,
-  While tungsten consumption has   remained   relatively flat   since 2008 due to limited world GDP growth; analysts had in fact predicted a strong demand push to 109,000 tpa by 2012, based on tungsten's uses and applications a forecast likely to be revisited in any stronger economic recovery .

China is by far the dominant player in global tungsten markets. China holds an estimated 61% (USGS) of known global tungsten resources, the largest of any nation; and also holds some of the largest deposits. China produces an estimated 60,000 tonnes of tungsten annually (USGS, 2011 estimate), representing over 83% of world production: China is estimated to consume 50% of its   internal tungsten production;   which makes it a heavy   exporter of tungsten-content manufactured goods and machinery .

Once a concentrate exporter, China now is a net concentrate importer and has significant internal restrictions on export of   non-processed tungsten feed stocks China has been managing it's tungsten exports for ten years now, first employing export quotas in 2002. Export tariffs on tungsten content products followed in 2004. Chinese export quotas for the current year have again been lowered (2%), and the predictions are for growing restrictions in the future on both primary and intermediate tungsten exports. In early 2012, the USA, EU, and Japan filed a challenge with the World Trade Organization (WTO) regarding China's tungsten export restrictions. The EU now classifies tungsten as a "critical raw material" and the British Geological Society it on their list of 'supply risk minerals' . put

## Tungsten Demand Outlook 19.2

Tungsten consumption has been traditionally closely tied to economic activity and growth rates, in fact  matching rates. In the 1980's, analysts predicted 4% long term annual growth rates for tungsten; but the actual growth rates have industrial sectors have played a role in consumption that have allowed tungsten demand to show strength in lower overall growth environments; offset partially by higher recycling. The and continuing industrialization of both China and India will generate increased tungsten demand as well. rapid

## 19.3 Tungsten Applications

Tungsten is one of the heaviest metals, at 19.25 g/cm? (approximately the weight of gold), and has the highest melting of all metals at 3,422*C, a temperature at which iron, aluminum; copper and titanium  have already exceeded their   boiling   points   (vaporized): This makes tungsten alloyed steels the strongest high temperature man-made metallic materials. Tungsten monocarbides (WC) are extremely hard, with a hardness index of 300-600 HVso' very close to diamond. point

Approximately 60% of all tungsten is converted to tungsten cemented carbides; which are used as high wear surfaces or cutting surfaces on high speed tools used to form; shape and cut other Tungsten carbide 'hard-facings remain the (essential) material of choice for drill bits in oil and mineral exploration; production are manufactured by cementing tungsten monocarbide grains in a binder matrix of cobalt or nickel alloy using liquid phase sintering.  These manufactured materials exhibit superior hardness; strength; toughness and compressive strength:  The basic sintering process for manufacturing hardmetals has been practiced since the 1920's, although the science and the engineered materials have progressed substantially since the initial techniques were applied.

Mill products represent the next segment of tungsten application by tonnage, at about 20%. Because of tungsten's very high melting point, tungsten shapes are typically not melted &amp; cast, but   fabricated from powders which are pressed, sintered and worked or formed into the desired shape. Lighting filaments; electrodes; wire and electronic contacts are formed in this fashion; as are certain tungsten alloys; such as tungsten-carbide silver, or sintered tungsten copper. Lighting applications make up approximately 4% of tungsten usage. New lighting technologies (CFL, fluorescent; HP mercury-vapor, metal halide; etc.) have not diminished this application for tungsten; as most also have tungsten content in critical parts; some with more tungsten than was present in traditional mono-filament bulbs.

The steel   alloy segment represents the remaining 20% of tungsten consumption globally Steels and metals can be alloyed with tungsten by introducing tungsten or ferro-tungsten into the melt or through secondary electro-slag re-melting: Tungsten can also be introduced in this application as scrap. High speed hardened steels typically contain a minimum of 7% tungsten; molybdenum; and vanadium; plus 0.6% carbon. At content, the hardness and toughness of steel is maximized.  Tungsten is also commonly alloyed with steels used in high heat   applications; such as   engine valves Tungsten is added to stainless steels to improve corrosion resistance. alloy

## Tungsten Customer Contracts &amp; Sales Terms 19.4

The majority of tungsten is mined and processed into APT, tungsten carbide; or end use products in China. China had followed a path of value added processing for its internally mined/sourced tungsten, choosing to export finished goods with tungsten content rather than exporting concentrates; as was done in the 1970-1990 timeframe. China is a net importer of tungsten concentrates today.

While there has always been a market for tungsten concentrates; that market has not been particularly transparent and remains characterized by private contracts between miners and tungsten   upgraders;   typically ammonium paratungstate (APT) refiners. APT is publically quoted, Chinese trading houses (FOB China, not duty-paid)) , and others. As a result, APT is universally considered as the for tungsten. This is also appropriate as APT represents tungsten in the form most often used by fabricators and others for manufacturing downstream and end use tungsten products.

APT is priced in metric ton units ("MTU's"), which are equal to 22.04 pounds; or 10 kg. Thus, 100 MTU's equals one tonne. Tungsten is also typically quoted in US dollars. Concentrate is also priced in MTU's, but as a concentrate is usually only 65% tungsten trioxide by weight, the concentrate pay-weight is actually calculated on a tungsten-equivalent basis. Concentrates are almost  always low moisture; less than 5%, essentially powder. outputs or measures are quoted in short ton units ("STU's") which is one hundredth of an imperial ton (2,000 pounds) and therefore only 20 pounds or approximately 10% less than an MTU. dry

Tungsten concentrates are in short supply today. Scheelite concentrates; (Springer's intended product) are typically demanded by APT customers to be pure and free of a number of other metals and contaminants, particularly uranium; but also molybdenum in any significant concentrations; grading 62.5% to 65% tungsten trioxide (WO;). Concentrates are typically sold in 1-2 tonne reinforced fabric bags on pallets. Concentrate prices typically reference a specific independent quote for APT, discounting to APT on various bases, depending on the individual customer-supplier negotiation: Pricing formats can include; for example; one or more of the following:

-  Fixed discount   percent   to APT price, current month or multi-month   trailing quote,
-  on APT price thresholds; with either higher or lower discounts as APT pricing rises,
-  Fixed dollar discounts to APT,
-  Combinations of all of the above pricing mechanisms, and
-  Single year or multi-year contract terms.

<!-- image -->

The very low APT pricing environment of the late 1970-90's encouraged structures based on fixed pricing discounts, while the more volatile pricing environment since the 2000 timeframe has had both suppliers and customers favoring percentage of APT - based pricing formulas.

A typical baseline pricing formula; as used in this PEA, is a compliant quality-agreed 65% concentrate of 80% of the previous month APT quote; FOB mine price price gate.

## 19.5 Historic APT Pricing

Pricing on APT has been volatile in the decade beginning with the year 2000 (Figure 19-1). Chinese influence on APT markets kept prices under $1OO/MTU in the first five years of the decade; only breaking through $1OO/MTU and into the +S2OO/MTU range in 2005. Monthly pricing flirted with $3OO/MTU levels but never achieved that mark in 2005 and 2006, settling into a $25O/MTU price range that stayed relatively stable as the chart below shows through 2007-2008. Pricing retreated in 2009, reflecting the then-current financial crisis; combined with very poor world industrial growth rates and tungsten de-stockpiling, back to the S2OO/MTU range. By 2010, APT prices were again rising; and finally convincingly broke the $3OO/MTU price point in Q4. Pricing in 2011 continued the trend of 2010, with APT pricing quickly exceeding S4OO/MTU and pushing to   just under   $SOO/MTU before   falling back into the $45O/MTU range; where prices stayed through Q1 2012. The recent six months has seen prices settle over S4OO/MTU, falling through that level just at the writing of this report to $36O/MTU in the beginning of September 2012.

## Right-of-Way-Tailings Pipeline 20.2

GE established a right-of-way (ROW) over BLM owned property in the 1970s, over which it pumped fresh well water to the minelmill from groundwater wells in the valley.  That ROW remains in place and will be used for the same purpose by Springer in operations.

GE also traversed US Bureau of Land Management (BLM) property with a tailings pipe; in a direct route to the existing tailings dam facility in the valley; located on private land owned by Springer mine. The ROW associated with this BLM property was not fully perfected at the time GE used it. Nonetheless; the pipe and route would have been available to Springer today; on a grandfathered basis, except for the fact that a substantial range fire that ran through this area in 2007 destroyed the GE tailings pipe in place at the time. In order to re-establish the pipe on this property; the ROW needs to be formally re-established with the BLM. The property section ground is disturbed and has legacy environmental impacts.

Springer has formally applied to the BLM for a reinstatement of this ROW to allow a new tailings pipeline to traverse the approximate 1.1 mile length (one section; slight diagonal) of this disturbed area. This plan represents the most  efficient solution for Springer one that has better life of mine economics than the currently permitted solution:

The currently permitted solution; based on earlier planning work, called for the construction of a small, intermediate on privately owned property directly adjacent to the mill. tailings pond

This ROW is expected to granted and approved not later than June 2013, and will not delay facility restart.

## 20.3 Mine Closure Considerations and Requirements

Nevada State mining regulations require site reclamation bonding to be established, to the start of operations. Reclamation cost estimates are made based on predetermined cost required reclamation cost estimates in accordance with Nevada   regulations. The current reclamation cost estimate is $3.9 million and the associated bonding requirement is included in the capital cost estimate to restart mine operations. prior

## CAPITAL AND OPERATING COSTS

As the mine was a fully   operational facility in the past; the capital  requirements   are now associated with restart of the existing   facilities;   including rehabilitation of certain areas, additions of new or different equipment in the mill and mine, and modernization and conversion of the underground operations to more efficient mining methods. The existing buildings and infrastructure is all in place and in excellent condition.

working capital and contingencies; with Certain expenditures can be delayed until the mine is in commissioning and early production:

Table 21-1 is a summary of total restart capital.

## 21.1.1 General

This capital estimate has been determined on the basis of estimates provided directly by third party contractors; discussions with contractors and service providers familiar with the facility , and internal estimates (Table 21-2). Because there is no 'greenfields' construction required, the typically factored costs are not a part of this estimate. However, as the mine is not able to be inspected due to flooding, rehabilitation costs are estimates only, based on as-found condition.

## 21.1.2 Production Mining Equipment

Mobile equipment requirements were estimated in the same manner as labor requirements and are listed in Table 21-3. New mining equipment generally has a life expectancy of approximately 7 years at average utilization rates. Since this typical equipment life exceeds the currently planned mine life of 4.75 years, and equipment sizes specified are available in the used market the capital cost of the mining equipment has been estimated at 60 80% of new equipment. today,

## Tungsten Milling Cost Summary 21.2.3

The Springer tungsten mill annual average costlton is estimated at $13.5O/ton. The mill will not be operated as it was by GE in 1982, so the historic cost experience is not a useful indicator of cost from a flowsheet standpoint; in addition to being 39 year old figures.

## PRELIMINARY ECONOMIC ANALYSIS

The preliminary   economic analysis is   preliminary in nature and includes inferred mineral resources that are considered to be to have the economic considerations applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as a mineral reserve and there is no certainty that the preliminary economic analysis will be realized.

The Project has been valued using a constant dollar, discounted cash flow analysis to generate a 5 year project plan of operation; plus one year to production to de-water the Sutton mine; rehabilitate various surface and underground facilities; and complete a re-commissioning of the mill facility. Both pre-tax and after-tax NPV results are presented, at various discount rates. Discounted cash flow-internal rate of return ("DCF-IRR" or "IRR") results are also presented, and calculated on restart capital only no sunk costs are included. The effects of changes in inputs has also been assessed and presented in a sensitivities review. prior key

## 22.1 Summary

As previously discussed in Chapter 21 (Capital and Operating Costs) , the economic evaluation on the Project considered all capital and development costs to re-establish Springer Tungsten Mine as a modern longhole mine. This includes capital and capitalized development costs to establish ramp connected levels, and adit access. The mine plan calls for two separate mining operations:   the existing GE mine in Sutton on the eastern side of the property, and a new smaller high grade mine at 0'Byrne on the western side of the property. The mine life presented in all economics is defined by the updated NI 43-101 resource estimate; and limited to 5 years of production. Project performance is summarized in Table 22-1.

Cash Flow Model Financial Summary 22.2

The financial returns, as defined by the cash flow model for a 5 year production plan are summarized in Table 22-2.

The cash flow model uses a conventional discount method, and is constructed with annual revenue and cost inputs; annual capital cost inputs; and assumes no contractor participation or leased equipment, and no leverage (debt) The economics are presented on a 100% equity basis. The annual cash flows are discounted back to 'time zero' , specifically January 1, 2013. Revenue and production begins in 2014.

## Capital Cost Summary 22.3

a two year restart   plan. This  estimate mill and surface   facilities, add circuits   required in the mill to produce and package a tungsten concentrate (65% WO;); purchase used underground mining equipment (60% of new catalog prices) and meet all environmental standards with respect to tailings pond performance; for the full 5 year term of the PEA. In addition; the capital cost estimate includes a 10% contingency a working capital estimate of $3.0 M (45 days operating expenses). The financial model cash flow also includes $3.0 M in pre-production expenses to income plus USS13.5 M million in sustaining capital over the total 5 year PEA term, mostly underground mine development work.

Details of the elements of restart capital are presented in Table 22-3 below.

## Project Scope 22.5

The cash model is based on a 5 year mine plan to produce tungsten concentrates as 65% WOs: The mine restart plan calls for a 12 month concurrent permitting; ROW, and construction program in 2013, with de-water beginning in month 6, and full production commencing in

January 2014. The PEA has production scheduled for a total of 4.8 years, and cash flows modeled for 6 years including the initial start-up year .

## 100% Basis Presentation 22.6

The Project is presented on a 100% basis; as Silver Predator holds 100% ownership rights to the Springer assets and mineral rights; subject to royalties on certain minor mineral parcels which are not material to the project economics.

## 22.7 Basis of Revenue Estimates

Sales revenues are based on 24 month   trailing average European delivery Metal Bulletin quoted Ammonium Paratungstate (APT) prices; which is the form in which tungsten is typically sold to manufacturing customers or tungsten carbide converters. Springer will sell a 65% WO concentrate; which is assumed to sell for 80% of its contained tungsten in concentrate. APT prices are typically quoted in metric ton units (MTUs) and US dollars; either FOB Europe or FOB China: An MTU is equal to 22.04 Ib of contained tungsten; or 1/1OOth of a allowance for freight costs has been taken in the cash flow estimates.

## 22.8 Cost and Production Price Escalation

The cash flow model is a constant dollar model, and no inflation is assumed in costs, revenues, or margins. NPV discount rates should be viewed as constant dollar rates as well.

## 22.9 Currency and Exchange Rate Assumptions

The cash flow model is expressed in United States dollars (USS), as to costs and revenues. The project does not expect to incur expenses or receive revenues in any other currency than USS.

## Mine Closure and Salvage Costs 22.10

No costs have been included at the end of the 5 year cash flow model for mine closure or salvage. The Nevada State environmental bond of $3.9 M represents a worst-case shut-down cost for the facility, and the cash flow model assumes that the cash collateralized $2 M portion of this estimate would likely reclaim most of the property; particularly if salvage costs on the mill and mining equipment were applied to any unfunded reclamation and dismantling costs.

## Taxes and Royalties 22.11

The property is burdened by two royalty-holders who have over-riding Net Smelter Returns ("NSR") of 5% of revenues, net of any freight on CIF sales. This NSR is included in the cash flows and economics.

These NSR's are payable on small mineral license parcels inside the general mineral license area owned or controlled by Springer Mining Company. The tonnage of tungsten resource and grade on these properties is unknown; and certain advance royalties have been since 2008. The PEA assumes that 10,000 tons of ore per year is mined from these properties collectively, and that average ROM grades generate a $50,000 annual royalty payable Prior paid

PEA further assumes that royalties will only be payable on years 4 and 5 in the cash flow analysis.

The State of Nevada has a net   proceeds tax   payable on all   mining business, which is a property tax. The net proceeds tax rate is 5% of earnings before interest and federal tax ("EBIT"), and while depreciation deductions are allowed, depreciation schedules are restricted to a 20 year straight line convention.

A US corporate income tax applies to Springer taxable income 'EBT") which is currently 34% on pre-tax income under $10 M. This tax rate assumption was used in the cash flow analysis for the PEA. The Nevada State tax is deductable for federal tax calculation purposes.

result of   previous restart   spending in the 2006-2011   period that were taken as income statement losses. These prior period losses can be used to offset taxable income in a return to profitability and have been assumed usable for that purpose in the PEA cash flow model. Further to costs written off to income; there also remains a significant investment in capitalized development work and assets from the 2006-2008 period that have been assumed can be written off over the 5 year PEA life in the cash model. As a result of utilizing these period investments as depreciable assets; the cash model shows US corporate tax payable beginning in the second half of year 3 of the total 5 year mine life cash model. Nevada resource taxes are paid in every operating year in the model and period NOLs cannot be utilized in that taxable income calculation. prior prior prior

Payroll taxes and other employee taxes and burdens are assumed as a part of operating costs in each year. Mineral   royalties are payable to the State of Nevada   annually; total approximately $50,000 on the un-patented mining claims held by Springer Mining Company. they

## 22.12 Select Annual Output Levels and Financial Results

Mining  operations are scheduled to begin at both the Sutton and O'Byrne mine locations; although O'Byrne is severely limited as to mineable tonnage; based on the NI 43-101 resource available: As a result; while Sutton operates for approximately 4.8 years; O'Byrne operates for only 1.6 years. Stockpile draw downs of 40,000 tons extend product output levels slightly, and are shown in the table below as Sutton production in the tungsten (MTU) category; as were produced there historically , thus carry similar grade. they

## Sensitivities to Variables Key 22.13

Project economic risks were assessed and can be seen below. The risks were segregated into three categories; as follows:

- Sensitivity to fluctuations in tungsten prices (Table 22-6), defined as APT pricing; Euro quote in metric ton units (MTU's) , 
- Sensitivity to financial   assumptions;   specifically total   production cost (mining/milling/G&amp;A) , and restart capital cost estimates; as shown in Table 22-7, below, and key 
- Sensitivity to production and   operating   parameters, such as mill   tungsten recoveries; and resource head grade assumptions; as shown in Table 22-8, below. 

## INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS

The project is impaired by a small, NI 43-101 compliant resource and thus a short mine life; but this analysis does suggest the potential viability of an economic return on restart capital at current tungsten prices. Underground production and operations will present opportunities to conduct exploration for additional resources that may extend mine life. Mining will also present opportunities to efficiently   attempt to validate existing historical   production data that has otherwise not been useable in the current NI 43-101 resource estimate.

Molybdenum element. It has not been considered as a co-product that contributes to project revenue in this PEA (per the CSA Staff Notice dated August 16t 2012) because a NI 43-101 molybdenum resource has not been established on the property. Mining operations underground are likely to create an opportunity to do exploration and assay work on molybdenum that could create a moly resource in the future: If saleable quantities and grades of MoSz are captured in the mill, it is likely that these co-products will have marketable value The flowsheet and capital spend estimates do indicate that SMC intends to attempt to capture this opportunity .

## RECOMMENDATIONS

Re-establish the historic resource in Sutton I, Il &amp; Il in the underground working areas to a NI 43-101 standard to capture value in future economic studies and shareholder value. Many of the production stopes have detailed sampling information which is based on grade sampling from ore cars. As this information does not permit an assessment of grade distribution and variability it was not considered appropriate to include in the resource estimate. The following recommendations are made:

-  After existing underground facilities are dewatered and accessible; exploration and confirmation drilling and sampling should be undertaken
-  It is estimated that $1-2 M in drilling and sampling may be able to reinstate the historic resource (+50% on current resource) in the Sutton Mine

Additional exploration drilling should be considered for Springer West to improve the mineral resource classification category:

-  Complete both surface and underground core drilling to test the undrilled strike extensions of the O'Byrne bed,
-  Integrate the   currently   small and un-utilized   George bed resource into the O'Byrne Mine plan.
-  Compile a central database for all historical channel samples from the workings on the western side of the district   including Humboldt; Stank and Springer mines
-  Develop a long term mining plan for Springer West, where historic production suggests higher   tungsten   grades be found, supported by focussed resource exploration from starter mines suitable for expansion and consolidation: may

Consideration should be given to   developing a NI 43-101 mineral resource estimate for molybdenum; corresponding to tungsten resources:

-  Existing molybdenum assay values have been entered into the Springer Microsoft Access@ database This effort should be continued and managed to achieve a moly resource if possible
-  Since molybdenum must be removed from the scheelite concentrates; where it is considered a "deleterious' element, consideration should be given as to whether   there is any economic value to capturing a separate   molybdenum (MoS)) concentrate product.

Investigate whether early testing applications of the Kelsey Jig applied to tungsten resources to make a saleable concentrate to provide immediate cash flow during the second half of the start-up year zero:

- An   existing 40,000 ton surface resource stockpile from Sutton may  a candidate for concentration and flotation testing in the mill to produce saleable product quickly
-  Historic tailings are in the vicinity of the mill, reportedly grading 0.2% scheelite; and may be recoverable into product, depending on size fractions and concentration techniques applied.

Other Recommendations for optimization that should be undertaken in the start-up year zero:

-  Perform test work on tailings samples to determine the optimum size fraction and cement content required for backfill.
-  Convert all historical mine maps into the current state plane grid
