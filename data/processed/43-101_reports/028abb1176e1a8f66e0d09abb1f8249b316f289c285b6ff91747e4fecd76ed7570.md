## TABUAÇO TUNGSTEN PROJECT, PORTUGAL NI 43-101 TECHNICAL REPORT.

## 1 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

## 1.1 INTRODUCTION

The  Tabuaço  Tungsten  Project  is  located  within  the  São  Pedro  das  Águias  block  of  the Armamar-Meda  concession  which  is  situated  in  the  North  Central  region  of  Portugal, approximately 300 kilometres north-north east of Lisbon, 100 km to the east-south  east of Porto,  and  comprises  two  separate  blocks,  namely  the    São  Pedro  das  Águias  and  Meda blocks.

The  Tabuaço  Project  is  located  in  a  port  wine  growing  area  of  varying  topography, overlooking  the  banks  of  the  Távora  River.  The  Project  area  is  divided  into  three  deposit areas  the  São  Pedro  das  Águias-Herédias  resource  area  ('QSPA')  and  the  Aveleira  and Quintã exploration areas.

Colt  Resources  Inc.  has  100%  mineral  rights  on  the  concession  covering  the  Tabuaço Project.

An  exploration  contract  was  signed  on  the  10th  December  of  2007  and  has  a  five  year duration, expiring on the 9th December of 2012.

According to the present mining legislation, the company applied for an experimental mining licence  (EML)  for  the  Armamar-Meda  concession  on  August  14th,  2012.    This  trial  mining licence is similar to that granted to Colt for its 100% controlled Boa Fé gold project in southern Portugal.    It  is  expected  that  the  licence  will  be  granted  by  year  end  2012  at  or  round  the expiration of the exploration contract.  Should the exploration concession expire prior to the granting of an EML, Colt's right to remain the 100% owner of the property is protected by law, having applied for an EML prior to the expiry of the exploration concession.

The geology of Portugal is subdivided into two large domains: the Hesperian Massif and the Epi-Hercynian (Variscan) cover rocks. The Hesperian Massif is itself subdivided into four main tectonic domains which date from the Pre-Cambrian through the Paleozoic:

- · Galicia-Tras-os-Montes Zone (GTMZ);
- · Central Iberian Zone (CIZ);
- · Ossa Moreno Zone (OMZ); and
- · South Portuguese Zone (SPZ).

The Armamar Meda Licence area is situated at the border zone of two major geologic units in the  CIZ  of  northern  Portugal,  namely  the  Hercynian  age  Beiras  granite  batholiths  and  the Douro  Valley  Schist Greywacke  Complex.    The  region  is  noted  for  tungsten  and  tin -occurrences and has seen a number of past artisanal workings.

In  the  Armamar-Meda  Concession  there  are  a  number  of  significant  mineralized  zones mapped as skarn outcrop.  For the purpose of this report and resource estimation, only the

São  Pedro  das  Águias,  Aveleira  and  Quintã  mineralized  zones  lie  within  the  immediate Tabuaço Project area.

At  Tabuaço,  the  geological  model  used  for  exploration  is  best  described  as  a  contact metamorphosed tungsten skarn model. A granite/skarn interface is present with mineralization proximal to the granite boundary.  The tungsten mineral is present as scheelite and occurs as fine  to  coarse  disseminations  within  the  skarn  horizons.    The  Tabuaço  model  is  further complicated by small-scale local post mineralization brittle faulting.

There are two main skarn horizons; the 'upper or main skarn' and the 'lower skarn' separated by schist.  There are also numerous lenses or pods of tungsten bearing skarn material above and  below  the  two  main  horizons  along  with  tungsten-bearing  silicified  lenses within carbonate.

The Tabuaço Tungsten Project is currently an advanced exploration project with a resource estimate  reported  on  QSPA  in  December  2011.    This  report  upgrades  the  initial  reported Mineral Resource statement and the exploration potential in the Tabuaço Project Area.

There are no active mining operations on or near the project other than granite quarries.

An updated Mineral Resource Estimate has been produced by Colt and reviewed by SRK (UK), as presented below;

SRK Mineral Resource Statement for the Tabuaço Project, Portugal, 3 rd October 2012

| Classification               | Tonnage  kt   |   Grade  %  WO3 | Contained  Metal  t WO3   | Contained  Metal  lb WO3   | Contained  Metal  MTU WO3   |
|------------------------------|---------------|-----------------|---------------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Indicated Mineral  Resources | 1,495         |            0.55 | 8,150                     | 18,000,000                 | 815,000                     |
| Inferred Mineral  Resources  | 1,230         |            0.59 | 7,200                     | 16,000,000                 | 720,000                     |

- 1. Mineral Resources are not Mineral Reserves and there is no assurance that any, or all of the Mineral Resources will be converted to Mineral Reserves
- 2. The tonnage, grade and contained metal values have been rounded to reflect the accuracy of the Mineral Resource Estimate.  Numbers may not add due to rounding.
- 3. The  Mineral  Resources  are  stated  above  a  cut-off  grade  of  0.3%WO3,  based  on  an  anticipated  underground  mining  cost  of  USD30/t,  a processing cost of USD22/t, a metallurgical recovery of 80%, and WO3 price of USD300/mtu .realistic mining and processing cost and recovery assumptions

## 1.1 Conclusions

The Tabuaço Project comprises two distinct skarn horizons in close proximity to a granitoid intrusion.    The  Mineral  Resource  Estimate  is  an  update  for  the  project  and  SRK  would anticipate that further exploration will both extend and upgrade this.

There are numerous surface exposures of similar rocks in the region and several of these have already been sampled and shown to carry anomalous tungsten grades .

SRK  considers  the  upgrade  of  the  Mineral  Resource    to  be  an  encouraging  development towards  the  technical  assessment  of  the  mining  project  and  the  eventual  delineation  of Mineral Reserves.

SRK recommends that Colt Resources conduct further drilling at the Tabuaço Project on the Aveleira and Quintã deposits to outline and upgrade resources in these areas and link up with

the current Mineral Resource area at SPA and Aveleira to add to the overall global resource. SRK also recommends that work commences on a Scoping Study or Preliminary Economic Assessment ('PEA') to establish the best methodologies for exploiting the Tabuaço deposit.

## 2.5 Units of Measure

All  currency  amounts  are  stated  in  US  dollars  or  European  Monetary  Units,  or  Euros  (€) unless otherwise specified.  The units of measure presented in this report are metric tonne units (MTU's), which are equal to ten kilogram's per metric tonne and is the standard weight measure of the tungsten metal market.  Tungsten values are reported in percentiles of W and converted from W to WO3  at a factor of 1.2611 as appropriate and necessary.  Density is reported as tonnes per cubic metre.

## 2.6 Declaration

SRK's  opinion  contained  herein  and  effective  3  October,  2012,  is  based  on  information collected by SRK throughout the course of SRK's investigations, which in turn reflect various technical  and  economic  conditions  at  the  time  of  writing.  Given  the  nature  of  the  mining business,  these  conditions  can  change  significantly  over  relatively  short  periods  of  time. Consequently, actual results may be significantly more or less favourable.

SRK has confirmed  that the  MRE  reported  herein  are  within  the  licence  boundaries  given below.  SRK has  not,  however,  conducted  any  legal due  diligence  on  the  ownership  of  the licences themselves.

SRK has not undertaken any detailed investigations into the legal status of the project nor any potential environmental issues and liabilities the project may have at this stage of the Project. SRK has not undertaken any independent check sampling of material from the project during the course of the current investigation.

SRK is not aware of any other information that would materially impact on the findings and conclusions of the report.

## 4 PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION

The  Armamar-Meda  concession  is  situated  in  the  North  Central  region of Portugal, approximately 300 kilometres north north-east of Lisbon, 100 km to the east south-east of Porto and only 25 km to the south-east from Peso da Régua, a local regional centre. There are other small towns in the vicinity, including Armamar, Moimenta da Beira, Penedono, S. João da Pesqueira and Tabuaço.

The  town  of  Meda  is  the  largest  municipality  in  the  immediate  area,  with  Viseu  the  main population  and  district  administrative  centre,  with  several  smaller towns  and  villages  in  the vicinity of the property.

The  'Armamar-Meda'  exploration  area  comprises  two  separate  blocks  which  total  109.20 km 2 ,  The  southernmost  block  is  referred  to  as  the  Meda  block  (Latitude:  40°56'51.45"N, Longitude:  7°16'11.16"W  ) and the northern most area as the São Pedro das Águias block (Latitude: 41° 5'5.27"N, Longitude:  7°30'55.69"W), which contains the Tabuaço Project.

The Tabuaço Project is located approximately three kilometres south of the village of Távora within the district of Viseu, and the Tabuaço municipality. It is located along the western flank of  the  Távora  River,  a  tributary  of  the  Douro  River,  the  main  river  in  the  North  of  Portugal (Figure 4.1).  The project has also historically been referred to as the 'S. Pedro das Águias' skarn deposit.

## 4.1 Mineral Licence Tenure

As previously explained in the 21/12/2011 NI43-101, COLT has 100% mineral rights on the concession  covering  the  Tabuaço  Project,  which  is  included  in  the  exploration  contract granted by the Portuguese Government, under the terms of the Decree-Law 88/90 and 90/90.

The exploration contract was signed on the 10th December of 2007 and expires on the 9th December of 2012. The licence, comprises two distinct areas referred to as the 'Sao Pedro

das Águias' Block and the 'Meda' Block. The boundaries of the two current exploration areas comprise a total of 109.2km  (S. Pedro Águias Block = 4513 hectares; Meda Block = 6407 2 hectares). The licence areas have not changed since the previous 21/12/2012 NI 43-101.

The  coordinates  of  the  licence  areas  are  stated  in  Table  4.1  and  Table  4.2  below;  the coordinates have been converted from Hayford-Gauss (Datum 73) to UTM29T(Datum ED50). Figure 4.2 displays the boundaries of the two licence blocks in the ED50 projection.

## 4.2 Nature and Extent of Issuer's Interest

According to the terms of the exploration contract signed on the 10 th December 2007, 50% of the area was relinquished after the initial period of three years on the 9 th December 2010, and a further 50% of the remainder one year later on 9 th December 2011.

The expenditure commitment required was 25,000 Euros in the first year, 50,000 Euros during the second year, 75,000 Euros during the third year and 100,000 Euros per each one of the remaining contractual years. All expenditures have thus far been exceeded.

## 4.3 Royalties, Agreements and Encumbrances

Under the terms of the exploration contract, any mine registered under it is subject at the sole discretion  of  the  Portuguese  Government,  either  to  pay  a  royalty  of  10%  of  the  net  yearly profits or up to a maximum of 4% of a Net Smelter Return on production, depending on the gold market value, or half of these amounts if other commodities are mined (having gold as a reference).

On granting of an exploitation licence the Company will be obligated to pay €100,000 as a commercial discovery bonus to the Government of Portugal, provided that production from the mining activities is determined to exceed 1,000,000 ounces of gold or of gold equivalent.

The standard corporate tax rate in Portugal is 25% and an additional 2.5% municipality tax is also imposed, for a total corporation tax rate of 27.5%.

## 4.4 Environmental Liabilities and Permitting

SRK has not conducted a detailed review of the environmental liabilities and permitting and is not aware of any existing environmental liabilities on the Tabuaço Project.

## 4.5 Required Permits and Status

The Tabuaço Project is at the resource definition stage, and at this stage is still held as an exploration  licence.  A  mining  licence  or  an  experimental  mining  licence  can  be  obtained during the exploration period by the submission of an application to the relevant authorities.

In  accordance  with  present  mining  legislation,  the  company  applied  for  an  experimental mining  licence  on  14  August  2012.    The  application  included  a  set  of  detailed  documents including:

-  Trade-off  study  -  A  comparative  analysis  of  ore  and  waste  operations  and  transport  for  a 1,000 to 1,500 ton/day operation.  The study compares several different combinations of the ore  treatment  facilities  (surface  and  underground),  as  well  as  their  respective  OPEX  and CAPEX.
-  Experimental  Mine  Plan  -  with  a  description  of  the  selected  mining  method  and  mining sequence, main equipment, basic design of the main mine infrastructures and installations, water  and  electrical  supplies,  tailings  disposal  and  effluents  treatment.  It  also  includes  a description of the mineral deposit.
-  PDA (Environmental  scope  definition)  for  the  EIA.  A  comprehensive  environmental,  socioeconomic, patrimonial and land management study where the most important impacts derived from the proposed mine plan are listed as well as the respective working methodologies. The environmental  agencies  will  study  this  document,  and  when  agreed,  they  will  issue  a document stating the scope and details to be included into the EIA (environmental impact assessment).

## 4.6 Other Significant Factors and Risks

The Tabuaço Project is located within an area of extensive port wine vineyards. Port wine making is an important economic activity for the local communities and they are sensitive to environmental  issues.    COLT  is  currently  the  land  owner  over  the  majority  of  the  QSPA deposit  area  and  thus  far  all  activities  have  been  conducted  in  an  environmentally friendly fashion.

Issues  regarding  land  ownership  on  the  area  designated  for the  process  plant  and  tailings management facility  at  Passa  Frio  are  being  addressed  by  COLT  and  there  is  a  risk  that consensus will not be reached with several landowners.

While the local communities have not as yet shown any resistance to the possibility of a mine at Tabuaço, COLT will need to exercise all due care to ensure that this remains the case and that the communities remain supportive.

## 5 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND PHYSIOGRAPHY

## RESOURCES,

## 5.1 Topography, Elevation and Vegetation

As  described  in  the  21/12/2011  NI  43-101  report,  the  Tabuaço  Project  area  overlooks  the banks of the Távora River and  the topography of the licence area ranges from undulating rolling hills in the south-west to steep peaks and corresponding deep v-shaped valleys in the central,  eastern  and  north  eastern  areas  surrounding  the  project  (Figure  5-1).  Elevations range from +500 m down to +225 m above mean sea level. The vegetation of the project area is a mix of terraced grape vines and orchards, small farming areas, wooded areas and fallow ground.

Figure 5-1

<!-- image -->

View  of  the  Tabuaço  Tungsten  Project,  looking  from  the  east,  (circa 2009).

## 5.2 Accessibility

The Armamar-Meda licence area is immediately accessible through a good network of local roads and is bisected north to south by the national highway N323. The east-west highway N222  is  also  located  12  km  to  the  north  of  the  project  area.  The  project  is  located  at  a distance from the modernised major national highway system but it does have good access to the  main  north-south  road  networks,  in  particular  the  IP2/N102  highway  to  the  east  and A24/IP3  highway  to  the  west.  The  nearest  population  centre  is  the  village  of  Quintã, approximately 1 km to the north with a population of approximately 100 people.

## 5.3 Climate

The  climate  of  Portugal  is  described  as  typically  Mediterranean,  consisting  of  dry  hot summers and temperate wet winters, further detail is in the 21/12/2012 NI 43-101.

The climate of the Tabuaço Project area is distinct from its immediate surrounds, due to the steep valley setting producing a microclimate effect. It can be described best as temperatehumid  with  a  mean  temperature  of  +15°C  and  annual  rainfall  of  approximately  20cm;  the majority of which usually falls during November through to March. Summer temperatures can reach up to 45°C and are usually above 30°C between June and September, with brisk winds to the elevated project areas. Winters in the project area are relatively mild, with infrequent snowfalls on the higher peaks of the region which usually dissipate within a few days.

The lack of any distinct period of high rain or snowfall, together with good site access, means the operating season for exploration and development can therefore suitably be described as year-round.

## 5.4 Sufficiency of surface rights

COLT is the owner of 100% of the surface rights over the Tabuaço (SPA) project area and is on good terms with the majority of the local landowners.  At this stage the surface rights are deemed sufficient for the projects immediate requirements. COLT is currently in negotiations with other land owners regarding acquisition of further surface rights in areas that might be required for development purposes namely at the site for the proposed process and tailings facility.

## 5.5 Infrastructure

The project area is well serviced by the national grid, with a high-voltage 60kVa power line passing immediately adjacent to the project along the N323 highway between Granjinha and Quintã.  The entity responsible for the power infrastructure and main supplier of both base load  and  renewable  power  in  Portugal is  Energias  de  Portugal  ('EDP'), formally  known  as Electricidade de Portugal.

Supply  and  regulation  of  the  drinking  water  and  sewerage  is  controlled  by  the  Water  and Sanitation  Regulation  Agency  Entidade  Reguladora  de  Águas  e  Resíduos  ('ERSAR'). Service provision is shared between the local municipalities and the national water company, Águas de Portugal ('AdP').

Potable  water  is  available  from  the  local  municipal  system  and  the  Távora  river  passes through  the  project licence  area, making it  an  option for  sourcing larger volumes  of  drilling water  subject  to  permitting.    A  further  option  is  pumping  water  from  a  number  of  existing reservoirs which are located close to the project area.

There are  several  populated  towns  in  close  proximity  to  the  operation.   While most  of  the

manual labour force will come from these near-by locations, the majority of the higher skilled labour force will need to be sourced elsewhere in Portugal.

Colt  has  identified  several  areas  in  close  proximity  to  Tabuaço  that  would  be  potentially suitable for locating process facilities, tailings and waste disposal.  The company is involved in discussions designed to acquire one of these areas.

## 6 HISTORY OF THE TABUAÇO PROJECT

During the 1970's, geologists from the Serviço de Fomento Mineiro SFM (mines department) discovered scheelite bearing skarns along the flanks of the Távora River, through geological mapping  and  mineral-light  exploration  (using  short-wave  UV  lamp).  This  work  was  first documented in 1980 by Sousa, Ramos &amp; Viegas. From 1980 to 1982, a joint venture between the Portuguese Sociedade Portuguesa de Empreedimentos ('SPE') and the French Société d'Études de Recherches et d'Exploitations Minières ('SEREM'), the 100% owned exploration arm  of  the  Bureau  de  Recherches  Géologiques  et  Minières  ('BRGM'),  explored  the  area which now includes the Tabuaço Tungsten Project.

There is no record or evidence of any past mining activity to exploit scheelite mineralization at Tabuaço.

## 6.1 Prior Ownership and Ownership Changes

The whole Armamar-Meda (current) Licence was once included in the very large "Alto Douro" exploration concession (Sn-W, Au, etc.) held by the SPE-BRGM consortium in period 19791984.

Part of the Armamar-Meda Licence was once included in Greystar Resources Inc's Penedono exploration  concession  (Au)  during  the  period  1995-1997  and  part  of  the  Armamar-Meda Licence was included in Rio Narcea Gold Mines' first Penedono exploration concession (Au) during the period 1999-2004.

## 6.2 Previous Exploration and Development Results

Tungsten skarns were first discovered at the Tabuaço Project area by Government geologists in the 1970's during geological fieldwork and UV light prospecting. Further exploration of the Tabuaço  Project  area  was  completed  in  the  1980's  by  a  consortium  of  the  Portuguese companies (SPE) and the BRGM (through its subsidiary SEREM) with work focused on São Pedro das Águias, Quinta das Herédias, Quintã and Quinta do Paço.

A copy of the detailed exploration  data  was  obtained  directly from  SPE's  project  geologist Paulo Alves.  This was compiled into a report by Filipe Faria of GeoLog on behalf of COLT.

The initial phase of the SPE-SEREM exploration work conducted during 1980-1981 focused on  regional  mapping,  ultra  violet  (UV)  lamp  prospecting,  grab  sampling,  channel  rock sampling and stream sediment and soil sampling programmes.

The bulk of the work was conducted on the São Pedro das Águias prospect where vegetation was removed to allow for the extensive sampling of the exposed skarn outcrop in the northern

and southern boundaries.  The northern skarn was sampled through two channels, 16.70m long and 15.50m long, with weighted averages of 0.67% and 0.56% W and 0.086% Sn.  The southern skarn samples returned assay results of 0.10% to 0.55% W, with roughly 0.05% Sn.

At Quintã exploration was limited due to a tin mining concession covering the area at the time (now  expired).    Exploration  results  located  a  number  of  skarn  outcrops,  with  initial  results reported to range from 0.17% to 0.76% tungsten.

Initial drilling at the Tabuaço Project comprised a total of six diamond drill holes to determine the geometry, structure and grade of these scheelite rich skarns and were completed during the 1981-1982 seasons by a local contractor (Teixeira Duarte), Table 6 1 and Table 6 2. This contractor  was  not  a  mineral  exploration  driller,  and  core  recoveries  were  poor,  reportedly averaging 76%.

Holes S1 and S2 indicated the presence of an upper carbonate and a lower skarn horizon dipping  sub-horizontally,  with  mineralization  concentrated  within  the  skarn  horizon.    The northernmost  drilled  hole,  S9,  was  thought  to  represent  the  central  area  of  the  deposit, intersecting 19.35m of mineralization reported at 1.18% WO3, although no further drilling was carried out at the time to confirm this theory.

Laboratory  analysis  on  the  samples  from  the  SPE-SEREM  exploration  programme  were conducted at SFM's (now LNEG) laboratory at S.Mamede de Infesta, near Porto.  Analysis was completed using X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (XRF), reporting results in ppm W and ppm  Sn  with  manual  conversion  of  these  results  to  %  WO3  and  %  Sn.    Neither  of  the conversion formulae used to calculate the % WO3 or % Sn is known.  The suitability of the laboratory, equipment or sample preparation methods used in the SPE-SEREM exploration is also unverifiable; however XRF  is a currently accepted analytical method  for such mineralisation.

Check analyses were conducted by the BRGM laboratory in Orleans, France, reportedly with positive matches.

A systematic effort  was  carried  out  by  COLT  in  the  early  stages  of  its  exploration  work  at Tabuaço with a view to locate the historical drill core from the SPE-SEREM programme The

historical drill  core  could  not  be found at any of the Government core storage facilities and therefore it has not been possible to confirm the tungsten grades reported by means of core re-sampling.

Colt has referred to this historical data when positioning drillholes etc., but has not relied upon or included these historical results in any Mineral Resource estimation work.

## 6.3 Historical Mineral Resource and Reserve Estimates

The reported historical 'resource' and 'reserve' inventories cannot be considered a mineral resource or a mineral reserve under CIM guidelines as economic parameters used to derive the  estimates  do  not  reflect  accurately  the  current  economics  of  exploiting  this  deposit. Furthermore, procedures and data used have not been reviewed and verified by a Qualified Person and therefore cannot be classified as a Mineral Resource under Canadian Securities Administrators NI 43-101 guidelines.  In all cases, insufficient documentation exists that would allow SRK to classify historic reserve and resource estimates into the categories as currently defined  by  CIM  guidelines.    These  historic  estimates  should  be  considered  unclassified mineralized material.

Previous work by SPE-SEREM  estimated, a non-compliant, geological resource of approximately 1 million tons of scheelite skarn mineralization in stratiform horizons, grading 0.87% WO3.

## 6.4 Historical Production

Production  in  the  immediate  Tabuaço  area  has  not  been  recorded  in  modern  literature. However during the Second World War and until the 1960's there was some minor mining activity along the Távora River, mainly to recover cassiterite from the sediments and also from small galleries on narrow vein deposits on the right flank of the Távora River, north of Ponte do Fumo, but no production figures are available.

## 7 GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND MINERALISATION

## 7.1 Regional Geology

The geology of Portugal is subdivided into two large domains: the Hesperian Massif and the Epi-Hercynian (Variscan) cover rocks. The Hesperian Massif is itself subdivided into four main tectonic domains (Figure 7-1), which date from the Pre-Cambrian through the Paleozoic:

-  Galicia - Tras-os-Montes Zone;
-  Central Iberian Zone;
-  Ossa Morena Zone; and
-  South Portuguese Zone.

The Galicia - Tras-os-Montes Zone (GTMZ) occurs in the north-west corner of the country and is  characterised  by  the  mafic  and  ultramafic  Bragança  and  Morais  massifs.  The  rocks surrounding the massifs are mainly Silurian and represented by acid and basic volcanic rocks, which are thrust against the massifs. Alkali and porphyritic granites also occur.

The  Central  Iberian  Zone  (CIZ) is characterised  by  the  predominance  of  schists  and greywackes  with  minor  carbonates  representing  metamorphosed  flysch-type  rocks  dating from the Cambrian and Late Precambrian. There are also large areas of alkali and calc-alkali granites and granodiorites.

The  Ossa-Morena  Zone  (OMZ) is  a  complex  and  diverse  domain,  with  a  stratigraphic sequence  that  goes  from  the  Precambrian  through  Cambrian  and  Silurian  and  ends  with flysch units in the Devonian. The contact with the CIZ is a regional tectonic feature known as the Tomar-Cordoba Shear Zone.

The north-eastern sector of the OMZ has a preponderance of calc-alkali intrusives, which are also found in the north and centre of the zone. Magmatic rocks become more basic towards the south, where gabbros, diorites and anorthosites occur in the Beja ophiolite complex, as well  as  the  granites,  granodiorites  and  tonalities  of  the  Évora  massif.  The  Beja  Ophiolite Complex, which represents a piece of oceanic crust thrust up during the Variscan orogeny inter alia lies close to the contact with the South Portuguese Zone.

The  South  Portuguese  Zone  (SPZ) is characterised by a Late Devonian -Early Carboniferous volcano-sedimentary complex, which is overlain by the Culm flysch sequence (Mid-Late  Carboniferous).  These  rocks  are  all  underlain  by  the  Pulo  do  Lobo  Formation, comprising phyllites, quartzites and occasional acid and basic volcanics.  The contact of the South Portuguese Zone (SPZ) with the Ossa Morena is the Ferreira-Ficalho thrust.

The acid volcanics in the SPZ are associated with the massive polymetallic sulphides of the Iberian Pyrite Belt, which hosts the Aljustrel and Neves Corvo mines.

Finally, the Epi-Hercynian (Variscan) cover rocks include the Mesozoic-Cenozoic sedimentary units (limestones, clays and sandstones) of the south and west of Portugal and the Tertiary detrital basins of the Tagus (Tejo) and Sado Rivers.

The Tabuaço Tungsten Project is located within a segment of the CIZ in northern Portugal, see Figure 7 1 below.

## 7.2 Local Geology

The Armamar Meda Licence area is situated at the border zone of two major geologic units in the CIZ of northern Portugal, namely the Variscan age Beiras granite batholiths and the Douro Valley Schist Greywacke Complex - 'SGC' (Faria, 2008), also referred to as the 'Beira Schist -Complex' (Figure 7.2). The latter, of lower Cambrian age, comprises several formations that include shale, schist, siltstone, sandstone and greywacke, with subordinate conglomerate and carbonate beds. These rocks were folded and undergone low-grade regional metamorphism during the Variscan orogenic cycle (Upper Paleozoic). Intrusion of several successive granite plutons  also  took  place  during  the  Variscan  cycle,  since  pre-tectonic  till  late-tectonic  times, originating significant contact metamorphic haloes in the enclosing metasediments.

The lower part of the SGC, the Bateiras Formation, is characterized by a basal unit of black graphitic schist overlain by grey biotite schist with some carbonate beds intercalated. These lithologies  normally  outcrop  only  at  the lowest  portions  of  the  river valleys,  where  the  core zones  of  anticlines  are  exposed  by  erosion.  Outcropping  rocks  in  the  region  comprise  as follows;

-  Schistose  Unit : -black  and  grey  schist  and  phyllite,  locally  containing  minor intercalated calc silicate. -
-  Limestone Facies : -series of banded, grey green to bluish crystalline limestone and -calc schist consisting of alternating thin layers of crystalline carbonate and meta pelite  that  have  undergone  greenschist-facies  metamorphism.  Also  includes -local  calc silicate  and  skarn  horizons.  Mineralogy  consists  of  plagioclase  feldspar, -quartz, calcite, garnet and vesuvianite.
-  Skarn : a much more developed metamorphic/metasomatic formation than the above unit with amphibolite facies  metamorphism.  Represents  a  series  between  'dry' -hornfels with spotty amphibole at granite contacts to retrograde garnet-diopside skarn in  proximity to  limestone. Whitish  to  dark  greenish  colour  and  consisting  of  quartz, garnet, hornblende, epidote group minerals, vesuvianite, calcite and fluorite. -
-  Granite : -medium grained 'two mica' and 'muscovite' granites; the latter forms a rim --around the largest intrusion of the 'two-mica granite', and is often tourmalinized and with feldspars often transformed to damourite, a greenish variety of muscovite.
-  Aplite -Pegmatite Sills  and  rare  quartz veins: -alteration  of  the  aplite  results  in  a greenish, finer grained muscovite bearing (± damourite) often tourmalinized rock. -

The  Schist-Greywacke  Complex  lithlogies  are  in  contact  with  the  Armamar-Tabuaço granite  batholith  within  the  Tabuaço  Project  area.   This  contact  is  associated  with  the Távora anticline,  which  hosts  graphitic  schist  at  its  core,  overlain  by  biotite  schist  with skarn  and  carbonate  horizons.  Metasomatism  of  the  carbonates  is  thought  to  have produced  the  quartz-garnet-amphibole-pyroxene  skarns  that  host  the  target  tungsten mineralization

## 7.3 Property Geology

The landscape on the property shows a striking contrast between pine forestry developed on granite  upper  slopes  of  the  valley  to  the  vineyards  and  olive  trees  which  are  exclusively developed on schist. The local property geology is displayed in Figure 7.3.

## 7.3.1 Sao Pedro das Águias

The  Tabuaço  (Sao  Pedro  das  Águias)  deposit  is  located  at  the  contact  of  the  ArmamarTabuaço granitic intrusion and schist of the 'SGC' on the western limb of the Távora anticline

The  granite  is  typical  late-stage  fractionated  S-Type  with  coarse  equigranular  texture.  The mineralogy consists of  feldspar,  quartz,  muscovite  and  biotite.  Tourmaline  is  observable  in hand  specimen  as  black  acicular  laths.  Finer  grained  'sericitization'  of  plagioclase  is damourite rather  than  sericite  -  potassium-enriched muscovite  which  gives  a  green  to  lilac hue.    The  body  of  the  granite  is  homogeneous  but  becomes  more  complicated  near  the contact with the schist. In places there is some evidence for chilling with  1-3m of speckled rhyolitic rock. In other parts of the intrusion the contact is tectonic.  Aplite dykes and sills also stream  off  from  the  granite.  The  contact  zone  can  be  considered  as  asymmetrical  with  a relatively narrow unmineralized endocontact and a wider exocontact zone over several, even 10's  of  metres  depending  on  the  steepness  of  the  contact.    Drilling  in  the  northern  and western    part  of  the  Tabuaço  deposit  where  several  holes  have  intersected  schist  below granite  reveal  a  shallow  dip  of  25-30°  south-west  in  line  with  the  dip  of  schistosity  in  the country rock.

The  country  rock  of  the  'SGC'  as  described  by  Faria  (2008)  comprises  hangingwall  and intermediate  layers  to  mineralisation  of  biotite  and  chloritic  schist  and  phyllite.  Secondary mineralisation  includes  lenses  and  bands  of  silica  and  calc  silicate  minerals  (commonly epidote)  and  occasionally  calcite.  Where  calc  silicate  banding  becomes  interlayered  the lithology is logged as a separate laminated pelitic calc silicate or calc schist type.

The  footwall to mineralisation tends to be marked  by  the  presence  of  fine-grained homogeneous  black  chloritic  schist  with  graphite,  pyrite  of  diagenetic  origin  on  cleavage planes  and  is  largely  devoid  of  calc  silicate  minerals,  and  unaffected  by  hydrothermal alteration.

The carbonate facies are all affected by alteration to some degree so the original protolith is difficult to ascertain. Colloform silica banding is occasionally well developed and mineralised which may suggest that stromatolites may have been present and thus the carbonate may represent a persistent block of impure reef limestone with cycles of thin limestone and marl underneath.  This  environment  with  the  presence  of  silica  impurities  within  makes  a  fertile environment for skarnification.

There  are  three  main  units  containing  tungsten  mineralisation  that  attain  thicknesses  of several metres and have a close generic relationship:

-  Upper Carbonate Horizon (UCH)
-  Main Skarn Zone (MZ)
-  Lower Skarn Zone (LZ)

The UCH is classified separately from the skarn as tungsten is associated with sub-massive blocky limestone with strong silica banding.

The MZ is characterized by a greyish white rock with a bluish-pink hue that is blocky or with a

weakly banded texture with spotty black porphyroblasts (Figure 7.4). The LZ shows classic pink and green banding characteristic of contact metamorphosed rocks and skarn resulting from  contrast  between  pink/red  prograde  mineral  assemblage  and  the  green  retrograde mineral assemblage (Figure 7.5). Detail on the mineralogy will be discussed in Section 7.5 below.

The distribution of MZ to LZ is not always regular; the two units occasionally juxtapose and separate into several layers, this is particularly evident within the LZ . There are discontinuous lenses of both types in the intermediate schist. This classification has, however, provided a good framework on which to build the geological model as explained in Section 8.

## 7.3.2 Aveleira

This  area  is  located  around  700  m  Northwest  of  the  Tabuaço  deposit  (SPA),  and  hosts significant,  non-outcropping  tungsten  bearing  skarn  beds  which  were  not  discovered  until January 2012, when Colt drill tested soil geochemical anomalies.

Although the detail geologic knowledge of this new hidden tungsten deposit requires further drilling, it is  already  known that it bears striking similarities with the SPA deposit. As in the latter,  two  main  tungsten-bearing  skarn  horizons  of  metric  thicknesses  have  already  been recognised,  enclosed  in  a  biotite  schist  sequence  near  to  the  contact  with  the  ArmamarTabuaço granitic intrusion. The skarn horizons also appear to be gently dipping to the WestSouthwest.

## 7.3.3 Quintã and Quintã-Távora zones

The Quintã and Quintã-Távora zones are located 1.1km northwest of the Tabuaço deposit (SPA) and have not been drilled at this time but are a high priority drilling target.

The skarn bedding in the main part of this outcrop is sub-horizontal and gently dips to the Northwest. It is understood to be located at the very crest zone of the Távora anticline not far from the contact with the Armamar-Tabuaço  granite intrusion. Typically, outcrop is discontinuous making it difficult to see whether there is one or two skarn horizons present.

Taking  into  consideration  the  structural  knowledge  acquired  in  the  Tabuaço  and  Aveleira areas, the Quintã and the Quintã-Távora zone are interpreted as having the potential to host additional hidden tungsten-bearing skarn deposits.

## 7.4 Structure

The major structure of the Tabuaço Project area is dominated by two deformational events. A D1 event attributable to regional metamorphism is shown by tight chevron and drag folding in schist and also marly limestone of the UCH. The D2 event produces mesoscale folding not observable in core on an amplitude of 10s of metres. This event is responsible for the Távora Anticline trending NW-SE on the western side of the Távora River which is exposed near the 'Ponte de Fumo' Bridge and a regional Hercynian trend. Conjugate to this antiform at QSPAHerédias is an open synform which produces a SW dipping bowl-shaped structure in 3D on the skarn and carbonate horizons.

Two sets of brittle faults are important. A brittle north-west to south-east fault, FLT1, which is broadly parallel to the Távora Anticline axis. The 2nd set  which has also  been modelled is orientated  perpendicular  to  FLT1  and  appears  to  cross-cut  in  a  NE-SW  to  NNE-SSW direction. The mapped upper and lower skarn outcrops at QSPA are notably separated from the Quinta das Herédias skarn outcrops to the south by a major strike-slip fault, which has been mapped from surface.

Displacement  on  these  fault  sets  appears  to  be  in  the  order  of  a  few  metres  in  terms  of offsetting  mineralisation  but  the  pattern  may  be  more  complicated  near  the  contact  of  the main  granite  body  where  there  is  less  evidence  from  drilling.  Several  fault  zones  may  be stacked here  with  'screens'  of  granite  (allochthonous  blocks  and  lenses  detached  from the main intrusion) in between the faults.

Originally the north-south fault was considered to limit the mineralisation to the south-west of QSPA but subsequent drilling from the 2012 campaign has shown this not to be the case. The reason here may be due to a steepening of the granite contact and more limited range of hot hydrothermal fluids emanating from the granite rather than this particular structure.

At Aveleira and Quintã the influence of FLT2 set is apparent as it downthrows the lithology several metres to the south between Quintã and Aveleira.

## 7.5 Mineralisation

The Tabuaço region is noted for tungsten and tin occurrences, and has seen a number of past artisanal workings.

In the Armamar-Meda Concession, there are numerous skarn outcrops that are mapped as being mineralised. For the purpose of this report and resource estimation, only the Tabuaço and Aveleira mineralized zones lie within the immediate resource area. Quinta das Herédias, Quintã,  Quintã-Távora  and  the  'gap'  area  between  Aveleira  and  Tabuaço  are  outside  the immediate resource area but considered as exploration targets to the north and north-west and  still  within  the  Tabuaço  Project  area  (see  Figure  7  2).    The  Tabuaço  and  Aveleira deposits  contain  the  most  significant  known  tungsten  mineralization  of  the  Tabuaço  area. Mineralogical studies to date have been concentrated on the Tabuaço deposit area.

The skarn mineral assemblage comprises scheelite with epidote group minerals (epidote+zoisite+clinozoisite),  albite  plagioclase,  grossular  garnet  and  calcite.  Also  in  the gangue  vesuvianite,  k-feldspar,  fluorite,  apatite,  muscovite  and  quartz.  Sulphides  were identified under reflected light in trace amounts, namely pyrite, chalcopyrite and arsenopyrite.

In the Main Zone the granoblastic grey-bluish banded texture is due to the presence of albite + vesuvianite + sericite+fluorite ± scheelite. Sericite occurs from the breakdown of scapolite and plagioclase. High grades of tungsten occur in this zone as demonstrated under UV light in Figure 7.6 and 7.7.

The Lower Zone is less albitic but still contains some plagioclase; instead K-feldspar is more prominent  giving  the  pinkish  banding.  Green  banding  is  caused  by  the  presence  of  calcsilicate minerals principally by epidote group minerals, vesuvianite and Ca-pyroxene (diopside) with minor scapolite and grossular garnet.  Black speckling is due to porphyroblasts of amphibole or biotite.

Lane  (2011)  investigated  the  mineralogy  of  a  sample  of  concentrate  derived  by  gravity separation  using  heavy  liquids  which  was  originally  taken  from  skarn  at  outcrop  (refer  to Section 13). The relative abundance of minerals screened at 425microns is shown in Table 7.1

The skarn mineralised zones host virtually no sulphide mineralisation nor any molybdenum. Powellite, with Mo replacing for W in scheelite, has been recognised under UV light (glows yellow rather than blue) but has not been seen in significant quantities to affect processing. Apart from the presence of fluorite the assemblage is favourable for both mineral processing and having few deleterious elements (e.g. sulphide) to impact on the environment.

## 8 DEPOSIT TYPE

Mineral  deposits  within  the  Armamar  Meda  licence  and  surrounding  area  include  skarn tungsten, tin &amp; tungsten bearing veins and orogenic gold. The Tabuaço Project is considered a skarn Tungsten deposit.

Tungsten  skarns  are  one  of  seven  types  of  skarn  deposits  that  comprise  an  economically significant class of mineral deposits and which account for the majority of tungsten produced worldwide.  This  classification  is  documented  by  Ray  and  Webster  (1991).  As  with  most skarns,  deposits  form  in  'reactive'  rocks  such  as  calcareous  sediments  and/or  volcanics. Skarns  form  by  regional  or  contact  metamorphism,  the  latter  being  the  more  common geologic model. In these settings intrusive rocks are often nearby and often provide the heat source for the hydrothermal activity that alters the host lithologies and introduces mineralization.

The term skarn is an old Swedish mining term originally used to describe a type of silicate gangue, however in modern usage the term "skarn" has been expanded to refer to calciumbearing silicates In the USA the term "tactite" is often used synonymously with skarn.

Skarns and tactites are most often formed at the contact zone between intrusions of granitic magma  bodies  in  contact  with  carbonate  sedimentary  rocks,  where  hydrothermal  fluids derived from the granitic magma are rich in silica, iron, aluminium, and magnesium. These fluids  mix in  the  contact  zone,  dissolve  calcium-rich carbonate  rocks,  and  convert  the  host carbonate rock to skarn deposits in a metamorphic process known as "metasomatism". The resulting  metamorphic  rock  may  consist  of  a  very  wide  variety  of  mineral  assemblages dependent  largely  on  the  original  composition  of  the  magmatic  fluids  and  the  purity  of  the carbonate sedimentary rocks.

The  actual  ore-bearing  mineral  containing  the  tungsten  at  Tabuaço  is  scheelite,  a  calcium tungstate mineral (CaWO4).  Pure scheelite fluoresces bright blue under shortwave ultra violet light.

## 8.1 Geological Model

At  Tabuaço  the  geological  model  used  for  exploration  is  best  described  as  a  contact metamorphosed tungsten skarn model. The key considerations for paragenesis of scheelite mineralisation are:

-  Proximity to granite intrusion and related aplite dykes and sills;
-  Circulation of hot fluids about the granite and dykes and interaction with cooler meteoric water in the country rock;
-  Chemistry of the country rock and amenabilty to chemical reaction with hydrothermal fluids and metasomatism.

There  is  no  clear  correlation  between  tungsten  mineralisation  and  proximity  to  the  granite contact - i.e. higher grades in the exocontact nearest the intrusive body itself. Ordinarily the heat  gradient falls  away  fairly  quickly from the  contact  within  20-30 metres.  Conversely  as contact metamorphism is a relatively localised  effect the  model  needs  to  address  how  the skarn mineralisation is extended for several 10's of meters and sometimes over 100 metres away from the main granite body.

Good skarn development is propagated by successive intrusive events. Pulses of magma and sheeting of dykes recharges the heat flow and creates a reflux effect whereby cooler sinking fluids are replaced by hotter rising ones. The morphology of the granite contact can also have an important bearing on mineralisation. The laccolith  shape of the granite in the centre and north  of  QSPA  may  have  created  a  barrier  trapping  fluids  enabling  enough  time  for  the creation of a thick zone of metasomatism - hence greater skarn development and tungsten mineralisation  where  the  granite  contact  is  shallow.  Figure  8.1  shows  a  very  simplified representation of such a paragenesis.

Figure 8-1 Simplified paragenesis to explain the formation of skarn at QSPA.

<!-- image -->

The chemical composition and impurities within limestone and amenability of limestone and other  calcium  rich  strata  also  has  a  bearing  on  skarn  development.  The  impure  reefal limestone responsible for the UCH and MZ is persistent and probably stretches for several kms  but  high  grade  tungsten  occurs  where  there  is  low  magnesium  and  silica  present. Mineralisation  in  UCH  in  particular  may  be  due  to  the  local  occurrence  of  silica  replacing fossils/stromatolite.  The  LZ  may  be  formed  from  metasomatism  of  several  thin  band  of limestone and calcareous marl below the reefal limestone. Stacking of several layers gives a high surface for fluids to react over.

## 9 EXPLORATION

After  acquisition  of  the  exploration  licence  and  an  assessment  of  the  available  data,  Colt began field exploration on the Tabuaço project in 2008.

Initially these activities focused on prospecting, mapping and collection of rock chip samples, to establish the full surface extent of the mineralised zone. Ultraviolet lamp prospecting has also been conducted on the scheelite during a number of night time field visits.  Results of this prospecting  continued  to  be  favourable  leading  to  the  initiation  of  diamond  drilling  in November 2009.

## 10  DRILLING

The current exploration area is focussed on showings of scheelite mineralization or hidden deposits  outside  of  the  Tabuaço  (SPA)  deposit  resource  area  which  includes  Quinta  da Aveleira, Quintã, Quintã-Távora and the 'gap' area between Aveleira and SPA.

Prospecting  holes  were  planned  to  test  the  newly  discovered  soil  geochemical  anomalies resulting  from  the  survey  completed  in  November  2011  (see  Section  9.1  below).  The  first scout diamond drill hole completed in February 2012 led to the discovery of the Aveleira skarn tungsten deposit.  Since then and up to October 5, 2012, a total of 16 diamond drill holes for a total of 1278.27 metres have been completed using mobile APAFOR™ 400 series rigs on the Aveleira deposit as well as the gap between the latter and the SPA deposit. The APAFOR™ rig is a small but powerful conventional coring rig designed for ground investigation work but adapted  to  negotiating  vines  and  narrow  terraces.  The  majority  of  these  holes  intersected tungsten-bearing skarn beds with thickness of several metres.

At Aveleira the results of prospect drilling to date confirm the extension of the skarn tungsten deposit for a strike length of at least 200 metres in the north-west south east direction (see Figure  7-3  and  Figure  9-1).  Step-out  drilling  has  already  been  initiated  across  strike  to determine the lateral extent of the deposit, which is thought to dip gently into the mountain and underneath the granite outcrop, in style similar to Tabuaço (São Pedro das Águias).

In order to fast track towards the delineation of an inferred resource for the Aveleira deposit, a 75 m x 75 m drill grid was planned comprising an additional 13 diamond drillholes adding up to a total of 1620 m, of which 4-6 holes are already completed totalling 436 m.

A drilling programme of 9 short vertical holes was also planned to follow up on additional soil geochemical  anomalies  in  the  Tabuaço-Aveleira  gap;  6  of  these  holes  have  already  been completed,  of  which  4  intersected  skarn  tungsten  mineralisation  whereas  2  were  barren. Additional drilling is currently being planned for this gap which seems to be prospective for blind tungsten mineralization.

## 10.1  Surveys and Investigations

All  drillholes  were  surveyed  at  the  collar  surface  by  the  responsible  geologist,  using  a handheld GPS. Data for Eastings, Northings and RL was recorded in UTM 29T, Datum ED50.

A high resolution topographic survey was conducted in 2010 by survey contractors 'Superfície Topographia Lda' of Porto, leading to a 2m resolution digital terrain model.  Holes DHT01DHT09 were also accurately surveyed during this work. The topographic survey has enabled the continued use of handheld GPS' units for collar locations, as data can be draped on to the topographic surface and corrected.

The  topographic  survey  was  updated  in  August  2012  by  survey  contractors  'Superfície Topographia  Lda'  of  Porto.  The  DTM  was  updated  using  photogrammetric  methods  and remote sensing imagery. Drillhole collars for the current 2012 campaign were captured using a  portable  DGPS  using  a  central  radio  beacon  for  reference.    Data  was  presented  by Superfície in both ED50 and WGS84 format which is currently being processed and verified by  Colt before  converting  the  database  from  ED50  to  WGS84  datum.  The  updated coordinates  in  ED50  datum  incorporating  this  survey  were  used  in  the  Mineral  Resource Estimation.

Exploration  work  done  beyond  the  Tabuaço  (SPA)  deposit  aimed  at  locating  additional tungsten-bearing skarn deposits and included: geologic prospecting and rock sampling; nighttime  'Mineralight' (UV-lamp)  prospecting;  a  soil  geochemical  survey;  and  finally  scout diamond drilling.

Geologic prospecting led to the discovery of skarn float at Aveleira as well as skarn outcrops at  Quintã.  Follow-up  rock  grab  and  chip  sampling  confirmed  the  presence  of  tungsten (scheelite) mineralization in most of these rock units.

'Mineralight'  UV  light  prospecting  was  conducted  particularly  along  the  West  bank  of  the Távora  to  the  Northwest  of  the  SPA  deposit.  This  lead  to  the  discovery  of  several  areas containing (fluorescing) scheelite mineral debris in the soil or in mineralized float spread from

the São Pedro das Águias farm through the Aveleira farm.

In  order  to  help  in  the  location  of  likely  blind  tungsten  deposits,  a  multi-element  soil geochemical survey was undertaken by Colt along the West bank of the Távora. Firstly, two pilot soil traverses comprising a total of 54 soil samples were sampled at 10m intervals across the  São  Pedro  das  Águias  deposit  outcrop,  in  order  to  provide  indicative  evidence  with regards to the geochemical signature of the tungsten skarns in this particular area. Following this a soil geochemical survey was carried out to the NW of the deposit throughout the São Pedro das Águias and Aveleira farms. This comprised a total of 293 samples collected from 10m  intervals  along  a  total  of  seven  100m  spaced  traverses.  This  survey  lead  to  the identification of a  number  of  geochemical  anomalies  containing  elements  indicative  of tungsten skarns, namely W, Ca, Mg, Mn, Ti, etc.

## 10.2  Sampling Methods and Quality

The following field methods have been applied to the multiple sampling programs undertaken in COLT's fieldwork, in every case executed by COLT's own field staff and under supervision of experienced senior personnel:

Soil sampling sites along planned traverses were defined in advance by a senior geologist prior  to  the  fieldwork  based  on  both  topographic  and  geologic  mapping.  Location  of  the sampling sites in the field was done  with the aid of a hand-held GPS with some minor site adjustments  being  occasionally  necessary  due  to  various  obstacles  (e.g.  vineyards,  steep terracing, stream crossings etc.).

The samples collected from each grid location were sieved on-site through a 2 mm sieve prior to  bagging  in  order  to  avoid  inclusion  of  gravel  the  sieve  was  cleaned  with  a  thick  brush between each pair of samples. Samples weighing between 500g and 700g  were taken from each site for shipment to the laboratory; these samples  were bagged in plastic bags  which included a tag with the sample number inside the bag as well as the same number written in water-proof ink on the outside of the bag. The collection and sieving of the samples in the field as well as their packing and shipment to the laboratory was done by company local helpers under the supervision of a senior field assistant.

The  selection  of  the  areas  for  'hammer'  prospecting  and  rock  sampling  work  has  been planned  by  COLT's  senior  geological  personnel  based  on  geological,  geochemical  and mineral occurrence data. Rock samples taken during 'hammer' prospecting are meant only to determine whether a prospective tungsten-mineralized lithology (e.g. scheelite or cassiterite bearing skarn) yields any anomalous tin/tungsten values and not to try and determine average grades for a specific rock unit over a specific width. Where a number of float blocks are found spread over a restricted area, a composite float sample is taken from several blocks for the sake of statistics but this must also be considered as a grab sample. The rock samples are bagged for shipment to the laboratory inside plastic bags which include a tag with the sample number inside the bag as well as the same number written on the outside of the bag in both cases in water-proof ink.

Drill core has been sampled on site by COLT staff, the procedure for which is described in Section 10 of this report.

To check for contamination during sample preparation blanks were prepared on site by the Colt technicians from known barren material (granite) and inserted at a rate of 1 per every 50

samples into the sample stream.

Certified Standards used by COLT for the 2012 season are W104 (0.202% tungsten)/ W105 (1.40% tungsten)/W106 (2.16% tungsten)/W108 (0.72% tungsten) and were inserted at a rate of 1 per 50 samples into the sample stream.  All Certified Standards have been prepared and supplied by WCM Minerals, and Certificates of Analysis are shown in Appendix A.

COLT has compiled  and  analysed  Quality  Assurance  and  Quality  Control  (QA/QC)  on  the submitted samples, blanks and  standards  which have been subject to audit by SRK.  Any samples  from  the  returned  assays  that  varied  from  the  expected  values  by  more  than  1 standard  deviation  were  investigated  further  before  acceptance  into,  or  rejection  from,  the final dataset.  It is SRK's opinion, based on QA/QC program results that the obtained assays are representative of the deposit.  The graphs reported support the conclusion of no bias in the  laboratory  results,  and  consequently,  SRK  has  full  confidence  that  the  samples  in  the assays database are representative of the deposit.

Since  starting  the  exploration  drilling  programme  at  São  Pedro  das  Águias  (SPA)  in November 2009, COLT has drilled 66 drillholes as of August 31, 2012, completing a total of 7,708 meters of diamond drilling across the Tabuaço Project area.

Four  diamond  drilling  campaigns  have  been  conducted  on  the  Tabuaço  Tungsten  project area. The first was conducted by SPE SEREM in the early 1980's and comprised six diamond drill holes labelled S1-S4, S6 and S9. This campaign was sufficient to prove the existence of scheelite bearing skarn horizons over the area but recoveries were poor thus none of the data has been utilised in a quantitative manner by COLT.

The second campaign was conducted by COLT in 2009-2010, primarily to verify the extent and levels of tungsten mineralisation quoted in the historical literature.  A total of 9 diamond drillholes were drilled totalling some 815 m, and labelled DHT01B-DHT09.

The  third  campaign  also  conducted  by  COLT  between  November  2010  and  11th  October 2011  was  conducted  to  establish  a  Mineral  Resource  Estimate  (MRE)  for  Tabuaço  and comprised 23 diamond drillholes for 2661.54 m and labelled DHT10-DHT33 (but not including DHT-31 and DHT-32).  The resultant MRE can be seen in the 21/12/2011 NI43-101.

The fourth  and  current  diamond  drilling  campaign  was  again  conducted  by  COLT  between November 2011 and 31st August 2012. The reasons for this campaign were to:

-  Close off and delimit the extent of mineralisation at the QSPA resource area;
-  Upgrade  the  Inferred  resource  area  estimated  in  the  previous  Mineral  Resource Estimate  of  December  2011.  To  this  effect  no  drillholes  were  planned  within  the Indicated Resource  area outlined by SRK for this estimate between sections 1075N and 1200N;
-  Produce drill core sample for bench-level metallurgical testwork, and;
-  Verify and outline the extent of mineralisation in Quinta de Aveleira and the gap area between Aveleira and QSPA.

Details  of  the  current  campaign  are  shown  in  Table 10-1  below.  The  drillholes  used  in  the current  MRE are listed  and  illustrated  in Error!  Reference source not found. and  Figure 10-2  below.  Drilling  has  generally  been  planned  and  executed  using  a  grid  with  spacings ranging from 50m x 25m to 25 m x 25 m.

Exploration drilling is still ongoing outside the resource definition area, and does not form part

of this report or the associated MRE.

## 10.3  Type and Extents

Due to the terrain and the extent of vineyard terracing, low impact access was required along with  small,  manoeuvrable  rigs.  Thus  diamond  drilling  services  have  been  provided  by  a number of drilling contractors but there has been a trade off using the smaller rigs with lower power of the machines and hence slower rate of penetration, particularly with inclined holes below 100m depth.

Companies contracted for the current round of drilling at Tabuaço include LNEG (Laboratório Nacional de Energia e Geologia, I.P.), Geoplano, CGS Ingenierá and Betoteste.  Rigs were utilised during the project as follows;

-  Betoteste rig#1 (OXIDRILL): on site from 17 January 2012 to present;
-  Betoteste #2 (SCHRAMM): Percussion rig on site from March 2012 to April 2012 to precollar metallurgical holes and one vertical evaluation hole;
-  LNEG rig #1 (RIESKA): on site 21 November 2011 to 12 April 2012;
-  CGS drill rig (ACKER): on site from 17 March 2012 to 20 April 2012 and again from 19 July 2012 to present;
-  Geoplano rig #1 (MUSTANG): on site from 17 January 2012 to 16 June 2012;
-  Geoplano rig#2 (APAFOR): on site from 17 January 2012 to 7 July 2012;
-  Geoplano rig#3 (APAFOR): on site from 7 March 2012 to 25 June 2012.

The APAFOR™ rigs drill conventional HQ (63.5mm ø) vertical holes only, the remainder have wireline  capability  and  are  capable  of  drilling  holes  inclined  to  45 .  Evaluation  holes  were o nominally  drilled  HQ  reducing  to  NQ  (47.6mm  ø)  as  a  last  resort  to  advance  the  hole  in difficult  ground.  Pre-collars for the metallurgical  holes  were  drilled  open  hole  percussion  at 150mm  diameter.  Metallurgical  hole  DHMT-01  was  drilled  PQ  (76mmø)  diameter,  the remaining metallurgical holes were drilled at HQ diameter.

An additional contractor, Geocontrole, has been contracted specifically to drill on the Aveleira and QSPA-Aveleira gap area.  Geocontrole has been on site since 27 August 2012 and is currently operating with two coring rigs, a MUSTANG and CHRISTENSEN CS14. Betoteste have mobilized a second OXIDRILL rig to the 'gap' area making a total of three rigs working on the exploration area.

## 10.4  Procedures

Guidelines set out in COLT's standard operational procedures revised March 2012 were used by the field geologists. This set of guidelines governs all aspects of its field programs from sampling methodology through to how it processes its data. This is managed on 3 levels:

-  Database Management;
-  Organizational Management; and
-  Operational Management.

Drill  pads  were levelled and prepared using a 1 tonne mechanical excavator with front end blade to dig sump pits for circulation of water, level pads and cut slots into terraces where necessary. Collars were marked with a stake and flagging tape with 2 to 3 more pickets all aligned along the azimuth of the proposed hole for inclined holes. The azimuth was sighted using a Brunton compass or Silva TM SurveyMaster and fined-tuned by the geologist during set up of the rig. Twin holes for the metallurgical programme were collared within 3m of the conjugate hole. Once the rig was set up a 20 m  zone was flagged off using danger tape and 2

the site designated an industrial zone according to CE standards.

Drill core was delivered from the core barrel to a 3m metal v-tray at the end of each run and the core transferred to a wooden core box by the geologist. A daily check on the condition of the  rig  and  support vehicles  was  made  and  recorded  according  to  the  H&amp;S  policy.    Driller sheets in duplicate were collated from the previous day's shift and the drillers' records (stick up books) checked  so as to correlate with the plod.    Regular  checks  in  the  field made  by geologists to ensure core boxes were correctly labelled and v-trays washed to prevent crosscontamination.  On completion of the hole and downhole survey the collar was capped with a ½ m2 cement plug with the borehole stamped with its ID number.

Processing of drill core was carried out at COLT's core storage facility in Távora according to the flowsheet shown in Figure 10-3 where applicable.

Sample intervals were nominally one meter each with sample lengths adjusted to break at lithologic  boundaries  from  a  minimum  of  0.5  m  to  a  maximum  of  2.0  m  in  visually  barren intervals  in  intermediate  schist.  Visually  mineralized  skarn  units  of  the  MZ  and  LZ  were sampled including intermediate schist between mineralised skarn and 10m into the FW and HW. For the twin holes samples were taken as close to the original sample interval from the historic  hole  as  possible  adjusted  to  variations  in  lithological  boundaries.  Semi-quantitative determination of scheelite content was carried out by examination under short wave UV light. --Geotechnical logging is completed by the geologist at the time of completing the geological logging.  The  core  is  photographed  under  artificial  lighting,  using  a  camera  cradle  ensuring each photo is taken under identical settings.

The  core  was  marked  for  sampling  down  the  centre  line  of  the  core  intersecting  the  axial trough of mineralization. The core is then cut by diamond saw. One half of the core is sent for analysis,  while  the  other  half  is  retained  in  the  core  boxes  for  future  reference.  Where additional sample was required for reference assays for metallurgical testwork the core was quartered ensuring minimal bias of mineralisation in the sampled quarter. Core was stacked in Távora, later racked at a specially prepared storage facility at the site office at QSPA.

The core samples for analysis are packed into sealed cardboard boxes at the storage facility, from  where  they  are  collected  and  transported  by  a  courier  operator  (TNT)  to  the  ALS Laboratory  in  Seville,  Spain.  Samples  are  analyzed  for  W,Sn  and  major  oxides  using  a metaborate fusion followed by XRF.

A set of standards, duplicates and blanks is inserted by COLT into the sample stream on a regular  basis  in  addition  to  the  laboratory's  own  internal  QA/QC  standards  and  duplicates. The standards inserted into the sampling stream are certified standards, produced by WCM Minerals of Canada. The Sample Certificates for standards W104, W105, W106, W107 and W108 are shown in Appendix A.

All  drillholes  were  surveyed  at  the  collar  surface  by  the  responsible  geologist,  using  a handheld GPS. Data for Eastings, Northings and RL was recorded in UTM 29T, Datum ED50.

A high resolution topographic survey was conducted in 2010 by survey contractors 'Superfície Topographia Lda' of Porto, leading to a 2m resolution digital terrain model.  Holes DHT01DHT09 were also accurately surveyed during this work.

The  topographic  survey  was  updated  in  August  2012  by  survey  contractors  'Superfície

Topographia  Lda'  of  Porto.  The  DTM  was  updated  using  photogrammetric  methods  and remote sensing imagery. Drillhole collars for the current 2012 campaign were captured using a  portable  DGPS  using  a  central  radio  beacon  for  reference.    Data  was  presented  by Superfície in both ED50 and WGS84 format which is currently being processed and verified by  Colt before  converting  the  database  from  ED50  to  WGS84  datum.  The  updated coordinates in ED50 datum incorporating this survey were used in the MRE

All drillholes have been subject to downhole surveying, to record variations from the original inclination. Surveys have been recorded at varying intervals, depending on the operator and original inclination of the drillhole and the depth drilled,

Data entry and capture was made on Excel spreadsheets with information summarized at the end of the week. Data was transferred to Colt's main office at Beloura from site for further processing.

## 10.5  Interpretation and Relevant Results

For the work conducted by COLT during the period 2009 to 2012, reputable contractors, using industry  standard  techniques  and  procedures  have  conducted  the  drilling.    Results  are interpreted to follow three principle tabular zones of skarn, namely the Carbonate, Main and Lower Horizons dipping gently to the south-west. The drill intercepts have been adjusted to true widths assuming an average strike of 315° and average dip -20° based on the average dip and strike of the mineralized zones at Tabuaço. Table 10-3 displays significant drillhole intercepts from the period 2009-2012.

Due to locally steep topography and occasional access restrictions, the diamond drillholes are arranged in a variety of orientations with the intention of intersecting the mineralized zones at approximate 50m centres.

A total of 62 assayed drillholes were used for the estimation, with an average recovery of 86 %. 74% of the total samples used have recovery equal or greater than 80 %.

## 11  SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND SECURITY

Samples from the current programme were shipped to the principal preparation facility of ALS in  Seville,  Spain  and  then  forwarded  for  analysis  in  Kamloops,  Canada.  Samples  used  in previous  COLT  campaigns  were  also  prepared  and  analysed  at  Stewart  Group's  OMAC laboratory in Loughrea, Ireland.  A third external laboratory, SGS Lakefield in Canada  was commissioned in September 2012 to check pulp rejects from both laboratories.

Processing of drill core was carried out at COLT's core storage facility in Távora according to the flowsheet shown in Figure 10-3 where applicable.

Sample intervals were nominally one meter each with sample lengths adjusted to break at lithologic  boundaries  from  a  minimum  of  0.5  m  to  a  maximum  of  2.0  m  in  visually  barren intervals  in  intermediate  schist.  Visually  mineralized  skarn  units  of  the  MZ  and  LZ  were sampled including intermediate schist between mineralised skarn and 10 m into the footwall and  hangingwall.  For  the  twin  holes  samples  were  taken  as  close  to  the  original  sample interval from the historic hole as possible adjusted to variations in lithological boundaries.

Semi-quantitative  determination  of  scheelite  content  was  carried  out  by  examination  under short wave  UV light.    Geotechnical  logging  is  completed  by  the  geologist  at  the  time  of --completing the geological logging. The core is photographed under artificial lighting using a camera cradle ensuring each photo is taken under identical settings.

A line was marked down the centre of the core intersecting the axial trough of mineralisation. The core is then cut by diamond saw along the line, splitting the core into two equal halves. One half of the core is sent for analysis, while the other half is retained in the core boxes for future reference. Where additional sample was required for reference assays for metallurgical testwork  the  core  was  quartered  ensuring  minimal  bias  of  mineralisation  in  the  sampled quarter. Core was stacked in Távora, later racked at a specially prepared storage facility at the site office at QSPA.

The core samples for analysis are packed into sealed cardboard boxes at the storage facility, from  where  they  are  collected  and  transported  by  a  courier  operator  (TNT)  to  the  ALS Laboratory in Seville, Spain. Samples are analysed for W,Sn and major oxides using a metaborate fusion followed by XRF.

A set of standards, duplicates and blanks is inserted by COLT into the sample stream on a regular  basis  in  addition  to  the  laboratory's  own  internal  QA/QC  standards  and  duplicates. The standards inserted into the sampling stream are certified standards, produced by WCM Minerals of Canada. The Sample Certificates for standards W104, W105, W106, W107 and W108 are shown in Appendix A.

## 11.1  Sample Preparation

At the ALS Laboratory in Spain, samples were prepared using the following process:

-  WEI-21 - Received sample weight
-  LOG-22 - Sample login, record w/o barcode
-  CRU-31  -  Fine  crushing  to  better  than  70%  &lt;2mm.  Includes  CRU-QC  crushing efficiency test
-  PUL-32  Up  to  1kg  sample  split  is  pulverised  to  better  than  85%  75  µ.  Includes

PUL\_QC pulverising test

-  LOG-24 - Pulp Login, record w/o barcode

## 11.2  Analyses

Three laboratory methods were used to analyse the Tabuaço Project samples:

- 1. ICP-AES  - Aqua Regia (AR/ES) and Multi Acid Digestion (MA/ES) by OMAC;
- 2. ICP-MS  (ME-MS61)  -  48  element,  four  acid  digestion  of  sample  followed  by Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry by ALS;
- 3. Fusion XRF using lithium borate disc for ore grade samples &gt;0.2% W (ME-XRF 10 by ALS - BF ES/MS Major and Trace elements by OMAC).

Only Fusion XRF for major oxide content and minor elements was requested of SGS, method XRF78S.

## 11.3  Security

COLT was responsible for managing  the  security  of  the  whole  sampling  process,  with  the Project  Geologists  supervising  all  selection  of  sampling  intervals,  the  cutting  process  and packing ready for shipment to ALS laboratories in sealed packages.  The office and storage facility at QSPA is fully alarmed and the compound subject to 24 hr CCTV.  Samples bags were sealed with single use plastic cable ties to prevent tampering.

COLT use TNT couriers to provide a secure logistical train, with sample batches tracked from dispatch from the Colt core sampling facility at Távora to arrival and signed for receipt at ALS.

Samples are recorded using COLT's unique ID numbers, and a separate ID number used by the supplied laboratory submission sheet.

Assay certificates are directly issued by the laboratories to COLT Management, and to SRK. Sample  tracking  and  downloadable  certificates  were  also  available  online  using  ALS Webtrieve facility accessed through secure login.

## 11.4  Laboratories

The original laboratory used for this programme was the Stewart Group's OMAC laboratory in Loughrea, Ireland.  ALS in Seville was originally utilised as a second laboratory to assist with QA/QC  and  to  accommodate  the  large  number  of  samples  when  drilling  proceeded  more quickly  but  is  now  used  as  the  main  laboratory  instead  of  OMAC.    SGS  has  been commissioned  to  perform  external  checks  on  20%  of  ALS  and  OMAC  samples  combined along with the requisite insertion of standards and blanks at 1 per 50 sample intervals.

All  three  laboratories  are  certified  and  considered  to  operate  to  internationally  acceptable standards.

## 11.5  Results and QC Procedures

ALS Laboratory internal  quality  controls  are  based  on  internationally  recognized  (EN,  ISO, US, EPA, ASTM, CEM, NIOSH, AOAC) standards and all ALS analytical procedures are fully validated and accredited to EN ISO/IEC 17025:2005 and ISO 9001:2008 registration.  Under this  accreditation,  a  systematic  process  of  quality  control  is  established  including:  regular calibration of instruments and independent verification of calibration; regular measurements of blank,  laboratory  control  and  laboratory  duplicate  samples.  Details  on  ALS  internal  QAQC procedures, proficiency testing, independent QA monitoring and internal auditing is presented on its website: http://www.alsglobal.com/minerals/downloads.aspx

Laboratory results were issued by both OMAC and ALS laboratories to the client in form of pdf certificates, with accompanying excel or .csv files for insertion into the database.  Copies of these  datasets  were  forwarded  directly  onto  SRK  for  QAQC  analysis  and  independent verification of the excel files against the laboratory certificates.

Results for tungsten were delivered by OMAC and ALS laboratories from the XRF analysis and provided to the Colt Resources as W% assays.

## 11.6  QA/QC

COLT have inserted Certified Reference Materials (SRM's) as Field Standards (W104, W105, W106 and W108), as well as duplicates and blanks into the sampling stream on the basis of 1 per 50 samples at random. For the current drill programme2011/12 Field Standards W104, W105,  W106  and  W107  were  used.  Standards  were  prepared  by  COLT's  geologists  by measuring 100g from a central container containing homogenized standard.

Copies of the SRM Certificates are presented in Appendix A.

SRK have conducted ongoing  QAQC reviews  on  the  returned  laboratory  assay  data.  This involves checking the standards, blanks and duplicates inserted by COLT into the sampling stream,  and  checking  the  reported  standards,  blanks  and  duplicates  inserted  into  the assaying programme by the laboratory.

The XRF data supplied by OMAC and ALS to SRK has passed the QAQC checking process and was therefore used for the MRE.

## 11.7.1  W104

Field standard W104 (0.202% tungsten) was used 13 times by ALS during the 2012 sampling campaign  and  22  times  overall.    Results  from  the  2012  campaign  were  all  within  the  2 standard  deviations  (SD)  warning  limit  and  showed  greater  precision  than  the  previous sampling campaign.

## 11.8  Field Blanks - XRF

A total of 35 field blanks were tested by ALS during the current 2012 drilling and sampling campaign and 88 times overall. Analysis of the field blanks tested by XRF showed some slight deviations from the expected result in 17% of blanks tested from 2010-2011 drilling.  These variations minor and are noted in both the OMAC and ALS batches. This may be explained by slight  contaminations  from  bordering  high  grade  samples  rather  than  being  an  analytical machine  error  given  that  COLT  geologists  tended  to  insert  blanks  in  the  sample  stream immediately after high grade samples during this period. This procedure was changed in 2012 with blanks being inserted randomly. There also remains the possibility that some of the field blanks used are not totally barren.

## 11.9  Certified Reference Materials - Field Standards - ICP

The SRMs samples reported above for XRF analysis were also tested by ICP-AES by ALS. However, given that the previous QA/QC results for ICP-AES reported in December 2011 by SRK indicated that the ICP method is not suitable for high grade tungsten assays &gt;0.2% W at Tabuaço (due to incomplete acid digestion),  the ICP-AES results have not been reported here  not  used  in  preparing  the  resource  estimate  described  in  the  MRE  section.  COLT continues to compare these results with the XRF results on a regular basis to ensure integrity of sample preparation or calibration of the XRF equipment.

## 11.10  Laboratory QA/QC Review

COLT monitors and analyses the outcomes of internal QA/QC of each laboratory that COLT employs.  Assay  results,  from  the  laboratories,  are  treated  and  analysed  with  the  same techniques, used in COLT's QA/QC program.  The procedure and results are presented and graphed as follows.

Both OMAC and ALS laboratories inserted their own quality control standards into the assay stream, in the form of repetition, or repeat, analysis and the use of blanks and standards.

OMAC used a one in ten repeat frequency for repeats, with two in-house standards used in each batch and two blanks inserted into each batch.

ALS used a more random insertion of duplicates, roughly every 20 samples, with blanks and in-house standards also part of the testing.

SRK has run QA/QC analysis on the provided laboratory standard assay results. These refer to supplied laboratory inserts provided by OMAC and ALS laboratories for the previous 2011 series samples.

Figure 11-10 OMAC and ALS Laboratory Blanks QA/QC - XRF

<!-- image -->

The ALS facility in Seville was audited by COLT on July 21 2012.  The full sample preparation line was examined including:

-  Sample reception and printing of barcodes for separate crushing and grinding schemes,
-  Jaw crushers to -2mm,
-  Tema mills,
-  Storage and sample dispatch,
-  Core cutting.

COLT's  opinion  is  that  the  facility  was  generally  clean  with  adequate  staff  operating  the crushing lines with appropriate PPE equipment. Extraction and air conditioning was effective. An  industrial  vacuum  cleaner  was  used  to  prevent  accumulation  of  dust.  The  facility  was operated on a 3 x 8hr shift basis, 7 days per week.

COLT discussed their concern of the pulp storage and the condition of the grinding equipment with ALS management during the visit. The pulp is stored in paper kraft packets which risked contamination  and  deterioration  over  the  long  term.  ALS  said  that  kraft  packets  were  only used for  a  split  of  120g  of  pulp  for  the  primary  analysis.  Up  to  900g  of  the  master  pulp  is retained in a polythene bag which is suitable for storage and retained for 3 months.

The routine use of steel tema mills for grinding appeared worn with 'convexing' of the base of the pot compared with mills made of tungsten carbide. ALS explained that the reasons were based  on  cost,  the  alternative  to  use  silica  pots  for  COLT's  samples  made  the  cost uncompetitive and that wear on the  steel mills  was  closely monitored  by  regular  weighing. Once the pots lost 2kg in weight they were replaced.  COLT also  notes that the pots were cleaned by using washed and screened inert river gravel from the local river bed.

## 11.11  Opinion on Adequacy

Colt Resource's use of Stewart Group's OMAC laboratory and ALS Seville laboratory for their ICP-MS and XRF assaying meets with accepted industry standards for laboratory certification.

The XRF analysis methods utilized for detecting tungsten (W%) at Tabuaço is deemed to be

appropriate for the grade present.  The ICP-AES method is appropriate for detecting smaller grades  and  should  be  used  if  a  cut  off  grade  of  0.2%  or  below  is  used.  ICP-AES  is  not suitable or reliable for tungsten values above 0.2% due to issues  with acid digestion of the sample during preparation.

The frequency and use of the laboratory repeats, blanks and standards can be used in their own right, or together with the addition of the COLT introduced repeats, blanks and standards to give an increased population for QA/QC review on the laboratory instrumentation, although differing sample preparation techniques and sample states need to be taken into account.

The insertions made by COLT staff of repeats, blanks and standards give an additional check on the laboratory preparation and instrumentation quality.  These insertions remain outside the  laboratory  control,  although  certain  items  will  remain  obvious  in  the  sample  stream  as QA/QC insertions (e.g.  SRM's) this  is  acceptable  practice,  as  the  laboratory  are  not  made aware of the actual values of the standard being inserted into the sample stream.

SRK found no reason to reject any of the XRF assay results from the returned dataset, based on statistical analysis and QA/QC. SRK is comfortable that the frequency of repeats, blanks and standards used is sufficient to give an adequate laboratory quality control check.

## 12  DATA VERIFICATION

SRK was appointed independent QP for the Tabuaço Project in February of 2011 and since then  has  been  involved  with  reviewing  'best  practice'  procedures  and  monitoring  QA/QC protocols.    In  addition  numerous  visits  by  several  personnel  covering  a  wide  range  of disciplines have been made to the project to supervise the ongoing procedures and to verify the  adherence  to  protocols.  During  a  number  of  these visits  SRK  personnel  witnessed  the sampling procedures employed as well as the sealing and despatch of these samples.

SRK  assisted in establishing guidelines for the standard operational procedures as documented by Colt in March 2012.

All assay certificates were issued directly by the laboratories to SRK in Cardiff for verification and assimilation into an independent database.

Thus  SRK  is  confident  that  the  values  returned  from  the  laboratories  are  an  accurate reflection of those in the deposit and that there has been no opportunity for these results to be tampered  with.    As  such  SRK  did  not  consider  it  worthwhile  to  collect  further  verification samples from the Tabuaço Project.

## 12.1  Procedures

A procedure for data logging and management was put in place by SRK for this project, which was implemented and refined by COLT.

Tabuaço drilling data is contained in excel spreadsheet format. The raw data on all activities from historical drilling, metallurgical test holes and exploration drilling is stored on a master workbook  which  contains  all  COLT  geological,  geotechnical,  specific  gravity,  sampling intervals, and assay return data. This is a user access controlled database that becomes the

only  source  of input  data  used  in  Gemcom for  geological three  dimensional  modelling  and block modelling.

User access to all or parts of the master is strictly controlled so as to prevent old slave data overwriting the new master. Two copies of the database are maintained, the master is housed on the COLT server for updating and a duplicate is stored on the corporate public domain for use by the exploration team and management. This maintains the integrity of the dataset and allows widespread use without compromising the master database.

This master database  has gone through multiple phases of data validation and verification checks  using  a  number  of  mining  software  packages,  including  Gemcom,  Micromine  and LeapFrog, as well as manual checks following SRK QAQC. It is routinely validated by COLT in Gemcom.

All drilling and sampling data independent of the master database was digitally uploaded onto the SRK Sharepoint FTP site by COLT project geologists upon completion of each drillhole as individual excel files. The files were  split into categories for drillhole surveying; core boxes; core  photography;  daily  drill  monitoring;  drillers'  logs;  geology  data;  geotechnical  data; sampling data and specific gravity data. In addition, copies of the sampling certificate PDFs held by SRK were placed on the FTP site as a record. These data files were then collated and combined by SRK into a single, independently verified database.  This database was held in a read-only format, with write access limited to SRK. The finalized database was uploaded into mining software and validation  checks  were  run  against  the  data  to  check  accuracy  of the data ranges, correct height and depths.

## 12.2  Limitations

SRK is not aware of any limitations to the data collected and is comfortable for this data to be used to update the MRE.

## 12.3  Data Adequacy

SRK  is  confident  that  the  data  utilised  in  this  report,  specifically  in  the  MRE,  is  of  a professionally acceptable standard and quality and that it is adequate for the purposes used herein.

Geological Data was collected from a series of 75 vertical and inclined drillholes across the mapped and predicted skarn horizon in the Tabuaço Project exploration licence area.  Drilling was completed on a hole spacing ranging from 50 m x 25 m to 25 m x 25 m.

Collars  were  surveyed  using  the  Project  Geologist's  handheld  differential  GPS  devices however the availability of detailed topography adds confidence to the collar elevation data. All collar positions were surveyed in UTM 29T, Datum ED50. Core logging was completed in sufficient  detail  to  be  able  to  separate  and  determine  significant  changes  in  alteration, lithology, structure, mineralization, alteration and geotechnical features when entered into a modelling package.

Total core  recovery  within  the  skarn  zones  at  the  Tabuaço  resource  area  averaged  nearly 87% for the MZ and 89% for the LZ.

SRK  is  comfortable  that  the  methods  and  processes  used  to  sample  the  core  and  the processes  used  to  record  the  geological  logs  meet  the  required  quality  and  quantity

parameters to complete a geological model of Tabuaço.

The  assay  data  supplied  is  from  reputable,  certified  laboratories  and  has  been  subject  to QAQC analysis and review.

## 13  MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING

Two scoping-level metallurgical programmes have been conducted on test composites from the Tabuaço tungsten deposit with a third bench-scale programme currently underway.  The first study was conducted by Inspectorate Exploration and Mining Services Ltd (Inspectorate), under the direction of Bolu Consulting Engineering on an outcrop sample from Tabuaço. The second scoping-level study has also been conducted by Inspectorate under the direction of SRK  on  drill  core  reject  material  from  the  Tabuaço  property.    The  results  of  these  two metallurgical test programmes and preliminary results from the third programme underway in 2012 are presented in this section.

## 13.1  Metallurgical Programme on Tabuaço Outcrop

The  results  of  the  scoping-level  metallurgical  programme  conducted  on  Tabuaço  outcrop material  is  presented  in  the  report,  'Scoping  Metallurgical  Testing  for  the  Recovery  of Scheelite on Samples from the Tabuaço Property of Colt Resources', Inspectorate, February 22, 2011.   Head analyses on the test composite averaged 0.64% WO3 with total sulphur less that 0.1%.  Main elements of interest are presented in Table 13-1

Mineralogical  investigations  indicated  a  predominant  presence  of  silicate  gangue  minerals with  fluorite  present  as  a  subordinate  constituent.  This  observation  was  confirmed  by  the fluorine  assay  presented  in  Table  13-1,  which  corresponds  to  3.4%  fluorite  (CaF2).    The microanalytical  scan  showed  no  fluorine  minerals  other  than  fluorite.    Accessory  minerals included apatite, scheelite and calcite, with traces of sulphides and cassiterite.

The scope of metallurgical testing conducted on the outcrop composited included:

-  Heavy liquid separation studies on individual size fractions
-  Gravity  release  study  with  a  laboratory  Wilfley  shaking  table  on  separate  size fractions
-  Gravity  concentration  tests
-  Scheelite flotation tests

## 13.1.1  Heavy Liquid Separation Study

The heavy liquid separation (HLS) studies were conducted on size fractions over the range from -12.7mm + 0.84 mm and subjected to separation with heavy liquid specific gravities (SG) of 2.96, 2.8 and 2.6 g/cm3. This work was conducted to gain a preliminary understanding of the gravity concentration potential of the material, and demonstrated that at the size range

tested 92.3% of the  scheelite is present in 65% of the HLS feed mass in the + 2.96 SG sink product.

## 13.1.2  Gravity Release Study

In  order  to  assess  liberation  and  potential  upgrading  characteristics  of  scheelite  in various size ranges, release analysis was conducted on 23kg of Outcrop composite sample using a Wilfley shaking table.  The test sample was stage-crushed to -595 microns and screened at 420; 297; 210; 150; 105 and 75 microns to produce seven fractions for laboratory table tests.

The results of these tests are presented in Table 13-2, and demonstrate that very high grade concentrates were achieved in the -105 micron size ranges, while the -120 + 105 micron size range  should  be  upgradable  to  marketable  concentrate  grades  with  further  stages  of upgrading.  The  coarser size ranges  would  most  likely  require  regrinding  to improve concentrate grade and recovery.   This work indicated that future gravity testing should target 20-25% rougher mass pulls followed by multiple upgrading stages.  Low grade intermediate products should be subjected to mineralogical investigations to determine liberation and the necessary regrind requirements for optimum gravity recoveries.

## 13.1.3  Gravity Concentration Tests

Gravity table tests were performed using two size ranges of the Outcrop composite sample: 500 +150 micron and -150 micron.  Each fraction was separately dry fed to the laboratory Wilfley  shaking  table,  and  metallurgical  results  are  provided  in  Table  13-3.    These  results indicate that approximately 75% of the tungsten can be recovered at ~25% mass pull into a gravity  concentrate  assaying  ~2.5%  WO3.    Tungsten  recoveries  and  grades  into  the  table concentrate and middling products were ~87% and 2.2% WO3, respectively, for the -500 +150 micron size range, and ~67% and 2.9% WO3, respectively, for the -150 micron size range.

## 13.1.4  Scheelite Flotation Tests

Scoping-level flotation tests were conducted on the Outcrop sample ground to a target grind of  P80  150  microns.  A  total  of  three  tests  were  conducted  under  a  variety  of  flotation conditions using soda ash, sodium hydroxide and sodium silicate for slurry conditioning and fatty acids as the scheelite collector and methyl isobutyl carbinol (MIBC) as the frother. The results of these tests are  summarized in Table 13-4.  The best test (F2) resulted in 65.8% tungsten recovery into a rougher flotation concentrate containing 7.17 % WO3.

## 13.2  Metallurgical Programme on Tabuaço Drill Core Reject

A subsequent metallurgical programme was conducted at Inspectorate on a test composite formulated  from  drill  core  reject  material  from  selected  intervals  from  fourteen  drill  holes. Head analyses on the test composite averaged 0.71% WO3, 2.5% F and 1.84% P2O5. Total sulphur was 0.1%.  Main elements of interest are presented in Table 13-5.

The  test  programme  was  designed  to  more  extensively  evaluate  scheelite  flotation  and parameters required to achieve acceptable flotation recoveries and concentrate grades.  This was followed by a bulk gravity/flotation test in which  three separate sized fractions over the range from 300 microns to 74 microns were subjected to gravity concentration and the minus 74 micron fraction was subjected to scheelite flotation.

## 13.2.1  Scheelite Flotation Studies

Scheelite flotation is typically conducted at an alkaline pH, using soda ash, sodium hydroxide and sodium silicate as flotation modifiers and fatty acids (such as oleic acid and linoleic acid) as  collectors.    The  extent  to  which  scheelite  can  be  concentrated  by  flotation  is  highly dependent on the mineralogy of the ore, and more specifically the extent to which fluorite, calcite and apatite occur in the ore, as these minerals have a strong tendency to float with scheelite.

A series of flotation tests were conducted by Inspectorate, under SRK's supervision, to define the  flotation  process  parameters  required  to  effectively  recover  scheelite  into  a  flotation concentrate.  This work included an initial evaluation of process parameters previously used by Inspectorate during the earlier studies on the Outcrop composite, followed by a systematic evaluation of key flotation parameters, such:

-  Collector dosage
-  Sodium silicate dosage
-  Grind size

## Scheelite Flotation versus Collector Dosage

Flotation  tests  on  1,000  gram  test  charges  were  run  to  evaluate  the  effect  of  fatty  acid collector (blend of 50% oleic acid and 44% linoleic acid) levels over the range of 100 - 600 g/t.  Test conditions held constant included:

The results of the collector dosage test series are summarized in Table 13-6.  As the collector addition  was  increased  from  100  g/t  to  600  g/t,  the  grade  of  the  first  cleaner  concentrate decreased  from  12.3%  WO3  to  4.86%  WO3,  while  overall  tungsten  recovery  into  the  first cleaner concentrate remained fairly constant at about 60%.  On this basis, a collector dosage of 100 g/t was used for subsequent flotation studies.

## Scheelite Flotation versus Sodium Silicate Dosage

In an effort to achieve a higher level of scheelite flotation selectivity, a series of tests were run with sodium silicate addition rates over the range from 2.5 to 4.5 kg/t.  The results of these tests are summarized in Table 13-7and showed that as sodium silicate levels increased, the grade of the first cleaner concentrate increased from 12.3% WO3 to 24.4% WO3, but tungsten recoveries declined dramatically from 59.9% to 3.4%.

## Scheelite Flotation versus Grind Size

A series of flotation tests were run to evaluate the effect of grind over the range from P80 150 to  P 80 75  microns.  The results of these tests are  summarized in  Table 13-8and show that tungsten  recovery  increased  from  47.9%  at  a  P80  150  micron  grind  to  71.1%  at  a  P80  75 micron grind. First cleaner concentrate grades were fairly constant at about 16-18% WO3.

## 13.2.2  Bulk Gravity/Flotation Study

A bulk gravity/flotation test was conducted on a 20kg ore sample, stage-crushed to -48 mesh. The  test  composite  was  then  screened  into  four  size  fractions:  -48m+65m,  -65m+150m,  150m+200m.  Table 13-9 provides a summary of tungsten grade and distribution in each of the size fractions. As can be seen, the tungsten values are highly concentrated in the -200m fraction, which represents 54% of the mass and accounts for 69% of the tungsten in the test composite.  It should be pointed out that the tungsten distribution into to the fine fractions in this drill core reject test composite may be significantly higher that may be experience in an actual milling operation. The first three size fractions were subjected to gravity concentration on  a  laboratory  Wilfley  shaking  table  followed  by  upgrading  of  the  table  concentrate  on  a Mozley concentrating table.

Scheelite Flotation

The -200m fraction was subjected to scheelite flotation using the optimized flotation conditions developed earlier in the study.  The results of this test are summarized in Table 13-3, which shows  that  78%  of  the  contained  tungsten  was  recovered  into  a  first  cleaner  flotation concentrate containing 13.5% WO3.   At 19.9% fluorine, the major contaminant in the flotation concentrate  is  fluorite.    Even  though  67%  of  the  fluorite  was  rejected  into  the  combined flotation  tailings,  due  to  the  high  concentration  of  fluorine  in  the  ore  (~  3%),  in  order  to produce  higher  grade  scheelite  flotation  concentrates,  further  work  will  need  to  done  to develop a flotation protocol that can be more selective against fluorite.

## 13.2.4  Recovery

As shown in Table 13-14, this scoping study suggested an estimated overall recovery of 75% based on the results of this work.  This recovery projection assumed the following:

-  90% recovery of the rougher gravity concentrates:
-  95%  recovery  of  tungsten  in  the  first cleaner  concentrate  during  subsequent upgrading to market grade concentrates:
-  50%  recovery  of  tungsten  values  in  the  gravity  middling  and  tailing  products advanced to flotation: and
-  50% recovery of tungsten values contained in recycled cleaner tailings.

Additional  work  will  be  required  to  further  develop  the  flotation  process  required  to  more selectively float the contained scheelite from the major contaminant minerals fluorite, apatite and calcite.

## 13.3  Metallurgical Programme on Tabuaço Drill Core Samples

The previous metallurgical studies had demonstrated that production of high grade scheelite flotation  concentrates  was  difficult,  using  commonly  accepted  procedures,  due  to  the  high fluorite content of the ore. Consequently, in early 2012 COLT retained a Chinese metallurgical services  provider  that  specializes  in  tungsten  ore  metallurgy  to  undertake  a  metallurgical investigation  of  the  Tabuaço  ore.    Although  work  is  still  in  progress,  a  preliminary  report, 'Research on the Samples from Tabuaço Scheelite Project, Portugal' dated August 30, 2012 has been issued to the Company. A final report is expected in the fourth quarter of 2012 from the metallurgical services provider.

In May 2012, COLT supplied the metallurgical services provider with 523 kilograms of recent drill core material to conduct additional metallurgical studies. The drill core holes and intervals used are shown in Table 13-15.  Multi-element analyses and tungsten mineral phase analysis are shown in Table 13-16 and Table 13-17, respectively.

Preliminary gravity separation test work on this composite determined that about 45% to 50% of the contained tungsten would report to gravity concentrates containing about 50% WO3.

With the  addition  of  sodium  carbonate  and  a modified  sodium  silicate  as  regulators,  and  a modified fatty acid as a collector flotation reagent, that up to 92% of the contained tungsten can be recovered into a rougher floatation concentrate at a grade of 7.29% WO3.

This work was followed by exploratory cleaning floatation tests on the rougher concentrates. Initial results have been very positive and have demonstrated that 73% of the tungsten in the rougher concentrate reports to a very high grade concentrate grading, almost up to 77% WO3. A  further  18.7%  of  the  WO3  content  of  the  rougher  concentrate  reports  to  a  middling concentrate  grading  up  to  22%  WO3.  An  overall  cleaner  flotation  recovery  of  91.7%  was obtained in a combined cleaner plus middling concentrate containing 51.1% WO3.     Based on rougher flotation tungsten recovery of 92% achieved during locked-cycle testing, an overall tungsten  recovery  in  the  range  of  84%  appears  achievable.  It  is  likely  that  these  initial metallurgical results can be improved upon and additional cleaner flotation testwork, including locked-cycle tests designed to recirculate intermediate middling streams, should be conducted to optimize cleaner flotation requirements and concentrate grades.  The objective will be maximize tungsten recovery into a flotation concentrate that exceeds 65% WO3

Pending the final results for the work currently in progress, COLT anticipates contracting with

the metallurgical services provider at a future date for pilot plant testing of a twenty metric ton ore lot when such material is available. It is recognized that some of the reagents used during these  metallurgical  studies  may  be  proprietary  and  the  Company  may  be  dependent  upon Chinese  sources for  reagents  such  as  the  modified  sodium  silicate  and  modified fatty  acid collector reagents.

## 13.4  Processing

Although considerable work remains to define the process flowsheet and process parameters for the Tabuaço scheelite ore, based upon the results of the studies to date,  and the recent finding  that  the  production  of  high  grade  flotation  concentrates  is  possible,  it  is  likely  the process flowsheet development will focus on flotation recovery through conventional crushing, grinding  and  classification  of  the  scheelite  ore  to  an  approximately  75  micron  grind  size followed by; multiple stages of roughing, scavenging and cleaner flotation processes.

## 14  MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATES

## 14.1  Introduction

The Mineral Resource model presented here represents a resource estimate for the QSPA resource area (the Resource).  The MRE was completed by COLT and reviewed by Martin Pittuck, Director and Corporate Consultant for Mining Geology with SRK (UK) Limited (SRK), with input provided by Filipa Matias, COLT's Geological Engineer.  Mr Pittuck is considered a Qualified Person as defined in National Instrument 43-101. The effective date of this resource estimate is 3rd October, 2012.

This section describes  the work  undertaken  by COLT  in  conjunction  with  SRK  and summarizes  the  key  assumptions  and  parameters  used  to  prepare  the  revised  Mineral Resource models.

The Mineral Resources presented here are reported in accordance with Canadian Securities Administrators'  National  Instrument  43-101  and  have  been  estimated  in  conformity  with generally  accepted  CIM  'Estimation  of  Mineral  Resource  and  Mineral  Reserves  Best Practices' guidelines. Mineral Resources are not Mineral Reserves and have not demonstrated  economic  viability.  There  is  no  certainty  that  all  or  any  part  of  the  Mineral Resource will be converted into Mineral Reserves. Mineral Reserves can only be estimated as a result of a technical-economic evaluation as part of a preliminary feasibility study or a feasibility  study  of  a mineral  project.  Accordingly, at the present level of development there are no Mineral Reserves at the Tabuaço Project.

## 14.2  Topography and Coordinate System

Geographic information used in the development of this study is projected in the Universal Transverse  Mercator  European  Datum  1950  Zone  29  North.  Pre-Colt  era  data  has  been converted from Hayford-Gauss (Datum 73).

The topographic surface used in the Gemcom model was produced by surveyor contractor Superficie. The surface was created from 2 meter topographic contours from a high resolution orthorectified  aerial  photo  mosaic  encompassing  Sao  Pedro  das  Águias,  Quintã  and  the Aveleira  areas.  The  study  was  completed  December  2011,  with  periodic  updates  to  the drillhole database for spot locations of drilling activities.

## 14.3  Database Construction and Validation

Raw  data  was  compiled  by  COLT  field  exploration  team,  collated  into  excel  format spreadsheets  for  continual  archiving.  Separate  tables  were  compiled  for  collar,  downhole survey,  assay,  lithological  logging,  structural  geology,  and  alteration  and  mineralisation occurrence. In  addition,  density  data  was  also  compiled  in  an  ASCI  table.  COLT  compiled data  collected  until  September  2012  and  imported  it  into  the  Gemcom  (GEMS)  mining software package. Validation of data was performed during collation of field data (an ongoing process) and again inside the relational database of GEMS mining software. The data was verified as correct at the time of submission.

## 14.4  Geological Interpretation and Domaining

As referred previously in this report, prior to geological modelling, a series of cross sections were defined perpendicular to the strike direction of the mineralized zones within the Project. Also,  a  series  of  longitudinal  sections  were  defined  along  strike.  After  interpreting  in  both directions, a set of 3D wireframes and strings were created to materialize the interpretation and domaining of the deposit.

Two  major  zones  of  tungsten  bearing  skarn  mineralization  were  defined,  using  geological aspects like rock type, texture, structure and position criteria. Grades of WO3 were also used to  help  correlating  the  different  horizons  across  the  section.  Each  major  zone  was  then divided in two sub-zones.

The  two  major  units  defined  are  the  Main  Skarn  (red  horizons)  and  Lower  Skarn  (orange horizons).  This  separation  was  based  mainly  in  the  rock  type  defined  by  the  core  logging, although  in  some  sections  and  zones  it  was  also  based  on  position  relationship  along  the cross  section.  The  Main  Skarn  (SKM  in  geological  log)  includes  mainly  a  coarse  grain, massive in texture and well developed skarn, with high grade mineralization. Nevertheless, in some  zones  some  carbonaceous  lithologies  (CRB)  were  also  included  in  the  Main  Skarn domain  as  they  might  represent  a  less  developed  skarn.  In  fact,  it  is  accepted  that  some lateral variation may occur in this type of geological setting. The Lower Skarn was modelled based on the layered and  green to pink skarn (SKL rock code in the geological log). This lithology  is  fine  grained,  rich  in  garnet  and  epidote,  and  corresponds  most  of  the  times  to medium to low grade mineralization.

Each unit is consistently separated by a few meters of barren biotitic schist although within the same rock type and positional trend of the main zone where it is included. Therefore, M1 and M2 were defined as the two sub-zones of the Main Skarn, while L and LL are two sub-zones of the Lower Skarn.

In Aveleira a two-layer model was also defined with a Main Skarn and Lower Skarn unit based mostly in rock type and in position relationship along section.

An approximate grade cut off of 0.1 % WO3 was used to define the mineralisation wireframes, in  conjunction  with lithological  logging  of  lower  grade  skarn.    After  completion  of  the  cross sectional modelling, the interpretations were tied together to create 3D wireframes to be used for  constraining  the  MRE.  A  fault  which  cuts  across  the  modelled  units  has  also  been modelled  as  well  as  two  additional  but  less  significant  faults  in  the  south-east  part  of  the deposit. A typical cross section through the modelled units is given in Figure 14-1. From top to

bottom, wireframes are designated as M1, M2, L and LL. This denomination it is not applied to Aveleira, being the wireframes named as Main Skarn horizon (red) and Lower Skarn horizon (orange) for that project (Figure 14-2).

The  wireframes  generally  look  continuous  in  cross  section  and  long  section  which  allow  a reasonable  confidence  to  be  placed  on  their  continuity.  As  the  wireframes  are  often  flat dipping, their outlines in horizontal plan view are sometimes uneven but this is considered by SRK to be an artefact of the wireframing which can be improved upon before mine planning commences.

A total  of  66  assayed  drillholes  were  used  for  the  estimation,  with  an  average  recovery  of 86%.  74% of the total samples used have recovery equal or greater than 80%.

## 14.5  Density Analysis

A total of 284 Specific Gravity (SG), or density, measurements were taken during the course of  the  Colt  Resources  2011  drilling  campaign  and  80  samples  during  the  2012  drilling campaign. Measurements were taken by the 'Archimedes' method by displacement of water from  solid  core  immersed  in  a  bath.  Two  weights  are  recorded  with  a  1g  precision  scale: Weight of core (Wc) and Weight immersed (Wi). By assuming SG of water as 1:

SG of core is SG = Wc/(Wc-Wi)

The table below (Table 14-1) illustrates the relationship between lithology and SG averaged over the two drilling campaigns. 3.1 is the average SG value for the skarn units samples, with a grade higher than 0.3%; this value has been used as the average density of the ore bearing blocks in the MRE.

## 14.6  Statistical Analyses

Exploratory data analysis was performed using the one meter composite samples within the wireframes described previously. The composite process  was conducted in the Gemcom TM Software,  as  well  as  samples  extraction,  with  subsequent  visual  confirmation  of  interval coding  by  the  wireframes.  The  short  composites  were  checked  to  ensure  no  bias  was introduced and to determine if could be included. As no bias was present, smaller samples were retained for the estimation.

Basic statistics were analysed for each layer individually, and are presented below, in Figure 13-3 to Figure 13-6.

All  populations  show  a  positive  skew  and  do  not  display  a  normal  histogram.    When transformed  to  natural  logs,  the  populations  move  towards  log-normality,  but  they  are  not strictly log-normal, being negatively skewed. This happens with all the wireframe populations. The  geological  interpretation  and  knowledge  of  the  deposits  lead  resulted  in  3  estimation domains being used for SPA only one for Aveleira. Summary statistics for these are provided in Table 14-2.

## 14.7  Grade Capping

Statistical analysis of the 1 m composite data indicated that grade capping was not required since  there  were  no  extreme  outliers  encountered,  and  in  most  instances  high  grades  are supported  by  neighbouring  high  grades  in  the  same  drillhole,  often  with  additional  support from neighbouring drillholes.  Any isolated higher grade samples would also be accounted for in the kriging process, which requires a minimum number of composites to estimate a block value. This dependence reduces the impact of individual high grades on the block values.

## 14.8  Variographic Analyses

Spatial analysis was undertaken only at the SPA deposit. Experimental directional variograms were unsuccessful in the M0+M1 and M2 domains, whereas in the L+LL domain directional variograms were obtained.

1m lag omnidirectional variograms were used to define the nugget effect in each domain.  For solids M0+M1 and M2, omnidirectional variograms, with a longer lag were used to model an appropriate range in the plane of the deposit.

Each experimental variogram was fitted with a spherical model, which despite good geological continuity showed grade continuity to have a low range on average. Experimental variograms and fitted models are presented below (Figures 13.7 to 13.9).

## 14.9  Block Model Construction

A block size of 12.5 x 12.5 x 2.5 m  was chosen and is considered reasonable for the average 3 drillhole spacing in the better drilled areas. Each block model is rotated 10  clockwise, to be ° aligned with the model edges with the strike of the mineralization. Block model parameters are presented in Table 14-3

## 14.10  Grade Interpolation

Grade data for each of the domains were interpolated into the respective wireframe domain using three search pass Ordinary Kriging (OK) in SPA and two pass inverse distance squared weighting at Aveleira. The search ellipsoid was defined based on each deposit's average dip and strike orientations and drilling spacing. A minimum number of 5 samples and a maximum of  75  samples  were  used  in  each  block  estimation.  Because  Aveleira  is  similar  to  SPA  in terms  of  geology  and  mineralization,  the  same  search  ellipsoid  parameters  were  applied, represented in Table 14-4 using Pass 1 and Pass 2 parameters.

At SPA the block estimation strategy ensured that all blocks in the parts of the domains which contribute to the resource were assigned a grade. At Aveleira, because a 2 pass search was employed, some blocks did not have grade assigned to them.  The transformation to tonnage was done based on a density value of 3.1, which represents the average value of samples with a grade higher than 0.3%.

## 14.11  Block Model Validation

Block models were validated by several methods:

-  Statistical comparison between block and composite data;
-  Slope of regression as an indication of estimation quality
-  Visual comparison of drill-hole composites with the resource block grade;
-  Swath plots.

## 14.11.1 Mean block grade versus composite mean grade

Statistical  comparison  between  block  and  composite  grades  was  done  individually,  per domain. To  each  wireframe,  a  cumulative  function  comparison  was  undertaken  as  well  as means comparison, in order to determine if there is bias in the estimation process. Means are higher  in the  raw  data,  likely  due  to  the  relative  clustering  of  drilling  in  higher  grade  areas which has been declustered by the ordinary kriging.

Table 14-5 Comparison between block and composite average grade, for each wireframe.

| Solid    |   Raw data average grade  (%WO3) |   Estimated data average grade  (%WO3) |   Relative difference  (%) |
|----------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| M0+M1    |                             0.46 |                                   0.39 |                     -17.37 |
| M2       |                             0.38 |                                   0.32 |                     -21.71 |
| L+LL     |                             0.23 |                                   0.18 |                     -30.3  |
| Aveleira |                             0.47 |                                   0.45 |                      -5.5  |

## 14.11.2 Visual comparison

Visual  comparison  between  the  block  grades  and  the  underlying  composite  grades  in perpendicular  and  longitudinal  sections  show  acceptable  agreement.  An  examples  cross section is presented in Figure 14-10, showing block models and composite grades.

## 14.11.3 Swath plot analysis

As part of the validation process, the block model grades were compared with the composite grades within slices through the deposit. The results were displayed on graphs to check for visual agreement between grades averaged for sections cut in the X, Y and Z directions. An example is given in Figure 14-11.

## 14.12  Mineral Resource Classification

The drilling and sampling protocols and quality control results provide a high confidence in the database  which  has  been  used  for  the  MRE.  The  geological  continuity  of  the  mineralised skarns is reasonable to good in the main drilled area, some faulting may affect continuity at a small  scale  and  some  faults  affecting  the  dip  extensions  in  the  Inferred  Mineral  Resource have been modelled although with low confidence; more drilling would be required to improve confidence of down dip faulting and continuity in the lower skarn units.

In the well drilled areas, whilst geological continuity is good, the grade continuity is variable; in some places there are consistent and consecutive high grade drilling intersections  whilst in some other areas the grade continuity is interrupted by low grade intersections. This suggests that mineralisation is bound within the continuous skarn horizons but occasionally it can be very weak.

COLT and SRK have relied on visual inspection of the grade block models and slopes of regression values which indicate the quality of block estimates to determine substantial areas of the deposit where block grade estimates are of reasonable quality and demonstrate large continuous mineralised volumes for which the average grade of the blocks is known with a reasonable  degree  of  confidence:  these  areas  have  been  classified  as  Indicated  Mineral Resources and other areas have been classified as Inferred Mineral Resources

## 14.13  Mineral Resource Statement

COLT has prepared a 3D geological model based on diamond drilling and mapping which has resulted  in  a  robust  demonstration  of  the  geological continuity  of mineralised  skarns  at  the Tabuaço  deposit.  The  drilling,  sampling  and  assaying  have  been  carried  out  to  a  high standard. The continuity of grade within the main mineralised zones is variable, but sufficient in many places to allow estimation of block grades with a reasonable level of confidence. The resultant model demonstrates that there are substantial parts of the deposit which present a continuous body of mineralisation above a cut-off grade of 0.3% WO3 which have sufficient dimensions  and  grade  to  have  reasonable  prospects  for  eventual  economic  extraction according to the mining and processing studies carried out to date.

Mineral  Resources  have  been  classified  and  reported  in  accordance  with  standards  as defined by the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (CIM) 'CIM Definition Standards - For Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves', prepared by the CIM Standing Committee on Reserve Definitions  and adopted by CIM Council on December 11, 2005 and as amended on November 27, 2010.

SRK  has  reviewed  the  process  and  outcomes  in  sufficient  detail  to  adopt  and  report  the resultant estimate given in Table 14-6.

- 3. The  Mineral  Resources  are  stated  above  a  cut-off  grade  of  0.3%WO3,  based  on  realistic  mining  and processing cost and recovery assumptions.

## 14.14  Grade Tonnage Curves

The MRE is sensitive to cut-off grades. A breakdown of the tonnage and grade of the defined domains is presented below in form of table and grade-tonnage curves presented separately for the Indicated and Inferred classifications (Figures 13-12 and 13-13).

## 18  PROJECT INFRASTRUCTURE

## 18.1  Infrastructure

A preliminary infrastructure study has been undertaken in 2012. This section is based on an experimental  mine  plan  proposed  by  Real  and  Caupers  (2012)  which  draws  upon  the conclusions from the trade-off study.  The study suggests bench and fill would be a preferred mining method, and with access to the deposit based on a ramp at 362 m elevation and the portico  to  the  north  of  the  winery  of  Quinta  de  S.  Pedro  das  Águias.    The  ramp  would  be developed down to the 250 m elevation, currently believed to be the maximum depth of the mineralization.  From this level, there could be a second access to the surface which would ensure the natural drainage of the mine, the air outlet vent and a second entrance to the mine for safety reasons.

The access would allow for rubber-tired trucks on the 425 m and 362 m levels to transport both ore and waste to surface and on to the proposed plant location.  Ventilation is planned with the entry of air through the upper access ramps and ventilation stack with the exhaust being drawn from the gallery located at the250 m level.

Figure 18-1 shows a three dimensional view suggested in the preliminary infrastructure study by Real and Caupers (2012). The bypass is designed to avoid haul trucks crossing the main N323 road.

The  main  underground  infrastructure  of  the  mine,  such  as  main  ramps,  underground workshops and hanging wall galleries will be located whenever possible within the granite to improve the stability of the excavation and reduce support costs.

Real and Caupers (2012) propose a phase of trail mining to include;

-  Gallery  access  at  332.5  m  level,  located  at  the  footwall  of  the  deposit  with  a  length  of approximately 60 m; and
-  Sinking an exploratory shaft, 4 m in diameter and 60 m deep.
- The  Real  and  Caupers  (2012)  study  suggests  that  the  trial  mining  developments  could generate approximately 1,500t of ore and 2,300t of waste for a collective total of 3,800t of material to be extracted.

Figure 18-1 Three dimensional view of the mining infrastructure (after Real and Caupers, 2012).

## 18.1.1 Power

The project area is well serviced by the national grid, with a high-voltage 60kVa power line passing immediately adjacent to the project along the N323 highway between Granjinha and Quintã.  The entity responsible for the power infrastructure and main supplier of both base load  and  renewable  power  in  Portugal  is  Energias  de  Portugal  (EDP),  formally  known  as Electricidade de Portugal.

## 18.1.2  Water

Supply  and  regulation  of  the  drinking  water  and  sewerage  is  controlled  by  the  Water  and Sanitation Regulation Agency Entidade Reguladora de Águas e Resíduos (ERSAR).  Service provision is shared between the local municipalities and the national water company, Águas de Portugal (AdP).

Potable  water  is  available  from  the  local  municipal  system  and  the  Távora  River  passes through  the  project licence  area, making it  an  option for  sourcing larger volumes  of  drilling water  subject  to  permitting.    A  further  option  is  pumping  water  from  a  number  of  existing reservoirs which are located close to the project area.

## 18.1.3  Mining Personnel

The area of northern Portugal has a long and varied mining past, with a significant number of stone quarries used for building or road building still evident in operation in the area.  The metalliferous mining industry in northern Portugal is relatively small scale compared to global standards, however the area hosts the Panasqueria Tin-Tungsten mine, located in Covilha, Castelo  Branco,  which  is  one  of  the  world's  main  producers  of  Tungsten.    The  nearest concentration of modern metalliferous mines in Portugal is found in the Iberian Pyrite Belt to the  south.    Additional  skilled  workers  are  potentially  available  from  Spain  and  other  EU countries with areas of existing or historic Tungsten or other metalliferous underground mines.

## 18.1.4  Port

The closest ports to the project site are 'The Port of Leixões' and 'The Port of Lisbon'.  The Port of Leixões is an artificial harbour comprising two breakwaters, 1.6 km and 1.1 km long,

located 9 km north of Porto at Matosinhos.  It has been developed specially for the export of wine but does have container-park gantries and heavy cranes capable of handling Panamaxtype container ships.  The Port of Lisbon is the premier commercial port in Portugal handling over  12  Mt  of  containerized  cargo  and  solid  bulk materials  (2010).    Container facilities  are developed on both banks of the River Tejo equipped to deal with over 3,000 vessels annually.

A third port with deep water facilities is The Port of Setúbal which formerly had a concession to Almina/Somincor/EDP to export ore concentrates from Aljustrel and Neves-Corvo mines.  It has a 126 m long pier by a 19,000 m  park with dedicated railroad and service facilities. 2

## 18.1.5  Buildings and Ancillary Facilities

The preliminary infrastructure study reports that there are currently, no buildings located on the  property  adaptable  for  mining  purposes  and      established  campsite.  Lodging  for  the operations personnel required during any trial mining phase will need to be supported in the near-by town of Tabuaço.

## 18.1.6  Potential Waste Disposal Areas

Real and Caupers (2012) estimated that 2,300t of waste rock will be extracted from the trial mine  phase.    The  waste  rock  disposal  site  must  have  the  least  possible  impact  on  the vineyard, using to this end uncultivated land or land currently planted with olive trees.

## 18.1.7  Potential Processing Plant Sites and Tailings Management Areas

A multi-criteria analysis is currently ongoing to establish the optimal location for processing facilities  and  tailings  management  area.    Four  areas  are  being  considered  using  criteria including, but not limited to, the following:

-  Location at an economically cost-effective distance from the mine site;
-  Relief not too uneven to accommodate tailings and  minimize entrainment of solids during heavy rainfall;
-  Sufficient  capacity    to  accommodate  waste  which  is  not  suitable  to  be  used  as  fill material underground;
-  Location of the infrastructure within the same catchment area with minimal impact on watercourses and runoff ;
-  Shortest  possible  distances  and  differences  in  elevation  so  as  to  minimize cost  on roads, pipes pumping etc.;
-  Economically  cost  effective  distances  to  source  of  fill  material  for  construction  of dykes and platforms;
-  Areas not affected by the existence of habitats of endangered species;
-  Location that minimizes impacts on flora, fauna and aquifers, and containable in case of accidents and has minimal risk from geological or seismic hazards;
-  Land use of low economic value or potential and within the same administrative area;
-  Minimal negative visual impacts to the  community and from noise, dust generation and effluent discharge;
-  Constraints related to power transmission lines, water pipes, roads, REN and RAN (National  Ecological  Reserve  and  National  Agricultural  Reserve),  PDM  and  other instruments of planning and land management;
-  Ability to negotiate and deal sensibly with affected landowners;
-  Ease of implementing solutions for mine closure and reclamation.

The four areas currently under consideration are Azenha Velha, Lavandeiras, Passa Frio and

Patalão. The sites that currently best meet the criteria are Passa Frio and Patalão, which are both located on the edge of the granite plateau between 600 m and 800 m elevation on the western side of the Távora Valley, which is the same side of the valley as the deposits and located within the same administrative municipality of Tabuaço.

## 25  INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS

The Tabuaço Project comprises two distinct skarn horizons in close proximity to a granitoid intrusion.    The  current  updated  Mineral  Resource  contains  a  core  indicated  component suitable to convert to an situ mineable resource on which to proceed with a preliminary mine design and trial mine development.

SRK would anticipate that further exploration and drilling on the Quinta da Aveleira deposit and adjacent areas has high potential to outline and define additional tungsten resources.

There are numerous surface exposures of similar rocks in the region and several of these have already been sampled and shown to carry anomalous tungsten grades. The prospects of further economic mineralisation within the Tabuaço Project Area are therefore good, though in all probability a large part of these will be small in size.

Given the natural beauty of the area, the concept of a number of small low impact deposits feeding in to a centralised processing facility may be appealing.

SRK  considers  the  delineation  of  a  Mineral  Resource  at  Tabuaço  to  be  an  exciting development not only for Colt but for the region and Portugal. Tungsten and tin occurrences are quite widespread in northern part of Portugal.

## 26  RECOMMENDATIONS

## 26.1  Recommended Work Programmes

## 26.1.1  Drilling

SRK notes that there is a lack of grade continuity in  some  parts  of  the  upper  Main  Skarn horizon. A short programme of 4 further infill holes is proposed to resolve this between section lines 1250N and 1325N.

COLT has planned 10 holes to expand the inferred resource area at Aveleira. Should this programme  demonstrate  continuity  then  a  further  20  holes  may  be  warranted  to  infill  and expand the resource into the Aveleira gap area.

A total of 20 holes would be warranted to explore and test extent of mineralisation at Quintã and north-westward to Távora and beyond along strike.

The cost of the combined drilling programmes is outlined below and is inclusive of all drilling, assaying, manpower and QA/QC programmes.

## 26.1.2  Metallurgical and Process Testwork

SRK  recognises  the  need  to  expand  upon  results  from  scoping  level  testwork,  and  that additional metallurgical studies need to be conducted, including the possibility of pilot  plant testing of a 20t sample to be taken from either the centreline of the proposed gallery or the shaft in advance of trial extraction.

The cost of a pilot metallurgical testwork is estimated below.

## 26.1.3  Geotechnical

SRK recognises that the condition of both the hangingwall and footwall presents a significant cost and risk factor in the viability of the proposed mining method. A specific programme of geotechnical drilling is proposed of 20 orientated drillholes to better understand the structure, density  and  conditions  of  fracturing  and  obtain  sample  for  rock  mechanic  characterization. Initially the holes should be located in the vicinity of the development and ventilation shafts and  along  the  line  of  the  trial  gallery  and  later  along  the  line  of  the  main  access  drive, ventilation adit and proposed locations for major underground infrastructure.

## 26.1.4  Hydrological and Environmental Studies

SRK notes that there has been limited hydrological and hydrogeological investigation on the deposit.  SRK  recommends  that  a  desk  top  study  is  initiated  to  identify  both  surface  and groundwater conditions and identify major structures  which  have the  potential  to  discharge into  any underground development. Existing drillholes should be identified for installation of monitoring piezometers to better understand groundwater conditions.

## 26.1.5  Resource Update and DFS

SRK recommends a further  update  of  the  resource  during  Q1  2013  to  lead  into  a  Design Feasibility Study. Estimated costs are outlined below.

## 26.1.6  Marketing

Given  that  tungsten  presents  a  niche  market  with  few  players  SRK  recommends  that  Colt investigate the options for off-take agreements.

## 26.1.7  Surface Acquisition Rights

SRK  understands  negotiations  are  ongoing  to  acquire  the  surface  rights  to  the  preferred location of the process facility and a conclusion should be reached as quickly as possible.

## 26.1.8  Trial Mining at QSPA

SRK recommends a specialised engineering contractor to be engaged to undertake the trial mine development in Q4 0f 2012 in order to generate geotechnical and metallurgical data to be used in the initial phase of the DFS.

## 26.1.9  Estimated Costs

The recommend work programmes detailed above have been given a cost estimates by SRK and are illustrated, along with other details, in Table 26-1 below.
