## 1.0 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

MDN Inc. (MDN) commissioned Met-Chem Canada Inc. (Met-Chem) to carry out the scoping  study  of  the  Crevier  niobium  and  tantalum  deposit,  North  of  Lac  Saint-Jean, Quebec. This technical report is prepared in accordance with the Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects as defined by NI 43-101.

The geology and exploration data are a summarization of the 'Technical Report Niobium and  Tantalum  resource  estimation  of  the  Crevier  deposit,  North  of  the  Lac-Saint-Jean, Quebec, Canada, effective date of resource estimates May 25, 2009', prepared by SGS Geostat Ltd., now SGS Canada Inc.

The Crevier Property is located in the Crevier and Lagorce Townships in the MRC of Maria-Chapdelaine, Roberval County. The property is located North of Lac St-Jean area and  the  nearest  city  with  all  major  services  is  Dolbeau-Mistassini  about  85  km  to  the South.

The  property  is  centered  on  latitude  49°30'  North  and  longitude  72°49'  West  (SNRC system,  map  reference  is  32H/07).  The  property  covers  83  claims  totalling  an  area  of 4,645.45 hectares.

The property lies within the Lac à la Truite basin in the valley of the Rivière à la Truite. The lake is approximately 330 meters above sea level. This shallow depth lake covers the central part of the Crevier Property. The hills are about 20 meters higher than the lake in the northern part while the southern hills are about 100 meters above lake elevation.

The Crevier mineral deposit was discovered by SOQUEM in 1975. From 1975 to 1986, SOQUEM carried out various phases of exploration on the property. SOQUEM, in 1986, was in  the  process  of  a  partial  privatization  of  its  producing  assets  and  formed  a  new company  named  Cambior.  The  ownership  of  the  Crevier  Property  was  transferred  to Cambior during this privatization process. In 2006, Cambior was bought by IAMGOLD which became the owner of the Crevier Property. In April 2008, Les Minéraux Crevier Inc. (Crevier) bought the property from IAMGOLD.

The  igneous  alkaline  Crevier  complex,  25  km   wide,  is  part  of  a  gneissic  Grenville 2 formation. The origin, according to some authors, is associated with the major Saguenay Graben structures, which has given an alkaline metasomatic rim to the Grenville rocks.

The alkaline complex is divided into three (3) main lithological units (Units 1 to 3), the fourth unit being the Grenville rocks. These main units are composed of many specific distinct lithological units, defined by local mapping and diamond drilling.

- · The first unit represents the major north-western part of the complex; its elongated shape is aligned along a North 320° axis. The composition is an alternating suite of bands  of  biotite-carbonate  syenites,  nepheline  syenites,  nepheline  syenites  with biotite and carbonatites with an orientation between North 300° and North 340°;

- · The second unit mainly covers the south of the complex, but is also present in a 300 meter  thick  band  surrounding  the  first  unit.  The  composition  is  mainly nepheline  syenite  with  nepheline-biotite  syenite  dykes  crossing  the  formations along North 320°;
- · The third unit is very small and is located in the south-western part of the complex, inside the second unit and is characterized by a large amount of syenite.

The chronologic sequence of the deposition of the Crevier complex is as follows:

- · Alkaline metasomatism preceding the complex intrusion;
- · Deposition of the nepheline-biotite syenites;
- · Emplacement of carbonate-biotite melanosyenite;
- · Carbonatite injection;
- · Intrusion of nepheline syenite dykes and biotite syenites.

The mineralized tantalum-niobium zone, associated with a porphyritic nepheline syenite dyke, is located in the southern part of the Crevier alkaline intrusive and extends some three (3) kilometers. The 20 meter thick dyke, oriented along North 320° and dipping to the North at 80° to 85°, is generally composed (95%) of nepheline syenite of pegmatitic texture containing large feldspar crystals and nepheline having variable grain size from a few centimeters to close to one meter in certain areas.

A total of 105 diamond drill holes were completed by previous owners, 72 by SOQUEM and 33 by Cambior. The hole spacing was approximately 50 meters on section with a spacing of 100 to 300 meters between sections. These holes were sampled generally at 1.5  meter  intervals  and  assayed  for  oxides  and  particulary  Nb2O5  and  Ta2O5.  Results show that the niobium grade varies along strike and decreases from South to North while the  dyke  width  increases  towards  the  North.  SGS  Geostat  analysis  has  highlighted  a continuity axis striking North and dipping at 45°. This will need to be analysed from the latest  exploration  work  performed  in  2009.  Tantalum  is  found  within  the  niobium pyrochlore mineral grain in a ratio of 1 to 10.

The original assay intervals were standardized into 2.5 m composites. A capping analysis was  performed  on  the  composites  and  outliers  were  capped  based  on  the  statistical analysis.

Independent sampling by SGS Geostat lead to the resource estimation using the two (2) different sources of historical data for the same sector. The results showed a significant difference  which  was  investigated.  Based  on  studies  done  during  this  evaluation,  SGS Geostat  reduced  the  Nb2O5  grades  by  19%  and  the  Ta2O5  grades  by  13%  for  all  the SOQUEM composites used in the estimation to correct bias concerns.

SGS Geostat used interpolation parameters based on drill spacing, variograms, envelope extension and orientation to estimate the average grade of Nb2O5 (%) and Ta2O5 (in ppm) within  the  three  (3)  mineralized  envelopes.  A  Final  Mineral  Resource  estimate  for  the

property  was  completed  by  SGS  Geostat  using  all  the  historical  data  with  corrected SOQUEM diamond drill hole grades.

The classification method used is the simple search ellipsoid technique, where classification is done by the amount of composites within a specific search radius of the block. In general, for the Project and drilling intensity, it shows reliable classification.

At  this  stage  not  having  the  trench  data  computerized,  SGS  Geostat  has  not  presented measured resources in its May 2009 resource technical report. Additional infill drilling of 2009, not included in this report, should help in defining measured resources.

For indicated resource classification, a search ellipsoid of 175 m North (as per the local grid), 125 m down dip 80°, 15 m across dip (East down 10°, as per the local grid) is used with a minimum of four (4) composites with maximum of two (2) from the same hole. The remaining blocks are classified as inferred.

Met-Chem was mandated to look at various alternatives to mine the deposit based on the SGS Geostat resource block model (effective date May 25, 2009).

The  proposed  mining  production  rate  for  the  Project  to  be  mined  by  open  pit  or underground  mining  methods  has  been  established  at  2,740  tonnes  per  day  or  1.0  M tonnes per year.

Preliminary  geotechnical  parameters  were  developed  using  rock  mass  classification methods.  Based  on  core  and  outcrop  observations,  all  rock  types  are  considered  and qualified  as  competent  rock.  Based  on  the  RMR  rock  mass  classification  system,  rock may be qualified as very good to excellent rock. Presence of shear or fault zones indicate that  further  investigations  would  be  required  for  the  interpretation  of  the  structural features observed in the core.

For  the  preliminary  open  pit  design,  the  recommended  mining  slope  parameter  is 55° interramp. This value is considered suitable at this stage of the study. However, the available  information  and  data  indicate  the  possibility  to  increase  it  up  to  60°,  giving access  to  additional  tonnage.  However,  in  order  to  optimize  the  final  pit  wall  or  to increase slope angles, rock strength tests will be needed to confirm preliminary results.

The  cut-off  grade  used  for  pit  design  is  based  on  both  the  Nb2O5  and  Ta2O5  content. Based on estimated mine and mill operating costs, estimated mill and refinery recovery and sales price, the resulting Nb2O5 equivalent cut-off grade is estimated at 0.1087 %.

The economic pit limits were evaluated using the EPIT optimizer module of MineSightTM mine planning software, based on 3D Lerch-Grossman algorithm. A final economic pit shell (ultimate pit), delineated 25.4 Mt of indicated and 0.9 Mt of inferred resources (at a stripping ratio of 5.8 to 1) amenable to open pit mining. From this pit shell an engineered pit complete with ramps, and catch benches was designed. The resulting engineered pit recovers 25.8 Mt (or 98.3%) of the economic pit resources and increases the stripping ratio to 6.4 (10% increase) due to placement of the main ramps.

The  PEA  is  preliminary  in  nature  and  it  includes  Inferred  mineral  resources  that  are considered too speculative geologically to have the economic considerations applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves. There is no certainty that the conclusions reached in the PEA will be realized. Mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability.

A 25 year mine plan was developed from the pit design based on a production rate of about  1.0  Mtpy  of  mineral,  an  external  dilution  factor  of  5%  (at  zero  grade)  and  a mineable recovery factor of 95% for uncontrollable losses during mining.

A review of the underground mining potential of the deposit was made early in this study. Mining of the portion  of  the  mineral  deposit  below  the  economic  pit  limits  as  well  as mining  the  entire  mineral  deposit  with  underground  methods  was  reviewed.  It  was determined that, based on sub-level open stoping method and taking into consideration

mining cost as well as the process and services costs and sales price, results showed a profit well below the profit for mining the same deposit using an open pit method. It was therefore decided not to pursue the underground mining option early in the study.

The current metallurgical flow sheets and design criteria are based primarily on the test work reports from SGS Lakefield Research Limited (SGS Lakefield) and the operating experience of Met-Chem personnel.

The main concern in the development of the process was the amount of test work done on an unconventional mineral deposit. Met-Chem supports SGS Lakefield recommendations that  future  test  work  should  focus  on  minimizing  potential  unstable  operating  plant conditions.

Metallurgical  test  work  completed  by  SOQUEM  and  Cambior,  demonstrates  that  a niobium  (pyrochlore)  concentrate  can  be  produced  by  a  combination  of  standard industrial processes or treatment.

The current expected metallurgical recovery at the flotation circuit for this mineralisation based on laboratory test work averaged 70%. The tests indicate that recovery might range between 60% and 80%. The refining recovery is expected to be 96% from the concentrate yielding an overall recovery of 67.2%.

The plant capacity is designed to process one (1) Mtpy of mineral, while working 365 days per year, 24 hours per day with an overall plant availability of 96%.

Due  to  their  characteristics,  the  tailings  will  be  managed  in  two  (2)  separate  tailings ponds.  The  first  pond  will  receive  the  residue  from  the  flotation  process  which  will produce  more  than  95%  of  the  tailings.  Results  of  analysis  of  total  metal  content  and leaching  tests  conducted  on  the  mineral  show  that  tailings  generated  in  the  flotation process are considered low risk for environmental contamination. The second pond will receive  the  residues  from  the  refinery,  which  represents  less  than  5%  of  the  tailings. Because of the type of process, the chemicals used and the expected quantities of fluorine associated  with  the  process,  the  residues  produced  at  the  refinery  are  considered  as  a higher  environmental  risk.  However,  it  is  to  be  noted  that  only  one  sample  has  been characterized  at  this  point.  Thorough  environmental  characterization  of  both  types  of tailings will need to be confirmed to validate the method of tailings management.

The off-site infrastructure required for the Project includes:

- · A Class II access road to be built starting at km 30 from the end of pavement on Route R0206,  opening an access to the site from the South, by way  of 2.5 kilometers of road upgrading and 7.3 kilometers of road building. Some class IV roads exist but need to be upgraded or rebuilt.
- · A transmission line from Normandin substation about 90 km from the site. Since the Hydro-Québec study is not yet available, Hydro-Québec L rate was used in this Project. Based on this rate, the unit consumption cost for the Project is estimated at: $0.04318/kWh.

The on-site infrastructure required for the Project includes:

- · Electrical sub-station and power distribution;
- · Office building and gatehouse;
- · Class IV service road to the tailings pond;
- · Assay laboratory;
- · Three  (3)  warehouses,  two  (2)  for  storage  of  chemical  materials  and  one  (1)  for equipment and spare part storage;
- · A garage with four (4) maintenance bays;
- · Satellite  antenna  at  the  mine  to  provide  telephone  communications  and  internet access;
- · A pumping station near Lake Kapapapmeutanu for an estimate of 20 m /h process 3 water requirement;
- · Domestic water from a pumping station at Lake Kapapapmeutanu for human use such as showers, toilets, etc.;
- · Bottled potable water;
- · Two (2) large diesel tanks for one week consumption and one small gasoline tank for light vehicles complete with a supply station and a concrete containment basin fitted with an oil separator;
- · A  domestic  wastewater  treatment  system  comprised  of  a  septic  tank  and  an infiltration bed.

The following comments on the environment apply to the Project:

- · According to information obtained from the Department of Natural Resources and Wildlife (MRNF) and the Ministry of Sustainable Development, Environment and Parks  (MDDEP),  no  mention  of  plants  threatened,  vulnerable  or  likely  to  be  so designated  is  reported  for  the  area  covered  by  the  Project.  No  exceptional  forest ecosystem is listed in the study area;
- · Regarding land use, in addition to forestry activities, the area under study is used for  vacation  and  for  hunting  and  fishing  while  the  Mistassini  River  is  used  for various recreational activities including canoe-camping;
- · Federal procedures do not apply to the Project. The rate of mining and processing proposed for the Crevier Project is less than the current threshold for submission to the Environmental Impact Assessment and Review Regulation (7,000 t/d) and less than  the  proposed  new  threshold  published  in  the  Québec  Mineral  Strategy, released  June  29,  2009  (3,000  t/d);  therefore  an  evaluation  study  and  review  of environmental impacts will not be required;

<!-- image -->

- · However, as per Article 22 of the Environment Quality Act, an application for a certificate of approval  will  have  to  be  sent  to  the  Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean Regional bureau of the Department of Sustainable Development, Environment and Parks  (MDDEP).  This  application  must  be  accompanied  by  an  environmental assessment sufficiently detailed and meeting the requirements of Directive 019 of the mining industry so that the MDDEP can rule on the acceptability of the Project. This type of approval process does not require public hearings;
- · Three  (3)  rock  samples  (two  (2)  waste  rock  and  one  mineral)  representatives  of waste  rock  and  mineral  to  be  mined  were  characterized.  The  waste  rock  and  the mineral  samples  analyzed  are  not  considered  generators  of  acid  mine  drainage. Results regarding total metal content indicate that the three (3) samples, according to Directive 019 , waste rock and mineralisation are considered as low-risk. Results regarding  leaching  tests  performed  on  the  three  (3)  samples  indicate  that  only cadmium, lead and zinc exceeded the criterion of resurgence in the surface waters of  the  Soil  Protection  and  Contaminated  Land  Rehabilitation  Policy.  Radioactive elements should not be an issue in the context of this Project;
- · Preliminary  mitigation  measures  have  been  identified  for  the  following  Project activities:
- · Management of overburden for protection against erosion;
- · Management of waste rock;
- · Tailings management;
- · Water management.
- · A rehabilitation and restoration plan is required for submission to the Minister for approval before commencing mining activities;
- · The mining property is located in the traditional ancestral territory (Nitassinan) of Pekuakamiulnuatsh ( Montagnais du Lac-Saint-Jean ). It is the subject of land claims by the First Nation of Mashteuiatsh;
- · The Agreement-in-principle, signed in March 2004, includes several references to the exploitation of natural resources, including minerals, but it does not provide for payment  of additional royalties (i.e., other than those already paid to the Government  of  Quebec).  Instead,  the  Innu  tshishe  utshimaut,  the  future  Innu government will be entitled to a share (no less than 3%) of the royalties collected by Quebec on the natural resources of Nitassinan;
- · Regarding  Innu  land  use,  the  mining  property  is  located  in  the  Roberval  beaver reserve. In a later phase, contacts should be established to identify the Ilnu families managing the territory corresponding to the mining property.

The schedule to complete the remaining studies (metallurgical tests works, environmental studies,  geotechnical  investigation  and  feasibility  study)  and  execute  the  EPCM  is estimated at 34 months.

The  capital  cost  estimate  that  covers  the  Project  for  niobium  and  tantalum  production includes the work required to develop the mine, built the mineral processing facilities and establish all the site and off-site infrastructure and services necessary to support the mine site. The cost estimate is based on Met-Chem's standard methods applicable for a scoping study to achieve an accuracy level of ± 35%. The base date for the cost estimate is the third quarter of 2009.

The initial capital cost for the scope of work is $267.1 M of which $185.1 M are direct costs and $82.0 M are indirect costs.

Operating costs are subdivided into manpower, electrical power, reagents and consumables. These costs were derived from supplier information, Met-Chem's database or factored from similar operations. The process operating cost is estimated at $29.00 /t.

The  general  and  administration  costs  for  the  Project  are  estimated  at  $3.2  M/y  of operation and include costs for manpower as well as costs for material and services.

Mine  operating  costs  were  established  by  Met-Chem  for  mineral  mining,  as  well  as overburden  and  waste  removal.  These  costs  were  estimated  based  on  information provided  by  suppliers  and  on  manpower  rates  provided  by  the  client.  The  mining operating average cost is estimated at $2.39 /t.

A pre-tax Project cash flow analysis has been completed for the Crevier Scoping Project based on a production rate of 2,740 tpd. The model reflects fourth quarter 2009 pricing. Some scenarios were prepared to improve the Project economics and analyze the Project sensitivity to the niobium selling price, the power line impact, the flotation recovery and the production rate.

The following Table ES 3 lists the main technical assumptions used in the Base Case cost estimate. The initial capital cost for the Project is estimated at $267 M.

Table ES 3 - Technical Assumptions

| Total mineral mined (LOM)   | 000' t   | 25,838   |
|-----------------------------|----------|----------|
| Average grade to mill Nb2O5 | %        | 0.170    |
| Average grade to mill Ta2O5 | ppm      | 180.5    |
| Processing Rate             | t/d      | 2,740    |
| Flotation Recovery          | %        | 70       |
| Refinery Recovery           | %        | 96       |
| Recoverable product Nb2O5   | 000' kg  | 29,462   |
| Recoverable product K2TaF7  | 000' kg  | 3,134    |

The Net Present Value (NPV) at a 5% discount rate and the Internal Rate of Return (IRR) for  the  Base  Case (70% flotation recovery and 96% refinery recovery) were calculated from the cash flow statement. The economic analysis indicates a positive NPV at a 5% discount rate of $103.8 M and an IRR of 7.7% for the Base Case using a sales price of

US$51.50  per  kilo  for  oxide  niobium  product  and  an  initial  capital  cost  that  includes construction cost of the power line.

The  PEA  is  preliminary  in  nature  and  it  includes  Inferred  mineral  resources  that  are considered too speculative geologically to have the economic considerations applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves. There is no certainty that the conclusions reached in the PEA will be realized. Mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability.

Efforts have been made to identify additional scenarios to improve the economics of the Project. Three (3) additional scenarios to the Base Case (niobium oxide selling price of US$51.50 and power line cost included) were added to the analysis based on increased production rates of 3,500 t/d, 4,000 t/d and 4,500 t/d.

Capital and operating costs estimates were factorized for the different production rates and used to develop corresponding cash flows. This data should be used only to have an order of magnitude. An amount corresponding to $ 1.0 M was added to the production rate  scenarios Indirect Costs to cover for the Environmental Impact Assessment that is expected to be required for these cases. Results based on the production rate scenarios are presented in Table ES 4.

The  results  at  a  flotation  recovery  of  70%  indicate  that  the  Base  Case  at  a  NPV  of $103.8 M may not be an optimized scenario. As shown in the table, for an additional 10% of  capital  cost,  the  NPV  is  almost  doubled  at  the  3,500  t/d  scenario.  The  4,000  t/d scenario indicates that for an additional $15 M in capital investment the gain on the NPV is an additional $30 M.

As  shown  in  the  Table  ES  4,  a  flotation  recovery  of  72%  increases  the  IRR  by approximately one point.

The economic analysis indicates a positive NPV at a 5% discount rate of $ 233.5 M and an IRR of 12.7% based on a flotation recovery of 70% and a production rate of 4,000 t/d while the NPV and IRR increase to $271.9 M and 13.9% for a flotation recovery of 72% and the same production rate.

Production rate: 3,500 t/d

Production rate: 4,000 t/d

Production rate: 4,500 t/d

## 2.0 INTRODUCTION AND TERMS OF REFERENCE

## 2.1 General

Les  Minéraux  Crevier  Inc.  (Crevier)  is  a  Montreal  based  company  contemplating  a Project for the construction, installation and operation of niobium  and  tantalum processing  facilities  to  be  located  approximately  100  km  North  of  St-Félicien,  Quebec (the Project).

On  April  14,  2009,  MDN  Inc.  (MDN)  entered  into  an  agreement  with  Crevier  which provides MDN with an option to acquire, over a three (3) years period, a majority equity interest  in  Crevier  in  return  for  funding  the  development  and  feasibility  study  of  a NI 43-101 compliant niobium and tantalum resource for the Project.

A mineral resource estimate was reported in a NI 43-101 compliant technical report by SGS Geostat and titled: 'Technical Report Niobium and Tantalum resource estimation of the  Crevier  deposit,  North  of  Lac  Saint-Jean,  Quebec,  Canada'  dated  May 25,  2009 available on SEDAR which is effective date and current resource estimates.

Met-Chem  Canada  Inc.  (Met-Chem)  was  requested  by  Crevier  to  provide  a  Scoping Study  Report  for  the  exploitation  of  the  Crevier  deposit.  The  process  flow  sheets developed  are  based  on  work  performed  by  SGS  Lakefield  to  produce  niobium  oxide (Nb2O5) and tantalum K-salt (K2TaF7). The capital cost and the operating cost estimates have been developed for a production rate of 2,740 t/d, to an accuracy of ± 35%.

Efforts have been made to identify additional scenarios to improve the economics of the Project.  Three  (3)  additional  scenarios,  factorized  from  the  original  Base  Case,  were added  to  the  analysis  based  on  increased  production  rates  of  3,500  t/d,  4,000  t/d  and 4,500 t/d.

## 5.0 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE AND PHYSIOGRAPHY

## 5.1 Accessibility

A  gravel  road  from  Girardville  gives  access  to  the  property  (see  Figure  5.1).  It  is approximately 70 km north of the village. The main road follows the Mistassini River. This all-weather road is numbered RO206.

The northern portion of the property can be accessed via a small gravel road connecting to  RO206  at  kilometer  42;  this  road  is  used  to  access  the  neighbourhood  of Lac-à-laTruite cabins and fishing camps. The southern portion of the property is accessed from kilometer 33  (see  Figure  5.2)  on  the  RO206  by  following  a  series  of  secondary  gravel roads. These small access roads are only used in the summer.

## 5.3 Local Resources

The region north of Lac Saint-Jean has an extensive agricultural and forestry industry. The  region  has  a  significant  hydro-power  dam  system  to  supply  electricity  to  the aluminum  production  and  transformation  industry.  The  mining  operations  are  mainly quarries  for  aggregates  and  dimensional  stone.  However,  a  niobium  mine,  Niobec, located 250 km east of the Crevier property is owned and operated by IAMGOLD.

Even if the region is not a mining area, qualified personnel may be found in the region. The  University  of  Quebec  in  Chicoutimi  has  a  well  developed  geological  department. The Chibougamau area, not far from the Project, also offers mining facilities. The village of  Girardville  can  provide  basic  needs  such  as  food  and  limited  accommodation, Dolbeau-Mistassini  can  provide  more  services.  Several  surrounding  cities  with  their distinct services also provide extensive contractor services and supplies within a 200 km radius.

## 5.4 Infrastructure

The only infrastructure at the site is the access road which is generally in good condition but will need some repairs and culvert replacements due to beaver activities. The property area  is  large  enough  to  support  mining  operations,  infrastructure,  processing  facilities, waste rock storage and tailings storage. The nearest power line is the major transmission line from Chute-des-Passes. Another power line which the Project could connect to is at the former wollastonite project (Orleans Resources) near Saint-Ludger-de-Milot. Otherwise the Project will need to build its own power line to connect to the Normandin Hydro Quebec main substation located 80 km from the Project.

## 5.5 Physiography

The property lies within the Lac-à-la-Truite Basin in the valley of the Rivière à la Truite . The lake is approximately 330 m above sea level. The lake of shallow depth covers the central  part  of  the  Crevier  igneous  complex  (see  Photo  5.1).  The  hills  are  about  20  m higher than the lake in the northern part while the southern hills are about 100 m above lake elevation.

The area was logged in the 1980s; there is presently little mature commercial wood left in the area of interest. There is no major difference in erosion pattern between the mineral and the surrounding rocks and the surface is relatively smooth. One remarkable aspect of the small scale erosion pattern was observed on outcrops where the porphyry texture is observed  with  the  matrix  protruding  while  the  nepheline  crystals  are  lightly  carved inward.

## 6.0 HISTORY

For  details  on  the  Crevier  property  history  the  reader  should  refer  to  the  SGS  Geostat (2009) report. The following sections summarize information from this report.

## 6.1 Ownership History

The Crevier mineral deposit was discovered by SOQUEM in 1975. From 1975 to 1986, SOQUEM carried out different phases of exploration on the property. In 1986, SOQUEM privatized some of its producing assets and formed a new company named Cambior and the ownership of the Crevier Property was transferred to Cambior. In April 2008, Crevier Minerals Inc. bought the property from IAMGOLD, current owner of Cambior.

A summary of past exploration work is given in Table 6.1.

## 6.2 Exploration and Historical Mineral Resources (not NI 43-101 compliant)

Details  regarding  exploration  work  on  the  Crevier  property  are  provided  in  the  SGS Geostat  (2009)  report.  The  following  is  a  summary  of  the  information  provided  on historical mineral resources in the SGS Geostat (2009) report.

Exploration summary reports were produced for 1975, 1976 and 1978 and are detailed in SGS Geostat (2009).

The  first  historical  "reserve"  summary  was  prepared  in  1980  and  showed  a  total  of 15,838,000  tonnes  (not  NI  43-101  compliant),  with  Nb2O5  grading  0.204%  and  Ta2O5

<!-- image -->

grading 212 ppm. The Historical "reserves" were qualified as semi-measured, indicated and semi-indicated categories (not NI 43-101 compliant).

A  second  historical  preliminary  "reserves"  estimation,  prepared  in  1981,  between  the surface and level -300 meters showed 32,178,000 tonnes of mineral at 0.188% Nb2O5 and 203 ppm of Ta2O5 (not NI 43-101 compliant). These "reserves" were classified as semimeasured,  indicated  and  semi-indicated.  An  extra  28,500,000  tonnes  was  added  in  the potential category, but no grade was attributed to them (not NI 43-101 compliant).

Various research programs and studies done in 1982, 1983 and 1986 are summarized in SGS Geostat (2009).

A description of the drilling campaign conducted by Cambior in 2002 is given in SGS Geostat (2009).

## 6.3 Present Cost (2008) of Past Exploration Work

An  estimation  of  the  costs,  in  2008  dollar  value,  of  past  exploration  work  excluding metallurgical  tests  is  given  in  SGS  Geostat  (2009).  This  estimate  includes  a  total  of 17,124  m  of  diamond  drill  in  105  holes  along  with  exploration  work  such  as:  line cuttings,  geophysics,  mapping,  drilling,  surveying  and  engineering  studies.  The  cost  is estimated to be between $4.5 M and $5.0 M.

## 7.0 GEOLOGICAL SETTING

For  details  on  the  Crevier  property  geological  setting,  the  reader  should  refer  to  SGS Geostat (2009) report. The following sections have been taken from this report.

## 7.1 Regional Geology

It  is  generally  understood  that  the  Crevier  intrusive  complex  was  injected  along  the Wasnanipi-Saguenay  couloirs,  a  major  lineament  going  north  from  the  St.  Lawrence River towards the Superior and extending to the south limit of James Bay. Many alkaline injections are located along this axis, mainly St-Honoré, Crevier, the Dolbeau carbonatites dykes, the Montviel, Shortt Lake and Grevet carbonatites. Finally, there is also a series of kimberlites, such as the Desmaraisville dyke which appear to be linked to this lineament.

## 7.2 Property Geology

The geology of the complex was studied with various mapping and drilling campaigns as well as by university research projects. The results of this field work have defined the numerous facies and their relations.

The Crevier complex most likely contains four (4) separate units. Firstly there is, on the south  eastern  part,  a  near  circular  injection  of  nepheline  syenite  with  variable  biotite content going from traces to some percentages. This unit is cut by a second phase having an oblong shape with the main axis parallel to the Wasnanipi-Saguenay corridor, from north-west toward south-east (320º az).

In the south-west part of the intrusive there is a smaller mass of syenite with almost no nepheline. This mass, even though identified by two (2) drill holes, was isolated from the remaining  of  the  complex  and  was  extrapolated  by  geophysics  which  describes  its contour, therefore giving what is defined as Unit #3.

There  is  also  a  period  of  alkaline  metasomatism  that  has  affected  the  host  gneisses (Unit #4).  The  aegirine,  a  sodic  pyroxene  seems  to  be  the  main  witness  of  this  event which has happened before the intrusion of the complex.

## 8.0 DEPOSIT TYPES

For details on the Crevier property deposit types, the reader should refer to SGS Geostat (2009) report. The following has been taken from this report.

The alkaline complex is divided into three (3) main lithological units (Units 1 to 3), the fourth unit being the Grenville rocks. These main units are composed of many specific distinct lithological units, defined by local mapping and diamond drilling.

- · The first unit represents the major north-western part of the complex; its elongated shape is aligned along a North 320° axis. The composition is an alternating suite of bands  of  biotite-carbonate  syenites,  nepheline  syenites,  nepheline  syenites  with biotite and carbonatites with an orientation between North 300° and North 340°;
- · The second unit mainly covers the south of the complex, but is also present in a 300 meter  thick  band  surrounding  the  first  unit.  The  composition  is  mainly nepheline  syenite  with  nepheline-biotite  syenite  dykes  crossing  the  formations along North 320°;
- · The third unit is very small and is located in the south western part of the complex, inside the second unit and is characterized by a large amount of syenite.

The chronological sequence of the deposition of the Crevier complex is as follows:

- · Alkaline metasomatism preceding the complex intrusion;
- · Deposition of the nepheline-biotite syenites;
- · Emplacement of carbonate-biotite melanosyenite;
- · Carbonatite injection;
- · Intrusion of nepheline syenite dykes and biotite syenites.

Two (2) main mineralization types  of  economic  interest  are  present  inside  the  Crevier complex. The first type of uranium-niobium mineralization is mainly located inside the first  unit  inside  an  uranopyrochlore  unit.  The  second  mineralization  type  is  one  of niobium-tantalum  and  is  associated  with  a  pegmatite-nepheline  syenite  dyke  located inside the second unit and also inside the first unit.

Apatite is found in few spots inside the complex but is mainly located in the center part. The apatite rich zones are along the contacts inside the carbonatite dykes and inside the nepheline syenites.

The dyke is separated in four (4) lenses stretched over 4 km and has an average thickness of 20 meters. It has been recognized down to 300 meters below surface. Exploration work was  aimed  at  defining  the  exact  position  and  grade  of  the  nephyline  syenite  porphyry dyke.

## 9.0 MINERALIZATION

## 9.1 Tantalum-Niobium Lenses

For details on the Crevier property mineralization, the reader should refer to SGS Geostat (2009) report. The following has been taken from this report.

The  mineralized  tantalum-niobium  zone  is  located  in  the  southern  part  of  the  Crevier alkaline  intrusive.  Previous  field  work  such  as  stripping,  geological  mapping,  trench sampling  and  diamond  drilling  have  contributed  to  ascertain  this  mineralization  over more than three (3) kilometers long.

The  mineralization  of  the  niobium-tantalum  type  is  associated  with  a  porphyritic nepheline  syenite  dyke.  The  dyke  is  composed  of  a  minimum  of  four  (4)  sections  or distinct lenses (numbered 1 to 4). The contacts with the host rocks are clean and can be easily  seen.  The  dyke  is  generally  composed  (95%)  of  nepheline  syenite  of  pegmatitic texture containing large feldspar crystals and nepheline having variable grain sizes from a few  centimeters  to  close  to  one  meter  in  specific  areas.  Many  secondary  minerals  are observed,  mainly:  biotite,  magnetite,  pyrrhotite,  pyrite,  zirconium,  sodalite,  cancrinite, ilmenite, carbonates and pyrochlore.

The main dyke also contains 5% of secondary dykes and host rocks. The thickness of the secondary units varies from centimeters to meters.

Lens #1 is the most southern one and is located between sections 9,700N and 11,200N. This is the best known of all lenses, having been diamond drilled with twenty-four (24) holes  and  geologically  mapped  over  more  than  600  meters.  Moreover,  two  (2)  bulk samples of 100 tonnes (1980) and 876 tonnes (1981) have been processed for metallurgical  testing.  The  thickness  varies  from  3  to  25  meters,  the  average  being 19 meters.

Lens #2 is a relatively small lens (400 m long) located to the north of the #1 lens and appears as having been relocated. Its average thickness is 25 m, and has been intersected by four (4) diamond drill holes, one of them at a depth of 372 m. On the northern part, stripping and trench sampling have been done.

Lens #3 is approximately 1,200 m long and has been drilled on a grid varying from 200 to  300  m  spacing  horizontally.  Seven  (7)  drill  holes  have  intersected  it  at  a  maximum depth of 70 m. The lens is 20 m thick and is showing an 'interdigitation' relation with the #2 lens.

Lens #4 is more than 900 m long and has been delineated with three (3) drill holes 300 m apart  and  four  (4)  exploratory  trenches  which  are  more  than  900  m  long.  Its  thickness varies from 8 to 36 m (average 29 m) and is still open to the north.

## 9.2 Other Mineralization

Uranium Niobium - Tantalum mineralization is present on the property. One is labelled East  U-Nb-Ta  showing  which  is  north  of  the  main  dyke  in  the  southern  part  of  the property while the other is labelled South U-Nb-Ta showing which lays South West of the main dyke lens #1.

No  significant apatite mineralization was  observed  or  highlighted  from  work  by SOQUEM near Lac à la Truite .

Other  parameters  of  interest  such  as  zirconium  and  cerium  were  analyzed  in  Cambior exploration campaign, but these are not considered in the current commodity assessment.

## 10.0 EXPLORATION

For details on the Crevier property exploration, the reader should refer to SGS Geostat (2009) report. The following has been taken from this report.

At the time of publication, May 25, 2009, the SGS Geostat report indicated that Crevier Minerals had not carried out extensive exploration work on the property. A site visit with independent sampling by SGS Geostat was done in July 2008 in addition to preliminary gravimetric concentration tests at COREM with blasted material stored in barrels by the previous owner Cambior. This material is from the blasted trenches.

Crevier has carried out a due diligence including a resource estimation update by SGS Geostat  and  the  preparation  of  a  NI  43-101  Technical  report  with  compliant  resource estimation  and  classification.  Details  regarding  results  of  grab  samples  in  old  blasted trenches may be found in SGS Geostat (2009) report.

## 11.0 HISTORICAL DRILLING

For details on the Crevier property drilling, the reader should refer to SGS Geostat (2009) report. The following has been summarized from this report.

At the time of publication of the SGS Geostat report, May 25, 2009, Crevier Minerals had not yet started a drilling program on the property. A drilling program was recommended for 2009 but results have not been reviewed and are not part of this NI 43-101 compliant mineral resource estimate and classification.

Historical  drilling  on  the  property  has  consisted  of  BQ  diamond  drill  holes.  Historical maps show the location of some small percussion holes used to blast material near the surface for the bulk sample tests. This information is not computerized in the database.

A total of 105 diamond drill holes were completed by previous owners, 72 by SOQUEM and 33 by Cambior. Witness cores from both campaigns are stored at the Niobec mine owned by IAMGOLD in St-Honoré. SGS Geostat has visited the storage facility and has taken independent samples for data verification.

The drilling pattern is generally done with 100 m hole spacing on sections perpendicular to the dyke and with 50 to 75 m hole spacing on sections in lenses #1 and #2. Drill hole spacing further north is 200 to 300 m in lenses #3 and #4. Drill hole depth varied from 50 to 350 m.

## 12.0 SAMPLING METHOD AND APPROACH

For  details  on  the  Crevier  property  sampling  method  and  approach,  the  reader  should refer to SGS Geostat (2009) report. The following has been summarized from this report.

At the time of publication of the SGS Geostat report, May 25, 2009, Crevier Minerals Inc.  had  not  yet  started  a  drilling  program  on  the  property.  Therefore,  the  sampling method and approach described here was used by previous owners.

The  hole  spacing  was  approximately  50  meters  on  section  with  a  spacing  of  100  to 300 meters between sections. These holes were sampled generally at 1.5 meter intervals. Samples were assayed for oxides and especially Nb2O5 and Ta2O5 from pulverized half core  samples.  Results  show  that  the  niobium  grade  varies  along  strike  from  South  to North of the exploration grid, the grid being oriented 321°.

Sampling of the half core was done with a core splitter, the sample length is generally 1.5 m. The deposit is recognized over a length of 4 km and the tabular structure has an average true thickness of about 20 m.

The rock is competent and core recovery is extremely good. The samples are of good quality and are representative of the intersected rock.

The mineralized rock being of porphyry texture, the bigger the samples are, the better the reliability.  SGS  Geostat  does  not  recommend  to  drill  smaller  than  BQ  diameter  due  to porphyry texture and the mineralization being relatively coarse with pyrochlore grains of millimetric size.

## 13.0 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND SECURITY

For details on the Crevier property sample preparation, analyses and security, the reader should refer to SGS Geostat (2009) report. The following has been taken from this report.

At the time of publication of the SGS Geostat report, May 25, 2009, Crevier Minerals Inc.  had  not  yet  started  a  drilling  program  on  the  property.  Therefore,  the  sample preparation analyses and security description presented here refers to methods applied by past project owners.

## 13.1 Sample Preparation and Analysis

SOQUEM  and  CAMBIOR  historical  records  of  the  project  indicate  that  samples collected from the project consisted of:

- · Surface grab samples;
- · Channel samples;
- · Pit samples and bulk samples;
- · Test drill hole cutting samples;
- · Diamond drill core samples.

Few details are available on sample preparation of these types of sample. Core sampling involved core splitting in two (2) and witness core preservation. Pictures were taken prior to splitting by Cambior. Early exploration campaign emphasized U3O8, Nb2O5 and Ta2O5. Additional  work  mainly  aimed  at  defining  mineral  resource  estimate  for  Nb2O5  and Ta2O5.

## 13.1.1 Sample Preparation at the Laboratory

Little  information  about  laboratory  preparation  is  available  from  the  1976  -  1978 exploration campaign. Cambior used standard commercial preparation procedures.

## 13.1.2 Analysis at the Laboratory

Several laboratories were used for earlier drilling program: Bondar-Cleg, École Polytechnique, X-Ray Lab, Metriclab and C.E.A.C. Cambior had mainly used Actlab for Nb2O5 and Ta2O5 analysis.

A formal review of assay certificates was carried out by SGS Geostat. Some of the assay certificates  were  not  found,  but  SGS  Geostat  does  not  believe  that  this  influences  the quality of the information.

## 13.2 Quality Control Program

Quality control programs were initiated by previous owners. SGS Geostat indicates that there have been important issues on results of standard sample from different laboratories.  However,  SGS  Geostat  has  not  found  a  specific  report  presenting  all  the investigations with a general compilation.

<!-- image -->

## 13.3 Security

In SGS Geostat opinion, the work has been done in a professional way.

## 14.0 DATA VERIFICATION

For  details  on  the  Crevier  property  data  verification,  the  reader  should  refer  to  SGS Geostat (2009) report. The following has been taken from this report.

## 14.1 Independent Sampling

The database assay table was verified against the original paper logs on a random basis and did not find major errors.

Independent  samples  were  taken  from  witness  core  holes  (39  samples)  and  from  site blasted trenches (10 grab samples) following a preparation and sampling protocol. The sample bags were sealed and delivered to the SGS laboratory facilities at Lakefield.

## 14.2 Sample Preparation at the Laboratory

Sample preparation protocol was provided by SGS Lakefield.

## 14.3 Analysis at the Laboratory and Quality Control Program

The rock samples were first assayed at SGS Lakefield while pulp samples were also sent to ALS Chemex of Val d'Or for laboratory verification.

Differences  were  noticed  in  the  database  between  SOQUEM  results  versus  2008 commercial  laboratory  check  values.  The  remaining  pulps  were  sent  to  Niobec  mine laboratory facility  (IAMGOLD) and a second preparation took place at SGS Lakefield from  the  rejects.  In  addition  to  regular  XRF  analysis,  SGS  Lakefield  has  also  been requested by SGS Geostat to test another analytical method with acid attack and ICP to have additional data and compare analytical technique results.

Results  indicate  that  the  average  grade  of  the  whole  mineralized  intersection  from  the Cambior campaign has been reproduced while the average from the SOQUEM hole could not be reproduced.

Blanks were also introduced in the sampling sequences and showed no major signs of contamination within the detection limits.

## 14.4 Additional Independent Sampling - Phase 2

Following inconclusive reproduction of results between SGS Geostat new analytical data and old SOQUEM data in the Phase 1 independent sampling program, the decision was made to carry out a more extensive sampling program on existing witness cores. A new sampling program (October 2008), involving four (4) witness holes drilled by Cambior and two (2) witness holes drilled by SOQUEM, was designed to verify the bias between the assays.

Results confirm a bias for the SOQUEM data: the new SGS Lakefield data shows lower grade compared to the original SOQUEM data for Niobium. The Cambior holes show acceptable  variations  between  both  dataset.  Tantalum  is  in  the  acceptable  range  of variations for both companies dataset.

<!-- image -->

## 14.5 Conclusions of verification

An appropriate correction was developed for the database based on a comparison block models on the two (2) sets of data, in order to use the information for the estimation of grade  in  mineral  resource.  A  negative  correction  of  19%  for  the  Nb2O5  and  13%  for Ta2O5 in ppm for all SOQUEM data has been applied to the composites. This correction factor is based on the comparative resource estimation model and was supported by the independent SGS sampling programs.

## 16.0 MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING

The current process flow sheets and design criteria are based primarily on the test work reports  from  SGS  Lakefield  Research  Limited  (SGS  Lakefield)  and  the  operating experience of Met-Chem personnel. The technical information comes mainly from three (3) SGS Lakefield reports.

The grinding and beneficiation flow sheet was developed from the SGS Lakefield report written in 2003. SGS Lakefield reviewed the test work in 2008 and arrived at the same flow sheet. The leaching, solvent extraction, stripping and precipitation flow sheet was determined by examining the SGS Lakefield reports from 2001 and 2002 related to the refinery section of the process.

The main concern in the development of the process was the amount of test work done on an unconventional mineral deposit. In the 2008 report, SGS Lakefield recommended that more  test  work  should  be  done  to  optimize  the  comminution,  flotation  and  refining processes. SGS Lakefield reported that during laboratory flotation testing there were pH control problems  in the Nb-Ta  rougher  circuit. SGS  Lakefield  suspected  calcite interference. Met-Chem supports SGS Lakefield recommendations that future test work should focus on minimizing potential unstable operating plant conditions.

Metallurgical  test  work  completed  by  SOQUEM  and  Cambior,  demonstrates  that  a niobium  (pyrochlore)  concentrate  can  be  produced  by  a  combination  of  standard industrial processes or treatment.

The current expected metallurgical recovery at the flotation circuit for this mineral based on laboratory test work averaged 70%. The series of tests indicate that recovery might range  between  60%  and  80%.  The  refining  recovery  is  expected  to  be  96%  from  the concentrate yielding an overall recovery of 67.2%. According to information provided by Crevier,  pyrometallurgical  processing  was  previously  evaluated  but  later  discarded  for the Project due to higher investment costs.

## 16.1 Review of Beneficiation Test Work

The SGS Lakefield 2008 report is a review of all previous test work and technical reports concerning  the  Project.  The  flotation  test  work  selected  by  Crevier  for  this  study  was performed by SGS Lakefield in 2003.

SGS Lakefield test work results show that flotation of the mineral can be achieved with recovering  about  70%  metal  of  the  desired  minerals  at  the  bench  scale  level.  SGS Lakefield used Test # 9 and Test # 12 to produce the preliminary flow sheet design and the  preliminary  reagent  scheme.  The  major  problems  noted  during  these  two  (2)  tests were  with  the  pH  control  in  the  Nb-Ta  flotation  circuit.  Only  13  flotation  tests  were performed and thus the optimal flotation conditions have probably not been established.

Very little information on comminution is available and this area requires significantly more test work prior to expanding the accuracy of the mill design and layout.

<!-- image -->

Items that require more investigation include:

- · Basic comminution test work and other test work

Prior to the next study level such basic tests as Crusher Work Index Test, SAG Mill Work Index, Ball Mill Work Index and possibly re-do the Rod Mill Work Index are required.  Abrasion  tests  would  be  very  helpful,  but  are  not  critical.  Furthermore, settling tests have to be done if at all possible for thickener selection.

- · De-sliming

SGS Lakefield has performed all the flotation  tests  after  de-sliming.  It  would  be interesting  to  evaluate  flotation  results  without  de-sliming.  In  Section  3.2  of  the SGS Lakefield 2003 report, it is stated that: 'The fineness of the grind in the range tested had no effect on the Nb-Ta recoveries.' This is not completely accurate. The table lists the rougher recoveries quite similar indeed, but the finer ground material had about 10% more niobium oxide and tantalum oxide removed prior to flotation.

The relative rougher flotation feed recovery is thus significantly higher for the finer flotation  feed.  If  de-sliming  is  not  absolutely  necessary,  a  5  to  6  %  increase  in recovery  could  be  anticipated  based  on  SGS  Lakefield  preliminary  test  work. Another  item  to  be  looked  into  is  that  if  de-sliming  is  essential,  can  the  slime material  be  re-processed  separately  to  recover  the  lost  niobium  and  tantalum minerals.

- · Flow sheet development Nb-Ta cleaner flotation tailings

Met-Chem's simplified flow sheet presents a more practical solution. The changes made  were  to  the  Nb-Ta  2 nd Cleaner  Tailings  which  now  goes  to  the  Nb-Ta  1 st Cleaner  Feed  rather  than  the  Nb-Ta  Rougher  Feed,  and  similarly  the  Nb-Ta  3 rd Cleaner Tailings now goes to the Nb-Ta 2 nd Cleaner Feed rather than the Nb-Ta 1 st Cleaner Feed.

- · Specialty collectors

SGS  Lakefield  had  created  its  own  specialty  collectors  to  obtain  good  flotation results. Simplification  of  the  flotation  process  by  using  existing  commercial collectors that get similar or better results should be investigated.

- · Flow sheet development Nb-Ta flotation concentrate

The  final  Nb-Ta  concentrate  undergoes  two-stage  magnetic  separation;  the  nonmagnetic  material  is  now  sent  to  a  pre-leach  thickener  and  does  not  undergo additional separation treatment.

- · Nb-Ta Flotation Concentrate Magnetic Separation

The fourth cleaner Nb-Ta concentrate undergoes magnetic separation. According to the test work, the fourth cleaner concentrate contains 17.4% Fe2O3, 21.17% Nb2O5 and  2.617%  Ta2O5.  After  magnetic  separation,  the  non-magnetic  concentrate

<!-- image -->

contains  16.8%  Fe2O3,  22.43%  Nb2O5  and  2.767%  Ta2O5.  This  is  not  a  very significant upgrading increase. However, the Nb2O5 and Ta2O5 recovery decreased by 6.6 and 6.7% respectively. New test work will have to demonstrate that the iron removal step is indeed critical for the downstream process; otherwise the cleaner concentrate magnetic separation steps should be removed.

## · Concentrate Thickener and Filtration System

Met-Chem added a concentrate thickener and filtration system in the design since there was no bridge between the beneficiation and refining processes. The refining process  involving  leaching,  solvent  extraction,  stripping  and  precipitation  will  be treated as a separate section and therefore the thickener underflow will be stored in a filter stock tank with approximately one-day holding capacity.

## · Final Tailings Treatment

The tailings from the mill and the refinery will be treated prior to discharge to the tailings pond.  Lime  will  be  added  to  precipitate  potentially  problematic  byproducts. Test work has to be done to ensure that the proper treatment is chosen.

## 16.2 Review of Refinery Test Work

The refinery test work was designed to examine whether the classical hydrometallurgical method of metal recovery and separation of niobium and tantalum would be suitable for the concentrates. The work investigated refining the concentrate by HF/H2SO4 leach and solvent extraction.

The  test  work  established  that  the  HF/H2SO4  leaching  process  is  suitable  for  the concentrate  and  achieved  high  leach  extraction  levels  for  niobium  and  tantalum.  The work  showed  less success in solvent extraction, stripping and metal compound precipitation.  Further  test  work  must  be  done  in  these  areas.  Results  generated  little useful information for process equipment design or sizing.

The  test  work  mandate  was  limited  in  scope  and  the  followings  items  will  help  to complete the test work program:

- · A further  test  work  program  should  be  carried  out,  designed  on  the  basis  of  the results  of  the  scoping  work,  and  focussing  on  solvent  extraction,  stripping  and precipitation;
- · The Nb and Ta extraction isotherms should be confirmed by a continuous, small scale extraction test to give better information on stage requirements and equipment sizing;
- · The sensitivity  of  Nb  loading  on  MIBK  with  HF  concentration  could  be  used  to investigate alternative extraction regimes;
- · The  stripping  steps  should  be  investigated  to  decrease  cross-contamination  and improve product quality;
- · Precipitation work should be repeated.

## 17.0 MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATE

There are no NI 43-101 compliant mineral "reserves" at this stage on this Project.

For details on the Crevier property mineral resource estimate, the reader should refer to SGS Geostat (2009) report. The following has been taken from this report.

The final drill hole database used for the resource estimation of the Crevier Project is in file  Crevier.mdb  dated  November  5,  2008.  The  database  has  information  on  105  drill holes from the entire Crevier Project.

The trench and surface samples was not integrated into the database at that moment.

A database in Gemcom format was transferred to SGS Geostat from the client. A review of the database was performed by SGS Geostat leading to some corrections from original logs. The corrected database has information on 105 drill holes from the entire Crevier property. After corrections the total drill holes length in database is 17,124 m. There are 4,789  assay  records  for  %Nb2O5  and  Ta2O5  in  ppm.  There  are  555 deviation  records. There are 935 lithology records and 1,961 RQD records.

Mineralized envelopes were  then defined using geological description and grade information  along  the  drill  hole  core.  The  interpretation  of  the  mineralized  structures (Lens/Porphyry Syenite dykes) was based on documented cross sections and interpretation  from  Cambior.  In  the  SGS  Geostat  mineralized  envelope  interpretation there are three (3) lenses instead of four (4). Cambior Lenses # 1 and # 2 are combined since they merge and are relatively continuous while the lenses #2 and #3 correspond to Cambior #3 and # 4 respectively.

The original assay intervals do not have the same length. The majority of assay intervals have  a  length  of  1.5  m.  The  selectivity  of  1.5  m  is  not  commonly  achievable  in  bulk tonnage mining; therefore a 2.5 m standard length has been chosen. The capping analysis was performed on the 2.5 m length composites. The %Nb2O5 composites were capped at 0.5% and 550 ppm for Ta2O5.

A specific gravity of 2.63 t/m  was used in the report. A block model was prepared by 3 SGS Geostat. The dimensions of each block are 2.5 m (EW) by 25 m (NS) by 10 m (Z). The grades were estimated in each block of a regular matrix of 201 columns (EW), 150 rows (NS) and 54 benches (Z) with its center within the limits of the mineralized zones. Altogether,  a  total  of  36,652  blocks  were  estimated  within  the  envelope  (final  block model grade corrected). The block model is cut by the topography.

The average grade of Nb2O5 (%) and Ta2O5 (in ppm) of each block was interpolated by inverse square distance from nearby 2.5 m drill hole composites.

SGS Geostat used interpolation parameters based on drill spacing, variogram, envelope extension and orientation.

SGS  Geostat  prepared  the  corrected  model  in  which  the  SOQUEM  grades  have  been lowered by 19% for Nb2O5, and by 13% for Ta2O5 in ppm.

<!-- image -->

The classification method is the simple search ellipsoid technique, where classification is done by the amount of composites within a specific search radius of the block. In general, for the Project and drilling intensity, it shows reliable classification.

At  this  stage  not  having  the  trench  data  computerized,  SGS  Geostat  has  not  presented measured resources. With the computerization of the trenches and detailed DGPS survey of  the  contours  of  the  lenses  on  surface,  it  would  be  possible  to  classify  resources  as measured  near  the surface. Additional drilling would  help  in defining measured resources.

For indicated resource classification, a search ellipsoid of 175 m North (as per the local grid), 125 m down dip 80 , 15 m across dip (East down 10 , as per the local grid) is used ° ° with a minimum of four (4) composites with maximum of two (2) from the same hole. The remaining blocks are classified as inferred.

Table 17.1 and Table 17.2 present the official final classified resource statement for the three (3) zones as prepared by SGS Geostat.

## 18.0 OTHER RELEVANT DATA AND INFORMATION

## 18.1 Mining

## 18.1.1 Introduction

Met-Chem was mandated by Crevier to look at various alternatives to mine the deposit based on SGS Geostat block model (May 25, 2009).

## 18.1.2 Preliminary Operating Parameters

The  proposed  mining  production  rate  for  the  Project  to  be  mined  by  open  pit  or underground  mining  methods  has  been  established  at  2,740  tonnes  per  day  or  1.0  M tonnes per year.

## 18.1.3 Mine Geotechnical Parameters

Preliminary  geotechnical  parameters  were  developed  using  rock  mass  classification methods based on two (2) different sources: geotechnical data taken from 2002 diamond drilling campaign (Cambior), and data collected during the 2009 the drilling campaign.

The CSIR  Geomechanics Classification System and Rock Mass Rating (RMR) (Bieniawski, 1976) was used to estimate rock quality based on rock mass parameters such as intact rock strength, RQD, joint spacing, joint condition, and ground water condition. The geotechnical parameters developed based on this method are preliminary in nature but adequate for this study objective. However, it is to be noted that additional field data and testing will need to be collected for the next development stages.

Based on core and outcrop observations, all rock types are considered and qualified as competent rock. Based on RMR rock mass classification system, rock may be qualified as  very  good  to  excellent  rock.  Presence  of  shear  or  fault  zones  indicate  that  further investigation would be required for the interpretation of the structural features observed in the core.

For  the  preliminary  open  pit  design,  the  recommended  mining  slope  parameter  is 55  interramp. This value is considered suitable for this stage of the study. However, the ° available information and data indicate possibility to increase it up to 60 ° , giving access to additional tonnage. However, in order to optimize the final pit wall or to increase slope angles,  more  geotechnical  work  will  be  needed  to  confirm  preliminary  results.  More specifically, laboratory testing including uniaxial compressive strength (UCS, MPa) and Morh-Coulomb  Strengths  (c,  phi)  will  be  required.  The  shear  strength  testing  of  rock mass discontinuities may be delayed up to the feasibility study stage.

## 18.1.4 Open Pit Mining

This preliminary evaluation of the open pit limits and pit design of the Crevier Project was based on design and operating parameters that were selected based on projects of similar  size,  operating  capacity  and  operating  conditions  or  in-house  Met-Chem  or Crevier data. Final operating costs were re-evaluated in more detail based on the results of the mine planning tonnage and required equipment fleet. The cut-off grade used for pit

<!-- image -->

design is based on both the Nb2O5 and Ta2O5 content. Based on estimated mine and mill operating  costs,  estimated  mill  and  refinery  recovery  and  sales  price,  the  resulting  the Nb2O5 equivalent cut-off grade is estimated at 0.1087 %.

The economic pit limits were evaluated using the EPIT optimizer module of MineSight TM mine planning software, based on 3D Lerch-Grossman algorithm. A final economic pit shell (ultimate pit), delineated 25.4 Mt of indicated and 0.9 Mt of inferred resources (at a stripping ratio of 5.8 to 1) amenable to open pit mining. From this pit shell an engineered pit complete with ramps, and catch benches was designed. The resulting engineered pit recovers 25.8 Mt (or 98.3%) of the economic pit resources and increases the stripping ratio to 6.4 (10% increase) due to placement of the main ramps.

The  PEA  is  preliminary  in  nature  and  it  includes  Inferred  mineral  resources  that  are considered too speculative geologically to have the economic considerations applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves. There is no certainty that the conclusions reached in the PEA will be realized. Mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability.

A 25 year mine plan was developed from the design pit based on a production rate of about  1.0 Mtpy  of  mineral,  an  external  dilution  factor  of  5%  (at  zero  grade)  and  a mineable recovery factor of 95% for uncontrollable losses during mining. Mineral will be excavated with 6.2 m  hydraulic excavators and trucked to the crusher located near the 3 plant  to  the  southwest  corner  of  the  pit  using  off-highway  quarry-type  41-metric  ton dump  trucks.  All  mine  equipment  is  to  be  owned,  operated  and  serviced  by  Crevier, except for explosives requirements, where a contractor will be responsible for explosives loading and blasting.

Details of the mine plan are shown in Table 18.1.

In  addition  to  the  production  equipment,  a  number  of  auxiliary  and  service  equipment such as bulldozers, graders, and service trucks are required for the mine operation and are accounted  for  in  the  mine  capital  and  operating  costs.  The  mine  equipment  fleet  is presented in Table 18.2.

## 18.1.5 Underground Mining

A review of the underground mining potential of the deposit was made early in this study. Mining of the portion  of  the  mineral  deposit  below  the  economic  pit  limits  as  well  as mining  the  entire  mineral  deposit  with  underground  methods  was  reviewed.  It  was determined that, based on sub-level open stoping method and taking into consideration mining cost as well as the process and services costs and sales price, results showed a profit well below the profit for mining the same deposit using open pit method. It was therefore decided not to pursue the underground mining option early in the study.

## 18.2.2 Beneficiation

A conceptual  beneficiation  process  flow  sheet  (Figure  18.1)  and  a  conceptual  refinery process  flow  sheet  (Figure  18.2)  were  developed  from  SGS  Lakefield  test  work.  A mechanical equipment list was developed for the main process equipment.

The beneficiation process flow sheet is composed of the following areas:

- · Crushing Circuit (Primary, Secondary and Tertiary);
- · Grinding Circuit;
- · Calcite Flotation;
- · Niobium - Tantalum Flotation;
- · Concentrate Thickening, Filtration and Storage;
- · Reagent Mixing and Distribution.

## 18.2.3 Refining

The refining process involves receiving the flotation concentrate from the beneficiation plant in 2-tonne bags, leaching the niobium and tantalum from the flotation concentrate, removing  the  leach  residue  by  filtration,  recovering  the  metals  from  the  leachate  by

<!-- image -->

solvent extraction, separating the metals by selective stripping, precipitating niobium as a hydroxide and tantalum as a fluoride, and packing the products for shipping.

The different refining unit processes include:

- · Niobium/Tantalum Concentrate Leaching;
- · Leach Slurry Filtration;
- · Niobium/Tantalum Solvent Extraction;
- · Niobium Stripping and Cleaning;
- · Tantalum Stripping;
- · Niobium Precipitation, Drying and Calcining;
- · Niobium Oxide Packing;
- · Tantalum K-Salt Crystallization and Drying;
- · K-Salt Packing.

The refinery tailings will undergo a thickening and filtering process before final disposal. The  filtered  tailings  will  be  packaged  in  the  same  2-tonne  bags  used  for  concentrate transport. These tailings bags would be returned by the same transport truck to the mine site for disposal in the leaching tailing pond.

The  tailings  thickening  process  overflow  will  go  through  an  adsorption  process  with activated alumina columns to remove excess fluoride from the water. Treated water will be re-circulated back to the refinery after further treatment by reverse osmosis.

## 18.3 Tailings Management

## 18.3.1 Introduction

Due  to  their  characteristics,  the  tailings  will  be  managed  in  two  (2)  separate  tailings ponds.  The  first  pond  will  receive  the  residue  from  the  flotation  process  which  will produce  more  than  95%  of  the  tailings.  Results  of  analysis  of  total  metal  content  and leaching  tests  conducted  on  the  mineral  show  that  tailings  generated  in  the  flotation process  are  considered  low  risk.  The  second  pond  will  receive  the  residue  from  the refinery, which represents less than 5% of the tailings. Because of the type of process, the chemicals used and the expected quantities of fluorine associated with the process, the residue produced at the refinery (leaching stage) are considered as higher risk. However, it is to be noted that only mineral sample has been characterized at this point. Thorough environmental  characterization  of  both  types  of  tailings  will  need  to  be  confirmed  to validate the method of tailings management.

## 18.3.2 Flotation Tailings

The  storage  capacity  required  for  the  tailings  from  the  flotation  is  estimated  at  26 Mt (1 M  t/y  over  26  years).  Considering  that  the  volumetric  density  of  dry  residue  in  the pond is 1.4, this represents a volume of about 19 Mm ³.

Three (3) possible alternatives for the construction of the tailings pond were identified and compared on the basis of environmental, technical and economic criteria (see Figure 18.3).

Although Alternative A is the farthest from the concentrator, it has been chosen because its  topography  is  more  favourable  to  the  development  of  a  tailings  pond.  Indeed,  the volume of material needed for the construction of the dikes is much lower than for other variants. The height of the dikes is also much lower. The geotechnical characteristics of the tailings will need to be determined to confirm their potential use as building material before the potentially lower cost upstream dyke construction method can be chosen.

## 18.3.3 Leaching Tailings

The tailings from the leaching process will be stored in a separate cell that will meet the Level  B  criteria  of Directive  019 .  The  bottom  and  sides  of  the  tailings  pond  will  be protected by the superposition of two (2) synthetic waterproofing membranes. Tailings from the leach process will not be used as building material for the dikes. Considering a rate of tailings production of about 30,000 t/y and a mine life of 26 years this represents 780,000 t or a volume of approximately 625,000 m³.

## 18.4 Infrastructure and Services

## 18.4.1 Access Road

Two (2) access road options, one reaching the site from the North (Option A) and one reaching the site from the South (Option B), were analyzed for the Crevier Property.

The access from the South (Option B) was selected for the Project. The Class II access road will be built starting at km 30 from the end of pavement on Route R0206, opening an  access  to  the  site  from  the  South,  by  way  of  2.5  kilometers  of  road  upgrading  and 7.3 kilometers of road building. Some class IV roads exist but need to be upgraded or rebuilt.

Figure 18.4 locates the two (2) options considered.

## 18.4.2 Power Line

The solution for the mine's electrical supply was first studied by Hydro-Quebec in 2003. This study was later updated in October 2009 with an Exploratory Study from HydroQuebec.  This study is based on a transmission line from Normandin substation about 90 km from the site. Costs were evaluated at the time at $ 88 M but include refection costs to the substations as well as maintenance costs.

This Exploratory Study is expected to be revised by Hydro-Quebec for spring 2010 with a  more  complete  Planning  Study.  In  the  mean  time,  the  cost  of  the  transmission  line ($45 M) used in the present Project was estimated using Met-Chem's in-house database.

Since the Hydro-Québec study is not yet available, Hydro-Québec L rate for power was used in this Project. Based on this rate, the unit power consumption cost for the Project is estimated at: $0.04318/kWh.

Because  the  construction  of  the  161  kV  line  is  a  high  cost  and  long  delivery  item, discussions should be held with Hydro-Québec (i.e. regarding the voltage level, the costs related to the construction and so on) early in the next phase of the Project.

<!-- image -->

## 18.4.3 Main Substation and Power Distribution

The estimated power demand is 11 MVA (10.5 MW at 95% power factor).

The substation is a standard outdoor design estimated at $3.1 M with:

- · One Main Disconnect Switch;
- · One Metering Point;
- · Two (2) branches, each with a breaker and a transformer 7.5/10 MVA (161 kV/ 4.16 kV).

The two (2) transformers are connected to a 4.16 kV Switchgear with the possibility to be tied. The main loads are generally supplied, using MV-MCC, at 4.16 kV (i.e. Ball Mill, Rod Mill) and the other loads are supplied at 600 V, via LV-MCC.

Because each transformer has the possibly to increase its capacity from 7.5 MVA to 10 MVA with the addition of cooling fans in an emergency mode, the total load could be feed by only one transformer.

However, the voltage drop (sags re. dips) when starting the mills should be considered.

## 18.4.4 Site Roads

The Class IV service road to the tailings pond will closely follow the pipeline, except for very short sections.

Since this road is expected to be used for the pipeline construction, a 70-ton bridge will be required.

## 18.4.5 Buildings

No campsite accommodation is required for the Project.

Provision has been made for an office building and gatehouse based on requirements for office  space  for  a  staff  of  twelve  (12)  people,  meeting  rooms,  locker  room,  washroom with  shower  and  kitchen  and  eating  area.  A  water  well  and  a  septic  system  are  also included.

Provision has been made for an assay laboratory equipped to conduct continuous tests at a  rate  of  a  few  kilograms  per  hour  on  the  concentrator's  raw  material  and  finished product.

Three (3) warehouses will be required, two (2) for storage of chemical materials and one (1) for equipment and spare part storage.

The  garage  will  have  four  (4)  maintenance  bays  and  will  contain  the  necessary equipment, tools and accessories to maintain and repair 50-ton mining trucks and other mobile equipment such as loaders, lift trucks and pickups. It will be equipped with:

- · Two (2) 15-t overhead cranes;
- · One 5-t overhead crane;

<!-- image -->

- · One 3-t overhead crane;
- · One hydraulic lift for light vehicles;
- · One water treatment system for the washing bay.

## 18.4.6 Telecommunication

It is proposed to install a satellite antenna at the mine to cover requirements for telephone communication and internet access.

## 18.4.7 Water Supply

In order to meet the concentrator's process water requirement estimated at 20 m³/h, it is proposed  to  install a pumping  station  near  Lake  Kapapapmeutanu.  Some  design parameters such as elevations, length were assumed based on available topographic map for this preliminary evaluation.

The pumping station enclosed in a 5 m by 5 m building will be comprised of a 200-mm pipeline preceded by a strainer resting at the bottom of the lake on a concrete slab and two (2) submersible pumps (one operating and one stand-by).

The  water  supply  line  between  the  pumping  station  and  the  concentrator  will  be  a 100-mm PVC DR-14 pipeline with a length of 1,100 meters. A purging manhole has been planned along its routing.

## 18.4.8 Water Services

The domestic water will be provided by a pumping station at Lake Kapapapmeutanu. The water quality is assumed to be adequate for human use such as showers and toilets. This will be verified at the next stage of the Project.

Bottled  potable  water  will  be  provided  to  specific  areas  and  included  in  the  operating cost.

## 18.4.9 Domestic Waste Water Treatment

Provision for a domestic wastewater treatment system is made for the Project. It is based on  the  assumption  that  150  employees  will  use  the  facilities  and  that  no  meals  are prepared on site. It will be composed of a septic tank and infiltration bed using soil as the purifying element providing fine sandy soil is available for treatment on site. It consists of  parallel  trenches  in  which  the  wastewater  to  be  treated  percolates  into  the  ground. Perforated rigid pipes installed in the trenches allow the wastewater distribution into the ground.

## 18.4.10 Fuel Storage

Fuel storage will consist of two (2) large diesel tanks each able to contain one week of consumption (capacity of 20,000 imperial gallons or 90,900 L) and one small gasoline tank for the needs of light vehicles (capacity of 1,000 imperial gallons or 4,500 L). The tanks are double-skinned, out-of-ground horizontal cylinders with conic ends. They come complete  with  NPT  taps,  service  vent,  level  indicator,  lifting  lugs,  ground  anchorages,

<!-- image -->

nameplate  and  epoxy  paint  exterior  finish.  Their  design  and  fabrication  complies  with Standard ULC-S601.

The fuel storage system also includes a supply station for both products, consisting of a pump, hose, fittings, valves and fuelling gun. Ground contamination from spills and leaks will be prevented via a concrete containment basin fitted with an oil separator. The fuel storage system will be protected with a fence and bollards. A light post will be installed to allow night operation.

## 18.5 Environmental Considerations

## 18.5.1 Environmental Context

The mining property is located in the watershed of Lac-à-la-Truite , which is part of the catchment area of the Mistassini River.

According  to  information  obtained  from  the  Department  of  Natural  Resources  and Wildlife (MRNF) and the Ministry of Sustainable Development, Environment and Parks (MDDEP), no mention of plants threatened, vulnerable or likely to be so designated is reported for the area covered by the Project. No exceptional forest ecosystem is listed in the study area.

As for wildlife issues, to this date, no portion of the study area is included in the Registry of  Protected  Areas  established  under  Section  5  of  the  Act  on  conservation  of  natural heritage.  Furthermore,  no  land  is  currently  under  study  at  MDDEP  to  grant  it  a  status under  this  Act.  Within  the  boundaries  of  the  study  area,  no  wildlife  habitats,  mapped according to the regulations, is currently protected except for the fish habitat that consists of all the lakes, marshes, swamps, floodplains or streams where there are fish. Moreover, there is no mention of wildlife species threatened, vulnerable or likely to be so designated reported for the area covered by the Project. The nearest reference is located more than 8 km away from the study area.

Regarding land use, in addition to forestry activities, the area under study is particularly used  for  vacation  and  for  hunting  and  fishing  while  the  Mistassini  River  is  used  for various recreational activities including canoe-camping.

## 18.5.2 Environmental Authorization Process

## Federal Government

The federal environmental review procedures are dealt with the Act to establish a federal environmental assessment process (1992, C. 37).

The application of the federal procedure is required under certain conditions. The only condition that could  be applied for this Project is related to federal authority's requirement  of  issuing  permits,  licenses  or  approvals  as  per  various  federal  acts  or regulations. The Fisheries Act is one judicial element that could be a trigger.

<!-- image -->

However,  a  review  of  topographic  maps  and  aerial  photographs  suggests  that  the infrastructure  required  by  the  Crevier  Project  could  be  built  without  any  watercourse being directly affected. Consequently, the federal procedure does not apply to the Project.

## Provincial Government

The rate of mineral mining and processing proposed for the Crevier Project is less than the  current  threshold  for  submission  to  the  Environmental  Impact  Assessment  and Review Regulation (7,000 t/d) and less than the proposed new threshold published in the Quebec  Mineral  Strategy,  released  June  29,  2009  (3,000  t/d);  therefore  an  evaluation study and review of environmental impacts will not be required.

However,  as  per  Article  22  of  the  Environment  Quality  Act,  an  application  for  a certificate  of  approval  will  be  prepared  and  submitted  to  the  Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean Regional bureau of the Department of Sustainable Development, Environment and Parks (MDDEP).  This  application  must  be  accompanied  by  an  environmental  assessment sufficiently  detailed  and  meeting  the  requirements  of Directive  019 of  the  mining industry so that the MDDEP can rule on the acceptability of the Project.

Even thought, this type of approval process does not require public hearings, as it is the case when an environmental impact study is undertaken, it is strongly recommended to hold  briefings  with  the  local  population,  Innu  community  of  Mashteuiatsh  and  local environmental groups.

In  addition  to  the  Certificate  of  Approval  for  the  Project,  other  specific  authorizations which  can  be  requested  in  parallel  or  following  application  to  the  certificate  will  be needed from MDDEP and the Department of Natural Resources and Wildlife (MRNF). Note that these other applications will not affect the critical timing of the Project.

## 18.5.3 Mineral and Waste Rock Characterization

In  order  to  characterize  the  waste  rock  and  mineral  that  will  be  produced  by  mining activities three (3) rock samples (2 waste rock and one mineral) representative of waste rock and mineral to be mined were tested.

All samples underwent tests for acid-generating potential analysis for total (environmental) metal content, leaching test and radioactivity.

Results regarding acid-generating potential indicate that the waste rock and the mineral samples analyzed are not considered generators of acid mine drainage.

Results regarding total metal content indicate that the three (3) samples present values inferior  to  criteria  A  of  the  Soil  Protection  and  Rehabilitation  of  Contaminated  Sites Policy for all the parameters analyzed. Thus, according to Directive 019 , waste rock and mineral are considered low-risk.

Results  regarding  leaching  tests  performed  on  the  three  (3)  samples  indicate  that  only cadmium (2 out of 3 samples), lead (3 out of 3 samples) and zinc (3 out of 3 samples)

exceeded  the  criteria  of  resurgence  in  the  surface  waters  of  the  Soil  Protection  and Contaminated Land rehabilitation Policy.

Results  regarding  radioactivity,  with  tests  performed  on  uranium  (total  content  and leachate)  as  well  as  radium-226  and  thorium-230  indicate  very  low  values  for  these elements,  often  below  the  limits  of  analytical  equipment.  Based  on  these  results, radioactive elements should not be an issue in the context of this Project.

## 18.5.4 Environmental Management Plan

Preliminary mitigation measures, highlighted in the Report, have been identified for the following Project activities:

- · Management of overburden for protection against erosion;
- · Management of waste rock;
- · Tailings management;
- · Water management.

## 18.5.5 Rehabilitation Program

As per the Mining Act (L.R.Q., C. M-13.1), the land rehabilitation and restoration work of mining activities must be planned and approved by the MRNF (Department of Natural Resources and Wildlife). A rehabilitation and restoration plan will need to be prepared and submitted to the Minister for approval before commencing mining activities.

## 18.5.6 First Nation Issues

The  mining  property  is  located  in  the  traditional  ancestral  territory  (Nitassinan)  of Pekuakamiulnuatsh  ( Montagnais  du  Lac-Saint-Jean ).  The  area  is  the  subject  of  land claims by the First Nation of Mashteuiatsh.

In March 2004, the First Nations of Mamuitun - representing Mashteuiatsh, Betsiamites and  Essipit  -  and  the  First  Nation  of  Nutashkuan,  Canada  and  Quebec  signed  the Agreement-in-principle of general nature . The Agreement-in-principle includes several 1 references  to  the  exploitation  of  natural  resources,  including  minerals,  but  it  does  not provide  for  payment  of  additional  royalties  (i.e.,  other  than  those  already  paid  to  the Government of Quebec). Instead, the Innu tshishe utshimaut, the future Innu governments, will be entitled to a share (no less than 3%) of the royalties collected by Quebec on the natural resources of Nitassinan.

Regarding Innu land use, the mining property is located in the Roberval beaver reserve. In a later phase, contacts should be established to identify the Ilnu families managing the territory corresponding to the mining property.

## 18.7.2 Basis of the Estimate

Budget  prices were  established for major  process equipment  based  on  technical descriptions from qualified suppliers for more than 30% of the process equipment value, while  the  remaining  equipment  was  estimated  from  a  database  from  similar  recent projects or in-house estimation.

Major  mining  equipment  was  sized  using  the  mine  production  parameters  and  budget prices were obtained from a qualified supplier. Costs from recent similar projects were used for other equipment.

Quantities  for  civil  work  were  calculated  from  the  preliminary  site  plan  and  buildings layout. Budget unit prices for the civil and buildings work were established from recent similar projects.

Process  piping,  electrical  and  instrumentation  costs  were  established  as  a  factor  on delivered process equipment based on recent similar projects.

## 18.7.3 Indirect Costs Summary

Provision  has  been  made  for  indirect  costs  related  to  Project  development,  Project implementation, contingencies, financial costs and closure costs.

## 18.8 Operating Cost Estimate

## 18.8.1 Process

The estimated annual operating costs for the mill and refinery are summarized in Table 18.5.  Operating  costs  are  subdivided  in  manpower,  electrical  power,  reagents  and consumables. These costs were derived from supplier information, Met-Chem's database or  factored  from  similar  operations.  Electrical  power  is  required  for  equipment  and services  in  the  mill  and  refinery.  The  unit  cost  of  electricity  was  established  at $0.043/kWh.

## 18.9 Cash Flow Analysis

A pre-tax Project cash flow analysis has been completed for the Crevier Scoping Project based on a production rate of 2,740 tpd.

A cash flow model was developed and a cash flow statement prepared for the life of the Project. The model reflects fourth quarter 2009 pricing.

## 18.9.1 Base Case Scenario

## Economic Assumptions

The following assumptions have been used in the preparation of this simplified cash flow model of the Base Case:

- · The exchange rate was established by Met-Chem at 0.90 CAD/USD;
- · A discount rate  of  5%  for  the  computation  of  the  Net  Present  Value  (NPV)  was used;
- · All the remaining cost (Direct and Indirect) prior to production was considered and was included in the year proceeding the first production year.

The  product  sales  prices  were  proposed  by  Crevier  based  on  an  internal  market  study which  was  not  reviewed  by  Met-Chem.  A  sales  price  of  US$150.00/kg  was  used  for K2TaF7  and  two  (2)  sales  prices  were  used  for  Nb2O5  in  the  cash  flow  analysis: US$44.00/kg and US$51.50/kg. The cash flow analysis was first performed on a current sales price of US$44.00/kg. It was then decided to increase it to a forecasted sales price of US$51.50/kg.

This cash flow analysis makes no provision for taxation.

## Technical Assumptions

Table  18.7  lists  the  principal  technical  assumptions  used  in  the  base  case.  The  initial capital cost for the Project is evaluated at $267 M.

Table 18.7  - Technical Assumptions

| Total mineral mined (LOM)   | 000' t   | 25,838   |
|-----------------------------|----------|----------|
| Average grade to mill Nb2O5 | %        | 0.170    |
| Average grade to mill Ta2O5 | ppm      | 180.5    |
| Processing Rate             | t/d      | 2,740    |
| Flotation Recovery          | %        | 70       |
| Refinery Recovery           | %        | 96       |
| Recoverable product Nb2O5   | 000' kg  | 29,462   |
| Recoverable product K2TaF7  | 000' kg  | 3,134    |

<!-- image -->

The operating costs are identified as follows:

- · Mining Cost Mineral: $2.44/t;
- · Mining Cost Waste: $2.39/t;
- · Mining Cost Overburden: $2.12/t;
- · Process Cost (including refinery): $29.00/t;
- · General and Administration Cost: $3.40/t;
- · Environmental Cost: $0.50/t.

The initial capital is scheduled to be disbursed during the 33 months prior to the start of production for Pre-Feasibility Studies, Feasibility Studies and Construction/PreProduction  with  the  majority  of  the  initial  capital  being  disbursed  at  the  onset  of construction. It is expected that purchasing of long lead items will occur at the beginning of the construction period or one year before start-up.

## Results and Sensitivity Analysis

The NPV at a 5% discount rate and the Internal Rate of Return (IRR) for the Base Case (70% flotation recovery and 96% refinery recovery) were calculated from the cash flow statement.  The  economic  analysis  indicates  a  positive  NPV  at  a  5%  discount  rate  of $103.8 M and an IRR of 7.7% for the Base Case identified with a sales price of US$51.50 and an initial capital cost that includes the construction cost of the power line.

The Project sensitivity was first evaluated for:

- · The impact of the power line ($45 M);
- · The variation of the niobium oxide selling price (US$44.00 versus US$51.50);
- · The increase in production after five (5) years by 5 and 10%.

The results are shown in Table 18.8. This table indicates that the cost of the power line and  a  lower  sales  price  have  the  most  negative  impact  on  the  NPV  and  IRR  while increasing the production rate slightly improved the economics of the Project.

The  PEA  is  preliminary  in  nature  and  it  includes  Inferred  mineral  resources  that  are considered too speculative geologically to have the economic considerations applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves. There is no certainty that the conclusions reached in the PEA will be realized. Mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability.

## 18.9.2 Production Rate Scenarios

Efforts have been made to identify additional scenarios to improve the economics of the Project. Three (3) additional scenarios to the Base Case (niobium oxide selling price of US$51.50 and power line cost included) were added to the analysis based on increased production rates of 3,500 t/d, 4,000 t/d and 4,500 t/d.

Capital and operating costs were factorized for the different production rates and used to develop corresponding cash flows. These data should be used only to have an order of magnitude.  An  amount  corresponding  to  $  1.0  M  was  added  to  the  production  rate scenarios Indirect Costs, to cover the cost of an Environmental Impact Assessment that is expected to be required for these cases.

In addition to the production rates, an additional scenario was produced on the basis of an increased flotation recovery to 72%.

## Results

Results based on the production rate scenarios are presented in Table 18.9.

The  results  at  a  flotation  recovery  of  70%  indicate  that  the  Base  Case  at  a  NPV  of $103.8 M may not be an optimized scenario. As shown in the table, for an additional 10% of  capital  cost,  the  NPV  is  almost  doubled  at  the  3,500  t/d  scenario.  The  4,000  t/d scenario indicates that for an additional $15 M in capital investment the gain on the NPV is an additional $30 M.

As  shown  in  the  Table  18.9,  a  flotation  recovery  of  72%  increases  the  IRR  by approximately one point.

<!-- image -->

The economic analysis indicates a positive NPV at a 5% discount rate of $233.5 M and an IRR of 12.7% based on a flotation recovery of 70% and a production rate of 4,000 t/d while the NPV and IRR increase to $271.9 M and 13.9% for a flotation recovery of 72% and the same production rate.

## 19.0 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS

The objective of the study was to estimate at ±35% the capital and operating costs and the profitability of the Project.

The property contains the Crevier Pegmatitic Nepheline Syenite deposits explored and evaluated by SOQUEM and Cambior from 1976 to 2002. The property is located north of Lac  St-Jean.  The  Crevier  Carbonatite  intrusive  complex  was  put  in  place  inside  the gneisses of the Granulites Centrales (CGT) of the Grenville province.

Previous owners SOQUEM and CAMBIOR (now IAMGOLD) conducted various work programs including: geophysics, prospecting, mapping, grab and channel surface sampling, diamond drilling, bulk sampling, metallurgical testing, resource estimation and feasibility studies  on  the  Syenite  Porphyry  Pegmatitic  Dyke  bearing  niobium  and tantalum on the property up to 2002 before selling it to Crevier Minerals in 2008.

A total of 105 diamond drill holes were completed by previous owners respectively; 72 by SOQUEM and 33 by Cambior. The holes were spaced approximately 50 meters apart on section with 100 to 300 meters between sections. These holes were sampled generally on  1.5  meter  intervals.  Assays  were  completed  for  oxides  and  particularly  Nb2O5  and Ta2O5  from  pulverized  rock  samples  from  half  drill  core.  Results  show  that  niobium grade varies along strike from south to north of the exploration grid, the grid North being oriented North 321°. The generally higher niobium grades are observed in the southern part  and  lowering  in  the  northern  direction  but  with  increasing  dyke  horizontal  width. SGS geostatistical analysis has highlighted a continuity axis striking north and dipping 45°  that  will  need  to  be  confirmed  in  the  next  phase  of  work.  The  tantalum  is  within niobium pyrochlore mineral grain in a ratio of 1 to 10.

Metallurgical  testwork  completed  by  SOQUEM  and  CAMBIOR  demonstrates  that  a niobium  (pyrochlore)  concentrate  can  be  produced  by  a  combination  of  standard industrial processes or treatment.

## 19.1 Sampling Method and Approach

Independent sampling by SGS Geostat has lead to the resource estimation using the two (2)  different  sources  of  historical  data  for  the  same  sector;  the  results  have  shown  a significant  difference  that  needs  to  be  further  investigated  by  new  drilling  should  the client  want  to  use  the  SOQUEM  data  without  corrections.  In  a  conservative  approach, SGS Geostat has capped the outliers in the original database. From studies done during this evaluation SGS Geostat has reduced the Nb2O5 grades by 19% and the Ta2O5 grades by 13% for all the SOQUEM composites used for the estimation.

## 19.2 Data Verification

It  is  important  to  mention  that  two  commercial  laboratories,  SGS  Lakefield  and  ALS Chemex  were  used  and  they  both  reproduced  the  result  from  one  Cambior  hole mineralized  intersection  data  (mainly  Actlab)  while  they  have  shown  a  lower  average

<!-- image -->

grade  for  one  of  the  SOQUEM  mineralized  intersection  data.  A  third  laboratory, IAMGOLD Niobec mine facility laboratory, has shown similar results as the SOQUEM campaign and has shown higher average grade for the Cambior hole. According to those results a second phase of independent sampling of old witness core was done and results confirm the bias of SOQUEM data.

## 19.3 Mineral Resource Estimate

SGS  Geostat  completed  a  Mineral  Resource  estimate  for  the  property  using  all  the historical data with corrected SOQUEM diamond drill hole grades (Drill hole name series 10-745-xxx). The following table presents the May 25, 2009 current 43-101 compliant estimate:

## 19.4 Mining Operations

The risks associated with the development and operation of the open pit mine are mainly directed towards the reliability of the geological model and towards the confirmation of the maximum slope angles used in the mine design.

<!-- image -->

Opportunities  for  improving  the  mine  operation  and  reducing  costs  can  be  expected  if results  of  future  geotechnical  studies  allow  the  increase  of  the  selected  55 ° maximum slope angle of the pit walls. Conversion of inferred resources to indicated resources for near-surface  resources  at  the  pit  extensions  will  likely  improve  mine  economics  by reducing stripping requirements.

Detailed  mine  planning  efforts  may  also  enable  engineers  to  identify  areas  where  low grade  mineral  (below  economic  cut-off)  may  be  separated  from  richer  mineral  thus increasing the average grade. It was not possible at the level of this study.

Another area where improvements are possible would be to optimize mine planning and include in-pit waste dumping early in the mine operation.

## 19.5 Mineral Processing

The current mandate was to develop a process flow sheet based on SGS Lakefield flow blocks. The current flow sheet and design criteria are based primarily on the test work reports from SGS Lakefield and the operating experience of Met-Chem personnel.

The grinding and beneficiation flow sheet was developed from the SGS Lakefield report written in 2003. SGS Lakefield reviewed the test work in 2008 and arrived with the same flow sheet. The leaching, solvent extraction, stripping and precipitation flow sheet was determined by examining the SGS Lakefield reports from 2001 and 2002 related to the refining section of the process.

The main concern in the development of the process was the amount of test work done on an unconventional mineral deposit. In the 2008 report, SGS Lakefield recommended that more  test  work  should  be  done  to  optimize  the  comminution,  flotation  and  refinery processes. SGS Lakefield reported that during laboratory flotation testing there were pH control problems  in the Nb-Ta  rougher  circuit. SGS  Lakefield  suspected  calcite interference. Met-Chem supports SGS Lakefield recommendations that future test work should focus on minimizing potential unstable operating plant conditions.

Metallurgical  test  work  completed  by  SOQUEM  and  Cambior,  demonstrates  that  a niobium  (pyrochlore)  concentrate  can  be  produced  by  a  combination  of  standard industrial processes or treatment.

The current expected metallurgical recovery at the flotation circuit for this mineral based on laboratory test work averaged 70%. The series of tests indicate that recovery might range  between  60%  and  80%.  The  refining  recovery  is  expected  to  be  96%  from  the concentrate yielding an overall recovery of 67.2%.

## 19.6 Tailings Management

Due  to  their  characteristics,  the  tailings  will  be  managed  in  two  (2)  separate  tailings ponds.  The  first  pond  will  receive  the  residue  from  the  flotation  process  which  will produce  more  than  95%  of  the  tailings.  Results  of  analysis  of  total  metal  content  and leaching  tests  conducted  on  the  mineral  show  that  tailings  generated  in  the  flotation

<!-- image -->

process  are  considered  low  risk.  The  second  pond  will  receive  the  residue  from  the refinery, which represents less than 5% of the tailings. Because of the type of process, the chemicals used and the expected quantities of fluorine associated with the process, the residue produced at the refinery (leaching stage) are considered as higher risks. However, it  is  to  be  noted  that  only  one  mineral  sample  has  been  characterized  at  this  point. Thorough  environmental  characterization  of  both  types  of  tailings  will  need  to  be confirmed to validate the method of tailings management.

## 19.7 Cash Flow Analysis

The  results  at  a  flotation  recovery  of  70%  indicate  that  the  Base  Case  at  a  NPV  of $103.8 M may not be an optimized scenario. As shown on Table 18.9, for an additional 10% of capital cost, the NPV is almost doubled at the 3,500 t/d scenario. The 4,000 t/d scenario indicates that for an additional $15 M in capital investment the gain on the NPV is an additional $30 M.

The  PEA  is  preliminary  in  nature  and  it  includes  Inferred  mineral  resources  that  are considered too speculative geologically to have the economic considerations applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves. There is no certainty that the conclusions reached in the PEA will be realized. Mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability.

## 20.0 RECOMMENDATIONS

## 20.1 Mineral Resources

In their 2009 report, SGS Geostat makes the following recommendations to improve the available data:

- · The  database  should  be  expanded  to  include  surface  channel  samples  and  short blast holes of the bulk sample;
- · The database should also be expanded to include all the other elements which have been analyzed (Zr, U, etc.);
- · Crevier should acquire the most recent high resolution satellite image;
- · All geological, geographical, geophysical, property boundaries, access and surface analytical data should be integrated into a Geographical Information System.

## 20.2 Mine Design

Regarding the mine design, the following recommendations were made:

- · Include  further  work  on  revised  geological  model  including  most  recent  drilling results;
- · Perform geotechnical studies on slope stability with the intent of increasing overall pit slopes;
- · Drill near known surface extensions of the deposit that may become resources and increase mineral tonnage and decrease overall strip ratio;
- · Perform detailed mine planning with the objective of delaying waste removal for the first few years of operation;
- · Review mine planning to include possible in-pit waste dumps in certain portions of the pit;
- · Re-assess  the  viability  of  sub-contracting  mineral  and  waste  mining  in  first  few years of the Project to reduce CAPEX;
- · Re-assess the possibility of recovering high grade areas of the bottom of the final pit using underground mining methods.

## 20.3 Processing Plant and Metallurgical Testing

Further  test  work  is  required  and  should  focus  on  capital  cost  reduction  rather  than improving process efficiency.

Test work should address such areas as:

- · Slimes Removal;
- · SAG Milling;
- · Concentrate Magnetic Separation;
- · Boiled Corn Starch;

<!-- image -->

- · Sodium Peroxide;
- · Solvent Extraction;
- · Alternative Extraction Regimes;
- · Stripping Test Work;
- · Niobium Precipitation Test Work;
- · Tantalum Precipitation Test Work;
- · Hydrofluoric Acid Recovery;
- · Design information for filtration and thickening.

## 20.4 Tailings and Water Management

Because of the type of process, the chemicals used and the expected quantities of fluorine associated  with  the  process,  the  residue  produced  at  the  refinery  (leaching  stage)  is considered as higher risk. However, it is to be noted that only mineral sample has been characterized  at  this  point.  Thorough  environmental  characterization  of  both  types  of tailings will need to be done to validate the method of tailings management.

In  order  to  reduce  initial  construction  costs,  it  is  suggested  to  construct  the  flotation tailings storage area in stages. This will be done during years 0, 3, 5, 10, 15 and 20 of the Project. The possibility of raising the dikes of the flotation tailings pond, by the upstream construction method using flotation tailings for construction, will be evaluated in the next phase. The geotechnical characteristics of the flotation tailings should be determined to confirm or deny their potential use as building material and the selection of the upstream construction  method.  If  the  flotation  tailings  can  be  used,  only  the  initial  stage  of construction  would  require  borrowed  materials.  Moreover,  the  upstream  construction method would significantly reduce the volume of dikes to build.

The leaching tailings from the leaching process will be stored in a separate cell that meets the Level B criteria of Directive 019 .  The bottom and sides of the tailings pond will be protected  by  the  superposition  of  two  (2)  synthetic  waterproofing  membranes.  The leaching  tailings  pond  will  be  located  near  the  concentrator  so  as  to  ensure  greater oversight.  It  will  be  surrounded  by  dikes  on  all  sides.  In  order  to  reduce  initial construction costs, it is suggested to construct the leaching tailings by stage. This will be done  during  years  0,  3,  5,  10,  15  and  20  of  the  Project.  The  leaching  tailings  being considered a risk for the environment, they cannot be used for the construction of dams. Moreover, the upstream construction method cannot be considered to reduce the volume of the dikes.

## 20.5 Infrastructure and Services

The power line is a critical item for the Project. As the electricity is under the jurisdiction of Hydro-Quebec, and also as the construction of the 161 kV power line is a high cost a long  delivery  item,  discussions  should  be  held  with  Hydro-Quebec  for  the  Project concerning all the electrical aspects and costs early in the next phase.

<!-- image -->

## 20.6 Future studies

The basic for the scoping study was a production rate of 2,740 tpd, however, the cash flow analysis shows that the economic rate will be more likely 4,000 tpd. A feasibility study is recommended to verify this assumption.
