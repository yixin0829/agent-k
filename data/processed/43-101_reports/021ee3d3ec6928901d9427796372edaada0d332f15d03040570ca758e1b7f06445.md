## 1 Summary

## 1.1 Summary Introduction

This report has been written to conform to the specification outlined in NI 43-101F1, for the Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects as required in National Instrument 43-101. Greg Gillstrom, P. Eng. and  Steve  Robertson,  P.Geo.  are  the  designated  'Qualified  Persons'  responsible  for  the  report's preparation in accordance with National Instrument 43-101.

This report has been prepared to update mineral resources for the Red Chris Property, and includes all new exploration  drilling  and  geological  mapping  that  has  been  done  by  Imperial  Metals  Corporation ('Imperial') between 2007 and the beginning of 2010.

The previously published mineral reserve, mine plan, and the accompanying feasibility study have not been updated and therefore will only be referenced in this report.

The results of the 2004/2005 Red Chris Feasibility Study Report were based on:

- ¾ Conventional open pit mining
- ¾ A 30,000 tonne per day flotation mill
- ¾ Shipment of concentrates going to Pacific rim smelters
- ¾ Shipping from the B.C. port of Stewart
- ¾ Estimated 25 year mine life.

The feasibility results included Proven and Probable Reserves, metallurgical performance, capital and operating cost estimates and financial analysis. The 2004/2005 feasibility study report was written by AMEC  E&amp;C  Services  ('AMEC'),  Vancouver,  B.C.  with  contributions  from  various  independent consultants as follows:

- ¾ Giroux Consultants: preparation of the resource estimate.
- ¾ Nilsson Mine  Services Limited: preparation of Proven and Probable Reserve estimate, preparation  of  LOM  mine  plan,  production  schedule  and  mine  capital  and  operating  cost estimates.
- ¾ Merit Consultants International Inc.: estimation and consolidation of the project capital costs.
- ¾ G&amp;T Metallurgical Services Limited:  metallurgical test work.

Note:  Metal  assay  values  above  labeled  'R-'  had  a  recovery  equation  applied  to  them  and therefore are recovered metal values. (i.e. R-Cu = Recovered Copper)

The reported ore reserves were calculated based on a $3.75/t net smelter return cutoff.  The selection of this  cutoff  level  was  based  upon  a  pit  rim  determination  of  the  ore  value  required  for  recovery  of processing and general &amp; administration onsite operating costs.  Low grade quantities were segregated in the production schedule.  Material between $3.25/t net smelter return and $3.75/t was designated as low grade one (LG1) and separated for future processing if economic conditions improved beyond the levels assumed for that study.  Material with a net smelter return value above $3.75/t but less than the applied cutoff for a particular pit phase, was designated low grade two (LG2).  The LG2 material was scheduled for delivery to the East Stockpile area and then reclaimed for processing in Year 17 through Year 25.

The  full  2004/2005  Red  Chris  Feasibly  Study  can  be  found  on  the  Imperial  Metal's  website  and  on SEDAR.

On the Imperial website the report is available in two parts at this URL http://www.imperialmetals.com/s/RedChris.asp.

On  SEDAR  (http://www.sedar.com)  the  report  is  available  under  Company  documents  for  bcMetals Corporation.

The Red Chris property is located about 18 km southeast of the village of Iskut and 80 km south of Dease Lake on the Todagin Plateau in northwestern British Columbia, Canada (see figure 1.2).

The Red Chris Project is comprised of the Red Chris claims and the Red Claims. The Red Chris claims consist of 49 mineral claims covering 10,183.3 hectares. Mineral tenure number 541653 has been legally surveyed.  Red  Chris  Development  Company  Ltd.  ('RCDC')  has  a  100%  interest  in  the  Red  Chris claims, subject to a 24% reversionary carried ownership interest ('RCOI') held by American Bullion Minerals Ltd. ('ABM') and a 1.8% net smelter return royalty ('NSR') by Falconbridge Limited. The 1.8% NSR can be bought down to 1% at any time prior to commencement of commercial production in consideration of $1,000,000. RCDC is a wholly owned subsidiary of Imperial.

The Red claims cover the northern part of the project and consist of 18 mineral claims covering 7,501.5 hectares. Imperial Metals Corporation owns 100% of the Red claims (see figure 4.2).

The  Red  Chris  porphyry  copper-gold  deposit  is  distributed  along  the  central  axis  of  the  pervasively altered  and  fractured  formation  called  the  Red  Stock.  At  the  Red  Chris  deposit,  the  Red  Stock  is  the predominant  host  of  the  mineralization.  Mineralization  and  associated  alteration  are  more  intense adjacent  to  the  ancestral  en  echelon  fault  system  along  the  axis  of  the  stock  which  controlled  the emplacement of the stock and later altering and mineralizing hydrothermal fluids which is more typical of a shear-hosted copper-gold deposit. The Red-Chris copper-gold mineralization has good near-vertical and longitudinal continuity, controlled largely by post-mineral faulting superimposed on and along the ancestral, en echelon, central axis fault zone. Pyrite, chalcopyrite, bornite, with minor chalcocite are the principal sulphide minerals of the shallower portions of the Red Chris deposit. Minor covellite occurs as inclusions in pyrite, and molybdenite, sphalerite and galena occur locally in trace amounts. Gold, second in economic  importance  to  copper,  occurs  spatially  and  genetically  associated  with  the  copper mineralization. In the newly discovered deep East Zone pyrite becomes significantly decreased and in places bornite becomes the dominate copper mineral.

From 1968 to 2006, the property was explored by Conwest Exploration Ltd., Great Plains Development Co.,  Silver  Standard  Mines  Ltd.,  Ecstall  Mining  Limited,  Texasgulf  Canada,  American  Bullion  and bcMetals Corporation (via its wholly owned subsidiary RCDC).

In 2003 and 2004 RCDC conducted an infill drilling program targeting the core in East and Main Zones where open pit mining would be expected to take place.  Based on this drilling, the Red Chris Measured, Indicated  and  Inferred  Resources  were  updated  and  RCDC  commissioned  AMEC  to  complete  a Feasibility Study of an open pit mine at Red Chris. The study was published in December, 2004.

On September 8, 2006 Imperial' subsidiary CAT-Gold launched an all cash takeover bid of bcMetals Corporation, at $0.95 per/share. bcMetals responded by adopting a poison pill which limited potential ownership of the company to 20%. Upon termination of the initial takeover bid on November 8, 2006, Imperial owned approximately 17% of bcMetals. On November 23, Taseko Mines made an offer for all outstanding  shares  of  bcMetals,  to  which  Imperial  responded  with  a  friendly  offer  of  $1.10/share, representing a 4.8% premium over Taseko's offer.  A bidding war ensued, which Imperial eventually won with a final bid of $1.70/share submitted on February 2, 2007 for total cost of $68.4 million.

Since acquiring the Red Chris Property Imperial has conducted an aggressive exploration and drilling program, consisting of diamond drilling, geological mapping, and geophysics. During the period from 2007  to  2009  Imperial  drilled  20  holes  targeting  deep  mineralization  mostly  in  the  East  Zone  (hole numbers: 07-335 to RC09-354). Figure 11.4a shows a comparison of the drilling at the end of 2006 with the drilling to the end of 2009.

The highlights from the program were holes 07-335 and 09-350. Hole 07-335 was collared vertically in the core of the East zone, and graded 1.01% copper, 1.26 g/t gold its entire length of 1,024.1 metres. This  extended  high-grade  mineralization  in  the  East  Zone  down  another  270m  from  its  previouslyknown extent. Hole RC09-350 was collared approximately 170 metres northeast of drill hole 07-335 and returned 432.5 metres grading 2.00% copper and 3.80 g/t gold which included a 152.5m zone grading 4.12%  copper  and  8.83  g/t  gold  starting  at  a  depth  of  540.0  metres  (see  figure  1.1  and  11.4c).

## 1.2 Updated Resources

A new block model was constructed to update the resource calculations to include the 2007 to 2009 drilling. The assays for holes RC10-355 and RC10-360 were completed during the writing of this report and have been included. At the 0.3% copper cut-off grade used for comparative purposes, the revised resource estimate represents a 31% tonnage increase in the measured and indicated category and an 89% tonnage increase in the inferred category over the previous 2005 resource estimate. The copper and gold grades in the measured and indicated category at the 0.3% copper cut-off grade are also significantly higher, with copper grades increasing from 0.46% to 0.54%, and gold grades increasing from 0.37 to 0.55 grams per tonne. The higher grades discovered in the deeper drilling of the East zone have yielded an even more dramatic increase in the resource at higher cut-off grades. The measured and indicated resource at a 0.6% copper cut-off grade increased from 35.1 million tonnes grading 0.82% copper and 0.72  g/t  gold  to  86.96  million  tonnes  grading  0.88%  copper  and  1.11  g/t  gold,  representing  a  148% increase in tonnage, a 7% increase in copper grade and a 55% increase in gold grade. (see Table 1.2 for a summary).

## 4 Property Description and Location

## 4.1 Location and Claim Status

The Red Chris property is located in northwest British Columbia, approximately 18 km southeast of the Iskut village, 80km south of Dease Lake, and 12km east of the Stewart-Cassiar Highway (see Figure 4.1).  The nearest gravel airstrip is located in Iskut. During summer Northern Thunderbird Air regularly services the Dease Lake airport. Helicopter and fix winged charters can also be secured from the Dease Lake airport.

The  Red  Chris  exploration  site  is  accessible  year  round  via  a  17km  gravel  access  trail,  which  was constructed in 2008. The new trail branches off at the 6km marker on the Ealue Lake road, making it a 23km  trip  from  Red  Chris  camp  to  Highway  37  (0km  on  the  Ealue  Lake  road).  The  access  trail  is predominantly travelled by pick-up trucks, but is also navigated by larger fuel trucks, flat bed trucks and semi  trailers.  Access  to  the  property  via  the  trail  has  significantly  reduced  exploration  expenditures associated with helicopter reliance and has made working around the property safer (see figure 4.1).

## 4.2 Claim Information (Mineral Tenure)

The Red Chris Property is comprised of the Red Chris Claims and the Red Claims, which are described below. The Red Chris Deposit which has been approved for development under the British Columbia Environmental Assessment Process is located on the Red Chris Property.

The  Red  Chris  Property  consists  of  49  mineral  claims  covering  10,183.26  hectares.  Red  Chris Development Company Ltd. ('RCDC') has a 100% interest in the Red Chris Claims, subject to a 24% reversionary carried ownership interest ('RCOI') held by American Bullion Minerals Ltd. ('ABM') and a  1.8%  net  smelter  return  royalty  ('NSR')  by  Falconbridge  Limited.  The  1.8%  NSR  can  be  bought down  to  1%  at  any  time  prior  to  commencement  of  commercial  production  in  consideration  of $1,000,000.

The Red claims consist of 18 mineral claims covering 7,501.51 hectares. Imperial owns 100% of the Red claims (see table 4.1 and figure 4.2 for exact locations of all claims).

## 4.3 Permits and Agreements

Red Chris commenced its environmental assessment process by submitting an application in 2004 to both  the  government  of  British  Columbia  and  Canada.  The  Provincial  Environmental  Assessment process  follows  the  British  Columbia  Environmental  Assessment  Act  ('BC  EAA')  and  the  Federal Environmental Assessment follows the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act ('CEAA') process.

The Red Chris (BCEAA) Certificate was issued in August 2005.  Federal approval for the Red Chris Project under the CEAA was received in May 2006.  The federal approval was subsequently challenged by a third party; however a decision by the Supreme Court of Canada on January 21, 2010 upheld the federal approval which has allowed mine permitting and development to proceed.

## 4.3.1 Exploration Permits

Since the acquisition of bcMetals by Imperial Metals Corporation in 2007, work at the Red Chris site (exploration  and  geotechnical  investigations  for  site  and  tailings  impoundment)  has  been  conducted under mineral exploration permits issued by the Ministry of Energy Mines and Petroleum (MEMPR). In 2008, an access trail to the project site was also constructed under the exploration permit.

The exploration permit was obtained to conduct the following work:

- · Exploration drilling as per submitted yearly work program
- · Building an exploration trail for safer and environmentally improved access for drilling
- · Geotechnical investigation for the plant site and the tailings impoundment areas.

## 4.3.2 Project Development, Operation and Closure Permits

RCDC submitted its draft Terms of Reference for the Mines' Act Permit Application in October 2009 and met with Northwest Mine Development Review Committee in December 2009 and in March 2010. The Terms of Reference ('TOR') are finalized.

The BC Government is in the process of streamlining the overall permitting process and is proceeding with asynchronous permitting approach. The new system will have all permits required from the various ministries of the Province to be synchronized with the Mines Act Permit Application.

The  following  permits,  approvals,  licenses  and  leases  will  be  required  for  the  Red  Chris  Mines' development, operation and closure:

## BC MEMPR

- · Mines' Act Permit
- · Mining Lease
- · Permit pursuant to Mining Right of Way Act

## 4.3.3 Agreements

Red Chris Development Company Ltd. ('RCDC') has a 100% interest in the Red Chris Claims, subject to  a  24%  reversionary  carried  ownership  interest  ('RCOI')  held  by  American  Bullion  Minerals  Ltd. ('ABM') and a 1.8% net smelter return royalty ('NSR') by Falconbridge Limited. The 1.8% NSR can be bought down to 1% at any time prior to commencement of commercial production in consideration of $1,000,000.

The RCOI is an interest which gives the holder the right to receive payment after commencement of commercial production on the Red Chris Project and after all costs incurred on or in connection with the Project have been repaid in full. The RCOI becomes a net 24% working interest after commencement of commercial production on the Red Chris Property and becomes assessable for a 24% share of costs and other royalty burden upon commencement of commercial production. RCDC is entitled to receive 100% of all revenues, until all costs incurred on or in connection with the project have been repaid in full.

## 5 Accessibility, Climate, Local Resources, Infrastructure and Physiography

The  Red  Chris  exploration  site  is  accessible  year  round  via  a  17km  gravel  access  trail,  which  was constructed in 2008. The new trail branches off at the 6km marker on the Ealue Lake road, making it a 23km trip from camp to Highway 37 (0km on the Ealue Lake road). The access trail is predominantly travelled  by  pick-up  trucks,  but  can  also  be  navigated  by  larger  fuel  trucks,  flat  bed  trucks  and  semi trailers. Access to the property via the trail has significantly reduced exploration expenditures associated with helicopter support and has made access to the property safer.

In summer Northern Thunderbird Air regularly services the Dease Lake airport. Aside from the regular flight schedule, helicopter and fix winged charters can be secured from the Dease Lake airport. The Red Chris property is located approximately 18 km southeast of the Iskut gravel airstrip located in the village of Iskut (see Figure 4.1).

The Red Chris property is situated on the eastern portion of the Todagin upland plateau which forms a subdivision of the Klastine Plateau along the northern margin of the Skeena Mountains. Elevations on the  plateau  are  typically  1,500  ±  30  m  with  relatively  flat  topography  broken  by  several  deep  creek gullies (see figure 5). Bedrock  exposure  is  confined  to  the higher-relief drainages and  along mountainous ridges. The majority of the property is covered by several metres of glacial till. Vegetation on the plateau consists of scrub birch and willow, grasses, and mosses. Within the creek valleys, are several  varieties  of  conifer  and  deciduous  trees  including  balsam,  fir,  cedar,  spruce,  and  aspen.  The project area lies in a region of moderate annual precipitation with an average of 530 mm total annual precipitation which is more or less evenly distributed throughout the year, with April to May receiving the least and August to December the most. Temperatures vary from a low of -21  C in January to a high o of 9  C in July with temperature extremes ranging from -50 o o C to 30 o C.

## 5.1 Northwest Transmission Line Project

Development of the Red Chris Mine is contingent upon the availability of electric power. The Provincial and  Federal  governments  have  committed  to  provide  funding  for  a  powerline  from  Terrace  to  Bob Quinn  (Northwest  Transmission  Line  ('NTL')  Project,  which  is  now  under  review  through  the  BC environmental assessment process.  Assuming that the NTL is approved and constructed Imperial will be responsible for extending powerline service sufficient to meet its needs from Bob Quinn to Tatogga and from there to the Red Chris Mine. The powerline extension along Highway 37 requires approval through  an  amendment  of  the  Red  Chris  EA  Certificate  and  will  also  require  a  permit  from  the  BC Ministry  of  Transportation  and  Infrastructure  (MOTI)  to  allow  development  within  the  Highway  37 Right-of-Way (see figure 1.2 and 4.1).

## 6.1 Red Chris Deposit Exploration History

This  section  has  been  largely  taken  from  the  Giroux  et  al,  2002  and  2004  reports  on  the  Red  Chris Project.

The first recorded exploration of the project area occurred in 1956 when Conwest Exploration Limited staked the Windy claims to cover prominent limonitic gossans on the Todagin Plateau. The showings reported  (B.C.M.M.  Annual  Report,  1956)  consisted  of  a  large  oxidized  area  with  small  amounts  of azurite  and  malachite.  Work  consisted  of  a  limited  amount  of  open-cutting  and  pack-sack  X-Ray drilling.

In  September 1968, Great Plains Development Co. of Canada staked the Chris and Money claims to cover the headwaters of a stream in the western portion of the present project area, based on a strong copper anomaly in stream sediments. Over the next 2 years Great Plains conducted geological (8 rock samples)  and  geochemical  (534  B-horizon  samples)  surveys  followed  by  two  diamond  drill  holes  in 1970 totalling 309 m. One of the holes (70-2) intersected 0.25 % Cu over 73 metres. During the next two years,  additional  surveys  were  completed  including  geologic  mapping,  ground  magnetic  and  induced polarization  surveys,  followed  by  the  drilling  of  eight  diamond  drill  holes  in  1972,  totalling  922  m. These  holes  intersected  weak  pervasive  (hypogene)  alteration  controlled  by  fracturing  with  low supergene copper mineralization near surface (Panteleyev, 1973).

In 1970, Silver Standard Mines Ltd. staked the Red and Sus claims to the north and east of the Chris claim group. In 1971, Silver Standard conducted geologic mapping and soil geochemical surveys over the claims and tested anomalies with bulldozer trenches (457m) near the common boundary between the Red and Chris claims. Two trenches exposed low-grade copper mineralization in intrusive rocks. Ecstall Mining Limited (which later became Texasgulf Canada Limited, the Canadian subsidiary of Texasgulf Inc.), optioned the Silver Standard claims in 1973 and drilled 14 percussion holes totalling 914 m, of which half intersected low grade copper mineralization.

In 1974, Texasgulf Canada Ltd. formed an agreement with Silver Standard and Great Plains to acquire an option on 60 per cent of the combined Red and Chris groups of claims and paying 80% of costs with Silver Standard and Great Plains both retaining 20 per cent.

During the years from 1974 to 1976, Texasgulf drilled a total of 67 diamond drill holes (12,284 m) and 30 percussion holes (2,261 m). During the 1978 and 1980 field seasons, Texasgulf drilled an additional 7 shallow core holes totalling 1,017 m to test for near-surface copper-gold mineralization. (Newell and Peatfield,  1995).  Property-wide  geological,  geochemical  (153  overburden  samples),  and  geophysical surveys  (20km  IP)  were  also  completed  during  this  time.  An  overburden  drill  was  utilized  to  test bedrock geochemistry in poorly exposed areas of the property. The results of this program outlined an area 3.4 km long, striking east-northeast, with multiple anomalies greater than 500 ppm copper. This anomalous copper zone effectively outlines the limits of the Red intrusive stock. Magnetometer surveys delineated  the  northern  intrusive  contact  of  the  Red  Stock  with  volcanics  but  could  not  discriminate between the various intrusive lithologies or the Bowser Lake Group of clastics to the south.

As a result of the Texasgulf exploration, two coalescing east-north-easterly trending zones of coppergold mineralization named the Main and East zones were outlined. The mineralization was described as pyrite, chalcopyrite, and lesser bornite occurring spatially with zones or quartz vein stockwork near the centre of the Red intrusive stock. The estimated resource in 1976 at a 0.25% Cu cut-off was 34.4 million tonnes with an average grade of 0.51% Cu and 0.27 g/t Au to a depth of 270 m in the Main Zone and 6.6 million tonnes with average grade of 0.83% Cu and 0.72 g/t Au to a depth of 150 m in the East Zone (Newell and Peatfield, 1995).

No exploration was done on the property in the period 1981 to 1994. A series of corporate takeovers and reorganizations in January, 1994 resulted in the ownership of the property divided amongst Falconbridge (60%), Norcen Energy (20%), and Teck Corporation (20%). American Bullion Minerals Ltd. acquired an  80%  interest  in  the  property  in  early  1994  with  Teck  Corporation  retaining  the  remaining  20%. American  Bullion  retained  Mark  Rebagliati  to  review  and  evaluate  the  exploration  completed  by previous owners. Rebagliati estimated a possible resource at a 0.20 % Cu cut-off of 136 million tonnes averaging 0.38 % Cu and 0.25 g Au/t. He estimated a higher grade core containing 37 million tonnes averaging 0.67% Cu and 0.45 g Au/t. Rebagliati recommended 15,000 m of diamond drilling to upgrade and expand the higher grade core zones and explore the remainder of the property (Rebagliati, 1994).

During the 1994 field season, American Bullion completed mineral claim staking, land surveying, line cutting, soil geochemistry (547 B-horizon), geophysics (including 74km ground magnetic, 26km V.L.F. EM, and 72km induced polarization surveys), camp and core logging facility construction, HQ and NQ diamond drilling  totalling  21,417  m  in  58  holes,  core  sample  assaying,  acid  base  accounting  studies, base-line environmental studies, a mineral resource estimate, petrographic and metallurgical studies, and documentation. The programs were completed between June and November, 1994 at a cost of CAN $4.2 million.

Drilling completed in 1994 extended the lateral dimensions for mineralization in a north-south direction and extended the known  copper-gold  mineralization over vertical distances of up to 400  m. Geochemical and geophysical surveys extended the mineralization to the west to include the 600 by 600 m Far West zone and the 700 by 400 m Gully zone.

Based on the additional 1994 drill data the measured + indicated resource was estimated at 181 million tonnes averaging 0.4% Cu and 0.31 g Au/t at a 0.2% Cu cut-off (Giroux, 1995). In this report, terms of proven, probable, and possible were used that under 43-101 Guidelines would conform to Measured, Indicated, and Inferred. An additional 139 million tonnes averaging 0.35% Cu and 0.28 g Au/t at the 0.2% Cu cut-off was classed as inferred. This resource, estimated by ordinary kriging of 30 x 30 x 15 m blocks, was compiled and estimated within a 1,300 x 200 m area to depths of between 1,050 to 1,530 m A.M.S.L.

The  1995  exploration  program  (112  holes  totalling  36,770m)  successfully  increased  the  geological resources of the Red Chris deposit across the width of the Red stock and over a 400-metre strike length west  of  the  known  mineralization.  Significant  near  surface  copper-gold  mineralization  was  also discovered at the Gully and Far West zones. As of November, 1995, the property had been tested by a

total  of  244  diamond  and  44  percussion  drill  holes,  or  74,782  metres  of  drilling.  Drill  program  was supplemented by a 290 sample geochemical survey.

In 2003, bcMetals conducted an infill drilling program totalling 16,591m in 49 drillholes.  This resulted in updated measured, indicated, and inferred resourced calculations which were released in the NI 43101 Update Report dated February 16, 2004.

The infill drill program completed in 2004 consisted of a total of 6,927 m in 25 diamond drill holes.  Of these holes 10 targeted the Main Zone, 4 targeted the saddle zone between the Main and East zones, 6 tested the East zone and 5 condemnation holes were drilled to the north east of the East Zone (RCDC Technical  Report,  2007).    This  resulted  in  a  reinterpretation  of  the  geologic  model  upon  which  the resource  estimation  was  based.    As  a  result,  the  mineralized  unit  was  re-modeled  as  a  single  unit, whereas  prior  to  2004,  the  Main  Zone  and  East  Zone  had  been  separated,  with  inner  and  outer mineralized shells. Drill program was supplemented by a 4.6km seismic and 6.5km EM geotechnical program designed to further investigate the tailing impoundment area.

Exploration in 2006 consisted of 14 drillholes for a total length of 4679m.  This consisted of 7 holes in the Gully Zone and 2 geotechnical holes 300m to 600m northeast of the pit limit, in the vicinity of the then-proposed  mill  site.  In  addition,  5  holes  were  drilled  within  the  East  and  Main  zones  for  due diligence and verification purposes under the terms of a joint venture agreement between bcMetals and the  Global  International  Jiangxi  Copper  Company  Ltd,  which  had  recently  been  announced  for  the development of Red Chris.

On September 8, 2006 Imperial's subsidiary CAT-Gold launched an all cash takeover bid of bcMetals Corporation at $0.95 per share. bcMetals responded by adopting a poison pill which limited potential ownership of the company to 20%.  Upon termination of the initial takeover bid on November 8, 2006, Imperial owned approximately 17% of bcMetals. On November 23, 2006 Taseko Mines Limited made an  offer  to  purchase  all  outstanding  shares  of  bcMetals,  to  which  Imperial  responded  with  a  friendly offer of $1.10/share, representing a 4.8% premium over Taseko's offer.  A bidding war ensued, which Imperial eventually won with a final bid of $1.70/share submitted on February 2, 2007 for total cost of $68.4 million.

## 7 Geological Setting

## 7.1 Introduction

Sources  of  information  on  the  regional  geological  setting  of  the  Red-Chris  deposit  are  primarily provincial and federal geological survey reports and open files, or references therein.  The most recent work is by Ash and others who produced 1:50,000 scale maps of the geology and mineral occurrences in the  Tatogga  Lake  area  for  the  British  Columbia  Geologial  Survey,  along  with  accompanying  reports (Ash et al ., 1995, 1996, 1997a,b).  The regional geology map in Figure 7.1 is based on these works, with additional  geology  from  Geological  Survey  of  Canada  open  file  maps  by  Read  (1984,  1990).    A comprehensive  report  on  the  geology  of  the  northern  Bowser  Basin  by  Evenchick  and  Thorkelson (2005) is the best recent reference for this element of the regional geological framework.

Geology pertaining to the Red-Chris porphyry copper-gold deposit itself (see also Section 9) has been adapted  in  large  part  from  a  major  report  on  Red-Chris  by  Giroux et  al. (2002).    Notable,  earlier published work on Red-Chris includes Newell and Peatfield (1995) and Baker et al. (1997).

## 7.2 Tectonic Setting

Red-Chris is situated in northern British Columbia within the accreted Stikinia terrane of the Canadian Cordillera (see figure 7.1).  This terrane forms a broad northwesterly trending belt in the centre of the Cordillera  from  southern  British  Columbia  into  southwestern  Yukon,  and  forms  a  major  part  of  the 'Intermontane  Belt'.    Stikinia  is  dominated  by  early  Mesozoic  island-arc  volcanic  strata  and  related intrusions, overlying a basement of Carboniferous, strongly deformed metasedimentary and metavolcanic  rocks  known  as  Stikine  Assemblage.    The  Mesozoic  arc  rocks  are  the  Middle  to  Late Triassic Stuhini Group, overlain by the Early and Middle Jurassic Hazelton Group.  The Stuhini Group consists of basinal sedimentary rocks, and submarine augite or hornblende-phyric basaltic volcanics and volcaniclastics.  The Hazelton Group is a diverse assemblage of bimodal, basaltic to rhyolitic subaerial and submarine volcanic rocks and related sediments, and may be a composite of two subparallel arcs and an intervening rift-basin(s) (Evenchick and Thorkelson, 2005).  There was probably a short hiatus in the  earliest  Jurassic  between  the  Stuhini  and  Hazelton  groups.    Regionally,  both  groups  may  host significant  mineral  deposits  related  to  Late  Triassic  and/or  Early  to  Middle  Jurassic  intermediate intrusions,  or  to  volcanogenic  hydrothermal  activity.    Red-Chris  is  in  a  Late  Triassic  intrusion  in  the Stuhini Group.

Both  the  Stuhini  and  Hazelton  assemblages  formed  in  oceanic  arcs  outboard  of  the  North  American paleocontinental  margin  (now  represented  by  the  Omineca  Belt),  in  response  to  east-directed,  and possibly  west-directed,  subduction.    Hazelton  arc(s)  formation  was  complicated  by  interarc  extension and  subsidence  related  to  the  migration  and  docking  of  the  Stikinia  microplate  against  the  North American margin in the Early to Middle Jurassic.

Stikinia's  accretion  involved  the  inboard  trapping  of  oceanic  crust  represented  by  the  Cache  Creek terrane, now interposed between Stikinia and the Omineca Belt.  Subsequent crustal shortening thrust the Cache Creek terrane southwestwards onto Stikinia, producing a marine to non-marine flexural basin ('Bowser Basin') on its southwestern front into which chert clast-rich sediments derived from the Cache Creek  Group  were  deposited,  in  the  form  of  the  Middle  Jurassic  to  Early  Cretaceous  Bowser  Lake Group.  All units were affected by Early to Late Cretaceous tectonic activity of the Skeena Fold Belt.

## 7.3 Regional and Property Geology

The southern half  of  the  Red-Chris  property  (figure  7.2),  containing  the  Red-Chris  deposit,  lies  on  a broad physiographic plateau called the Todagin Plateau.  This plateau is underlain mainly by the Stuhini Group, flanked on the southeast across a fault by the younger Bowser Lake Group.  The Hazelton Group occurs  just  beyond  the  far  southwest  of  the  property,  overlying  the  Stuhini  Group  probably  by  an angular  unconformity.    Bedding  in  the  Stuhini  Group  is  typically  steep  and  variable,  likely  due  to  a regional  deformation  event  around  the  Triassic-Jurassic  boundary  (Evenchick  and  Thorkelson,  2005). Regional considerations suggest the Stuhini stratigraphy generally faces west or southwest in the region. Jurassic strata of the Bowser Lake Group (and underlying uppermost Hazelton) have gentle to moderate dips between southeast and southwest resulting from Skeena Fold Belt deformation.

The northern half of the property is largely in lower topography, sloping towards the broad Klappan River plain, where the geology is less well known due to limited rock exposure.  However, the better exposed  ridges  above  the  Ealue  Lake  valley  are  underlain  by  Stuhini  Group  and  an  Early  Jurassic intrusion (Ealue Stock) to the east of the lake, and a mixture of Stikine Assemblage and Stuhini and Hazelton  groups  on  the  ridges  to  the  northwest  and  north.    A  northeast-trending  fault  is  inferred  to follow the trace of Coyote Creek and the Ealue Lake valley.  It continues to the east for an additional 30 kilometres where it has been designated the McEwan Creek Fault with a south side-down movement sense.

Intrusive rocks in the region range from large composite intrusions or stocks, to dikes a few metres in thickness.  A swarm of Early Jurassic granitic dikes north of Ealue Lake trends NW-SE.  Southeast of the lake, on the Red-Chris property, dikes generally trend between ENE and WNW.  They range in age from Late Triassic to Early Jurassic, although some may be younger.  Composition is typically medium to coarse grained monzodiorite.  The largest intrusion here is the Red Stock, which hosts the Red-Chris deposit, and is described under 'Local Geology', below.

Regional metamorphic grade on the property is low (except in the Stikine Assemblage), no higher than lower  greenschist  or  subgreenschist.  Hornfelsing  related  to  contact  metamorphism  around  larger intrusions may be present.  The Bowser Lake Group is unmetamorphosed.

## 7.4 Local Geology

## 7.4.1 Red Stock setting

The Late Triassic Red Stock (see figure 7.4a), which hosts the Red-Chris deposit, is an ENE-elongate intrusion, about 5 kilometres long by up to 1.5 km wide at surface.  The intrusion tapers to narrow dikes in  the  northeast  and  in  the  far  west.    The  stock's  northern  contact  is  steep,  around  80°  on  average, dipping either north or south, and may be faulted, in part (see figure 7.4b).

On its southeastern side, the stock is bounded by a NE-trending, south-side-down fault which abruptly places the stock and its Stuhini Group country rocks against the Bowser Lake Group at the present level of erosion.  The fault is known as the South Boundary Fault (SBF), and is assumed to be mainly normal slip and to dip steeply SE.  It may actually be a series of parallel faults.  It is Late Jurassic or more likely Cretaceous in age.  The vertical separation on the fault(s) is not known, nor the depth of the sub-Bowser unconformity on the hangingwall side, as the basal contact has never been intersected by drilling.

Basaltic volcanics and volcaniclastics are the predominant Stuhini Group host rocks along the northern margin of the stock.  Carbonate-pyrite alteration occurs in the volcanics, generally increasing towards the stock, especially within about 150 metres of the contact.  Drilling through the volcanics towards the intrusion reveals biotite-rich hornfelsing due to contact metamorphism.  In the west and east, however, the  Red  Stock  is  in  contact  with  Stuhini  Group  mafic-feldspathic  sandstone  and  lesser  siltstone,  with only minor volcanics forming the host rocks.

In the down-faulted block south of the SBF, the rocks comprise grey and pink-grey, thinly bedded and laminated siliceous siltstones of the Quock Member of the Middle Jurassic Spatsizi Formation of the Hazelton  Group,  paraconformably  overlain  by  Middle  Jurassic  Bowser  Lake  Group.    The  latter comprises  grey-brown,  thinly  bedded  shaly  siltstone  with  minor  cm-scale  claystone  beds  and  minor shell-rich  siltstone,  chert-grain  rich  sandstone,  and  lenses  of  resistive  chert-pebble  conglomerate. Formerly known as the Ashman Formation, the rocks are now termed Todagin Assemblage (Evenchick and Thorkelson, 2005), and interpreted as marine slope facies, with local channels or submarine fans filled with pebble conglomerate.

At least one small outlier of olivine-phyric basalt is present in the far south of the property, conspicuous by  its  well-developed  columnar  jointing.    The  rocks  are  assigned  to  the  early  Pliocene  Maitland Volcanics unit of Evenchick and Thorkelson (2005).  They are compositionally similar to the Mount Edziza volcanics, and are within the age range (5.7-4.9 Ma, K-Ar) of that event, and are thus correlated.

## 7.4.2 Red Stock geology

The Red Stock is texturally diverse and variably porphyritic, with multiple internal contacts, and it is better regarded as suite of dike-like intrusions instead of a single homogeneous body.  The composition of the phases is dominantly monzodiorite with minor quartz monzodiorite or monzonite, and they were probably emplaced in a relatively short period from a single magmatic event.  Friedman and Ash  (1997) reported that four zircon fractions from drill core have been dated at 203.8 ±1.3 Ma by U-Pb on zircon, which is taken as Late Triassic ( i.e. assuming the boundary with the Jurassic is ca . 200 Ma).

Two compositionally similar phases of plutonic rocks comprise the majority of the Red Stock and these rocks  are  cut  by  several  types  of  post-mineral  dikes.    The  'Main  Phase'  unit  is  a  medium-grained, weakly- to intensely altered plagioclase-hornblende porphyritic monzodiorite.  Colour varies from pale grey to pink-grey, depending on alteration.  Plagioclase phenocrysts are typically 3 to 8 mm long, and form about 10 to 15% of the rock, although they are quite commonly sparse or absent.  A trachytoid alignment from flow banding is quite common.  Hornblende phenocrysts are smaller, usually 5 mm or less, and may also show alignment.  The groundmass is fine to medium grained.  The Main Phase hosts

<!-- image -->

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

most  of  the  known  copper-gold  mineralization  and  constitutes  approximately  70-80%  percent  of  the stock.

The 'Late Phase' unit is a late- to post-mineral phase of the same monzodiorite composition, but with indistinct  flow  banding  and  chilled  margins  against  the  Main  Phase.    The  Late  Phase  is  remarkably similar in composition and texture to very weakly altered Main Phase rocks, and is distinguished by its 'fresher' appearance and milder overprinting by at least the high-temperature secondary minerals (see below under 'Alteration').  In addition, the Late Phase is usually barren of copper-gold mineralization. It represents approximately 20-28% of the stock.

Cutting  both  the  Main  and  Late  phases  are  post-mineral  dikes  which  are  typically  porphyritic  and amygdaloidal and range in composition from dioritic to monzonitic.  They are usually less than 1 to 5 metres wide, although they may attain widths of up to 50 metres in the western end of the Red Chris deposit area.  These dikes form most of the remaining volume of the Red Stock.

Minor breccia occurs throughout the Red Stock, especially along the northeastern and western margins. Breccia  bodies  may  range  in  width  from  a  few  metres  to  100  metres  or  more.  Their  contacts  are relatively distinct, marked by a rapid increase or decrease of subangular to angular fragments of plutonic rock. These fragments can vary from less than a centimetre to several metres in diameter.  The matrix of the  breccias  may  be  igneous  or  rock  flour  or  both.    The  breccias  are  interpreted  as  magmatichydrothermal, or the result of stoping along intrusion contacts, depending on the matrix-type.

## 7.4.3 Structure

The  apparent  ENE  linear  trend  of  the  Red  Stock  suite  suggests  that  it  was  intruded  along  a  syn-arc structure.  Within the stock itself, this trend dominates the orientation of dikes, brittle and semi-brittle faulting, and also quartz veins and vein stockworks which host the mineralization at Red-Chris.  Quartz vein  density,  and  high-angle,  EW-  to  ENE-trending  faults  or  fracture  zones  are  concentrated  in  the central axis of the stock (see figure 7.4a).  Structural zones characterized by semi-ductile shearing of quartz (+/-carbonate) veins, or by healed tectonic breccia, attest to relatively early and high-temperature shearing  in  the  intrusion,  whereas  friable  and  low-competency  zones  dominated  by  clay  alteration  or gouge represent deformation under later, cooler conditions.  Previous workers (see Giroux et al ., 2002) contended that the dominant 'axial' structures are concave to the south with normal dip-slip.

Numerous,  steeply  dipping  transverse  faults  deform  the  Red  Stock,  striking  NNW  to  NNE.    The geometry and separations related to these faults have been assessed by constructing level plans using drill  hole  data.    Most  geological  features  are  allegedly  traceable  from  N-S  section  to  section,  and  to depth, implying that most of the transverse faulting does not radically affect 'along strike' continuity of ores zones.

Despite the deformation, the structural complexity of the Red Stock should not be overstated, since the mineralization is apparently not significantly dismembered, and Giroux et al . (2002) maintained that at least  later-stage  faults  and  dike  orientations  are  both  laterally  and  vertically  remarkably  continuous, traceable for hundreds of metres in some cases.

## 7.4.4 Alteration

Two overlapping signatures of hydrothermal activity have affected the Red Stock (see figure 7.4c): an earlier high-temperature, 'potassic' alteration stage, of K-feldspar (orthoclase)-albite-biotite-magnetiteanhydrite,  superimposed  by  a  lower  temperature  alteration  of  sericite-quartz-pyrite  (ferrocarbonatekaolinite-illite).  Quartz veining and copper sulfide deposition are associated with both the early potassic and later sericitic alteration stages.

Figure 7.4c Red Chris Hydrothermal Alteration Cross Section

<!-- image -->

The earlier 'potassic' phase is preserved only at deeper levels in the stock (see figure 7.4d), where the monzodiorite is coloured reddish (dark) brown or pink from pervasive secondary K-feldspar and semipervasive  fine  biotite.    This  is  variably  overprinted  by  the  younger,  sericite-quartz-pyrite  alteration, which is far more developed in at least the upper 500 metres of the stock, and is exclusive at the present level of erosion.  Even at depth, the sericitic overprint is present in fracture zones or around the larger veins  where  'post-potassic',  lower  temperature  and  acidic  fluids  were  able  to  penetrate.    At  shallow levels of the hydrothermal system, significant kaolinite and illite commonly form part of the sericitic overprint assemblage, especially in zones of stronger deformation.  Early-stage magnetite is preserved

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

only  at  depth,  in  the  potassic  assemblage;  elsewhere  the  characteristic  iron  oxide  is  black,  specular hematite and earthy red hematite.

A characteristic of the Red-Chris hydrothermal system is the presence of significant ferrocarbonate.  It is mainly  associated  with  the  lower  temperature  sericitic  overprint,  especially  in  accompanying  quartz veins.  After exposure, the carbonate in drill core gradually oxidizes to an orange-brown colour, clearly distinguishing it from grey quartz and silicate minerals.

## 8 DEPOSIT TYPE

## 8.1 Classification

The Red Chris deposit displays characteristics of both alkalic and calc-alkalic porphyry systems.

Calc-alkalic characteristics of the deposits are;

- ¾ the relatively centralized mineralization
- ¾ large tonnage potential of the system
- ¾ strong association of copper sulfides with quartz veins, and
- ¾ quartz-sericite-pyrite  or  'phyllic'  alteration  halo,  which  is  generally  absent  in  alkalic  systems, especially in British Columbia.

Alkalic characteristics of the deposits are;

- ¾ monzodiorite host rock lithologies
- ¾ relatively high K2O, Na2O lithogeochemistry
- ¾ copper-gold metal signature
- ¾ magnetite-bearing potassic alteration
- ¾ relatively high-grade and compact dimensions (alkalic deposits tend to be smaller tonnage, with better grades locally).

The ideal wat to classify porpgyry systems is by the use of whole rock chemistry, but reliable wholerock lithogeochemistry is limited to date. The available data indicate Red-Chris should be assigned to the high-K calc-alkalic category of Lang et al. (1995), which places it in between the fields occupied by more-diagnostic alkalic and calc-alkalic systems. Other high-K calc-alkalic deposits such as Grassberg, Oyu Tolgoi and Bingham share many characteristics with the Red Chris deposit.

## 8.2 Exploration model

Prior  to  Imperial  Metals  Corporation's  acquisition  of  Red-Chris  in  early  2007,  historic  drilling  had established significant copper-gold mineral resources in the Red Stock, down to about 400 metres from the  present-day  surface.    Since  the  objective  had  been  open-pit  feasibility,  many  drill  holes  were terminated in mineralization.  Two deeper drill holes in the eastern part of the deposit had gone down to between  600  and  750  metres  below  surface,  showing  that  mineralization  did  indeed  continue substantially below the projected pit, but this did not prompt a change in strategy at the time.

While Imperial was preparing to mine the shallow deposit, further exploration was planned in the lower levels  of  the  system  to  determine  if  the  mineralization  beneath  the  current  design  open  pit  might  be economic.  Deep drill holes, to 1000 metres depth in 2007 and 2008, and to 1,500 metres depth in 2009, were successful in finding significant copper-gold mineralization to at least 1,000 metres below surface. The best grades were encountered beneath the eastern part of the reserve, stimulating further infill and step-out  exploration,  which  is  ongoing.    The  deep  drilling  results  indicate  a  general  continuity  of mineralization  from  the  surface  to  depth,  the  main  changes  being:  (1)  an  increase  in  the  amount  of preserved  potassic  alteration  downwards,  at  the  expense  of  the  sericitization  overprint,  and  (2)  a decrease in the amount of total sulfides, although this is mainly expressed by diminishing pyrite relative

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

to  chalcopyrite  and  bornite,  such  that  copper-gold  grades  remain  consistently  moderate  to  high.    The density of quartz veins does appear to subside at deep levels (+1000m) compared to the upper parts of the system. Copper grades decline with decreasing quartz veining, so exploration is focused on tracking zones of strong quartz veining, where some exceptionally high-grade mineralization has been found.

There has been much less deep drilling (to date) beneath the central and western parts of the reserve than in the eastern part, but the emerging exploration model is permissive of an expansion of deep mineral resources to the west, as well as towards underexplored ground immediately east and northeast of the pit reserve outline.  Future drilling programs will address this potential.  Drilling beneath the unconformity on the hanging wall side of the South Boundary fault is a more ambitious project is being driven by the pronounced magnetic anomaly there.

Other  Late  Triassic-Early  Jurassic  intrusions  on  the  property  are  worthy  of  geochemical  exploration, with some already showing highly anomalous values of copper and/or molybdenum.  Further geological mapping and sampling is planned.

## 9 Mineralization

## 9.1 Introduction

(Some aspects of the mineralization such as the host rock geology and structure are described elsewhere in this document.)

Overall, the Red Stock is relatively homogeneous, and alteration and sulfides are widely disseminated within it.  However, significant copper-gold mineralization is concentrated along a west to east or eastnortheast corridor in the centre of the dike complex (see figure 7.4a), closely associated with stockworks of quartz veins introduced into zones of mild to intense, subvertical fracturing.  Copper-gold grades are correlated with the density of quartz veins.  This association between mineralization and structure  may be  related  to  repeated  reactivation  of  an  ancestral  tectonic  weakness  along  which  the  Red  Stock  was originally emplaced,  and  which  continued  to  guide  dike  intrusion,  shearing,  and  hydrothermal permeability until the system lapsed.

## 9.2 Mineral zones

Within this scenario, a number of zones of high-grade copper-gold mineralization have been delineated in the Red Stock (see figure 9.1).  The two principal zones targeted for development are the East Zone, and the Main Zone, 800 metres to the west (see figure 7.4a).  A further 1.5 km to the west of the Main Zone,  at  the  western  end  of  the  Red  Stock,  are  the  Gully  Zone  and  the  Far  West  Zone.    Some mineralization in the Far West Zone is hosted in Stuhini Group country rocks.  The age of the Red-Chris mineralization is the same as the intrusion itself, i.e. approximately 204 Ma, or Late Triassic.

## 9.3 Dimensions, depth

At surface,  East  Zone  and  Main  Zone  mineralization  extends  over  approximately  1,500  metres,  eastnortheast.  In width, it ranges from at least 200 metres in the East Zone to 500 metres in the Main Zone. The depth of significant mineralization is about 1,000 metres in the East Zone and in the apparent centre of the Main Zone.  Beyond the areas of deep drilling, depth of mineralization is known only to around 400 metres.

The  Gulley  zone  footprint  is  approximately  500  metres  across,  east-west.    Mineralization  begins  at surface, and has been drilled to a depth of approximately 400 metres.  The Far West zone has a smaller footprint and has seen less drilling.

## 9.4 Mineralization textures

Pyrite, chalcopyrite and lesser bornite are the principal sulfide minerals; minor covellite occurs as inclusions in  pyrite,  and  molybdenite,  sphalerite  and  galena  occur  very  locally  in  trace  amounts.    In  the  ore  zones, chalcopyrite  is  most  abundant  in  the  quartz-sulfide  vein  stockworks  and  quartz-sericite-ferrocarbonate alteration  selvages  (see  figure  9.4).    In  quartz  veins,  chalcopyrite  occurs  as  disseminations  or  mm-scale blebs or coarser aggregates, and as fracture coatings and fillings both parallel to and crosscutting the quartz veins.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Copper sulfide content is roughly proportional to the intensity of quartz veining, except in the Gully and Far West zones.  Where quartz-sulfide vein stockwork intensity diminishes, copper grades may remain elevated due to the presence of fine-grained chalcopyrite (and pyrite) disseminated in the monzodiorite, and along fractures (commonly with pyrite veinlets), and rarely as pure veinlets.  This is particularly the case in the Main Zone at depth (300-400 m).

Bornite is most common as microveinlets and fine-grained (0.5 mm) disseminations in the quartz-sulfide vein stockwork zones of the East Zone, both within the vein cores and as crosscutting veins.  In zones of strong  sheeted  quartz  veins  in  the  East  Zone,  copper  assays  can  reach  several  per  cent.    Bornite  is  also intimately associated with disseminations, fracture fillings and coatings and aggregates of dark red or blueblack specular hematite.  This association makes visual estimates of grade difficult and invariably too low. Bornite  also  occurs  as  fine-grained  disseminations  in  the  highly  altered  Main  Phase  monzodiorite  of  the eastern Main Zone.  Bornite in the Gully Zone is much less abundant than in the East and Main zones. In portions of the deep East zone, bornite is the dominant copper mineral.

Gold,  second  in  economic  importance  to  copper,  occurs  spatially-  and  genetically-associated  with  the copper mineralization.  Microscopic gold grains are intimately associated with the copper sulfides.  Silver values are geochemically low but still of economic importance.

Pyrite occurs commonly as very fine- to fine-grained, anhedral to euhedral disseminations, fracture fillings, and veins.  Within the mineralized zones it is commonly poikilitic with numerous copper sulfide and iron oxide inclusions; outside the zones, the inclusions are commonly sericite and dolomite.  Pyrite content is variable throughout the deposit, ranging from less than 1% to 10%.  It's distribution is highest above the &gt;4% sulfur line shown on figure 7.4d and diminishes significantly below that. It is most abundant peripheral to the higher grade copper mineralization, where it is not truncated by faulting.  Pyrite is abnormally low or absent  in  many  areas  of  the  high-grade  East  Zone  except  near  the  surface,  but  it  is  quite  ubiquitous throughout the Main Zone ore.  Later stage pyrite (± chalcopyrite) veins cut quartz vein stockworks, and are typically associated with narrow hematite veinlets.  The partial replacement by pyrite or other sulfides of hornblende  phenocrysts  and,  to  a  lesser  degree,  plagioclase  phenocrysts  is  common.  Significant  pyrite occurs in the Stuhini Group volcanics up to 100 to 150 metres from the intrusive contact, especially where it is accompanied by rusty-weathering bleaching from the complete destruction of ferromagnesian minerals by carbonate alteration, probably related to hydrothermal fluid circulation around the stock.

Secondary magnetite and hematite are most commonly associated with mineralized quartz stockwork zones and plagioclase-hornblende-biotite dikes where they may represent up to 10 modal per cent. They usually occur as fine-grained disseminations in the veins and host rocks but they also occur as magnetite-hematite veinlets and quartz-magnetite veinlets.  Magnetite is more prevalent at deeper levels; higher in the system it is typically replaced by specularite and ultimately earthy red hematite.

Prominent limonitic gossans occur within the steep slopes and drainages over the Gully and Far West zones. However, in areas of low relief such as over the East and Main zones, weak limonite only extends 1 or 2 metres beneath the top of the bedrock. The overlying gravel till layer is often very limonitic or composed of ferricrete.  Thus, it appears that glaciation has removed any of the supergene mineralization that might have existed over the Red Chris deposit. However, supergene chalcocite mineralization has reportedly been

intersected in shallow drilling near the headwaters of the East Gully drainage.  Chalcocite occurs along with malachite, azurite and manganese oxides in this oxidized zone.

## 10 Exploration

Since acquiring the Red Chris Property in 2007 Imperial Metals has conducted an aggressive exploration and  drilling  program.  The  program  has  consisted  of  diamond  drilling,  geological  mapping,  and geophysics. From 2007 to 2009 Imperial has drilled 20 holes targeting deep mineralization mostly in the East Zone (see chapter 11 for details).

## 10.1 Geophysical Programs

## 10.1.1 Titan 24 Geophysical Survey

A  Titan-24  geophysical  survey  was  conducted  in  2009  as  an  exploration  tool  to  delineate  potential porphyry  style  mineralization  at  depth  within  and  surrounding  the  Red  Chris  deposit.  The  survey consisted of 13 parallel lines with 400m line separation with station spacing of 100m. DC, IP, and MT measurements were completed along each line. The survey line length was approximately 2.4km plus additional current injections up to 500m beyond the ends of the survey line for the DC/IP measurements. The DC/IP measurements were completed along a total of 30km (40.2km with current extension). The MT surveys were carried out along a total length of 30km. Finalized results and interpretations of the survey are pending.

## 10.1.2  Airborne Magnetic Survey

A 1,295km Aeroquest airborne magnetic survey was flow over the Red Chris deposit between October 13 th to October 15 th , 2009. The survey was conducted with a helicopter stinger-mounted cesium vapour magnetometer.  Ancillary  equipment  included  a  GPS  navigation  system,  radar  altimeter,  digital  video recording system and a base station magnetometer.

## 10.1.3 Proton Magnetometer Survey

A  Proton  Magnetometer  program  was  established  in  2009  with  the  use  of  a  GSM  19T  Series Magnetometer  V7  unit.  The  program  commenced  August  15 th and  concluded  September  31 st .  The extensive program included traverses over the entire Titan geophysical grid, road and trail networks as well as concentrated traverses in areas of interest. The purpose of the program was to identify covered geological contacts and faults, as well as add to the growing geophysical database for vectoring purposes within the Red Chris deposit.

## 10.2 Composite Sampling Program

Eighteen  drillholes  from  all  the  deposit  zones  were  selected  for  multi-element  analysis  to  assist  in targeting deeper mineralization in peripheral areas. Core from the selected drill holes was quartered and bagged individually according to original sample tag number (eg 94851). Samples were then composited into groups of four to six sequential samples (eg 94851-94855). In the case that a tag number within a composite sample represented a standard, duplicate or blank, that tag was eliminated from the composite sample. The four to six samples that yielded one composite were placed together in a rice sack, and shipped to Acme Analytical Laboratories in Smithers. A total of 2500 quarter cut samples comprising 486 composite samples were cut and shipped.

The samples were crushed in Smithers using a Terminator Jaw Crusher to 80% passing 10 mesh sieves. The samples were then shipped to Vancouver and pulverized using a ring and puck to 85% passing 200 mesh sieves. The representative portion of the pulverized material was then weighed and separated to be homogenized with the remaining samples. The composite sample was then sent analyzed using a 4-acid, 1EX  ICP-MS  package.  The  remainders  of  the  pulps  were  sent  via  commercial  vehicle  transport  to Imperial Metal's storage facility at Mt. Polley Mine.

## 10.3 Camp and Infrastructure Improvements

The  2007  to  2009  exploration  program  utilized  the  long  since  established  Red  Chris  camp,  with additional resources and improvements made to accommodate increasingly larger programs and winter operations. The established 25 man camp is complete with a kitchen, dining area, dry, showers, flush toilets,  washer/dryer,  office,  maintenance  sheds,  and  individual  4-man  tent  cabins.  There  is  also  a dedicated first aid shack, compliant with Health and Safety requirements. Water to the camp is derived from a 100m well located 100m east of the camp (see figure 10.3).

Due to an increase in the program scope and year round exploration requirements, four trailer sleeper units  were  installed  in  late  2008.  The  four  new  units  (equipped  with  7  individual  flush  toilets  and  6 showers)  provide  an  additional  32  man  capacity  in  camp   The  trailers  are  arranged  in  rows  of  two . lengthwise, with the space in between the sets of trailers enclosed from the elements adding additional dry/storage  facilities.  Additional  camp  improvements  included  insulating  the  tent  cabins  (office  and sleeping units) and core shack with thermal batt insulation. Further to that core shack was upgraded with the  addition  of  a  core  cutting  (two  rock  saws)  and  sample  preparation  rooms.  Additional  diesel  drip heaters were installed throughout the camp in preparation for winter operations.

Improvements  to  drill  operations  included  the  installation  of  a  750m  waterline  from  Border  Creek southward, surfacing along the periphery of the East Zone. A 3ft by 10ft perforated culvert was installed vertically  along  the  periphery  of  Border  Creek,  and  enclosed  by  a  monitoring/pumping  station.  The waterline was buried in a 7-8ft deep trench to ensure its utility during the winter months.

## 10.4 Property Access Trail

The  17km  gravel  access  trail,  which  branches  off  at  the  6km  marker  of  the  Ealue  Lake  road,  was completed in early 2009. Further upgrades to the trail included the installation of two eco barriers, to prevent potential slope failure, and multiple culverts, to prevent washouts. Preventative reclamation was also undertaken at both ends of the Coyote Creek bridge crossing in order to eliminate potential acid rock drainage generated from pyritic rock fill (see figure 10.4).

## 11 Drilling

Upon  acquisition  of  the  Red  Chris  project,  Imperial  conducted  a  helicopter-based  diamond  drilling program in the summer of 2007 to test for higher-grade material below the bottom of the planned pit proposed  in  the  2005  feasibility  study.  Initial  results  were  rewarding  prompting  the  company  to construct an access into the project area prior to resumption of the deep drilling. The campaign of deep exploration resumed in the fall of 2008 and then from July through December of 2009. Figure 11.4a shows a comparison of the drilling at the end of 2006 with the drilling to the end of 2009.

## 11.1 Deep Drilling - 2007

Historical  results  from  drillholes  140  and  06-324  indicated  the  presence  of  grades  in  excess  of  1% CuEQ up to 400m below the bottom of the pit design (see figure 11.4a) . Imperial completed six holes in 2007 for a total length of 4835 metres. The most significant drillhole was 07-335, collared vertically in the core of the East zone, 07-335 graded 1.01% copper, 1.26 g/t gold and 3.92 ppm silver over its entire length in bedrock of 1024.1 metres, extending high-grade mineralization in the East Zone down another 270m from its  previously-known  extent.  Drillhole  07-336,  collared  in  the  middle  of  the  Main  Zone, returned a vertical intercept of 996.4 metres grading 0.40% copper, 0.38 g/t gold, and 1.34 ppm silver. Drillhole 07-338, collared in the East Zone, was drilled from the same collar location as 07-335, but was angled to the north at a -78° dip. The final 46.5m of this drillhole graded 1.05% copper, 1.67g/t gold, and 1.41ppm silver, before being abandoned at 721.5 metres due to stuck rods. The final drillhole of 2007,  07-340,  was  collared  in  the  East  Zone  and  drilled  at  095°  azimuth.  07-340  returned  753.9m grading 0.60% copper, 0.56 g/t gold and 2.07ppm silver before terminating in a fault at 760.0 metres depth. The diamond drill program was supplemented by a deposit wide proton magnetometer survey.

## 11.2 East Zone Deep Exploration Drilling - 2008

In  2008  three  vertical  holes,  totaling  2,220  metres,  were  drilled  in  the  East  zone,  targeting  the  deep mineralization that was discovered in the 2007 program holes 07-335 and 07-338. The first two holes of 2008  were  abandoned  above  their  target  depth  due  to  adverse  ground  conditions  and  technical difficulties with drilling. The third hole, RC08-343, collared 165m northwest of 07-335 was completed to 1273 metres, and encountered 433 metres of mineralization between 840.3 metres and 1273.2 metres, grading 0.36% copper, 0.46 g/t gold and 1.13 ppm silver. Within this intersection was a higher grade interval of 97.5m grading 0.63% copper, 0.96 g/t gold and 1.89 ppm silver (see figure 11.4a). The drill program was supplemented by geological mapping survey to further refine geological contacts (8 rock samples). To reduce helicopter reliance a 17 km access trail was constructed to camp, branching off at the  6  kilometre  marker  on  the  Ealue  Lake  Road.  Collar  locations  and  orientations  are  summarized in Table 11.2.

## 11.3 Footprints Regional Drilling Program

In  the  summer  of  2009  Imperial  sponsored  and  participated  in  the  University  of  BC's  (MDRU)  and Oregon State University's Porphyry Footprint Project. The purpose of the project was to analyze and identify  the  regional  geochemical  signatures  of  large  porphyry  deposits.  Aside  from  the  geochemical investigation, the high density of drillholes also served to update and refine the local geology, which is masked  by  overburden.  The  project  consisted  of  138  diamond  drill  holes  totaling  2,440metres.  The program was accomplished with the aid of a low impact Bobcat mounted Hydra Core drill (BQTK rods) and a track mounted Marooka support water truck (see figure 11.3). The Footprints project is an ongoing project; preliminary results have not yet been released.

## 11.4 2009 East Zone Exploration Drilling

The 2009 exploration diamond drilling consisted of 11 diamond drillholes totaling 16,852.54 metres in length. Between July 1 and December 15, 2009, a total of 14,172m of HQ/NQ core was drilled with the use of a Boyles 56 and an LF-230 (see figure 11.4 for locations). The East Zone drilling program was a continued initiative from the 2007/2008 exploration programs, which discovered the extension of high grade  Cu-Au  mineralization  past  the  previously  established  pit  outline,  down  to  over  a  kilometer  in depth (RC07-335 graded 1.01% copper, 1.26 g/t gold and 3.92 g/t silver over 1024.1m, ending in high grade mineralization). Collar locations and orientations are summarized in Table 11.4a.

The 2009 drilling program successfully expanded the previously known mineralization in the Deep East Zone. All drill holes encountered significant intercepts of copper and gold mineralization, and added to the volume of the deep resource. The highlight of the program was Hole RC09-350 which was collared approximately  170  metres  northeast  of  drill  hole  07-335  and  returned  432.5  metres  grading  2.00% copper  and  3.80  g/t  gold  which  included  a  152.5m  interval  grading  4.12%  copper  and  8.83  g/t  gold starting at a depth of 540.0

The  full  lateral  constraints  on  the  mineralization  in  the  East  Zone  have  not  been  fully  established. Detailed  geological  modeling  of  ICP  data,  quartz-vein  densities,  gold-sulphide  ratios,  and  magnetic susceptibility  have  also  been  updated,  and  the  evolving  model  suggests  the  presence  of  additional mineralization. Other significant intercepts from the East Zone drill program are outlined in Table 11.4b.

Two holes from the 2010 program (RC10-355, RC10-360) were completed and released prior to completion of this report and have been added to database used to complete the new block model and resource estimate. The significant intercepts are also listed in Table 11.4b

## 11.5 Geotechnical Drilling

Knight Peisold Ltd. was contracted to design and implement a geotechnical program to further evaluate proposed locations for mine infrastructure and facilities.  The  geotechnical  program  was  conducted  in September 2009, and consisted of 4 holes in the newly proposed plant site area, 2 holes in potential crusher site areas, and 2 holes in the valley bottom of the tailings storage facility site. A total of 239.7m was  drilled  with  the  use  of  a  low  impact  Bobcat  Mounted  Hydra  Core  drill  (HQ  rods)  and  a  track mounted Marooka support water truck. Additional information was collected from 3 embankment cuts along the newly developed tailings access, data from previously installed groundwater monitoring wells and piezometers, and from site material mapping. This program is ongoing.

## 12 Sampling methods and Approach

## 12.1 Drilling Core Handling Procedures

Drill core handling begins at the drill where the core tube is retrieved from the downhole origin of the drilling, by way of an overshot and wireline. The wireline is used to hoist the coretube to surface where the drill crew extracts the drillcore from the coretube. The drill core is placed into 1.3 metre long core boxes, laid out so that it is in the same order that it was retrieved in. The core placement reflects English reading with the most shallow core in the top lefthand corner of the corebox and the deepest core located in the bottom right hand corner of the corebox. Permanent marker is used to lable box with information on the hole number, footage and box number. Wooden blocks labeled with the appropriate metreage are placed between each drill run. Once full, the core box is secured for transport to the logging facility.

The  Red  Chris  site  has  a  dedicated  facility  for  handing  and  logging  drill  core,  known  as  'the  Core Shack' (see figure 12.1 above and 12.2 below). Once drillcore is received into the Core Shack, the core is  washed and logged (geotechnically and geologically). Then the core is separated into 2.5m sample intervals  by  a  geologist.  The  2.5m  sample  length  can  be  split  in  two,  if  needed  to  conform  to  a geological  contact.  Geotechnical  data  collected  included  core  recovery,  RQD,  fracture  counts,  core strength,  and  overall  ratings,  with  special  attention  paid  to  the  occurrence  of  slickensides  and  fault gouge.

Each core box is permanently labled with aluminum tags which show information reflecting hole name, box number and metreage at the top and bottom of the core stored in the box. Sample tags are stapled into the box at the beginning of each sample interval.

The  core  is  logged  with  a  KT-9  magnetic  susceptibility  meter  over  every  sample  interval.  Ten susceptibility  reading  are  taken  for  each  sample,  and  then  averaged.  Geology  data  is  recorded  into Lagger  (Northface  Software),  a  database  program  designed  for  exploration  drilling.  Sample  tags  are placed at each sample contact by a geologist. Standards, duplicates, and blanks are randomly inserted within every 17 consecutive core samples.

The marked and tagged core is then photographed. Three additional whole rock samples are collected every 100m for geotechnical analysis. The first sample consists of a 10cm drill hole core plug which is sent to ACME for specific gravity analysis. The remaining two core samples are selected to test the axial (4cm NQ and 6cm HQ) and diametral (5cm NQ and 10cm HQ) strength of the rock. This is conducted onsite with a point load testing device.

Samples are returned to the core boxes after tested. The core is subsequently cut longitudinally using diamond bladed rock saws. Cut core is placed into clear poly-ore bags with the sample tag and zapstrapped. The other half-core is left in the core box, with the sample tag stub stapled to the start of the appropriate sample interval. Archived core is stored on-site in wooden racks. Sample bags are placed into white plastic rice bags, labeled, and zap-strapped with red numbered ties. The rice bags of samples are  driven  to  Iskut  and  stored  on  pallets  at  the  locked  Bandstra  Depot.  Twice  a  week  samples  are shipped via Bandstra to ACME's preparation Lab in Smithers.

## 12.2 Down Hole Survey and Collar Coordinates

Downhole  surveys  were  periodically  conducted  on  the  drillholes  to  measure  their  deviation.  This  is facilitated  during  bit  changes  and  hole  shutdowns  by  using  a  Reflex  EZ-Trac  downhole  probe. Measurements were taken every 9.14m (three rods), with the probe suspended by aluminum running gear  7m  beyond  the  drill-bit.  The  EZ-Trac  is  manufactured  such  that  a  handheld  computer  is synchronized  to  the  probe,  and  measurements  can  quickly  be  obtained  during  the  pulling  of  rods. Magnetic interference of the EZ-Trac is negligible at Red Chris due to the low amount of magnetite. Data recorded at each survey station included azimuth, dip, temperature, and magnetic field strength. Drillhole collars were surveyed with a handheld Garmin 60csx GPS, with accuracy to 3m.

## 13 Sampling Preparation, Analyses and Security

## 13.1 Sampling Method, Approach and Security - 2007 to 2009

Drill core from the 2007, 2008 and 2009 drilling programs was processed, logged and sampled on site by Imperial Metals employees. Delivery of the core from the drill to the logging and sampling facility was via helicopter (2007 program) or truck (2008 and 2009 programs). Once the core was delivered to the core shack, it was treated as described in section 12.1.

During  the  2007  and  2008  drilling  programs,  the  samples  were  flown  out  in  canvas  mega-bags  via helicopter to a staging area at Tatogga Lake Resort. Here, the samples were placed in a locked container by  Imperial  Metals  employees.  The  samples  were  shipped  approximately  once  a  week  via  Canadian Frieghtways Ltd. to the ACME Analytical Laboratories preparation lab in Smithers, British Columbia. Beginning in 2009, the rice bags were driven by truck to Iskut by an Imperial Metals employee and hand-loaded onto pallets in a secure location at the Bandstra Trucking Depot. Twice a week, the samples were delivered via Bandstra Transportation Systems to ACME's preparation lab in Smithers.

ACME preparation lab personnel recorded the shipment number, arrival time and security tag numbers for each sample shipment. The samples were dried at 60 C before being crushed using a jaw crusher to o 80% passing. Samples were then split and pulverized in a ring pulverizer to 85% minus 200 mesh, rolled and bagged. ACME then arranged for the pulp samples to be delivered to the main ACME Analytical Laboratory  in  Vancouver,  British  Columbia  for  assaying.  The  remaining  coarse  reject  samples  were bagged and labeled with the appropriate sample number and sent via commercial vehicle transport to Imperial  Metal's  storage  facility  at  the  Mount  Polley  Mine  in  Likely,  British  Columbia.  ACME Analytical Laboratories Ltd. is an ISO 9001 registered analytical laboratory.

All samples were analysed for gold, copper, iron and a 36-element geochemistry suite. Gold analysis was  completed  through  fire  assay  fusion  by  ICP-ES  (inductively  coupled  plasma)  on  a  30g  sample. Copper and iron were analyzed by ICP-ES with an aqua-regia digestion. In addition, all samples were analysed using ICP-MS with an aqua-regia digestion for a 36-element suite. The 36 elements analysed in the  ICP  suite  were:    silver  (Ag),  aluminum  (Al),  arsenic  (As),  gold  (Au),  boron  (B),  barium  (Ba), bismuth (Bi), calcium (Ca), cadmium (Cd), cobalt (Co), copper (Cu), chrome (Cr), iron (Fe), gallium (Ga), mercury (Hg), potassium (K), lanthanum (La), magnesium (Mg), manganese (Mn), molybdenum (Mo), sodium (Na), nickel (Ni), phosphorus (P), lead (Pb), sulphur (S), scandium (Sc), antimony (Sb), selenium (Se), strontium (Sr), thorium (Th), thallium (Tl), titanium (Ti), uranium (U), vanadium (V), zinc (Zn), tungsten (W).

## 14 Data Verification

## 14.1 Pre-2007 Data

Quality assurance and quality control ('QA/QC') programs began on the Red Chris Project during the 1994 drill program conducted by American Bullion and continued through to the 2003-2006  programs. The  analytical  quality  of  the  1994  and  1995  diamond  drill  programs  were  assessed  by  Barry  Smee, Ph.D., P.Geo., of Smee and Associates Consulting Ltd. and presented in two separate reports (Smee, 1995 and Smee, 1996). During the 2003 drill campaign RCDC retained A.J. Sinclair, Ph.D., P.Eng. to evaluate the earlier work and comment on the 2003 QA/QC procedures and results. Both consultants had favourable conclusions on the QA/QC programs.

' The  analytical  data  for  the  Red  Chris  Project  is  well  controlled.  Standards  prove  that  the  data  is accurate  to  within  acceptable  limits.  Duplicates  show  a  very  small  rotational  bias  between  the  two laboratories, with Min-En being slightly high on copper, and slightly low on gold, when compared with Chemex. However, the differences are not significant and do not impact the validity of analysis. ' Smee, (1995)

A complete copy of Sinclair's findings is appended to 2004 feasibility study and available on Imperial Metals Web site.

http://www.imperialmetals.com/i/pdf/2004TechnicalReport-RedChris2.pdf

Sinclair  updated  his  report  in  early  2007  to  reflect  his  review  of  the  data  from  the  2005  and  2006 programs and his conclusions were equally supportive of the analytical data received for that work.

All  the  past  drilling  programs  at  the  Red  Chris  Project  have  well  documented  procedures  for  quality assurance  and  quality  control.  Checks  on  standards  in  various  grade  ranges  have  shown  acceptable accuracy at both the primary analytical laboratories. Blank samples reported low values at or near the detection limit indicating the absence of contamination of material during preparation. Duplicate pulps sent to second labs have shown no significant analytical bias. The analysis of 'blind' duplicates by the primary lab (IPL) has shown the data are unbiased and have a moderate level of random analytical error. Re-analysis of 2 nd half  cores have shown sampling variability to be random and as a result should be minimized during the resource estimation. In the author's opinion the pre-2007 assay data at Red Chris are both suitable and of the quality necessary to use in a Resource Estimate.

## 14.2 2007-2009 Quality Assurance and Quality Control Program

The QA/QC program from 2007 to 2009 involved the random placement of a duplicate (DUP), blank (BLK)  and  standard  reference  samples  (STD)  within  every  17  consecutive  core  samples.  Three standards  were  used  to  reflect  low,  medium  and  high  grades.  Table  14.2  summarizes  the  regular mainstream samples (MS) and QA/QC samples (duplicates, standards and blanks) analysed during the 2007, 2008 and 2009 drilling programs at Red Chris.

Table 14.2 QA/QC Sample Summary of Drilling Programs by Year

| YEAR   |   MS |   DUP |   STD |   BLK |   TOTAL |
|--------|------|-------|-------|-------|---------|
| 2007   | 1939 |   114 |   114 |   114 |    2281 |
| 2008   |  917 |    54 |    53 |    54 |    1078 |
| 2009   | 4835 |   284 |   282 |   281 |    5682 |
| ALL    | 7691 |   452 |   449 |   449 |    9041 |

The standard reference material used during the 2007 drilling program was prepared by CDN Labs of Surrey,  British  Columbia.  The  custom  standards  were  originally  prepared  for  use  during  Imperial Metals' 2007 Mount Polley exploration drilling program. The material used to prepare the standards was collected from the remaining rejects from the 2005 and 2006 drilling programs at Mount Polley.  The rejects were selected based on assay intervals that would yield a low, medium and high copper and gold reference  assay.  CDN  Labs  prepared  and  packaged  three  homogeneous  standards  for  use  as  assay standard reference material. The standards were certified by Barry Smee, Ph.D., P.Geo. of Smee and Associates Consulting Ltd. The calculated assay values for the three standards are, 0.261% Cu (0.207g/t Au), 0.597% Cu (0.593g/t Au), and 2.37%Cu (1.05g/t Au).

The 2008 and 2009 drilling programs utilized the same low grade standard (MP06LG) used in the 2007 drilling  program.  Pre-processed  and  certified  medium  and  high  grade  copper/gold  standards  were purchased from CDN Labs. The calculated assay values for these standards are, 0.451% Cu (0.570g/t Au)  and  0.683%  Cu  (0.730g/t  Au).  The  pre-made  standards  purchased  from  CDN  Labs  were  also certified by Barry Smee, Ph.D., P.Geo. of Smee and Associates Consulting Ltd.

Copper  and  gold  assays  for  the  standard  reference  material  were  monitored  for  bias  and  precision. Standards met QA/QC requirements if the assayed values were within 3 standard deviations of the mean calculated standard value, as stated in the reference material certification. To monitor for bias, any two consecutive standard assay values could not be above two standard deviations on the same side of the mean calculated standard value.  Failure to meet these requirements resulted in a re-assay of the failed standard,  along  with  at  least  ten  sequential  samples  above  and  below  that  standard.  Re-assays  were generally completed within two weeks of receipt of the original certificate. By the end of each program, no sample intervals had outstanding QA/QC issues.

Duplicate samples, taken to measure the precision of analysis, were randomly inserted into the sampling sequence within 17 consecutive core samples. These samples were made from quartering the half-core sample at  the  time  of  cutting  or  splitting.  All  of  the  assay  results  for  the  duplicate  samples  matched within reason. The calculated correlation coefficients are 0.99 for copper and 0.98 for gold.

Blank  samples  were  randomly  inserted  into  the  sampling  stream  by  Imperial  geologists.  The  blank material consisted of crushed rock from a highways gravel pit located along the Likely highway in the central interior of BC. This material was bagged in poly ore bags in one kilogram samples. If a blank sample returned copper and gold assay values over a pre-determined threshold (0.05% Cu and 0.05g/t Au), the blank reject along with at least ten sequential core rejects (above and below the blank) would be re-processed and re-assayed. If the re-processed reject failed to meet the QA/QC requirements, the halfcore was quartered and new samples in the affected range were re-submitted to the lab for processing and assaying. The majority of the blank samples assayed at or below the detection limit. Out of the 449 blank samples assayed between 2007 and 2009, 5 samples failed to meet QA/QC requirements. In each of these cases, the affected range of samples was re-processed and re-submitted to the lab for assaying. By the end of each program, all blank samples had met QA/QC requirements.

## 15 Adjacent Properties

In the immediate area of the Red Chris deposit the BC government mineral inventory database (Minfile) records a few mineral showings, most of which are low level geochemical anomalies or small showings with limited tonnage potential. Immediately to the west is the Gin Property where historical work was conducted to look for Eskay Creek style targets due to the presence of prospective stratigraphy, but no mineralization  has  been  identified.  To  the  east,  the  Eldorado/Bonanza  property  has  received  similar grassroots style exploration for porphyry targets, no significant mineralization has been identified.

The two properties of significance in the area are the GJ owned by NGEX Resources and Rok which is owned  by  Firesteel  Resources  Inc.  The  GJ  property  is  located  on  the  southern  end  of  the  Klastline Plateau, over 30 km to the west of Red Chris. The property is underlain by Stuhini Group, and overlain by Lower Jurassic, Hazelton Group. Intruding the volcano-sedimentary sequence are numerous small plugs and sills of diorite to monzonite composition. The largest of these is the Groat Stock which hosts porphyry copper-gold mineralization in at least four areas; the Donnelly, North Donnelly, GJ and North zones. GJ has a 43-101 compliant measured and indicated resource, at a cut-off of 0.20% copper, of 153.3 million tonnes grading 0.321% copper and 0.369 g/t gold. An additional inferred resource, at a cut-off of 0.20% copper, is 23 million tonnes grading 0.26% copper and 0.31 g/t gold (NGEX Resources website).

The Rok property is north of Coyote Creek, to the northwest of Red Chris, with a relatively small area of mineralization  exposed  at  surface.  Much  of  the  prospective  area  is  covered  by  a  thick  package  of Toodogonne volcanics thought to be younger than the age of mineralization emplacement, so the extent of  the  copper-gold  mineralization  is  not  known.  The  mineralization  observed  occurs  in  structurallycontrolled  quartz-vein  stockworks,  however  there  is  no  evidence  of  a  large  intrusive  body  to  host significant porphyry style deposit. A blind and untested magnetic anomaly in the valley bottom provides encouragement that a large hydrothermal system may be present (see figure 15.1 for locations).

## 16 Mineral Processing and Metallurgical Testing

Mineral processing testwork conducted by Lakefield Research Limited in 1995 and 1996  and earlier work by G&amp;T Metallurgical Services Ltd., indicated the Red Chris deposit responds well to processing by conventional crushing, grinding and flotation to produce a commercial  grade copper-gold concentrate.

These earlier programs formed the basis for the 2004 Feasibility Study program conducted on newly acquired drill core from the 2003 exploration program. A comprehensive metallurgical test program was completed for the 2004 Feasibility Study. The Study used various processing schemes on representative samples of Red Chris ores.

The  Mineral  processing  and  metallurgical  test  work  was  done  principally  at  Lakefield  and  G&amp;T Metallurgical Services, utilizing both laboratory and pilot scale tests. The tests were conducted in logical sequence to determine an acceptable commercially viable process. These test are summarized in section 16.1.

In  January,  2010  Imperial  Metals  contracted  G&amp;T  to  initiate  a  scoping  level  study  to  examine  the metallurgical  characteristic  of  the  deeper  areas  of  the  East  Zone.  This  study  used  core  from  the 2008/2009 drilling programs (see section 16.3). The study is attached in Appendix A.

## 16.1 2004 Feasibility Study Testing

The 2004 Feasibility Study comprehensive test work programs was performed at G&amp;T using fresh drill core from the 2003 exploration program. This material was selected to be representative of the material to be mined in the open pit contemplated in the Feasibility Study. The G&amp;T metallurgical program was carried out in following three phases:

- ¾ Phase 1: Flowsheet Development;
- ¾ Phase 2: Recovery Variability; and
- ¾ Phase 3: Pilot Plant Concentrate Production

The  results  of  the  G&amp;T  2004  metallurgical  programs  were  used  as  the  basis  for  the  design  and consumption parameters for the Red Chris concentrator.  The G&amp;T 2004 programs confirmed previous test work that the mill flow sheet for Red Chris would utilize conventional processing techniques for a porphyry copper-gold flotation plant using:

- ¾ SAG and ball mill grinding to produce a nominal 150µ product to rougher flotation;
- ¾ Rougher flotation with an 18 minute retention time;
- ¾ Regrind of the rougher flotation concentrate to a nominal 25µ product to cleaner flotation;
- ¾ Two stages of cleaner flotation to produce a final copper-gold concentrate; and
- ¾ Thickening and dewatering of the final copper-gold concentrate for transport to off-site smelting facilities.

The proposed flow sheet is expected produce an average 27% copper concentrate at a copper recovery of 87%.  Test  work  indicates  that  the  gold  will  track  the  chalcopyrite,  pyrite  and  gangue  in  near  equal portions throughout the process resulting in a gold concentrate ranging from 5g/t to 25g/t of concentrate at an average recovery of 50%.

## 16.1.1 Sample Selection and Metallurgical Composites

Drill core from the 2003 exploration program was used for all 2004 metallurgical testing.  A ¼ split of selected sections from 23 holes was assembled into composites representing possible mining sequences. (see table 16.1a and 16.1b).

Three holes were drilled with HQ coring, #256, #256A and #283, for the purpose of obtaining a larger volume sample in each of the Main and East Zones.  The remaining core from holes 256A and 283 was used for grinding and work index studies.

The samples selected for metallurgical testing cover the majority of production within the East and Main ore  zones  with  emphasis  spatially  on  zones  in  the  first  nine  years  of  the  seventeen  year  mining production phase. The original sampling strategy was based on a mine plan and production level that has been  superseded  by  the  one  forming  the  basis  of  this  technical  report.  Additional  sampling  and metallurgical testing may be required to more fully characterize the metallurgical response of the entire deposit and link it to the current mine plan. Over the mine life, the East Zone will account for about 27% of mine production, but will average about 40% in the first six years of operation.

Portions  of  the  drill  core  were  blended  to  make  up  a  series  of  composite  samples  for  metallurgical testing.  Composites MZ-1, -2, -3 and EZ-1, -2, -3, -4 represent horizontal layers within each zone that would be mined sequentially.  Composite EZ-5 was a high grade sample prepared to study the effect of metallurgy at higher grades.  Composites MZ-4, MZ-5 and EZ-6 are lower grade, representing material that will be stockpiled during the seventeen year mining phase and processed at a later date in years 18 through 25.  Table 16.1a lists actual composite head grades used in the metallurgical testing. Over the mine life the average copper and grades of Main and East zones are expected to average about 0.42% and gold 0.30-0.39g/t respectively. In the first nine years of production the Main zone copper grade will average about 0.46% and the average grade of the Main zone metallurgical composite is about 0.47%. The average grade of the East Zone composite and global sample is relatively higher than the current production  plan.  Additional  sampling  and  metallurgical  work  has  been  recommended  to  test  grades closer to the mine plan for this zone.

## 16.1.2 Mineralogy

Pyrite, chalcopyrite and lesser bornite are the principal sulphide minerals in the portion of the Red Chris deposit planned to be mined by the 2004/2005 mine plan.  Minor covellite occurs as inclusions in pyrite, and  molybdenite,  sphalerite  and  galena  occur  locally  in  trace  amounts.    Gold,  second  in  economic importance to copper, occurs as native and electrum, genetically-associated with the copper and pyrite mineralization.

The Main Zone mineralogy consists predominantly of chalcopyrite and pyrite with an average pyrite: chalcopyrite ratio of 10:1.   The East Zone mineralogy has an average pyrite: chalcopyrite ratio of 4:1, with  significant  amounts  of  bornite  present.    The  non-sulphide  gangue  minerals  include  a  mixture  of sericite, quartz, ankerite, dolomite, illite and magnesite.   There are no oxide copper minerals present in the material tested.

Gold  occurrence  is  higher  in  the  East  Zone,  and  relative  to  the  Main  Zone,  it  is  more  dominantly associated  with  copper  sulphides  than  pyrite.  While  the  basic  mineralogy  of  occurrence  is  similar throughout  both  zones  this  results  in  better  gold  recoveries  in  East  Zone.  Table  16.1c  lists  the mineralogy of the metallurgical composites.

## 16.1.3 2004 Metallurgical Test Program

The program of flowsheet development studies and metallurgical response was based on the following series of objectives:

- ¾ Study the mineral composition and fragmentation characteristics of several ore composites from the Main and East Zones, representing material to be processed during the early years of the operation.
- ¾ Devise  a  set  of  common  treatment  parameters  for  processing  the  Red  Chris  ore  types,  including flotation feed sizing, regrind product sizing, reagent regime and flowsheet configurations.
- ¾ Conduct a series of work index tests to determine ore hardness variation for mill sizing and power requirements.
- ¾ Conduct modal assessments on groups of cycle test products to determine if further enhancements in metallurgical performance of the ores would be technically feasible.
- ¾ Assess the concentrate quality with regard to mineral composition and minor element concentrations.
- ¾ Using  optimum  treatment  parameters,  perform  a  series  of  standard  tests  on  a  variety  of  samples throughout the orebody to determine the variation in expected metallurgy.

## 16.1.4  Mineral Liberation Characteristics

A primary grind of 150 micron  K 80 was determined as optimum for the Red Chris ore.  At this feed sizing, 50% of the chalcopyrite and bornite particles are liberated, along with 90% pyrite liberation and 95% non-sulphide gangue minerals.  These liberation figures are within the typical range of standard industry  practice.    The  average  liberation  of  minerals  in  the  flotation  feed  of  twenty  two  porphyry copper-gold deposits in G&amp;T's data base at a primary grind size of 185 microns K 80 was 55% for copper sulphides, 65% for pyrite and 92% for non-sulphide gangue minerals.

The Red Chris ore is finer grained when compared with many porphyry copper-gold deposits, and as such will require a slightly finer grind size.  This is also evident in the 24 micron regrind size selected for  the  flotation  cleaner  circuit  feed.  A  primary  grind  of  105  micron  K 80 increased  the  recovery, however, this is more than off-set by an additional 3.5MW of power required for grinding or a reduction in  throughput.  A  simple  economic  study  confirmed  this,  using  typical  power  costs  and  a  net  smelter revenue value for copper of 90 cents.  Testing at a coarser 200 micron K 80 resulted in a 5% recovery loss.    The  150  micron  K 80 was  considered  the  optimum  level  for  this  application.  However,  the economic primary grind selection could be lowered as copper prices have improved significantly since the feasibility report was written.

## 16.1.5 Rougher and Cleaner Flotation

A total  of  129  bench  tests  followed  by  31  locked  cycle  flotation  tests  were  conducted  studying  pulp density,  pH,  reagent  dosage,  flotation  residence  time  and  grind  size  effect.    Table  16.1d  lists  the operating parameters required to achieve optimum performance.  Although the mineralogy between the two zones is different, similar operating parameters will be used with no loss in performance.

| Flotation  Density |                          | Roughers   | 33-35% solids |

Typical operating practice in many porphyry copper operations is to produce a 10 - 15% Cu rougher concentrate by pulling 4 - 5% mass.  Current testwork indicates the Red Chris ore requires a 15 - 20 % mass pull resulting in a rougher concentrate grade of 3% Cu in order to achieve the same recovery. The regrind circuit power has been specified based on a design weight recovery of 15%.

A series of regrinding tests were conducted to investigate the possibility of preferential or distributed regrinding power, and the benefit of pulp conditioning.  The tests involved by-passing part of the higher grade rougher concentrate, pre-cleaning prior to regrinding and classification prior to regrinding.

None  of  the  modified  circuits  produced  any  improvement  in  results  over  those  of  the  conventional regrinding circuit.  Testing indicated regrinding to a relatively fine liberation sizing of K80 = 24 microns was  potentially  required  to  obtain  optimum  final  grade  and  recovery,  but  this  is  mainly  based  on  a consideration of Main Zone metallurgy. More testwork was recommended by G&amp;T to optimize regrind size selection and power.

The duplicate tests listed in the table 16.1e indicate a slightly higher concentrate grade was achieved using the modified circuit.  However, when the higher rougher concentrate feed grade effect is taken into account, the results are very similar.

## 16.1.6 Gold Occurrence

Gold occurs with both the copper sulphides and pyrite.  Very little is associated with the non-sulphide gangue minerals as illustrated in the Gold Recovery Partition Table 16.1f.  The differences recorded in gold  recoveries  for  the  East  and  Main  Zone  composites  are  entirely  attributable  to  a  much  larger proportion of gold tracking the pyrite in the Main Zone composites.

## 16.1.7 Gravity Concentration Tests

Gravity concentration testwork was performed on global composites for both ore zones using a Knelson concentrator  to  examine  the  potential  for  gold  recovery.    This  test  work  resulted  in  minimal  gold recovery and no further work was performed and the inclusion of a gravity stage was not recommended in the flow sheet.

## 16.1.8 Work Index and Ore Hardness

A total of 64 ball mill / rod mill grinding work index tests were performed by five separate laboratories. G&amp;T Metallurgical Engineers performed 49 of the tests using both the Bond Work Index ('WI') method and  the  Comparative  Work  Index  method.  Four  tests  were  conducted  to  confirm  the  validity  of  the Comparative Work Index method.  On a Main Zone composite the Bond WI was 14.0 kW-hrs/tonne compared  with  13.5  kW-hrs/tonne  using  the  Comparative  WI  method.    Similarly,  on  an  East  Zone composite,  the  Bond  WI  was  14.1  kW-hrs/tonne  compared  with  14.2  kW-hrs/tonne  using  the Comparative WI method.

Thirty three samples were tested in the Geometallurgical Ore Mapping Program designed to establish the metallurgical variation within the two zones.  All samples were subjected to the Comparative Work Index test.  The work index of the Main Zone averaged 14.8 kW-hrs/tonne with a range of 11.5 - 16.6 kW-hrs/tonne.  The East Zone averaged 16.4 kW-hrs/tonne with a range of 10.8 - 22.1 kW-hrs/tonne.

During  the  first  year  of  mining,  the  weighted  calculation  of  60%  Main  Zone  and  40%  East  Zone provides a work index of 14.0 kW-hrs/tonne.  In year 2, the average work index increases slightly to 14.3 with the East Zone contributing 31% of the feed.  For years 3 to 5 inclusive, the average work index increases to 15.5 kW-hrs/tonne due to the gradual hardness increase at depth.  Beyond year 7, test work indicates a further increase in hardness.

An average 16.1 kW-hrs/tonne ball mill work index was used to calculate power requirements for mill sizing at 30,000 tonnes per day.

The  recoveries  of  copper  to  concentrate  ranged  from  85  to  90  percent  while  gold  recoveries    varied between 45 and 65 percent. Gold recovery in both zones was dependent on the head grades and pyrite content and higher in East zone.

Based  on  G&amp;T's  results,  and  a  production  split  of  73%  and  27%  between  Main  and  East  zones respectively, the overall life of mine metallurgy is summarized in table 16.1i.

Table 16.1i Copper Grade-Recovery Profile

| Mass %   | Assay - % or g/t   | Assay - % or g/t   | Recovery-%   | Recovery-%   |
|----------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------|--------------|
|          | Copper             | Gold               | Copper       | Gold         |
| 1.8      | 26.4               | 11.2               | 88           | 49           |

This is in reasonable agreement with the overall mine plan recoveries of 87% copper and 50% gold at a 27% copper concentrate grade. Over the first five years of operation gold recovery is expected to vary in the range of 50 - 60% depending on mineralogy and grade, with an overall average of 56%.

Additional  sampling  and  testwork  is  recommended  to  improve  the  correlation  of  metallurgy  the production  schedule  forming  the  basis  of  this  technical  report.  In  addition  the  impact  on  recovery  of storing low-grade ore for later processing should also be investigated. However this occurs only towards the end of the mine life.

## 16.1.10 Copper Concentrate

A pilot plant program was conducted at G&amp;T Metallurgical Engineers with the objective of producing a final concentrate for use and testing by prospective buyers.  Table 16.1j lists the full analysis, including minor elements, of a sample prepared in the ratio of 64% Main Zone and 36% East Zone.  Hg and Sb are expected to incur penalties for being outside the limits set by some of the smelters.

## 16.2 Processing

In  the  2004  Red  Chris  Feasibility  Study  ore  was  proposed  to  be  processed  through  an  on-site concentrator  that  will  produce  a  copper-gold  flotation  concentrate  that  will  be  shipped  out  of  the Province for smelting and refining. The nominal milling rate will be 30,000 tonnes per day. A simplified flowsheet is presented in Figure 16.2.

## 16.3 2010 Preliminary Metallurgical Test Work on the Deep East Zone

.

In  late  2009,  two  composite  samples  of  deep  East  zone  mineralization  were  put  together  to complete some preliminary metallurgical test work on these materials. The focus of this initial test  work  was  not  to  optimize  the  flowsheet  for  these  composites  but  to  see  how  the  samples would perform in the flowsheet proposed in the 2005 Feasibility Study. The primary objective of the study was to assess the mineralogical and metallurgical response of a new mineralized zone recently located during drilling at depth. The assessment was to be conducted with respect to the previously developed process for treating Red Chris mineralization.



Approximately 859 kilograms of sample, in the form of quarter drill core, were received for use in this study. From this material inventory, the two composites were constructed for use in this program,  using approximately  135  kilograms of the drill core inventory. The  program commenced mid January,  2010  and  at  the  writing  of  this  report  had  not  been  completed.  An interim  report  was  requested  and  there  remains  additional  planned  testing  to  complete  this program.

The  two  samples  collected  were  labeled,  High  Au  to  Cu,  and  High  Bornite,  and  each  was selected from intervals in recently drilled holes that had a high gold to copper ratio for the first sample and a high percentage of its copper mineralization in the form of Bornite in the second.

The following points summarized some of the key findings to date:

- ¾ The copper and gold grades of the composites selected for construction were considerably higher than previously tested samples.
- ¾ The samples contained much less pyrite than previously studied East zone samples. The copper sulphide liberations were between 64 and 69 percent when measured at 150GLYPH&lt;31&gt;m K80. These values were much higher than observed for other samples and should result in efficient rougher flotation recovery of copper sulphides.
- ¾ One composite had similar hardness as previously measured samples at 14.6kWh/tonne. The Bornite East Composite was hard, averaging 16.7 kWh/tonne.
- ¾ Using the previously developed process flowsheet, metallurgical performance for copper and gold far exceeded the historical levels from previous programs. The flowsheet and test  conditions  remain  un-optimized  and  simplifications  to  the      process  should  be considered for this mineralization to reduce operating costs.
- ¾ Mineralogical analyses, specifically for gold, indicated most of the gold in the samples was associated with copper sulphides, or was liberated. These forms of gold were well recovered to the copper concentrate. There was evidence to suggest the small amount of gold lost to tailings occurred as tiny inclusions in non-sulphide gangue.

The chemical and mineral contents of the composites were determined using standard analytical techniques and QEMSCAN particle mineral analysis (PMA). The results of QEMSCAN analysis provided quantitative mineral content values for the array of sulphide minerals observed in the sample. A composite sample from the historic testing of shallower East zone mineralization is included on the Table 16.4 that highlights the differences in the deeper samples. The relevant data summary is presented in Table 16.3.

Both  samples  contained  relatively  high  values  of  copper  and  gold  compared  to  previously studied East Zone samples, as shown in Table 16.3. The new composite samples also display relatively low levels of pyrite compared to the amount of copper sulphides.

The rougher tails from the locked cycle testing of the high Au-Cu East Zone were tested for Acid Base Accounting. The two tests showed the roughter tails to have a neutralization potential ratio (NPR) of 26.9 and 85.0 (see appendix A, table IV-5)

The High Au-Cu East Zone composite exhibited almost perfect copper metallurgical performance. Copper recoveries of 97 to 98 percent were achieved with a rougher mass recovery of  about  20  percent.  Similarly,  gold  was  also  well  recovered  to  the  rougher  concentrate.  On average,  between  91  and  93  percent  of  the  gold  in  the  feed  was  recovered  into  a  rougher concentrate  containing  20  percent  of  the  feed  mass.  Both  copper  and  gold  rougher  flotation performances were well above average for deposits of this type. Clearly this composite could be processed at a much coarser feed sizing.

The best cleaner flotation response for the high Au-Cu East composite was achieved in Test 11. In this test, additional collector (3418A) was added along with Potassium Amyl Xanthate. The superior performance of this test would suggest that the previous tests may have had insufficient collector dosages. Overall the results were spectacular, copper was 96 percent recovered into a concentrate grading about 33 percent copper. Similarly, gold was 88 percent recovered into the copper concentrate. The gold grade in the concentrate was about 50 g/tonne.

The Bornite East Zone composite also performed well. Copper in the feed was 93 to 95 percent recovered  into  the  rougher  concentrate  at  a  rougher  mass  recovery  of  about  10  percent.  Gold recoveries to the rougher concentrate were lower; averaging about 88 percent at 10 percent feed mass recovery.

The cleaner test results for the Bornite East Zone were more consistent. On average, about 90 percent  of  the  copper  in  the  feed  was  recovered  into  a  concentrate  grading  about  45  percent copper. Gold performance was more variable, but on average, about 75 percent of the gold was recovered into the copper concentrate. The gold grade was about 60 g/tonne in the concentrate.

In  locked  cycle  testing,  copper  recovery  to  the  final  concentrate,  from  the  High  Gold  Copper Ratio East Zone sample was 98 percent, with a copper concentrate grade of 29 percent. Gold recovery to the final concentrate was 90 percent, grading 47 g/tonne gold. Copper from the High Bornite East Zone sample was 93 percent recovered into a final concentrate, grading 49 percent copper. Gold was 85 percent recovered into the final concentrate, grading at a high 69 g/tonne gold.

The  observed  performance  was  superior  to  results  achieved  on  previously  tested  East  Zone samples.  The  high  grade  of  copper  and  gold,  low  pyrite  content  and  favorable  fragmentation properties  of  the  composites  make  these  composites  respond  well  at  the  previously  developed Red  Chris  process  conditions.  Overall,  the  batch  test  performance  for  these  high  grade composites was very good using the previously developed flowsheet. This flowsheet, designed for low grade ores, with considerably more pyrite in the feed, could likely be optimized to reduce operating costs. Adopting coarser primary and regrinding sizes, combined with lower pulp pH could reduce costs, with negligible effect on metallurgical performance.

## 17 Mineral Resource Estimate

## 17.1 Updated Mineral Resource Estimate for the Red Chris Deposit

A new block model was completed in April 2010 to update the 2004 resource estimate for the Red Chris deposit.  The  new  model included all new 2007 to 2009 drilling. The assays for holes RC10-355 and RC10-360 were complete before this report was finished and have been included also. At a 0.3% copper cutoff  the  updated  resource  shows  an  increase  in  measured  and  indicated  tonnage  of  30%,  with  an increase in copper grade of 17% and gold grade of 50%. In the inferred category the updated model shows an increase in tonnage of 89%, with an increase of 24% in copper and 60% increase in gold. The large increase in inferred resources in due mainly to the new deep drilling. More drilling is planned to expand the ore body at depth and to convert the inferred resources to measured and indicated.

The  new  block  model  and  resources  have  been  calculated  and  reviewed  by  Art  Frye,  Operations Manager for the Mount Polley Mine, and by Greg Gillstrom, P. Eng. Senior Geological Engineer, who has  been  designated  as  its  'Qualified  Person'  for  this  purpose.  Preliminary  data  review  and  specific gravity work was done by Dave Smithies, P. Eng., Project Engineer for Imperial.

## 17.2 Modeling Methodology and Resource Classification

This Red Chris Deposit is divided into five geological zones (domains) for statistical modeling purposes as follows (see figure 17.2).

Table 17.2a Red Chris Model Zones

| Red Chris model Zones   | Red Chris model Zones   | Red Chris model Zones            |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Zone  #                 | Name                    | Description                      |
| 1                       | Main                    | Largest Central Zone (0 - 400m)  |
| 2                       | East                    | East of Main Zone (90 - 400m)    |
| 3                       | Gully                   | West of Main Zone                |
| 4                       | Lower East              | East of Main Zone (400 - 1,000m) |
| 5                       | Lower Main              | Main Zone (400 - 1,000m)         |

A new block model for the Red Chris deposit was created in 2010 utilizing Mintec's MineSight software for the modeling and SAGE software for the variography. The model is in UTM Coordinates (NAD83) with the lower SW corner (origin) at: 450,000N, 6,394,000E and 0m Elevation. The upper NE corner is at:  454,500N, 6,397,500E and 1725 Elevation. The block dimensions are 20m north by 20m east and 15m high and are considered appropriate for the size and nature of the deposit.

The drilling data set comprises of 357 drill holes with an associated copper and gold assays sampled every 2.5m for the entire hole and composited to 15m for modeling. New holes 07-335 through RC09354 and RC10-355 and RC10-360, have been added to the data base since the previous resource update completed in 2004. Figure 11 shows the collar locations of all the drill holes, with the twenty two (22) new drill holes highlighted and labeled. As mentioned above the deposit was divided into five geological zones for statistical modeling purposes as seen in table 17.2a. The model methodology listed here is the same for all zones.

- ¾ All diamond drill holes are loaded into MineSight drillhole files where each assay interval is assigned a zone code matching the zone they fall within.
- ¾ Model blocks receive the same coding.
- ¾ Drill holes are composited to 15M bench lengths, except if their dip is less than 50 degree, in which case they are composited to 15M down hole lengths.
- ¾ Composites are not allowed to span zones.
- ¾ Statistics are carried out on the composites by zone to identify any outlier grades and to explore the grade correlation between copper and gold grades. The zones show strong grade correlation. Outlier grades are identified using Log Probability plots by zone and are capped to the grade selected.
- ¾ A code is interpolated to define an interpolation zone around each drill hole 100M along strike direction and 60M across and vertical to prevent over extrapolation of grades in areas of wide drill hole spacing.
- ¾ Indicator kriging is used to prevent the smoothing of high grades across well defined zones of waste.  An indicator is assigned as 0 or 1 to the composites based on copper grade using a 0.10% cut-off (&lt;0.10  =  0 and &gt;=0.10 =  1).  Variograms are run on the indicator by zone (see table 17.3d for results by zone).
- ¾ The  indicators  are  kriged  into  a  probability  item  in  the  block  model  resulting  in  each  block having a value from 0.0 to 1.0 representing the probability of the block being high grade (see table 17.3e for all kriging parameters). Based on this probability value, an indicator is set in the block identifying the block as 0 = lowgrade/waste or 1 = highgrade. The composite indicators are then  re-set  to  match  the  indicator  in  the  block  that  they  fall  within.  As  a  result  waste  grade composites within the ore zone are used  in the ore zone interpolation (internal waste dilution)

and  ore  composites  in  the  waste  zone  are  used  in  the  waste  zone    interpolation    (Note:  these composites have their range of influence limited).

- ¾ Copper and gold variography is performed for each model ore (indicator = 1) zone.
- ¾ Copper and gold grades both un-capped and capped are interpolated using zone and indicator matching. Two pass kriging is used in the ore zone. The first pass uses the full variogram range and the estimates are only used to provide an estimate of Inferred grades. The second pass limits the search radius to 67% of the variogram range with the vertical range further limited to +-22m (bench  above  and  bench  below).  This  pass  provides  the  Measured  and  Indicated  grades.  The waste  zone  is  interpolated  using  inverse  distance  squared.  Any  composites  in  the  waste  zone have their range of influence limited to 40M (see table 17.3c for tabulated classification logic).

## 17.3 Specific Gravity Modeling Calculations

Every insitu block in the model has a specific gravity assigned to it to enable a tonnage to be calculated. The data set collected from core samples comprised of a total of 3,039 composited SG measurements loaded into the composite drillhole file. The arithmetic average of all the composite samples was 2.78.

The SG modeling process began with the assignment of the average, 2.78, to every insitu block in the model.  This  was  followed  interpreting  grades  into  the  blocks  with  a  single  pass  spherical  inverse distance squared calculation utilizing the following parameters:

¾ Max search distance

250 m

¾ Min # of Measurements

2

¾ Max # of Measurements

30

The resulting SG's were verified visually by comparing the block model to the drill data. No significant discrepancies were noted. A comparison to the 2004 geologic model was also made utilizing the 0.2% Cu cut-off for the mineralized blocks within the proposed pit. The 2010 model mineralized blocks had an average SG of 2.80, the same as the 2004 model.

## 17.4 Model Validation

The  modeling  results  were  validated  both  visually  and  numerically.  Using  the  3D  Viewer  in  the MineSight  program,  the  grades  and  coding  in  the  modeled  blocks  were  manually  compared  to  the drilling in cross section view (both North/South and East/West). This was also done in plan view for every model bench level. No significant discrepancies in grade or coding were noted between the block model and the drillhole assay composites. Figure 17.4 below shows (Section 451960E) the Main Zone Domain;  with  drillhole  copper  assays  against  interpolated  block  model  copper  grades.  As  show,  the model grade interpolation to the south and north is limited by the zone wire frame solid.

## 18 Other Relevant data and Information

The previously published mineral reserve, mine plan, and the accompanying feasibility study have not been updated and therefore will only be referenced in this report.

The results of the 2004/2005 Red Chris Feasibility Study Report are based on

- ¾ conventional open pit mining
- ¾ a 30,000 tonne per day flotation mill
- ¾ shipment of concentrates going to Pacific rim smelters
- ¾ shipping from the B.C. port of Stewart
- ¾ estimated 25 year mine life.

The  feasibility  results  include  Proven  and  Probable  Reserves,  metallurgical  performance,  capital  and operating cost estimates and financial analysis as performed and consolidated by AMEC E&amp;C Services ('AMEC'),  Vancouver,  B.C.  in  the  Red  Chris  Feasibility  Study  with  contributions  from  various independent consultants as follows:

- · Giroux Consultants: preparation of the resource estimate.
- · Nilsson Mine  Services Limited: preparation of Proven and Probable Reserve estimate, preparation  of  LOM  mine  plan,  production  schedule  and  mine  capital  and  operating  cost estimates.
- · Merit Consultants International Inc.: estimation and consolidation of the project capital costs.
- · G&amp;T Metallurgical Services Limited:  metallurgical test work.

Table 18 - Ore Reserve Summary for the 2004/2005 mine feasibility study

|----------|-------------|--------|----------|--------|--------|----------|--------|
| Proven   | 93,475,785  |  0.423 |    0.327 |  0.374 |  0.185 |    0.482 | 11.554 |
| Probable | 182,524,215 |  0.3   |    0.226 |  0.261 |  0.1   |    0.32  |  7.6   |
| Total    | 276,000,000 |  0.349 |    0.266 |  0.299 |  0.129 |    0.374 |  8.939 |

Note:  Metal  assay  values  above  labeled  'R-'  had  a  recovery  equation  applied  to  them  and therefore are recovered metal values. (i.e. R-Cu = Recovered Copper)

The ore reserves were reported at a $3.75/t net smelter return cutoff.  The selection of this cutoff level was  based  upon  a  pit  rim  decision  for  recovery  of  processing  and  general  &amp;  administration  onsite operating costs.  Low grade quantities were segregated in the production schedule.  Material between $3.25/t net smelter return and $3.75/t was designated as low grade one (LG1) and separated for future processing if economic conditions improve beyond the levels assumed for this study.  Material with a net  smelter  return  value  above  $3.75/t  but  less  than  the  applied  cutoff  for  a  particular  pit  phase  was designate  low  grade  two  (LG2).    The  LG2  material  was  scheduled  to  the  East  Stockpile  area  and reclaimed for processing in Year 17 through Year 25 (see figure 18.1 for mine development concept).

## 19 Interpretation and Conclusions

A review of the past exploration programs at the Red Chris Project shows a tremendous amount of high quality  work  has  been  completed  including  geologic  mapping  and  sampling,  geophysics,  trenching, diamond drilling, modelling, preliminary mine planning, metallurgical studies, environmental base lines studies, and ABA testing.

The drilling, logging, and sampling protocols employed at the Red Chris Project in both the past and current drilling programs are appropriate for the deposit type and are being carried out in a fashion that meets or exceeds common industry standards. Assaying was carried out using industry standard methods and  QA/QC  protocols.  The  QA/QC  data  indicate  that  the  assays  are  acceptable  for  use  in  Mineral Resource estimation.

The 2007 to 2009 drilling programs were highly successful in achieving their goal of increasing the size and depth of the deposit, especially in the East Zone. A total of 20 diamond drill holes were completed on the Main and East zones (holes numbered 07-335 to RC09-354). Of these holes 18 targeted the East Zone and saddle zone between the Main and East zones, and two holes in 2007 tested the deep extent of the Main Zone.

The 2007 to 2009 drill programs completed at Red Chris were also successful in increasing both the confidence in the estimated resource used in the 2004/2005 feasibility study and in increasing the total resource tonnage for the Red Chris deposit.

The new model includes all the 2007 to 2009 diamond drill holes, plus two from the 2010 program (22 in  total).  At  a  0.3%  copper  cutoff  the  updated  resource  shows  an  increase  in  measured  and  indicated tonnage  of  30%,  with  an  increase  in  copper  grade  of  17%  and  gold  grade  of  50%.  In  the  inferred category the updated model shows an increase in tonnage of 89%, with an increase of 24% in copper and 60% increase in gold. The large increase in inferred resources in due mainly to the new deep drilling added since 2007.

## 20 Recommendations

The highly successful deep drilling program should be continued in the East Zone and expanded in all directions, with an emphasis on connecting it to the Main Zone. New deep drilling should be able to not only increase the size of the deposit at depth but convert the large increase in tonnage in the Inferred category to the Measured and Indicated category.

The average space (drilling grid) used in the 2007 to 2009 drilling was about 50m. With the consistency in the deep mineralization seen to date this drill spacing could be increased to 200m, with infill spacing between 50m to 100m where warranted on the same grid. It is also recommended that the deep drilling should also be expanded to the Gulley Zone and surrounding area.

Geophysical  work  done  in  2009  combined  with  geologic  mapping  indicates  that  there  is  significant potential for finding additional discrete zones of mineralization elsewhere on the property and although these targets are higher risk, they should be tested. The exploration of the deep East Zone has proven that  the  rewards  for  discovery  can  be  very  high,  so  stepping  out  with  future  exploration  plans  is recommended.

The marginal mineralization that has been identified in the Far West and Gulley zones is in itself not terribly attractive but the mineralization and associated alteration does indicate the presence of a very strong hydrothermal  system.  Those  geologic  observations  combined  with  attractive  geophysical signature strongly point to the deeper levels of these zones being the highest priority for the step out exploration program.

Further work  on  the mineralogy  and metallurgy of the expanding  resource at depth is also recommended.    Preliminary  work  to  date  indicates  that  this  mineralization  will  have  a  substantially better  response  to  flotation  recovery  than  the  upper  mineralization  upon  which  the  2005  Feasibility Study was based.

In  conclusion,  continued  deployment  of  a  variety  of  exploration  tools  including  geologic  observation and interpretation, geophysical techniques and of course drilling should be the backbone of the planned exploration campaign contemplated as the project is advanced. The significant increase in the grade and volume  of  identified  mineralization  over  the  past  three  years  is  testament  to  the  potential  that  may remain untapped on the property. Continued diligent and aggressive exploration is highly recommended.

## 1.0 Introduction

The Red Chris deposit, owned by Imperial Metals Corp., is described as a porphyry deposit containing copper, gold, and silver. The deposit is located in northern British Columbia about 80 kilometers south of Dease Lake.

A proposal to complete a metallurgical test program on the Red Chris deposit was requested and supplied to Mr. Matt Bolu, a consultant to Imperial Metals Corp. The scope of this work included an assessment of the mineralogical and metallurgical response of a new mineralized zone, recently located during drilling at depth. The assessment was to be conducted with respect to the previously developed process for treating Red Chris mineralization .  The main objectives of the proposed test program can be outlined as follows:

-  Prepare approximately 200 kilograms of the Red Chris material into two composites, designated High Gold Copper Ratio East Zone Composite and High Bornite East Zone Composite.
-  Conduct a full suite of Bond comminution tests on each composite to determine its ore hardness properties. These included ball, rod, abrasion, and impact crushing determinations.
-  Conduct a mineralogical analysis of the composites, at the suggested primary grind size of 150 m  K80. This analysis would provide a quantitative assessment of minerals contained in the feed and fragmentation characteristics of the key sulphides by particle size range. This data is critical in determining appropriate grind size for the flotation feed streams.
-  Conduct flotation studies to investigate the effects of primary grind size, regrind size, pH, and various reagents. These tests would be conducted as rougher and batch cleaner tests. Conditions established in earlier programs will guide the selection of collectors and flotation pulp pH.

-  Produce metallurgical performance estimates using locked cycle testing protocols. The best derived conditions from the batch cleaner tests would be used for the locked cycle tests.
-  Assess the final tailings from a single test for gold recovery using the Knelson gravity concentration unit. Evaluate gravity concentrate, as well as the copper concentrate and pyrite concentrate, of that test for gold occurrences using an Automated Digital Imaging System (ADIS).
-  Assess the pyrite rougher tailings of a single test for acid generation potential by performing an ABA test. The ABA data is summarized in Appendix IV.
-  Assess the final concentrates for dewatering properties and minor elements.

About 859 kilograms of sample in the form of quarter drill core were received for this study. From this material inventory, the two composites were constructed for use in this program, using 135 kilograms of the drill core inventory. The program commenced in mid January, 2010, and was completed by mid April, 2010. Following the test work, preparation of this technical report commenced.

The following technical brief summarizes the key technical points of the program. All of the test data generated through the execution of this program can be reviewed in a series of appendices attached to this brief. The appendices are arranged as follows:

```
Appendix I - Sample Origin Appendix II - Flotation Test Data Appendix III - Particle Sizing Data Appendix IV - Special Assay & ABA Data Appendix V - Modal Analysis Data Appendix VI - ADIS Analysis Data

## 2.0 Ore Characteristics

There are several inherent characteristics of an ore that will predispose the process design required to extract and concentrate minerals of value. Ore hardness defines the power needed during the comminution process. The mineral and chemical content dictate the configuration of the flotation process. The mineral fragmentation characteristics determine the comminution requirements to permit a physical separation of the valuable minerals. These important parameters, that impact on process design, are discussed further in the following subsections.

## 2.1 Ore Hardness

Ore hardness was measured using a standard Bond ball and rod mill work index test. The abrasiveness of the samples was also measured by a Bond abrasion test. A standard Bond ball mill work index test procedure with a closing sieve aperture size of 106µm was used. The results of these tests are summarized in Table 1.

## BOND WORK INDEX

| Sample                     |   Ball Work Index kWh/tonne |   Rod Work Index kWh/tonne |   Abrasion (g) |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------|
| High Gold Copper East Zone |                        14.6 |                       10.5 |         0.4517 |
| Bornite East Zone          |                        16.7 |                       16   |         0.3147 |

Note:

a) All tests performed to Bond standards.

b) See Appendix III for additional test data.

The results of the tests indicated that the Bornite East zone was moderately hard compared to the High Gold Copper Ratio East Zone Composite .  Conversely, the High Gold Copper East Zone Composite was more abrasive than the High Bornite East Zone Composite.

## 2.2 Chemical and Mineral Content

The chemical and mineral contents of the composites were determined using standard analytical techniques and QEMSCAN particle mineral analysis (PMA). The results of QEMSCAN analysis provided quantitative mineral content values for the array of sulphide minerals observed in the sample. The relevant data summary is presented in Table 2.

Notes: a) Detailed head assay and mineralogical content data are located in Appendix IV and V. b) Detailed copper distribution for the NOX Composite can be located in Appendix IV.

Both samples contained relatively high values of copper and gold compared to previously studied East Zone samples, as shown in Table 2.

The new composite samples also display relatively low levels of pyrite compared to the amount of copper sulphides. The samples also contained ankerite and other carbonate minerals. These minerals were present in the previous samples and can provide neutralization potential for the tailings.

## 2.3 Mineral Fragmentation

The mineral fragmentation characteristics of the two sulphide composites * were measured using QEMSCAN PMA at a nominal grind sizing of 150µm K80. The data, along with data from a previous test program are displayed in Table 3.

Notes:

a) Cs-copper sulphides, Cup-cuprite, Py-pyrite, and Gn-non-sulphide gangue.

b) Additional mineralogical data can be located in Appendix V.

Copper sulphides in both of the high grade samples were well liberated. The main form of interlocking occurred with non-sulphide gangue minerals at about 33 percent of the total copper sulphide minerals. These interlocked particles contained, on average, almost half copper sulphides by weight. The favorable fragmentation characteristics at this grind size should result in high recoveries of copper sulphides to the rougher concentrate.

Compared to the previously measured East Zone Global Composite, the new samples display a much higher degree of mineral liberation for the same grind size.

## 2.3 Mineral Fragmentation - continued

The mineral liberation data can be manipulated to estimate the effect of primary grind sizing on mineral liberation. These analyses, performed on the two deep east zone composites, are displayed in Figure 1. Liberation values at two grind sizes were extrapolated using the measured data at 150µm K80.

The primary grind size, however, had little effect on the liberation of the copper sulphide minerals. Therefore, large changes in primary grind size would be required to elicit a change in mineral liberation and subsequent flotation response.

Typically, for simple copper porphyry ores, two dimensional copper sulphide liberations of approximately 50 percent are required to ensure the recovery of most of the copper sulphides into the rougher concentrates. Based on this relationship, a primary grind sizing of about 250µm K80 could be used to treat both composites.

The mineral fragmentation data for the target minerals was also used to calculate a theoretical mineralogically limiting grade-recovery curve as shown in Figure 1B.

This curve displays the maximum grade-recovery for copper sulphide minerals at a nominal primary grind sizing of 150µm K80. The operating grade-recovery point generated from a typical operating plant is often offset to a position just below this mineralogically limiting curve. A small amount of rougher concentrate regrinding would be required to efficiently recover high grade final copper concentrates. Undoubtedly, the current target of 25  mK80 would be too fine for this mineralization.

## 3.0 Rougher Flotation Test Results

A total of six rougher flotation tests were performed in this program, using the schematic flowsheet shown in Figure 2. Additional rougher flotation stages were added to the flotation test to ensure recovery of all sulphides in each composite. The collector was added by stage to first recover copper sulphides, and then more aggressive dosages were added to recover any pyrite  in the sample. The graphs shown in Figure 2 display the results of the relevant rougher flotation tests.

The High Gold Copper East Zone Composite exhibited almost perfect copper metallurgical performance  . Copper recoveries of 97 to 98 percent were achieved with a rougher mass recovery of about 20 percent. Similarly, gold was also well recovered to the rougher concentrate. On average, between 91 and 93 percent of the gold in the feed was recovered into a rougher concentrate containing 20 percent of the feed mass. Both copper and gold rougher flotation performances were well above average for deposits of this type. Clearly this composite could be processed at a much coarser feed sizing.

The High Bornite East Zone Composite also performed well. Copper in the feed was 93 to 95 percent recovered into the rougher concentrate at a rougher mass recovery of about 10 percent. Gold recoveries to the rougher concentrate were lower; averaging about 88 percent at 10 percent feed mass recovery.

None of the variables tested dramatically affected metallurgical response of the two composites. Using collector dosages of PAX (potassium amyl xanthate) between 3 to 8 g/tonne and at natural pH will provide the most cost effective means of recovering copper and gold into a rougher concentrate.

The observed performance was superior to results achieved on previously tested East Zone samples. The high grade of copper and gold, low pyrite content and favorable fragmentation properties of the composites make these composites respond well at the previously developed Red Chris process conditions.

## 4.0 Cleaner Flotation Response

A total of six open circuit batch cleaner tests were performed on both composites in order to assess the concentrate production potential. All tests were conducted with elevated pH levels in the cleaner circuit. The flowsheet schematic used in these tests, along with a summary of test conditions and a graphical representation of the results obtained are displayed in Figure 3. The metallurgical performance is displayed as a series of grade recovery curves for both copper and gold. Gold was recovered into the copper concentrate as a byproduct.

For the High Gold Copper Ratio East Zone Composite, the best performance was achieved in Test 11. In this test, additional collector (3418A) was added along with Potassium Amyl Xanthate. The superior performance of this test would suggest that the previous tests may have had insufficient collector dosages. Overall the results were spectacular, copper was 96 percent recovered into a concentrate grading about 33 percent copper. Similarly, gold was 88 percent recovered into the copper concentrate. The gold grade in the concentrate was about 50 g/tonne.

The results for the High Bornite East Zone were more consistent. On average, about 90 percent of the copper in the feed was recovered into a concentrate grading about 45 percent copper. Gold performance was more variable, but on average, about 75 percent of the gold was recovered into the copper concentrate. The gold grade was about 60 g/tonne in the concentrate . 

Overall, the batch test performance for these high grade composites was very good using the previously developed flowsheet. This flowsheet, designed for low grade ores with considerably more pyrite in the feed, could likely be optimized to reduce operating costs. Adopting coarser primary and regrinding sizes, combined with lower pulp pH should be investigated.

## 5.0 Cycle Test Flotation Response

Estimates of metallurgical performance, anticipated from a continuous operation, were determined by performing a locked cycle test on each of the two composites. The flowsheet schematic shown in Figure 4 was instituted for the two locked cycle tests, using the optimum rougher and batch cleaner test conditions. Also displayed in Figure 4 is a summary of the test conditions used, along with the locked cycle test results.

A basic reagent scheme was utilized for these tests, including Potassium Amyl Xanthate (PAX) as the collecting agent. Tests were conducted at a primary grind sizing of approximately 155µm K80 with a nominal regrind size of 25µm K80.

Both composites performed exceptionally well. Copper from the High Gold Copper Ratio Composite was 98 percent recovered from the feed, into a final concentrate grading 29 percent copper. Gold recovery to the final concentrate was also high at 90 percent, grading 47 g/tonne of gold.

Copper from the High Bornite East Zone Composite was 93 percent recovered into a final concentrate, grading 49 percent copper. Gold in this composite was 85 percent recovered into a final concentrate, grading 69 g/tonne of gold.

The first cleaner tailings from locked cycle test 17 were evaluated for gold recovery using a Knelson gravity concentrator, followed by hand panning techniques. Gold from the first cleaner tailings was 35 percent recovered into the pan concentrate, grading 57 g/tonne gold. This accounts for approximately, 1.5 percent of the total gold in the feed.

## 6.0 Gold Deportment

In an effort to recover more gold from the rougher tailings, gravity concentration tests were conducted. The gravity concentration was a two step process; a Knelson concentrator was first used to recover gold, the Knelson concentrate was further upgraded using a hand panning technique. A schematic of the flowsheet and overall metallurgical summary for gold are displayed in Figure 5.

As shown in the table, most of the gold was recovered in copper flotation. An additional 3.5 and 5.8 percent gold was recovered from the feed into a 'pyrite' concentrate. In fact, the relatively low pyrite content of the feed did not result in the flotation recovery of pyrite concentrates. The concentrate contained low levels of sulphur and should be considered copper scavenger concentrates.

The application of gravity to flotation tailings failed to yield a meaningful gold bearing concentrate. The incremental gold recovery was less than 0.5 percent for both composites. To better understand gold deportment in these streams, gold searches by an Automated Digital Imaging System (ADIS) were performed on exit streams of the combined flotation-gravity concentration test.

A summary of the data is displayed as pie charts on the bottom of Figure 5. Most of the gold occurrences were located in the copper concentrate, which contained about 90 percent of the gold in the sample. However, some occurrences were located in the pyrite and gravity concentrate. There was one occurrence located in the gravity tails, it was a small inclusion in non-sulphide gangue and not recoverable by flotation.

Using the ADIS data, a gold distribution in the feed was calculated. For these composites, 92 percent of the gold was either liberated or associated with copper sulphides; therefore recovery to the concentrate was expected. About 8 percent of the gold was observed as tiny inclusions in non-sulphide gangue. Further recovery by flotation or even leaching would be unlikely. Extraordinary fine grind sizes would be required to further enhance gold recovery of this stream.

## 7.0 Dewatering Properties

The settling properties of the copper concentrates produced from the two locked cycle tests were measured using simple graduated cylinder settling tests. With the settling test data, thickener area calculations were performed with the Talmadge Fitch method. A single flocculent was tested; Superfloc A130 at various addition rates, this data is presented in Figure 6. Details of the settling tests are located in Appendix IV.

Based on the settling rates, at a flocculate dosage of 2 g/tonne provided reasonable settling performance for both composites. The High Bornite East Zone had significantly better settling properties when compared to the High Gold Copper Ratio East Zone Composite. Due to limited sample, optimization was not complete. Future test programs should include allowances for more detailed studies.

Simple leaf filter tests were conducted to estimate vacuum filter properties of the copper concentrates. The test data is shown in Figure 6B. As shown, standard vacuum moistures for the copper concentrates from the High Gold Copper Ratio East Zone would be about 21 percent after about 2 minutes of drying time. * For the High Bornite East Zone, moisture content would be approximately 18 percent after about 2 minutes of drying time.

## 8.0 Quality of Concentrate

Minor element determinations were carried out on the final concentrate produced in locked cycle testing. Weighted composites of the final concentrate from cycles IV and V were assayed using standard metallurgical quality assay techniques, for a suite of elements that typically may attract smelter penalties. The minor assay data for the two composites tested in this program are displayed in Table 4.

In general, the final concentrates produced in these tests did not contain minor element concentration that would normally attract penalties at smelting. There are, however, a few minor elements that are present at concentrations that may attract smelter penalties. Elements worth noting in this respect are antimony, bismuth, and selenium.

The concentrates produced contain significant precious metal content with gold grades between 46 to 71 g/tonne, and silver grades between 152 to 323 g/tonne.

We recommend that the minor element data be reviewed by an experienced marketing specialist to confirm any marketing issues for these concentrates. Individual smelters may impose penalties at variable concentrations and concentrate marketing specialists can provide more informed input on this subject.

## 9.0 Conclusions and Recommendations

Two composites originating from the Red Chris deposit East Zone were tested in this program of study. The samples represented deep mineralization which has recently been discovered. When tested for ore hardness, it was determined that the High Bornite East Zone sample was moderately hard compared to the High Gold Copper Ratio East Zone sample. The High Bornite East Zone and High Gold Copper Ratio East Zone samples had an ore hardness of 16.7 and 14.6 kWh/tonne and a rod work index of 16.0 and 10.5 kWh/tonne respectively. The abrasion index of the two composites was determined to be 0.31 and 0.45 g respectively.

The two composites contained between 1.4 and 2.9 percent copper. This value was significantly higher than that of the East Zone samples tested in a previous Red Chris program conducted at G&amp;T Metallurgical Services Ltd. The majority of the copper in the High Gold Copper Ratio East Zone sample was in the form of chalcopyrite while bornite, as expected, was the main form of copper sulphide mineral in the High Bornite East Zone sample. Pyrite values in these two samples were extremely low and considerably lower than the previously tested East Zone material.

The fragmentation characteristics for the sulphide minerals were measured at a primary grind size of 150µm K80. At this grind size, copper sulphides in both composites were well liberated. About 33 percent of the copper sulphides for both composites were interlocked with non-sulphide gangue minerals. These particles, however, contained sufficient copper to ensure their flotation into the rougher concentrate.

The composites were evaluated with a process flowsheet developed for lower grade East Zone material containing more pyrite. A primary grind size of 150µm K80 and a target regrind size of 25µm K80, was used for both composites. Both composites performed remarkably well and there is considerable potential to

reduce the operating cost of the process. Notably, both the primary grind and regrind sizes could be increased with this high grade mineralization with only a small decrease in metallurgical performance. Similarly, pH levels and subsequent lime consumption could likely be reduced due to the low pyrite content of the sample.

In locked cycle testing, copper recovery to the final concentrate, from the High Gold Copper Ratio East Zone sample was 98 percent, with a copper concentrate grade of 29 percent. Gold recovery to the final concentrate was 90 percent, grading 47 g/tonne gold. Copper from the High Bornite East Zone sample was 93 percent recovered into a final concentrate, grading 49 percent copper. Gold was 85 percent recovered into the final concentrate, grading at a high 69 g/tonne gold.

In an attempt to increase gold recovery, gravity concentration tests were conducted on the rougher tailings of two select tests. Overall, only between 0.2 and 0.4 percent of the gold was recovered from the feed into the gravity concentrate. A gravity concentration, performed on the first cleaner tailings of a single locked cycle test also resulted in low gold recovery. Only about 1.5 percent of the feed gold was recovered into the gravity concentrate.

Minor element scans on the locked cycle test bulk concentrates showed elevated levels of antimony, bismuth, and selenium. These elements may attract smelter penalties and would require further consideration. High gold and silver content, in the cons, will contribute significantly to the metal revenues for this project.

The dewatering properties were measured for concentrates from each deep east zone composite. A limited number of settling and filtering tests were complete using very simple test procedures. The test indicated no significant dewatering concerns; however, there is considerable potential to further optimize dewatering performance if coarser regrind sizes are adopted. No further dewatering studies should be performed until the process flowsheet is fully optimized and significant concentrate is available.

SAMPLE ORIGIN

## 1.0 Sample Origin

Samples for the Red Chris project were received at G&amp;T Metallurgical Services Ltd. on December 21, 2009. The shipment contained 223 samples in the form of quarter drill core, weighing a total of 960 kilograms. The mass and identification of each sample can be located in Table I-1.

Upon receipt, samples were placed into two composites, as instructed by the client. The samples used in the construction of each composite are listed in Table I-2. The samples were then stage crushed to -6 mesh, homogenized, and rotary split into 2 kilogram charges. Representative cuts were removed and assayed for elements of interest in this project as displayed in Table I-3.

A map provided by Red Chris geological staff is also attached, showing the location of the metallurgical sampling drill holes.

- 2) 0.0 Indicates these minerals were not observed during the counting procedure.
- 3) The 150 and 53µm sizing fractions correspond to the Tyler 100 and 270 mesh sieves. C1 to C5 indicates cyclones 1 to 5 on the cyclosizer.
- 4) Because the &lt;C5 fraction is not measured an overall estimate is calculated by the QEMSCAN.
- 5) The Total line is the distribution of mineral in the size fraction. Original data is from the size by assay and distribution tables.
- 6) The calculated liberation of the unsized product as measured in two dimensions has been converted to three dimensions using correction factors developed by G &amp; T Metallurgical Services.
- 7) The three dimension liberation is zero if the liberation in two dimensions is less than 20 percent.

- 2) 0.0 Indicates these minerals were not observed during the counting procedure.
- 3) The 150 and 53µm sizing fractions correspond to the Tyler 100 and 270 mesh sieves. C1 to C5 indicates cyclones 1 to 5 on the cyclosizer.
- 4) Because the &lt;C5 fraction is not measured an overall estimate is calculated by the QEMSCAN.
- 5) The Total line is the distribution of mineral in the size fraction. Original data is from the size by assay and distribution tables.
- 6) The calculated liberation of the unsized product as measured in two dimensions has been converted to three dimensions using correction factors developed by G &amp; T Metallurgical Services.
- 7) The three dimension liberation is zero if the liberation in two dimensions is less than 20 percent.
