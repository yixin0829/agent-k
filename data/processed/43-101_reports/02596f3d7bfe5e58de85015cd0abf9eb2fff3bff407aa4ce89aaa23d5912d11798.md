## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This  Preliminary  Economic  Assessment  (PEA)  refers  to  the  Northern  Dancer  (formerly  known  as Logtung) Project, an exploration property straddling the border between Yukon Territory (Yukon) and the  northern  portion  of  British  Columbia  in  Canada.  Northern  Dancer  is  operated  by  a  Canadian company, Largo Resources Limited (Largo).

Northern  Dancer  is  a  tungsten-molybdenum  deposit  hosted  by  a  coarse-grained,  felsic  intrusive complex and surrounding skarn. It  has  been  drilled  to  a  depth  of  up  to  500  m  below  surface  by previous operators and Largo. The deposit has been defined through the drilling of 134 drill holes on the  property.  Northern  Dancer  has  been  the  subject  of  historic  prefeasibility  studies  and  Largo believes the project to be amenable to open pit mining.

The deposit is located approximately 260 km to the southeast of the city of Whitehorse in Yukon. The closest  community  is  the  town  of  Teslin,  approximately  65  km  to  the  east  of  the  property.  The property is approximately 13 km to the north of the Alaska Highway. It is accessible by a combination of good quality paved roads and a short section of dirt road. Proximal sites with potential for hydro development to provide power to the project have been identified by Largo. Water is readily available at the site and there is highway access to tidewater at the port of Skagway in southeast Alaska as shown in Figure 1.

Largo entered into an agreement with Strategic Metals Ltd. (Strategic Metals) on 15 February 2006, this gave it an option to acquire an initial 70% interest in Northern Dancer by:

- · completing $5.0 million in work expenditures
- · issuing four million Largo shares listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX)
- · granting Strategic Metals a 1% net smelter return royalty interest in the property

On 14 March 2009 Largo completed its earn-in for the initial 70% interest, and on 14 March 2010 negotiated an extension to 15 May 2011 for the right to exercise a purchase of the remaining 30% interest in the property by providing an additional $4.8 million to Strategic Metals. Strategic Metals will  retain  the  1%  net  smelter  royalty.  The  agreement  allows  Northern  Dancer  to  be  carried  to production.

The Northern Dancer project area has been prospected since the 1920's. Numerous claim groups were staked throughout the years primarily for the exploration of lead-zinc-silver vein mineralization. Tungsten mineralization in the Northern Dancer area was first mentioned by the Geological Survey of Canada  which  mapped  the  area  in  the  early  1950's.  The  first  Mineral  Resource  estimate  for  the

Northern Dancer deposit, prepared by Largo in accordance with CIM (2005) Definition Standards, was based on a verified database including historic drilling data and data from Largo's 2006 drilling campaign.  The  results  of  this  work  were  independently  verified  by  Snowden  Mining  Industry Consultants Incorporated (Snowden) and publicly released on 2 April 2007.

In 2008 Largo conducted an exploration program of 38 diamond drill holes totalling 11,509 m. The program confirmed results from the prior exploration programs. The Northern Dancer deposit has now been drilled at a nominal 25 m sectional spacing. Given the density of drilling and confirmation of data, Largo completed an updated Mineral Resource estimate for the Northern Dancer deposit with technical assistance, advice, independent review and verification provided from Snowden. The Measured, Indicated and Inferred Mineral Resource publicly disclosed on 12 March 2009 triggered the publication of a NI 43-101 Technical Report by Snowden. Table 1 summarizes the results based on a 0.06% WO3 cut-off grade.

Notes: Resource classification categories in accordance with CIM (2005) Standards on Mineral Resources and Reserves referred to in National Instrument NI 43-101. Mineral resources that are not reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. Although 0.06% WO3 is  considered a likely cut-off grade for this deposit based on 2009 economic factors and comparisons to other similar deposit types, it has not been confirmed by the appropriate economic studies. Totals may not add up exactly due to rounding. †The WO3 grade shown here is correct, the grade of 0.107% WO3 in the 12 March 2009 press release was a typographical error. ‡Largo calculated tonnes of Mo using MoS2 instead of Mo in their 12 March 2009 press release - the figures shown in this table are correct. Despite these typographical errors, the quantities of WO3 and Mo in pounds are correct.

The Northern Dancer deposit is characterized by the presence of a quartz vein stockwork and a northeast-trending  sheeted  vein  set  centred  on  a  quartz  feldspar  intrusive  complex.  The  quartz feldspar  intrusive  complex  appears  to  be  a  branch  emanating  from  the  northern  flank  of  a Cretaceous-aged quartz monzonite stock. The total mineralized area measures 2.5 km by 1.0 km and strikes north. Minerals of economic interest include scheelite, molybdenite, and molybdoscheelite,  which  are  mainly  distributed  in  a  stockwork  of  fractures  and  veins  in  the metasedimentary rocks and quartz-feldspar  porphyry  dykes.  Deposits  of  this  type  comprise  large tonnage, generally low grade, hydrothermal mineralization related to igneous intrusions emplaced at high levels in the earth's crust.

Infill drilling, geotechnical work and environmental baseline studies/community relations took place in 2008 and have continued since that time. There are no known environmental liabilities attached to the property and it does not lie within an area selected as First Nations Settlement Land. It is located within the traditional territory of the Teslin Tlingit Council First Nation.

This PEA is based on a Mineral Resource Block Model Report published on 17 June 2009, which is summarized in the Mineral Resource Estimates section of this report. A Technical Report was also

completed  by  Snowden  and  filed  on  23  May  2008  in  SEDAR.  The  NI  43-101Technical  Reports published reflect statistical treatment of increasing amounts of assay data as drilling progressed on the property.

The Northern Dancer process plant conceptualized in this study will treat 30,800 t/d of Run of Mine ore  (ROM)  feed  material  through  the  crushing  and  ore  sorting  circuits.   The  resulting  sorter concentrate, 65%  of the ROM  feed mass, will be processed through the grinding and molybdenum/tungsten  recovery  circuits  at  a  rate  20,000  t/d.   Medium  grade  flotation  tungsten concentrate is converted to Ammonium Para-Tungstate (APT) on-site.  Overall metal recoveries into concentrates  are  estimated  at  75%  for  tungsten  and  72%  for  molybdenum.  The  predicted  APT conversion recovery is at 95% of tungsten in concentrate.

The  economic  assessment  which  follows  is  preliminary  in  nature.  It  includes  inferred  mineral resources which are considered too speculative geologically to have the economic considerations applied that would enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves and there is no certainty that the preliminary assessment will be realized. All qualifications and assumptions are discussed in this report.

Table 2 outlines the summary of estimated operating costs. Table 3 and Table 4 show the mine, mill and infrastructure estimated capital costs.

The estimated total project capital cost is $C 824M. Contingencies have been applied in individual project areas together with a global contingency of $C 126M. The overall project capital contingency is $C177M (27%).The pre-production portion of the Capital Costs is estimated to be $C718 million which includes contingency. Sustaining capital costs are assessed at an average of $C5.32M per production year.

The PEA schedule employs a mining rate (ore and waste) of approximately 30 Mtpa for 23 years, for a total of 545.24M ore tonnes at an average grade of 0.08% WO3 and 0.02% Mo. Higher grade ore will be mined in the earlier years of operation. Low grade ore stockpiled during the life of the mine will be sufficient to run the process plant for another 26 years once mining has been completed.

Metal prices used in the PEA are higher than those assumed for the 2009 Resource Estimate shown above in Table 1, allowing a lower cut-off grade (0.04% Equivalent WO3) to be used for pit design, and resulting, therefore, in increased ore tonnes. Tungsten is priced at an APT price of $US 275/mtu of  WO3  in  concentrate.  Molybdenum  is  valued  at  a  long  term  price  of  $US  17.5/lb  with  an  8% assessment for offsite costs and roasting. Life of Mine Mining Costs are estimated to be $C2.2/tonne ($US 2.00), with concentrator operations cost of $C 4.17/t ($US 3.79), Rejects rehandle of C$0.88/t ($US 0.80), Tails operating cost of C$0.20/t ($US 0.18), APT operations of C$1.88/t ($US 1.71) and General and Administration (G&amp;A) costs at $C1.60/tonne ($US 1.46). A long-term exchange rate of $C 1.00 = $US 0.91 is assumed. The undiscounted cash flow summary for the PEA is shown in Table 5.

## 1 INTRODUCTION

Largo Resources Ltd. (Largo) requested AMC Mining Consultants (Canada) Ltd (AMC) to undertake  a  Preliminary  Economic  Assessment  ('PEA')  on  the  Northern  Dancer  (ND), formerly known as Logtung, tungsten/molybdenum deposit using open pit mining methods, and to prepare an associated 43-101 compliant Technical Report (the Technical Report).

Infill and expansion drilling in 2008 (11,510m) was carried out on the property by Largo to better delineate and define the mineralization zones.

Following the successful 2008 drilling program, Largo contracted Snowden Mining Industry Consultants Inc. (Snowden) to prepare a Resource Estimate which was published in June 2009. The decision was then made to proceed to completion of a PEA of the Project. Initial work was conducted by Wardrop Engineering. The more recent work has been led by AMC with input from other independent consultants identified in the report.

The  purpose  of  the  Technical  Report  is  to  summarize  the  broad  range  of  planning  and technical studies that have been undertaken with respect to the ND Project, to provide a preliminary assessment of the economic potential of the Project, and to conclude whether further work, such as a prefeasibility study, is warranted.

The economic assessment presented within the Technical Report should be considered a preliminary evaluation appropriate to the 'scoping' stage of development of the project. The assessment has been based on a comprehensive block model database, pit design and optimization studies, various metallurgical and pre-concentration work, and to an appropriate level of mining, processing and G&amp;A cost estimation.

To date there has been limited analysis of world tungsten/molybdenum markets into which the mined and processed products would be sold. Neither are there contracts or arrangements of any kind at this point with end users to sell these products.

The Technical Report was compiled by independent consultants, with identification and a Statement  of  Qualifications  for  each  being  attached  herein.  It  provides  a  complete summary of past data together with more recent information generated subsequent to the Resource Estimate authored by Snowden in 2009.

The various agreements under which Largo holds title to the mineral lands for this project were previously verified  by  Snowden,  through  use  of  the  Department  of  Energy,  Mines and  Resources  of  the  Yukon  Government's  Yukon  Mining  Recorders  website,  and  the British Columbia Government's Mineral Titles Online website. A reference to a description of the property, and ownership is provided for general information purposes, as required by NI 43-101. The descriptions of the option agreement and the conditions for transfer of the mining claims have been provided by Largo.

A  resource  block  model  in  Datamine  format,  incorporating  the  2008  and  earlier  drilling was  received  from  Snowden  for  the  PEA  work.  The  model  was  that  generated  by Snowden as part of its assessment of the ND resource in 2009, the report of which is filed on  SEDAR.  The  methodology  and  resource  tonnage  estimates  from  that  report  are described herein.

Pit design and optimization using the Snowden model and generation of mining costs was the responsibility of AMC for the Technical Report.

Matt Bolu P.Eng of Matt Bolu Consulting Engineering Inc. was responsible for design of a metallurgical test program and generation of a process flow-sheet using test data. Bolu was also responsible for estimates of recovery of concentrates, process and APT plant operating costs and final metal product specifications.

Capital  cost  estimation  for  surface  infrastructure  including;  process  plant,  APT  plant, camp and other buildings has been completed by Peter Smith of Axxent Engineering Inc.

All  costs  and revenues have been assembled into an economic evaluation spreadsheet by AMC.

Other  contributors  to  this  report  included  Erik  Nyland  P.Eng  of  Boreal  Engineering  Ltd (Whitehorse) who prepared an estimate of cost for the site access roads which has been integrated into the capital cost estimates.

Hemmera Envirochem Inc. (Vancouver) provided commentary on project environmental and permitting aspects.

Dennis E. Netherton P.Eng M.ASCE of SFPC StreamFlow Power (Canada) a division of Almarah  Technical  Services  Inc.  (South  River  Ontario)  has  examined  the  potential hydroelectric capacity of the ND region and provided capital and operating cost estimates for  construction  of  hydroelectric  dams.  He  also  provided  an  estimate  of  power  cost  per KWHR.

John Lemieux of AMEC, formerly of Journeaux and Bedard Associates, has provided an analysis of tailings and waste management and associated operating and capital costs in contributing to the associated report section.

A listing  of  the  main  authors  of  the  Technical  report  together  with  the  sections  for  which they have been responsible is given in Table 1.1.

## 2 RELIANCE ON OTHER EXPERTS

Property  title  and  the  status  of  Largo's  earn-in  agreement  with  Strategic  Metals  are described  in  Section  3.2  of  this  report.  AMC  is  not  an  expert  in  legal  matters  and  has relied upon the information and advice provided by Largo with respect to title status.

## 3 PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION

## 3.1 Location

Northern  Dancer  straddles  the  southern  Yukon  and  northern  British  Columbia  border, Canada  as  shown  in  Figure  3.1.  The  project  is  approximately  260  km  southeast  of Whitehorse, the territorial  capital  of  the  Yukon,  and  about  165  km  west  of  Watson  Lake. The property (in the vicinity of the field camp) lies at an elevation of about 1,371 m above mean sea level, rising to approximately 1,850 m at the highest point on the ridge above the camp.

The area is accessible by a series of  paved  and  unpaved  highways.  Teslin,  the  nearest town,  with  a  population  of  2,000,  is  approximately  65  km  west  of  the  property.    The  ND Property (see Figure 3.2), is  covered  by  23  contiguous mineral  claims  in  the  Yukon  and three tenures in British Columbia, covering 1,500 ha, as shown in Table 3.1. The Dansar claims  are  registered  to:  Archer,  Cathro  &amp;  Associates  (1981)  Limited  (30%)  and  Largo Resources  (Yukon)  Ltd.  (70%).  The  British  Columbia  tenures  are  registered  to:  Archer, Cathro &amp; Associates (1981) Limited, who hold them in trust for the Strategic Metals joint venture. The concessions run contiguously north-south. The UTM Geographic Datum used for the area is NAD 83. The centre of the property is at latitude 60º 00' N, longitude 131º 37' W. The concession boundaries have not been surveyed.

Largo has represented that the local community welcomes the renewal of exploration and mining  in  the  area.  The  concessions  are  isolated  and  there  are  no  other  exploration  or mining properties of relevance adjacent to the property.

## 3.2 Property Status

Largo has represented that the claims are currently registered as exploration licenses and are in good standing. The Yukon claims were staked under the Yukon Quartz Mining Act and are registered with the Watson Lake Mining Recorder in the name of Archer Cathro &amp; Associates (1981) Limited and Largo Resources (Yukon) Ltd., The British Columbia claims are registered on the British Columbia Ministry of Energy and Mines Mineral Title On-Line database, which indicates that they are owned 100% by Archer Cathro &amp; Associates (1981) Limited who holds them in trust for Strategic Metals.

Mineral claims in the Yukon can be maintained in good standing by performing approved exploration work to a value of $100 per claim per year or by making a $100 per claim per year cash payment to the Watson Lake Mining Recorder in lieu of work. Exploration in the Yukon is subject to Mining Land Use Regulations of the Yukon Quartz Mining Act and to approval by the Yukon Environmental and Socio-Economic Assessment Board (YESAB). Mineral  claims  in  British  Columbia  can  be  maintained  in  good  standing  by  performing approved exploration work to a value of $4 per hectare per year for the first three years filed and $8 per hectare per year for subsequent years filed to a maximum of ten years per filing. Alternatively the claims can be maintained for one year by making a $4 per hectare cash payment in lieu of work to the British Columbia Ministry of Energy and Mines.

Largo entered into an agreement with Strategic Metals on February 15, 2006, giving it an option to acquire an initial 70% interest in Northern Dancer by:

- · Completing $5.0 million in work expenditures.
- · Issuing four million Largo shares listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX).
- · Granting Strategic Metals a 1% net smelter return royalty interest in the property.

AMC understands that, as of March 26, 2009, Largo has completed its earn-in for the initial 70% interest, and that Largo has the right to purchase the remaining 30% interest in the property for an additional $5.0 million or equivalent value in stock. Largo has negotiated a formal  extension  of  the  term  during  which  it  can  purchase  the  remaining  30%  interest  it does not already own at the Northern Dancer Tungsten-Molybdenum deposit in the Yukon Territory until May 15, 2011.

AMC also  understands  that  there  are  no  known  environmental  liabilities  attached  to  the property and that it does not lie within an area selected as First Nations Settlement Land, However, it does lie within the traditional territory of the Teslin Tlingit Council First Nations Council.

## 4 ACCESSIBILITY,  CLIMATE,  LOCAL  RESOURCES,  INFRASTRUCTURE  AND PHYSIOGRAPHY

## 4.1 Access

Northern  Dancer  is  approximately  13  km  north  of  the  Alaska  Highway,  260  km  by  road southeast of Whitehorse and 165 km by road west of Watson Lake. The project is accessed by 65 km of paved highway (the Alaska Highway) east from the town of Teslin, followed by 13  km  of  well  maintained  gravel  road  to  the  Northern  Dancer  camp.  There  are  both helicopter  and  fixed-wing  commercial  air  services  in  Whitehorse  and  Watson  Lake. Whitehorse, the territorial capital and the largest city in the Yukon, is served by an airport with multiple daily flights to and from Vancouver, British Columbia.

## 4.2 Infrastructure

Domestic power and telephone service are available in the town of Teslin, which is linked to the power grid. The phone and power grid do not extend to the project site from Teslin and to date the camp has been powered by diesel generator and has satellite communications. Most supplies and services required for exploration are available in Whitehorse and Watson Lake on a year-round basis. The closest preparation facility is located in Whitehorse and the  closest  analytical  laboratory  is  in  Vancouver.  Limited  services  are  available  in  Teslin including  hotel,  restaurant,  fuel,  groceries,  some  heavy  equipment,  a  first  aid  nursing station,  a  Royal  Canadian  Mounted  Police  detachment,  and  a  gravel  airstrip.  Water  is available  from  a  number  of  rivers  and  creeks  which  drain  the  general  area.  AMC understands that all necessary permits for water usage for exploration purposes have been in place through an application process with the Yukon Water Board.

Canada  has  a  large  and  active  mining  industry.  Infrastructure  for  mining  equipment, services  and  personnel  are  available  in  a  number  of  centres  including  Vancouver, Edmonton, and Toronto. The Yukon Territory has had a long and active mining history and, with several small active mines in the general area, a few local mining services are also available  in  Whitehorse.  Deep  water  port  facilities  are  available  at  Skagway,  Southeast Alaska.

## 4.3 Climate and Physiography

The climate in the Northern Dancer area is typical of northern continental regions with long, cold winters, truncated fall and spring seasons, and short, cool summers. Detailed climate information is  not  available  for  the  property;  the  closest  weather  station  at  Teslin  reports average temperatures of -19°C in January and 14°C in July (Yukon Community Profiles, 2006). Average annual precipitation is 340 mm, mostly occurring as rain during the summer months.  The  winter  snow  pack  averages  approximately  1m.  Although  summers  are relatively mild, Arctic cold fronts often cover the area and snowfall can occur in any month. The property is largely snow free between early June and late September. Sunlight ranges from 22 hours per day in June to 7 hours per day in December.

Northern  Dancer  is  located  in  the  Cassiar  Mountain  Range  and  is  centred  on  a  northtrending ridge that separates tributaries of the Smart River from the headwaters of Logjam Creek. Both of these drainages are part of the Yukon River watershed and flow into the Arctic  Ocean  via  the  Swift,  Teslin,  and  Yukon  Rivers.  Local  elevations  range  between

- 1,000m (near the Alaska Highway in the southern edge of the claim block) and 1,850m (in the northern part of the claim block). The area has undergone recent alpine glaciation and is typified by steep ridges separating broad U-shaped valleys which are blanketed by glacial till  and  moraines.  Outcrop  is  more  abundant  along  ridge  crests  and  on  north-and  westfacing cirque walls. South- and east-facing slopes are usually covered by talus.

The main area of interest on the property is located above the tree line at 1,450m. Here, non-vegetated  upper  slopes  give  way  to  grassy  lower  slopes  with  scattered  clumps  of balsam and buck brush. At the lower elevations near the camp and closer to the highway, there  are  stands  of  balsam,  spruce,  and  pine.  There  is  no  commercial  timber  on  the property.

## 5 HISTORY

The following historical information as shown in Table 5.1  is summarized from Canamax (1983),  Wengzynowski  (2006),  Eaton  (2007),  and  other  unpublished  internal  documents from previous operators.

## 5.1 Historical Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves

A historical Mineral Resource of 162 Mt at 0.13% WO3 and 0.052% MoS2 containing 464.3 million pounds of tungsten (as WO3) and 114 million pounds of molybdenum was reported by Noble et al. (1984). This estimate was based on the drilling and exploration conducted between 1977 and 1981 by Amax. Noble et al. (1984) did not identify the Mineral Resource category and consequently no comparison of the historical estimate can be made to the CIM (2005) accepted categories. The historical Mineral Resource does not conform to the requirements of NI 43-101 and is reported here for historical information purposes only.

## 5.2 Previous Mineral Resource Estimates

## 5.2.1 April 2007 Mineral Resource Estimate

The first Mineral Resource estimate for the Northern Dancer deposit that was prepared in accordance  with  CIM  (2005)  Definition  Standards  was  prepared  by  Largo,  based  on  a verified  database  including  historic  drilling  data  and  data  from  Largo's  2006  drilling campaign. The results of this work were independently verified by Snowden and publicly released on 2 April 2007. Details of this Mineral Resource estimate are presented in a NI 43-101 Technical Report prepared by Snowden dated 17 May 2007 (Snowden, 2007a). The April  2007  Mineral  Resource  estimate  for  the  Northern  Dancer  deposit  is  summarized  in

Table 5.2, below. Largo also reported a molybdenite-rich, porphyry zone sub-set of Inferred Mineral Resource at a cut-off of 0.04% MoS2 to highlight the presence of an elevated MoS2 grade zone within the overall deposit as shown in Table 5.3.

Notes:  Resource  classification  categories  in  accordance  with  CIM  (2005)  Standards  on  Mineral  Resources  and  Reserves referred to in National Instrument NI 43-101. Mineral resources that are not reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability.  Although 0.05% WO3 was considered a likely cut-off grade for this deposit based on comparisons to other similar deposit types at the time of that study, it had not been confirmed by the appropriate economic studies. Totals may not add up exactly due to rounding.

Mineral resources that are not reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. Although 0.04% MoS2 was considered a likely cut-off grade for this deposit based on comparisons to the Ruby Creek project of Adanac Moly Corporation (Blower, 2005), it had not been confirmed by the appropriate economic studies. Totals may not add up exactly due to rounding.

## 5.2.2 March 2008 Mineral Resource Estimate

An updated Mineral Resource estimate for the Northern Dancer deposit was prepared in accordance  with  CIM  (2005)  Definition  Standards  by  Largo  in  March  2008,  based  on  a verified  database  including  historic  drilling  data  and  data  from  Largo's  2006  and  2007 drilling  campaigns. The results of this work were independently verified by Snowden and publicly released on 10 April 2008. Snowden considered that there was sufficient geological and  grade  data,  and  that  this  data  was  of  sufficient  quality  to  support  a  portion  of  the resource  being  classified  in  the  Indicated  category.  Details  of  this  Mineral  Resource estimate are presented in a NI 43-101 Technical Report prepared by Snowden dated 25 May  2008  (Snowden,  2008).  The  31  March  2008  Mineral  Resource  estimate  for  the Northern Dancer deposit is summarized in Table 5.4. Largo again reported a subset of the Mineral  Resource  inside  the  porphyry  molybdenum-rich  zone  of  the  Northern  Dancer deposit (Table 5.5), using a cut-off of 0.024% Mo (equivalent to a 0.04% MoS2 cut-off).

## 6 GEOLOGICAL SETTING

The geological  setting  for  Northern  Dancer  has  been  described  by  Poole  (1956),  Harris, (1978),  Harris  (1979),  Harris  et  al.  (1981),  Noble  et  al.  (1984),  Noble  et  al.  (1986), Mihalynuk and Heaman (2002), and Roots et al. (2004). The information in this section is a summary from these reports. A recent age determination has been done by A. Brand and M. Mortenson of the University of British Columbia (Brand, 2008).

## 6.1 Regional Geology

The geological setting of the Northern Dancer area is tectonically complex. The property lies  130  km  southwest  of  the  Tintina  Fault  within  the  composite  Yukon-Tanana  Terrain Figure  6.1).  Country  rocks  consist  of  Palaeozoic  to  Triassic  fine  grained  clastic  and carbonate sedimentary rocks that were deposited along the margin of North America and later deformed during early Mesozoic arc-continent collision.

The sedimentary rocks were intruded and thermally metamorphosed by an en echelon set of  plutonic  bodies  of  Early  Jurassic  age  (e.g.,  Thirty  mile  Pluton  Northwest,  Thirty  mile Pluton Southwest, Simpson Peak Batholith and Nome Lake Pluton; see Figure 6.1). These intrusive bodies range from ultramafic to granodioritic in composition and regionally define a northwest trend. A younger suite of Cretaceous aged (generally emplaced between 115 Ma and 97 Ma; e.g., Brand, 2008) intrusive bodies are also present. These intrusions define a similar  trend  to  the  older  plutonic  bodies  and  are  quartz  monzonite  to  monzogranite  in composition. They range in size from batholith-sized bodies (e.g., Cassiar Batholith, Seagull Batholith, Marker Lake Batholith, Quiet Lake Batholith and Hake Batholith), through plutonsized  bodies  (e.g.  Kinkit  Pluton)  to  narrow  hypabyssal  dykes.  These  intrusions  host  a number of porphyry-molybdenum deposits in northern British Columbia and the southern Yukon,  including: Northern Dancer  (formerly Logtung), Red  Mountain,  and  Adanac (Mihalynuk and Heaman, 2002).

The Northern Dancer deposit is a porphyry tungsten-molybdenum deposit. The deposit is characterized by the presence of a quartz vein stockwork and a northeast-trending sheeted vein  set  centred  on  a  quartz  feldspar  intrusive  complex.  The  quartz  feldspar  intrusive complex appears to be a branch emanating from the northern flank of a Cretaceous-aged (~110  Ma  (Brand,  2008))  quartz  monzonite  stock.  The  stock  is  a  satellite  to  the  Seagull Batholith,  one  of  several  Cretaceous  tungsten-molybdenum-fluorine-rich  intrusions  that define a northwest trend in this part of the northern Canadian Cordillera.

## 6.3 Property Geology

The property is underlain by skarn and hornfels metasedimentary rocks that are assumed to have been derived from calcareous phyllite, siliceous argillite, and minor limestone of the Mississippian-aged  Dorsey  Group.  Light  green  quartz-diopside  skarn  is  the  predominant rock  type  with  subordinate  amounts  of  reddish-brown  garnet  skarn  and  grey  to  black hornfels. The skarn and hornfels lithological units are, however, often interbanded.

The metasedimentary rocks were intruded by fine- to coarse-grained Jurassic-aged diorite dykes  (as  shown  in  Table  6.1  and  Figure  6.3)  The  emplacement  of  these  dykes  was associated  with  the  development  of  a  narrow  contact  aureole  (about  30  m  in  width)  of hornfels in the surrounding metasediments.

Intrusion  of  the  quartz  monzonite  stock  (~110  Ma)  followed  and  appears  to  have  been associated with the development of a set of quartz-feldspar porphyry dykes. The quartzfeldspar  porphyry  dykes  appear  to  be  concentrated  at  the  northern  end  of  the  stock. Tungsten-molybdenum  mineralization  appears  to  be  strongly  associated  with  the  quartzfeldspar porphyry dyke bodies

The total mineralized area along the northern and western contacts of the quartz monzonite body  measures  2.5  km  by  1.0  km,  strikes  north,  and  extends  up  to  3  m  into  the  quartz monzonite.  The  area  of  highest  grade  mineralization  occurs  at  the  northern  end  of  the northerly dipping quartz monzonite stock and is centred on the complex group of quartzfeldspar porphyry dykes.

Minerals of economic interest include scheelite, molybdenite, and molybdoscheelite, which are mainly distributed in a stockwork of fractures and veins in the metasedimentary rocks and  quartz-feldspar  porphyry  dykes.  About  20%  of  the  mineralization  occurs  in  a  set  of large northeast-striking sheeted quartz-pyrite veins, which are often pegmatitic and contain accessory  beryl,  fluorite, bismuthinite, chalcopyrite, sphalerite, and  pyrrhotite. These sheeted veins appear to be associated with the emplacement of the quartz monzonite stock and quartz-feldspar porphyry dyke bodies. A further 5% of the scheelite and molybdenite are disseminated in garnet skarn bands.

## 7 DEPOSIT TYPES

The Northern Dancer deposit is  a  porphyry  tungsten-molybdenum  system  (e.g.,  Kirkham and Sinclair, 1984; Sinclair, 1995). Deposits of this type comprise large tonnage, generally low  grade,  hydrothermal  mineralization  related  to  igneous  intrusions  emplaced  at  high levels in the earth's crust. The mineralization may  be confined to pluton-hosted disseminations,  veins  and  veinlets  in  stockworks,  vein  sets,  and  breccias  and  occur  in skarn, replacement, vein and disseminated deposits peripheral to plutons. Deposits of this type  are  amongst  the  world's  largest,  including  copper,  molybdenum,  uranium,  tungsten, gold, silver, and tin. Porphyry molybdenum deposits are common in the northern Cordillera, with examples  including: Quartz  Hill, Endako,  Red  Mountain,  Adanac,  Trout  Lake, Henderson, and Climax.

## 8 MINERALIZATION

Previous  work  in  the  vicinity  of  the  claims  has  outlined  an  extensive,  multi-episode  vein system  (Table  8.1)  that  is enriched  in several  metals,  most  notably  tungsten  and molybdenum  (Noble  et  al.,  1984;  Wengzynowski,  2006).  Readers  interested  in  a  more detailed  description  of  the  vein  system  are  referred  to  Chapter  4  of  Brand  (2008).  The system is centred on a porphyry dyke complex and appears to form an approximately 3 km by 1 km kidney-shaped zone that is elongated along a north-north-easterly axis.

Most  of  the  mineralization  (approximately  95%)  within  the  system  occurs  in  veins  and fractures.  In  addition,  minor  molybdenite  is  disseminated  in  the  porphyry  complex,  some tungsten minerals are disseminated in skarn horizons and local disseminations of scheelite and molybdenite are found in the haloes of sheeted veins (Type 4; see Table 8.1). Although veins cross-cut all units and most are apparently related to emplacement of the porphyry dyke complex, it is possible that some veining and skarnification may predate that event.

## 8.1 Mineralization Studies

Amax Potash Limited (Amax), one of the previous operators, undertook bulk sampling of a decline  and  diamond  drill  holes  in  1980  to  gain  an  understanding  of  the  controls  on mineralization. Amax believed there were generally two controls on mineralization: regionalscale  controls  affecting  the  whole  deposit  (zoning  within  the  deposit)  and  local  scale controls affecting smaller portions of the deposit, such as Type 4 sheeted veins.

## Amax was of the opinion that:

- · Although the porphyry dykes are enriched in molybdenum relative to the wallrock, they are relatively depleted in tungsten. This relationship is demonstrated in samples taken from pre-2006 drill holes (Table 8.2) and the decline (Table 8.3).
- · Steeply dipping, north-easterly striking, sheeted veins appear to exert a major control on WO3 grade but do not influence distribution of MoS2.

Table 8.2 Grade distribution by rock type in pre-2006 drilling samples

| Rock Type        |   Average WO3 (%) |   Average MoS2 (%) | WO3:MoS2   |
|------------------|-------------------|--------------------|------------|
| Wallrock         |              0.1  |              0.041 | 2.5 : 1    |
| Porphyry complex |              0.06 |              0.08  | 0.8 : 1    |

## Table 8.3 Grade distribution by rock type in historic samples collected from the decline

| Rock Type        |   Average WO3 (%) |   Average MoS2 (%) | WO3:MoS2   |
|------------------|-------------------|--------------------|------------|
| Wallrock         |              0.1  |              0.041 | 2.5 : 1    |
| Porphyry complex |              0.06 |              0.08  | 0.8 : 1    |

Prospecting, mapping, and soil geochemical results from the various exploration programs, including  Strategic  Metals'  work  in  1998,  2001,  and  2003,  indicate  that  the  potential  for sheeted  vein  and  skarn  mineralization  extends  well  beyond  the  outlined  deposit.  Also, results from the various prospecting programs suggest that tungsten±molybdenum mineralized veins south of the defined deposit could contain potential by-products including beryllium, bismuth, gold, and silver.

Brand (2008) inferred that the monzogranite and felsic dyke intrusive were the source of the tungsten and molybdenum metals. She demonstrated that the ore mineral assemblage and scheelite composition varies by vein/host environment, with:

- · Type  1  veins  containing  only  molybdoscheelite  with  an  average  of  4.85  wt.%  MoO3 grade but do not influence distribution of MoS2
- · Type 2 veins containing purer scheelite (1.13 wt.% MoO3)
- · Type  3  veins  containing  primary  molybdenite  ±  relatively  pure  scheelite  (0.73  wt.% MoO3)
- · Type 4 veins containing scheelite + molybdenite ± beryl (0.92 wt.% MoO3)

Brand (2008) noted that the molybdenum content of the scheelite is controlled by one, or a combination  of  geological  conditions,  including  oxygen  fugacity  (fO2)  temperature,  fluid composition, redox conditions, pressure, and sulphur fugacity (fS2). Brand (2008) indicated that,  on  the  basis  of  previous  studies  on  the  role  of  fO2  and  fS2  in  the  stability  of molybdenite and scheelite (e.g., Hsu, 1977; Darling, 1994), a decrease in fO2 (and/or an increase in fS2) could cause molybdoscheelite to split into a dual assemblage of scheelite and  molybdenite.  Brand  (2008)  also  suggested  that  CO2  could  play  a  role  in  scheelite mineral chemistry.

## 9 EXPLORATION PROGRAMS

## 9.1 Historic Exploration

The  exploration  history  of  the  Northern  Dancer  deposit  has  been  described  by  Poole (1956), Poole et al. (1960), Bell (1976), Bacon (1977), Harris (1978), Harris (1979), Harris et  al.  (1981),  Cathro  (1982),  Canamax  (1983),  Eaton  (1994),  Wengzynowski  (2006),  and Eaton (2007). The historic information presented in this section is summarized from these reports.

## 9.1.1 Pre-1977 Exploration

The Northern Dancer project area has been prospected since the 1920s.. Numerous claim groups  were  staked  throughout  the  years  primarily  for  the  exploration  of  lead-zinc-silver vein mineralization.

Tungsten mineralization in the Northern Dancer area was first mentioned by the Geological Survey of Canada which mapped the area in the early 1950s (Poole, 1956 and Poole et al., 1960).

In  1976,  Cordilleran  Engineering  Ltd  discovered  tungsten  mineralization  on  behalf  of  the Bath Uranium Partnership, which was organized as a uranium exploration venture. They discovered tungsten stream sediment anomalies, but it was not until the following year that the anomalies were traced to their source and a large claim block was staked straddling the British Columbia-Yukon border. After preliminary prospecting, ownership of the claims was transferred to Logjam Resources Ltd, for which no details are available.

## 9.1.2 Amax Exploration from 1977 to 1981

Amax acquired the property in March 1977 and carried out extensive exploration during the Amax acquired the property in March 1977 and carried out extensive exploration during the summers of 1977 to 1981. Between 1977 and 1981 Amax built a road to the property and conducted geological mapping, soil geochemistry, IP surveys, drilled 51 diamond drill hole (Figure  9.1),  totalling  11,869  m,  and  excavated  496  m  of  underground  workings.  The surface work was done on both sides of the border but only 474 m of the diamond drilling (in four  drill holes) was done on the British Columbia claims, in the 'BC Zone'. Most of the drilling focused on an area about 300 m north of the British Columbia-Yukon border where the Northern Dancer deposit was outlined.

In 1981, Amax created a digital model of the deposit, performed geostatistical studies, and undertook a preliminary evaluation of the site, which included housing, transportation, plant design, power supply, and geotechnical considerations.

## 9.1.3 Canamax Resources Incorporated Exploration from 1983 to 1986

In  1983  Amax  transferred  its  interest  to  Canamax  Resources  Incorporated  (Canamax) which then prepared a Prefeasibility Study that concluded the deposit was uneconomic. In 1984  airborne  magnetic  and  electromagnetic  surveys  were  conducted,  and  in  1986 Canamax  dropped  its  option.  Subsequently  most  of  the  Yukon  and  all  of  the  British Columbia claims were allowed to lapse.

## 9.1.4 NDU Resources Limited Exploration in 1993

In 1993 NDU Resources Limited optioned the remaining claims and conducted exploration targeted at bulk tonnage gold mineralization modelled on the Fort Knox Deposit in Alaska (Eaton, 1994). The exploration program consisted of soil geochemical surveys, prospecting, and  234m  of  diamond  drilling  in  two  drill  holes.  Soil  sampling  outlined  large  areas  of moderately  to  strongly  anomalous  tungsten,  bismuth,  and  gold  values  but  rock  analyses and drilling returned disappointing results. The option was allowed to expire.

## 9.1.5 Strategic Metals Limited Exploration from 1998 to 2004

In  1998 Nordac Resources Limited (renamed Strategic Metals Ltd in 2001) re-staked the property  and  performed  additional  prospecting  and  limited  rock  sampling,  which  were

directed  primarily  toward  beryllium  potential.  Strategic  Metals  conducted  digital  data compilation and performed more prospecting in 2001 (Eaton, 2002), prospecting and hand trenching  in  2003  (Eaton,  2004),  and  excavator  trenching  and  road  construction  in  2004 (Eaton, 2005).

## 9.2 Largo Exploration

## 9.2.1 2006 Exploration

Largo optioned the property from Strategic Metals on April 10, 2006. In 2006, 17 diamond drill holes were completed, eight of which were designed to twin drill holes from the 1977 to 1980 Amax drilling  program,  and  nine  of  which  were  infill  drilling  (Figure  9.2).  Additional details of the 2006 drilling program are presented in Snowden (2007). Largo resurveyed all historic drill holes and surveyed the topography.

## 9.2.2 2007 Exploration

## Drilling

An additional 26 drill holes were planned for 2007 (Figure 9.3):

- · Twenty four of these drill holes were focused on infill drilling to facilitate upgrading of resource estimation confidence categories.
- · A single exploration drill hole was drilled into a prospect identified in 2007, called the Marilyn  Creek  occurrence,  centered  on  skarn-style  molybdoscheelite  and  scheelite adjacent to small porphyritic felsic dykes.
- · Largo, with technical services provided by Wardrop Engineering Inc., also drilled one drill hole for preliminary geotechnical assessment purposes.

Two drill holes were abandoned: LT07-88 due to poor ground conditions and LT07-93 due to excessive snowfall. Additional details relating to the 2007 drilling program are presented in Section 10.

## Surface Sampling

Largo enlisted the services of Mesh Environmental Inc. which performed preliminary testing of 'acid rock drainage' (ARD) through stream sampling along the southeastern basal area of the deposit, including seepage from the adit mouth. ARD testing also included selection of various lithological and mineralogical zones within the core obtained in 2007, to test for potential acid generating characteristics of these different zones.

Detailed geological mapping was performed on the northwest side of the ridge bisecting the property, as well as areas slightly to the northwest, leading to identification of the Marilyn Creek  occurrence.  A  total  of  22  rock  samples  were  also  taken,  including  six  outcrop samples  directly  from  the  occurrence  and  four  from  an  area  of  historic  trenching  (dates unknown) near the headwaters of the creek. Anomalous tungsten and molybdenum values ranging  from  &lt;0.005%  to  0.214%  W  and  22.4  ppm  to  157.2  ppm  Mo  were  obtained  for these  samples.  Three  of  these  were  chip  samples,  returning  lower  values  than  the  grab samples, the best result characterized by 0.049% W with 86.7 ppm Mo across 0.8 m.

Weakly anomalous molybdenum values were returned from the area of historic trenching; tungsten values generally reported at background levels with the exception of a single 0.8 m chip sample for which an assay of 0.008% W was obtained.

Minor massive galena-sphalerite veining was identified at two locations; one about 150 m east  of  the  main  deposit,  returning  values  of  up  to  0.3  g/t  gold  and  in  excess  of  100  g/t silver; the other along a stream west of the dioritic stock, returned an assay of 7.39 g/t gold and more than 100 g/t silver. Both occurrences are less than 0.15 m in width and a few metres  in  length  and  are  not  considered  significant  targets.  Minor  quartz-arsenopyrite veining, returning gold assay values up to 6.15 g/t, occurs about 600 m east of the deposit, slightly north of the northeast property boundary.

Base metal mineralization and elevated values of Bi, Sb, Pb, W and Mo were obtained from surface exploration and sampling along the structure that appears to limit mineralization in the northern parts of the deposit. This mineralization appears to be associated with a sliver of  quartz-feldspar  porphyry.  Largo  considered  this  as  a  worthwhile  target  for  follow-up during the 2008 exploration program.

## 9.2.3 2008 Exploration

An additional 38 holes were drilled in 2008 (see Figure 10.4). The purpose of Largo's 2008 drill program at Northern Dancer project was to:

- · Further  define  and  expand  the  limits  of  the  higher-grade  tungsten  and  molybdenum zones outlined during the 2007 drill program.
- · Upgrade  the  March  2008  resource  that  was  publicly  released  on  10  April,  2008 (Snowden,  2008),  in  particular  to  upgrade  a  significant  portion  of  the  Inferred  and Indicated resource to a Measured and Indicated category to produce a mineral resource that can form the basis for a Prefeasibility Study.

Additional details relating to the 2008 drilling program are presented in Section 10.

## 10 DRILLING

Historic  drilling  has  been  described  by  Poole  (1956),  Poole  et  al.  (1960),  Harris  (1978), Harris (1979), Harris et al. (1981), Eaton (1994), Wengzynowski (2006), and Eaton (2007). Details of the historic (pre-2006) drilling have been summarized from these reports. Largo's 2006 and 2007 drilling programs are described in Snowden (2007) and Snowden (2008) respectively.  A  summary  of  the  diamond  core  drilling  that  has  been  conducted  on  the Northern  Dancer  Project  including  the  2008  drilling  program  is  presented  in  Table  10.1. Collar  coordinates for all    drill  holes  drilled  on  the  Northern  Dancer  property  are  listed  in Appendix  A  of  the  Snowden-authored  43-101  Technical  Report  dated  1  June  2009  and entitled:  'Largo  Resources  Limited:  Northern  Dancer  Project,  Project  No.  V603,  Mineral Resource Estimate Update' (the 2009 Snowden Technical report).

## 10.1  Drilling by Amax from 1977 to 1980

Between 1977 and 1980, Amax drilled 51 diamond drill holes totalling 11,631 m. In 1977, Amax began with an exploration program consisting of 14 drill holes totalling 2,839 m. This was followed up in 1978 with a program of 19 drill holes totalling 4,176 m. In 1979, seven drill holes totalling 1,676 m were drilled. In 1980, Amax contracted Canadian Longyear to drill  eleven  diamond  drill  holes  totalling  2,876  m.  Drill  core  diameters  were  variable;  it appears that most drill holes were drilled to provide NQ drill core, with some BQ and HQ diameter drill core being recovered.

## 10.1.1 Collar Surveying

Historically,  surface  drill  holes  were  surveyed  by  McElhanney  Survey  and  Engineering Limited using a theodolite and triangulated using border monuments and associated control points.

## 10.1.2 Downhole Surveying

In  this  program,  surveys  were  only  taken  at  the  collar  and  the  end  of  the  drill  hole.  On average, drill holes were 255 m long, ranging from 6 m to 427 m.

## 10.1.3 Core Recovery

Core recovery was generally above 80% for the eight drill holes that were checked in detail, though some logs noted caving as a problem.

## 10.1.4 Results

The potential for structurally or stratigraphically controlled zones of elevated grade within or adjacent to the bulk tonnage deposit was not evaluated by Amax or Canamax, but does appear  to  exist.  Unfortunately,  most  of  the  pre-2006  drill  holes  were  vertical  or  steeply inclined and therefore failed to properly test the steeply dipping, higher grade sheeted veins (Type 4; see Table 8.1). The best sheeted vein interval intersected averaged 1.07% WO3 and 0.125% MoS2 across a 12 m thick section containing 15 veins, the largest of which had a drill core thickness of 50 cm. The pre-2006 drill data were too widely spaced to allow for correlation  between  skarn  intersections,  especially  considering  the  strong  deformation  in the metasediments and the relative lack of data regarding bedding orientations. The best skarn interval reported contained 1.13% WO3 and 0.129% MoS2 over 4 m.

In  the  'BC  Zone'  (i.e.,  south  of  the  Yukon-BC  border),  four  drill  holes  hit  mineralization (most significantly drill hole 77-01 with 8 m at 0.10% WO3 and drill hole 77-03 with 6 m of 0.16% WO3 and 6 m of 0.13% WO3). No further drilling was done after 1980.

## 10.2  Drilling by NDU Resources in 1993

Two HQ diameter diamond drill holes were drilled in 1993 by E. Caron Diamond Drilling of Whitehorse, totalling 234 m, to test the main Au soil geochemical anomaly. Both drill holes were drilled entirely in diorite, and assays were considered disappointing.

## 10.3  Largo Drilling Programs - 2006 onwards

## 10.3.1 2006 Drilling Program

The 2006 diamond drilling program consisted of 17 drill  holes  totalling  3,944  m,  eight  of which were designed to twin drill holes from the 1977 to 1980 Amax drilling program, and nine of  which  were  infill  drilling.  The  work  was  contracted  to  Full  Force  Diamond  Drilling Limited  of  Peachland,  British  Columbia.  All  drill  holes  were  done  with  a  Mandrill  1200 hydrostatic drill rig using NTW equipment.

Drilling was conducted between 22 April and 3 August 2006.

NTW diameter core was recovered and loaded into core boxes at the drill rig. Core boxes were then transported to camp for logging and sampling.

## Collar Surveying

Surveyors  from  Underhill  Geomatics  Ltd.  based  in  Whitehorse,  Yukon,  were  on  site between 29 August and 6 September 2006, conducting detailed GPS surveys of all of the 2006 drill hole collars. A detailed topographic survey was also conducted at this time.

## Downhole Surveying

Downhole surveys were conducted using an Icefield MI-03 Inclinometer tool with readings taken  every  15  m  down  the  drill  hole.  Graphs  of  drill  hole  traces  were  plotted  on  site  to assess the quality of the downhole surveying.

## Core Recovery

Core recovery was generally greater than 90% for all drill holes drilled as part of the 2006 drilling program.

## 10.3.2 2007 Drilling Program

A total of 26 drill holes (8,493.7m) were drilled as part of the 2007 drilling program. One drill hole (LT07-94) was designed for preliminary geotechnical assessment purposes and has not been sampled for assaying. Two drill holes were abandoned due to ground conditions (LT07-88  and  LT07-93).  The  work  was  contracted  to  Kluane  Drilling  headquatered  in Whitehorse, Yukon. All drill holes were done with a Mandrill 1200 hydrostatic drill rig using NTW equipment. The 2007 drilling program was conducted between 7 June and 1 October 2007.

NTW diameter core was recovered and loaded into core boxes at the drill rig. Core boxes were then transported to camp for logging and sampling.

## Collar Surveying

In  September  2007,  surveyors  from  Challenger  Geomatics  Limited  out  of  Whitehorse, Yukon were on site and conducted detailed GPS surveys of all the 2007 drill hole collars.

## Downhole Surveying

Downhole surveys were conducted using an Icefield MI-03 Inclinometer tool with readings taken  every  15  m  down  the  hole  for  three  of  the  holes  drilled  during  the  2007  drilling campaign;  the  instrument  was  then  damaged.  The  remaining  drill  holes  were  surveyed using  an  EZ-Shot®  downhole  surveying  tool  with  between  two  and  five  readings  being taken down the length of the hole. Downhole survey data were reviewed in a spreadsheet to assess survey quality.

## Core Recovery

Core recovery was generally greater than 95% for all drill holes drilled as part of the 2007 drilling program.

## 10.3.3 2008 Drilling Program

A total of 38 drill holes (11,509.78m) was drilled as part of the 2008 drilling program. The work was contracted to Kluane Drilling Ltd. All drill holes were done with two (2) Mandrill 1200 hydrostatic drill rigs using NTW equipment. The 2008 drilling program was conducted between 3 June and 14 September 2008.

NTW diameter core was recovered and loaded into core boxes at the drill rig. Core boxes were then transported 1.5 kilometres to the camp for inspecting, logging and sampling.

## Collar Surveying

In  September  2008,  surveyors  from  Challenger  Geomatics  Limited  were  on  site  and conducted detailed GPS surveys of all the 2008 drill hole collars.

## Downhole Surveying

Downhole surveys were conducted using a Reflex EZ-Shot® downhole surveying tool with a reading made every 30 m down the drill hole. Downhole survey data were reviewed in a spreadsheet to assess survey quality

## Core Recovery

Core recovery was generally greater than 95% for all drill holes drilled as part of the 2008 drilling program.

## 10.3.4 Results of Largo's Drilling Programs

All 2006, 2007 and 2008 drill holes (with the exception of drill hole LT06-64, which was lost in overburden, and LT07-94, which was drilled as a geotechnical drill hole and has not been sampled  for  assaying)  contained  mineralization  and  produced  significant  assays.  The average grade over the entire length of each drill hole and significant grade intersections are presented in the 2009 Snowden Technical Report, Appendices B and C respectively.

All 2006, 2007 and 2008 drill holes (with the exception of drill hole LT06-64, which was lost in overburden, and LT07-94, which was drilled as a geotechnical drill hole and has not been sampled  for  assaying)  contained  mineralization  and  produced  significant  assays.  The average grade over the entire length of each drill hole and significant grade intersections are presented in the 2009 Snowden Technical Report, Appendices B and C respectively.

## 2006 Drilling Program

The  2006  drilling  program  had  two  main  goals:  to  evaluate  the  reproducibility  of  the historical  Amax  drilling  results  and  to  test  for  steeply  dipping  sheeted  veins  (Type  4)  at depths shallower than previously intersected.

Results  from  drill  holes  drilled  to  twin  selected  historic  drill  holes  confirmed  the  grades reported in the historic drill holes, taking inherent geological variability between drill holes, different generations of drilling techniques, assay methods and laboratory conditions, and sample support into account. It was concluded (Snowden, 2007a) that the historic drilling

data  were  suitable  for  use  in  the  generation  of  a  Mineral  Resource  estimate  at  the Preliminary Assessment level.

The  2006  drilling  also  confirmed  the  presence  and  attitude  of  the  northeast-trending, steeply  dipping,  tungsten-rich  sheeted  veins  (Type  4  veins).  It  was  found  that  shallower angled drill holes (-45°) gave better intersection angles with the sheeted veins than steeper drill holes.  Type  4  veins  were  found  to  be  characterized  by  local  weak  stockwork geometries.  Shallower  angled  drill  holes  drilled  in  2006  intersected  sheeted  veins  at shallower depths than previously reported, indicating that the interpreted relationship of a tungsten  grade  increase  with  depth  needed  to  be  tested  and  revisited  with  additional shallow-angled drilling.

Other geological observations made during the 2006 drilling program included:

- · The  type  of  host  rock  was  found  to  affect  vein  mineralogy  and  alteration  envelopes, which were seen to change along strike as veins crosscut different host rocks.
- · Disseminated scheelite was found to be present in garnet and pyroxene skarn horizons as well as in the haloes of Type 4 veins.
- · The sulphide  content  of  the  deposit  was  found  to  be  low,  confirming  observations  of previous workers.

Additional  details  relating  to  the  results  of  the  2006  drilling  program  are  presented  in Snowden (2007a).

## 2007 Drilling Program

The  2007  drilling  program  had  two  main  goals:  infill  drilling  to  raise  confidence  in  the Mineral  Resource  (i.e.,  to  upgrade  Inferred  material  to  the  Indicated  category);  and  to investigate the potential of a high grade tungsten zone in the vicinity of the steeply-dipping sheeted veins.

The drilling was successful in upgrading a portion of the Mineral Resource to Indicated (see Snowden, 2008). The 2007 drilling  also  resulted  in  the  delineation  of  a  new  mineralized domain for the Northern Dancer deposit: a mineralized diorite domain. Diorite in the southwestern  part  of  the  deposit  was  found  to  be  highly  mineralized  in  several  intersections, confirming  earlier  geochemical  exploration  results  of  Archer  Cathro  that  indicated  a relationship  between  diorite  and  mineralization.  The  nature  of  these  structures  was proposed for investigation as a part of the 2008 exploration program.

Numerical logging of mineral abundances and vein structures was conducted as part of the 2007 drilling  program.  Largo's  objective  was  to  generate  three  dimensional  mineralogical models of the deposit using this information to assist in domain definition and refinement in future block models.

Additional geological observations made during the 2007 drilling program include:

- · The  type  of  host  rock  was  found  to  affect  mineralogy,  grain  size  and  distribution  of stockwork mineralization. Diorite, for example, was found to host veins that contained less molybdoscheelite and molybdenite than other host rocks, with vein types 2 and 3

usually being absent. Only skarn was found to host all types of stockwork mineralization.

- · Molybdenum  grades  appear  to  increase  with  depth,  especially  in  the  skarn  domain. Largo consider this as being a function of the proximity to a felsic intrusive body that is a source of stockwork mineralization, alteration and silicification (e.g., the quartz monzonite  and  quartz-feldspar porphyry  bodies). A  molybdenum  rich  zone  was identified proximal to the quartz-feldspar porphyry (QFP) at shallow depths in the northeastern  parts  of  the  property,  in  agreement  with  this  consideration.  Additional  drilling was proposed to further investigate this apparent relationship.
- · Elevated grades were generally found to be associated with alteration haloes. Elevated tungsten  grades  were  identified  in  the  dark  green  pyroxene  skarn  alteration  haloes developed in association with Type 2 and Type 4 veins.
- · The disseminated scheelite found in garnet and pyroxene skarn horizons, as well as in the haloes of Type 4 veins, as part of the 2006 drilling program, was again noted during the  2007  drilling  program.  Such  dissemination  is  considered  to  be  associated  with alteration  haloes  around  the  major  stockwork  vein  systems.  The  scheelite  generally displays a cloudy  or dusty appearance  due  to  the  fine  grained  nature  of the disseminated mineralization.

## 2008 Drilling Program

Largo's 2008 drill program at the Northern Dancer project had several objectives:

- · To further define and expand the limits of the higher-grade tungsten and molybdenum zones outlined during the 2007 drilling program.
- · To improve the molybdenum grade model for the deposit taking the northeast extension of molybdenum-rich zones in skarn and hornfels into account.
- · To upgrade a significant portion of the Inferred and Indicated resource to the Measured and Indicated categories to produce a mineral resource that can form the basis for a Prefeasibility Study.

The drilling program was successful in upgrading a portion of the Mineral Resource to the Measured and Indicated categories  (see  Section  16).  The  2008  drilling  also  investigated and  delineated  the  nature  of  the  sheeted  veins  within  different  rock  domains,  especially within diorite and skarn.

The 2008 drilling program also improved the molybdenum grade model for the deposit. This was  achieved  through  improved  delineation  of the molybdenum-rich  quartz-feldspar porphyry domain and through close-spaced drilling in the northeast of the property, where numerous  molybdenum-rich  (Type  3)  veins  crosscut  skarn  and  hornfels  rocks.  The improved model is characterized by an overall increase in the molybdenum grade across the deposit.

Close-spaced drilling was conducted in the diorite domain to better define the mineralized diorite  and its  contact  with  the  skarn  and  non-mineralized diorite domains. The results of

this  drilling  highlighted  physical  properties  of  the  diorite  and  diorite-hosted  sheeted  veins that  could  make  them  important  targets  for  additional  scheelite  recovery  metallurgical testwork.

## 11 SAMPLING METHOD AND APPROACH

## 11.1  Historic Sampling

The  sampling  method  and  approach  of  the  historic  data  has  been  described  by  Poole (1956), Poole et al. (1960), Harris (1978), Harris (1979), Harris et al. (1981), Eaton (1994), Wengzynowski  (2006),  and  Eaton  (2007).  Historic  sampling  method  and  approach  data from these reports are summarised below.

## 11.1.1 Sampling by Amax from 1977 to 1980

Sampling of mineralization within the study area by previous operators has been conducted using both diamond drilling and trench sampling methods. Core was taken from the ground and placed sequentially in core boxes. Boxes were transported to the camp nearby where the  core  was  inspected  and  recovery  was  noted.  The  core  was  geologically  logged  by  a geologist, the scheelite content was estimated by fluorescence, and sample intervals were marked. Drill core was split in two halves using a core splitter; one half of the core sample was  placed  back  in  the  core  box  and  the  other  half  was  then  bagged  along  with  its corresponding  sample  tag  for  shipment.  The  core  was  shipped  to  the  Rossbacher Laboratory  in  Burnaby,  British  Columbia.  Core  trays  containing  the  remaining  half  core sample were placed in core racks and stored at the exploration core storage shack on the Northern Dancer property for future reference. The historic core boxes were noted to be in very poor state due to vandalism and neglect.

## 11.1.2 Sampling by NDU Resources in 1993

All  drill  hole  core  from  this  campaign  was  split  on  the  property.  Half  of  the  core  was sampled  in  3  meter  intervals  and  sent  to  ALS  Chemex  Laboratories  in  Smithers,  British Columbia for preparation and then tested at their assaying facilities in Vancouver, British Columbia. The remaining core was stored on site with the core from earlier programs, and was also noted to be in a very poor state.

## 11.2  Sampling by Largo - 2006, 2007 and 2008

Largo's  sampling  methodology  and  approach  did  not  changed  significantly  between  the 2006, 2007 and 2008 drilling programs.

## 11.2.1 Core Logging

Core was transported by truck from the drilling site to a core shack located near camp. The core  was  photographed  and  cleaned  prior  to  conducting  geotechnical  logging.  RQD, recovery, magnetic susceptibility, and detailed fracture analysis were recorded as part of the  geotechnical  logging  process.  The  core  was  then  geologically  logged,  with  sample intervals delineated on the core by the geologist.

Largo geologists logged the core in detail for each sample interval (approximately every 2 meters  to  replicate  as  closely  as  possible  the  Amax  methodology),  using  the  Amax geological  legend.  Observations  were  made  concerning  rock  type,  relative  proportion  of each  vein  type,  vein  host  rock  type  and  sulphide  mineralogy.  Core  was  scanned  for

variations  in  scheelite  mineralization  using  an  ultraviolet  lamp  in  the  on-site  dark  room. Sample intervals were defined on the basis of lithology, alteration, veining and mineralization,  and  marked  on  the  core.  Alteration  and  veining  was  described  in  1  to  4 meter  increments,  and  an  estimate  of  the  relative  proportion  of  fluorescent  minerals  as observed under the ultraviolet lamp was made.

Core logging information was recorded on paper and then re-entered into an electronic drill log template as part of the 2006 drilling program. All geotechnical and geological logging conducted  during  the  2007  and  2008  drilling  programs  was  digitally  recorded  using Gemcom Logger software. Each core box was labelled according to drill hole, box number and  depth.  Additional  information  written  on  the  core  box  included  recovery,  RQD  and sample interval.

## 11.2.2 Sample Preparation Prior to Dispatch of Samples

Lines along which the core was to be split/sawn were selected during the geological logging of the core by the geologist. In 2006 cores were split in half using a mechanical splitter, with one half labelled, bagged, and sealed for assaying and the remaining half stored in the core box. In 2007 and 2008 drill hole cores were cut by electrical saw, with one half labelled, bagged and sealed for assaying and the remaining half stored in the core box. Care was taken during both drilling programs to ensure that the splitter and core saw were thoroughly cleaned between the splitting/cutting of each sample.

Samples were taken at regular intervals, most commonly 1.5 or 2.0 metres, due to relative uniformity of mineralization. Individual sample lengths were also determined by changes in lithology, alteration, structural zones such as faults, or amount of quartz veining; thus not all sample  lengths  are  identical.  All  sample  intervals  were  laid  out  prior  to  sampling,  with sample numbers marked with small wooden blocks, and intervals carefully documented. A tag  with  a  specific  identification  number  supplied  by  Acme  Laboratories  Ltd  (Acme Laboratories)  for  each  sample  taken  was  stapled  into  the  core  tray  within  the  respective sample interval. Sample bags were stored in the core shed prior to transportation.

## 11.2.3 Density Determinations

Density  was  measured  on  site  by  Archer  Cathro  in  2006.  Sample  intervals  considered representative of the different rock types were selected from different drill holes for density measurements.  Density  measurements  were  conducted  on  whole  core  material  prior  to sampling using the industry-standard weight-in-water weight-in-air technique (Lipton, 1993). Core samples were weighed to the nearest tenth of a gram. A representative suite of 444 whole core samples, averaging between 20 cm to 30 cm in length, were sent to the Eco Tech  Laboratory  in  Kamloops,  British  Columbia  for  density  testing  during  the  2007  (180 samples) and 2008 (263 samples) drilling programs. The samples were wax-coated at the laboratory prior to conducting the density measurements using the weight-in-air weight-inwater technique. The laboratory ran duplicates and standards as part of its internal quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocol, with the results indicating an acceptable level  of  precision  and  accuracy.  Density  samples  were  collected  for  all  five  mineralized domains,  as  well  as  for  the  quartz  monzonite  porphyry  (QMP)  and  waste  domains  (see Table 11.1).

Table 11.1 Density by Rock Type (Density Measurements from 2007 and 2008)

| Rock type                 |   Number of samples | Average density (t/m )*  3   |
|---------------------------|---------------------|------------------------------|
| Hornfels                  |                  90 | 2.62 ± 0.13                  |

## 12 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES, AND SECURITY

## 12.1  Historic Sample Preparation, Analyses and Security

Historic sampling preparation, analyses, and security have been described by Poole (1956), Poole  et  al.  (1960),  Harris  (1978),  Harris  (1979),  Harris  et  al.  (1981),  Eaton  (1994), Wengzynowski (2006), and Eaton (2007). The information in this section is a summary from these reports.

## 12.1.1 Amax Sample Preparation from 1977 to 1981

A  total  of  40  batches  of  samples,  containing  approximately  40  samples  each,  was submitted to the Rossbacher Laboratory in Burnaby, British Columbia following the 1977 drilling program. Three Amax control samples were sent per batch. A total of 54 samples from  five  batches  were  reanalysed  because  of  discrepancies  in  control  samples.  Three reject  and  pulp  duplicates  were  also  analysed.  Molybdenum  analysis  was  determined  as MoS2 (%) and total Mo by atomic absorption, with a minimum detection limit of &lt;0.001% MoS2. Tungsten analysis was determined as WO3 (%), colourmetrically with a minimum detection limit of &lt;0.01% WO3.

No further  laboratory,  sample  preparation,  analytical  or  QAQC  is  available  for  the  Amax drilling campaigns.

## 12.1.2 NDU Resources Sample Preparation in 1993

Half core samples from both drill holes drilled as part of the 1993 drilling program were sent to the ALS Chemex Laboratories in Vancouver. Samples were assayed for Au, Cu, W and geochemically analysed for a further 32 elements using the ICP technique. No additional information is available.

## 12.2  Largo Sample Preparation, Analyses and Security - 2006, 2007 and 2008

Sample preparation, analyses and security procedures used by Largo are not significantly different  between  the  2006,  2007  and  2008  drilling  programs  and  are  discussed  in  one section in this report.

Core samples were stored in the core shed until the batch was ready for transport to the assay  laboratory.  Samples  were  then  transported  by  truck  to  Whitehorse  and  then couriered  by  bus  to  Acme  Laboratories  Ltd  (Acme  Laboratories)  in  Vancouver.  Sample preparation (drying,  crushing,  splitting  and  pulverization)  and  analysis  were  conducted  at Acme Laboratories.

Acme  Laboratories  operates  a  Quality  Management  System  which  complies  with  the requirements of BS EN ISO 9001:2000.

Molybdenum (Mo) and tungsten (W) were analysed by both Aqua Regia digestion with an ICP-OES finish (G1DX) and phosphoric acid leach with an ICP-OES finish (G7KP) at Acme Laboratories. Additional elements analysed for by the G1DX method include: Cu, Pb, Zn, Ag, Ni, Co, Mn, Fe, As, U, Au, Th, Sr, Cd, Sb, Bi, V, Ca, P, La, Cr, Mg, Ba, Ti, B, Al, Na, K,

Hg, Sc, Tl, S, Ga, and Se. Fluorine was added to the list of elements to be analysed at Acme during the 2007 drilling program. The G7KP technique is more suitable for elevated molybdenum and tungsten values and provides a more complete digestion of tungsten into solution relative to the G1DX technique (the G1DX technique does not report molybdenum values greater than 0.2% and tungsten values greater than 0.01%). Largo elected to use the molybdenum and tungsten data derived from the G7KP technique for Mineral Resource estimation.  The  lower  limits  of  detection  for  molybdenum  and  tungsten  are  0.001%  and 0.01%, respectively, using the G7KP technique. All assay results were reported as W% and Mo% and were later converted by Largo to WO3% (by multiplying W by 1.2611) and MoS2 % (by multiplying Mo by 1.6681).

All quarter-core field duplicate samples collected as part of the QA/QC protocol for the 2006 drilling program were submitted to SGS Lakefield Research Ltd (SGS Lakefield) in Ontario. SGS Lakefield operate a Quality Management System that meets ISO 9001 and ISO 17025 requirements. Mo was analysed by Aqua Regia digestion with an ICP-OES finish (Method 9-4-41) and W was analysed by Internal Standard XRF (Method 9-6-2) at SGS Lakefield. No other elements were requested to be analysed for in the field duplicates. All quarter-core field duplicate samples collected as part of Largo's 2007 and 2008 drilling programs were submitted to Acme Laboratories.

## 12.2.1 Quality control measures

Prior  to  the  sampling  program,  a  quality  assurance  and  quality  control  (QA/QC)  protocol was  designed  in  conjunction  with  Snowden.  Largo's  QA/QC  information  focuses  on molybdenum and tungsten, the two elements of most economic significance to the Northern Dancer Deposit. Only G7KP molybdenum and tungsten data from Acme Laboratories, in conjunction  with  the  assay  data  determined  at  SGS  Lakefield  for  the  field  duplicates collected during the 2006 drilling program, was assessed for QA/QC purposes as only this data was used in Mineral Resource estimation.

In  addition  to  QA/QC  controls  submitted  by  the  operators,  Acme  Laboratories  and  SGS Lakefield conducted its own internal quality control analyses.

## Standards

Accuracy is a measure of how close an analytical result is to the actual value. Accuracy is measured by analyzing certified standard reference material, material for which the actual value of the variable of interest (tungsten and molybdenum in this case) is reliably known within a quantified narrow range of error. Standards included in the sample stream, prior to submission  to  the  laboratory,  make  the  expected  value  blind  to  the  laboratory  ('external standards'), even though the laboratory will inevitably know that the sample is a standard of some sort. By comparing the results of a laboratory's analysis of a standard to its certified value, the accuracy of the assay results of the laboratory is measured.

In 2006, two Canmet standards, BH-1 and MP-2, were used as field standards (see Table 12.1).Standard BH-1 was a wolframite tungsten standard, standard MP-2 was a wolframitemolybdenite  tungsten-molybdenum  standard.  Field  standards  were  randomly  selected, inserted  into  the  sample  stream  at  a  frequency  of  approximately  1  in  20  samples,  and submitted blind to the analytical laboratory.

Table 12.1 Density by Rock Type (Density Measurements from 2007 and 2008)

| Canmet  Standard   | Certified Value (Mo %)   | Mo 95% c.l.*   |   Certified Value (W%) |   W 95% c.I.* |
|--------------------|--------------------------|----------------|------------------------|---------------|
| BH-1               | n/a                      | n/a            |                  0.422 |         0.008 |
| MP-2               | 0.281                    | 0.01           |                  0.65  |         0.02  |

*Note: c.l. = confidence limits

In 2007and 2008, two different Standards, CDN-W-1 and CDN-MoS-1 from CDN Resource Laboratories Ltd (CDN), were used as field standards (see Table 12.2). Standard CDN-W-1 is  a  tungsten  ore  reference  standard  that  was  prepared  from  underground  workings  at North America Tungsten's Cantung mine in the Northwest Territories, Canada. It is high in sulphide  consisting  primarily  of  pyrite  containing  chalcopyrite.  The  tungsten  occurs  as scheelite.

Standard CDN-MoS-1 is a molybdenum ore reference standard that was prepared using mill feed material supplied by Thompson Creek Mining Company from its Endako Mine in British Columbia, Canada. The ore has been named Endako Quartz Monzonite consisting typically of 30% quartz, 35% pink tinged K-feldspar, 30% white to green tinged plagioclase with 5% partially chloritized black biotite. Primary ore minerals are molybdenite, pyrite and magnetite with minor amounts of chalcopyrite and traces of bornite, bismuthinite, scheelite and specularite.

Details  of  the  preparation  and  certification  of  these  standards  can  be  found  on  CDN's website (http://www.cdnlabs.com/Standards.htm).

Field  standards  (in  2007  and  2008)  were  randomly  selected,  inserted  into  the  sample stream  at  a  frequency  of  approximately  1  in  30  samples,  and  submitted  blind  to  the analytical laboratory.

Table 12.2 Density by Rock Type (Density Measurements from 2007 and 2008)

| CDN Standard   | Certified Value (Mo %)   | Mo 95% c.l.*   | Certified Value (W%)   | W 95% c.I.*   |
|----------------|--------------------------|----------------|------------------------|---------------|
| CDN-W-1        | n/a                      | n/a            | 1.04                   | ± 0.10        |
| CDN-MoS-1      | 0.065                    | ± 0.008        | n/a                    | n/a           |

*Note: c.l. = confidence limits

## Blanks

Cross-contamination  of  tungsten  and/or  molybdenum  could  occur  through  a  variety  of means during the sample handling process. The degree of contamination in a laboratory can  be  measured  through  the  insertion  of  blank  samples  into  sample  batches.  Blank samples contain only trace tungsten and molybdenum mineralization and should assay at or below the laboratory detection limit for these metals. If a blank sample has an analytical result significantly above the detection limit, contamination may be the cause.

Largo inserted 119 field blanks at a frequency of approximately one in 20 samples in 2006 drilling, 265 field blanks at a frequency of one in 30 samples in 2007 drilling and 196 field blanks, at a frequency of one in 30 samples in 2008 drilling . The blanks were made from landscaper's marble. Tests were conducted at Acme Laboratories prior to the start of the

2006  drilling  program  to  confirm  the  absence  of  molybdenum  and  tungsten  from  this material.

## Duplicates

Field duplicates as quarter core samples were inserted at a frequency of approximately one in 20 samples in 2006 and one in 30 samples in 2007 and 2008. Samples were analysed at SGS Lakefield in 2006 and at the Acme Laboratories in 2007 and 2008. 103 field duplicates were analysed in 2006, 265 in 2007 and 192 in 2008.

Analyses  of  coarse,  crushed  sample  reject  material  were  performed  at  a  frequency  of approximately one in 36 samples, at random intervals, always directly following the original sample.  A  total  of  73  coarse  reject  duplicates  were  analysed  in  2006  with  116  being analysed in 2007 and 179 being analysed in 2008.

Pulp  duplicate  analyses  were  performed  at  a  frequency  of  approximately  one  in  36 samples,  at  random  intervals  at  the  time  of  original  analysis,  following  coarse  reject analysis. A total of 73 pulp duplicates were analysed in 2006, 191 were analysed in 2007 and 222 were analysed in 2008.

## 12.2.2 Security and chain-of-custody

Core samples were sealed into sample bags on site and stored in the core shed until the batch was ready for transport to the assay laboratory. The samples were then transported by  truck  to  Whitehorse  and  then  couriered  (by  Greyhound  bus)  to  Acme  Laboratories  in Vancouver.

Sample preparation and analysis was conducted by the independent analytical laboratory. Sealed sample bags were only opened by technicians at the analytical laboratory. Largo is unaware of any sample bags that have been tampered with.

The samples were under the control of Archer Cathro in 2006 and Largo in 2007 and 2008 until they reached Whitehorse, where after they were in the custody of an independent third party transportation company (Greyhound in 2006, Byers Transport in 2007 and 2008) until they  reached  Vancouver  where  they  were  in  the  custody  of  the  independent  analytical laboratory  (Acme  Laboratories).  Largo  keeps  and  updates  an  electronic  record  of  the sampling, sample handling and transportation chain-of-custody.

## 12.3  Statement  on  the  Adequacy  of  Sample  Preparation,  Security,  and  Analytical Procedures

The author believes that  the  QA/QC  sampling  protocol  indicated  above  is  appropriate  to ensure  assay  and  density  data  quality  and  that  the  chain  of  custody  description  is  of industry standard.

## 13 DATA VERIFICATION

## 13.1  Verification by Largo

## 13.1.1 Verification of Historical Records

Most historical exploration data presented in this report, including all drilling data used for historical Resource estimations, was collected by a reputable engineering firm on behalf of a  major  molybdenum  producer.  The  results  are  mostly  recorded  in  reports  that  were accepted  for  assessment  credit  to  standards  specified  at  the  time  by  the  Yukon  Quartz Mining Act or the British Columbia Ministry of Energy and Mines regulations, which differ from those currently prescribed by NI 43-101. In addition, these assessment reports were submitted prior to current requirements for complete data records, including certificates of analysis and other documentation that would permit the author to verify the accuracy and internal consistency of all results presented.

Largo had access to raw data generated by Archer Cathro on behalf of its various clients since  1993 and has indicated its  opinion  that  the  data  contained  in  the  historical  reports appears to be valid and reliable.

The following validation checks were undertaken by Largo:

- · Where  available,  re-examination  of  original  analytical  certificates  and  geological  drill hole logs.
- · The range of values reported from various programs conducted on the Northern Dancer property  were  compared  for  internal  consistency  and  were  also  compared  to  results from  other  known  tungsten,  molybdenum,  and  beryllium  prospects  that  have  been reported in the literature.

The verification procedures undertaken in connection with this assignment were intended to assess  whether  inadvertent  errors  may  have  occurred  through  sample  handling  and analytical procedures.

## 13.1.2 Twin Drill Hole Drilling Verification by Largo - 2006

To verify the accuracy of historic drilling eight new drill holes were drilled alongside historic drill holes, with similar dips, azimuths, and depths. Two drill holes were twinned from each year of the historic drill program (1977, 1978, 1979, and 1980), spaced around the property.

The  inherent  geological  variability  (nugget  effect)  and  differences  in  analytical  methods, core  size,  recovery  and  diversion  of  drill  holes,  all  of  which  influence  the  comparison  of different  generations  of  drill  hole  data,  have  been  taken  into  consideration  as  part  of  the interpretation of the twin drilling results presented in this report.

Overall  the  results  of  the  2006  program  twin  drill  hole  analysis  confirmed  the  grades reported in the historic drill holes, taking inherent geological variability between drill holes, different generations of drilling techniques, assay methods, and laboratory conditions and sample support into account. The results indicated that the historic drilling data could be

used in conjunction with more recent quality drilling data in the generation of an Inferred Mineral Resource compliant with NI 43-101 (Snowden, 2007a).

## 13.1.3 Other Data Verification Conducted by Largo

Largo conducted various checks as part of the 2007 and 2008 drilling programs including:

- · Ensuring  that  drill  hole  collars  were  correctly  located  using  GPS,  maps  and  spatial relationship to existing drill holes.
- · Continual  cleanliness  checks  of  the  core  saw  between  each  sample,  in  particular between samples with visible molybdenite mineralization.
- · Validation  of  official  assay  certificates  against  digital  assay  data  files  supplied  by  the analytical laboratory.
- · Verification and validation of assay data accuracy using field standard control samples.
- · Assessment  of  potential  cross-contamination  in  the  analytical  laboratory  using  field blank control samples.
- · Verification of density data through a review of laboratory QAQC data.
- · Verification of compiled database integrity.

## 13.2  Verification by Snowden

## 13.2.1 2006 Drilling Program

## Site Visit

Dr. Warwick Board, then of Snowden in Vancouver, visited the Northern Dancer property between  5  July  and  7  July,  2006.  At  the  time  of  Dr.  Board's  visit  there  was  an  active diamond drilling program in progress. Dr. Board reviewed the following during the site visit:

- · Mineralization styles - Snowden visually inspected drill core displaying representative intersections  through  the  different  styles  of  mineralization  reported  for  the  Northern Dancer deposit. Molybdenite and scheelite mineralization was clearly visible in the core and displayed  mineralogical  associations  in  line  with  those  portrayed  in  the  literature (e.g., Noble et al., 1984)
- · Drill hole locations - Snowden considered that adequate measures had been taken to ensure that the drill holes were accurately located. Drill hole collars had, however, not been surveyed at the time of the site visit.
- · Drilling  technique  and  core  extraction  -  Snowden  observed  core  extraction  and  core box loading at the drill rig and did not note any issues.
- · Downhole surveying - Snowden reviewed the downhole deviation plots for several of the  drill  holes  completed  at  the  time  of  the  site  visit  and  did  not  note  any  significant erroneous deviations. Snowden considered the downhole survey information (available at that stage) to be of acceptable quality.
- · Core  recovery  -  Snowden  conducted  a  visual  inspection  of  several  core  boxes  from several drill holes and noted that recoveries were generally greater than 90-95%.

- · Geotechnical  logging procedures  -  Snowden  reviewed  the  geotechnical  logging procedures  on  site  and  was  of  the  opinion  that  they  were  of  acceptable  industry standard.
- · Geological  logging  procedures  -  Snowden  reviewed  and  discussed  the  geological logging process with several geologists responsible for logging core on site and found the nature and quality of the recorded information to be pertinent to deposit delineation and evaluation, and that the geological logging was of industry standard.
- · Density  measurements  -  Snowden  reviewed  the  site-based  density  measurement procedure and considered it as being acceptable due to the general competency of the rock.
- · Field QA/QC sampling - Snowden checked that the QA/QC protocol designed prior to the 2006 drilling program was being implemented as planned.

Snowden made several recommendations on improvements to future drilling programs but was  of  the  overall  opinion  was  that  all  aspects  of  the  collection  of  geological  and geotechnical data as part of the 2006 drilling program were of acceptable industry standard to facilitate the production of suitable quality data for Mineral Resource estimation.

## QA/QC of Assay Data

Snowden  conducted  a  detailed  QA/QC  of  the  assay  data  available  from  Largo's  2006 drilling program (Snowden, 2007b).

Snowden  made  recommendations  for  improvement  relative  to  W  accuracy  and  general improvement  in  protocols  for  future  drilling  programs  but  concluded  that  the  Mo  and  W assay  data  generated  during  the  2006  drilling  campaign  were  sufficiently  accurate  and precise,  with  no  evidence  of  significant  cross-contamination  in  the  sampling  and  sample preparation protocols, and that they were suitable for use in the generation of a resource estimate for use in a Preliminary Assessment of the Northern Dancer deposit.

## Historic Assay Data Quality pre-2006 Drilling Programs

Snowden conducted a detailed review of the results of the twin drill hole drilling conducted by Largo (Snowden, 2007b) and concluded that the historic drill hole data were of sufficient quality for use in the generation of a resource estimate for use in a Preliminary Assessment of the Northern Dancer deposit. Recommendations were made by Snowden for conducting a detailed reassessment of the historic drilling information and for investigating the limited evidence  suggesting  the  possibility  that  tungsten  could  have  been  over  reported  in  the historic data.

## 13.2.2 2007 Drilling Program

## Downhole Survey Data

Snowden conducted an independent check of the downhole survey data and noted that, overall, deviations down the drill hole appeared to be within acceptable limits.

Recommendation was made by Snowden to gather more downhole survey data to facilitate the definition of downhole survey deviations; this was noted as not being a material issue at the  Preliminary  Assessment level  but  one  that  would  be  of  increasing  importance  as  the study progresses to a Preliminary Feasibility Study stage. Further recommendations were made re collection of magnetic susceptibility data and surveying of a selection of drill holes using a non-magnetic  downhole  survey  tool,  together with investigation of several anomalous downhole survey data.

## Assay QA/QC data

Snowden conducted an independent check of Largo's field standard, field blank and field duplicate  control  sample  data,  as  well  as  Acme  Laboratories'  coarse  reject  and  pulp duplicate  data.  No  laboratory  standard  and  blank  control  sample  data  were  provided  to Snowden, thereby precluding an analysis of this data.

Overall  Snowden  considered  that  the  Mo  and  W  assay  data  generated  during  the  2007 drilling  campaign  were  sufficiently  accurate  and  precise,  with  no  evidence  of  significant cross-contamination in the sampling and sample preparation protocols, and that they were suitable for use in the generation of a Mineral Resource estimate for use in a Preliminary Assessment of the Northern Dancer deposit.

Observations by Snowden relative to the independent check included a recommendation to investigate  elevated  tungsten  values  for  two  field  blank  samples,  a  note  re  two  samples labelled  as  field  standard  CDN-MoS-1  appearing  to  be  mislabelled  field  blanks,  and observation that, overall, the majority of the assays determined for the CDN-MoS-1 and the CDN-W-1 field standard control samples submitted during the 2007 drilling program were within  acceptable  limits.  Recommendation  was  made  for  a  review  of  the  accuracy  in molybdenum  assay  data  and  a  check  of  several  anomalous  data  values  with  Acme Laboratories.  Overall,  the  degree  of  precision  for  the  field  and  pulp  duplicates  was considered to be acceptable for the current level of study. Recommendation was made for a detailed review of the 2007 duplicate QA/QC data and discussion of the results with Acme Laboratories to improve confidence in the precision of its tungsten and molybdenum data as the study moves beyond the PEA level.  Snowden also recommended the creation and maintenance of a separate QA/QC database populated with all field and laboratory control sample data. A final recommendation was to conduct 'real-time' QA/QC assessments of all field and  laboratory  control  sample  data  in  future  drill  programs  to  facilitate  timely intervention and remediation of any identified problems.

## 13.2.3 2008 Drilling Program

- · Dr Warwick S. Board, then of Snowden, visited the Northern Dancer property between 21 and 22 August 2008 and conducted the following data verification assessments of Largo's 2008 drilling program, which was in operation during the visit.
- · Observation of the entire exploration drilling process was made, from drilling, through core  collection,  handling,  logging,  sample  selection,  sampling,  sample  preparation, sample  chain-of-custody  and  sample  despatch.  Snowden  also  inspected  all  relevant rock outcrop along the ridge line across which the deposit is straddled.

- · Independent checks were conducted on 33 drill hole collar locations (22 collar locations from the 2008 drilling program, nine from the 2007 drilling program and two from the 2006 drilling program) using a handheld GPS unit. No discrepancies were noted.
- · Independent checks were conducted on Largo's 2008 downhole survey data, with some similar observations being made to those of the 2007 assessment. Snowden noted that the drill hole traces were smooth, with minimal deviation in dip and azimuth down drill hole. The few errant readings were generally inside the casing near the drill hole collar. Snowden also noted that downhole survey data were collected every 25 to 30 meters downhole and recommended that, for future drilling programs, this be done every 15 meters.  The  recommendation  arose  from  the  presence  of  pyrrhotite  in  some  of  the samples, which indicated the possibility of localized magnetic disturbances that could affect the downhole survey data. Snowden recommended that Largo collect magnetic susceptibility data with each EZ-Shot® survey measurement to assess the potential for erroneous readings due to the presence of magnetic material. Snowden  also recommended that, for future programs, Largo survey a selection of drill holes using a non-magnetic downhole survey tool (e.g., a Robertson or SRG borehole gyroscope) in addition  to  the  EZ-Shot®  tool  as  an  additional  check  on  the  quality  of  the  downhole survey data, particularly in those drill holes for which anomalous magnetic susceptibility readings  were  obtained.  Snowden  observed  that,  overall,  the  downhole  survey  data appeared to be of acceptable quality for use in mineral resource estimation.
- · Five  independent  samples  of  selected  drill  hole  intersections  were  collected  and independently arranged for sample transportation, preparation and analysis at the ALS Chemex  laboratory  in  Vancouver.  Results  of  the  independent  sample  analyses  are presented in Table 13.1. It can be seen from these results that, taking differences in sample support (half core for Largo samples versus quarter core for Snowden samples) and analytical laboratories, as well as the inherent variability in the mineralization within the deposit (the nugget effect) into account, the magnitude of WO3 and Mo grades in Largo's samples are matched in the independent samples.

Snowden  conducted  a  detailed  review  of  Largo's  2008  QA/QC  data  and  noted  that  the drilling data from this program are sufficiently accurate, precise and uncontaminated to be used  with  confidence  in  mineral  resource  modelling,  and  that  they  could  support  a Measured classification for part of the deposit. Snowden also noted that there appeared to

be a few minor sample mislabelling errors (in particular related to sample standards and blanks) that should be corrected in the QA/QC database.

Snowden reviewed Largo's geological interpretation for the Northern Dancer deposit and considered it to be reasonable. A parallel resource model was generated by Snowden using Datamine Studio 2 and the reported grades and tonnes were comparable to an acceptable degree to those generated by Largo.

## 13.3  Verification Not Conducted by Snowden

Snowden  did  not  verify  the  following  aspects  of  Largo's  2006,  2007  and  2008  drilling programs:

- · A  site  visit  was  not  made  during  Largo's  2007  drilling  program.  Snowden  mining engineers  were,  however,  on  site  during  this  program  and  noted  that  Largo's  drilling operations were being conducted in accordance with industry accepted practices.
- · Collar location survey data quality - the survey contractors used were considered to be professional organisations and, as such, were expected to provide data of acceptable quality.  The  results  of  the  independent  drill  hole  collar  checks  conducted  during  the August 2008 site visit support this contention.
- · Snowden did not carry out independent exploration work, drill any drill holes, or carry out any significant program of independent sampling or assaying, except for the limited independent sampling presented in Section 13.2.2. Molybdenite and scheelite mineralization  were  noted  to  be  obvious  in  many  parts  of  the  drill  core  and  the molybdenum and tungsten grade data from Largo's drilling programs were seen to be of similar magnitude and display similar trends to those of the historic drilling conducted by previous operators. Snowden was therefore of the opinion that an extensive program of independent sampling and assaying was not required.
- · Snowden did not independently check assay data in Largo's assay database against the hardcopy assay certificates provided by the laboratory.

## 13.4  Statements Regarding Verification

The author is of the opinion that the data used by Largo for the generation of the March 2009  Mineral  Resource  is  of  acceptable  quality  to  support  a  Measured,  Indicated  and Inferred classification for the Northern Dancer Mineral Resource estimate. The author also considers that, as the project moves beyond the PEA stage with the aim of upgrading the majority of the Mineral Resource to the Measured and Indicated categories, resolution of issues associated with the 2007 assay and downhole survey data should be undertaken as per the recommendations noted above.

## 15 MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING

## 15.1  Introduction

In addition to the historical metallurgical testing conducted by AMAX Inc. in the late 1970's and early 1980's, Largo completed scoping and preliminary level metallurgical testing on samples from the ND property during 2008 through to 2010.

## 15.2  Metallurgical Testing and Mineralogy

The 2008 metallurgical testing was a scoping level program and was conducted by SGS Lakefield in Ontario.  The testwork used three batches of samples including crushed assay rejects  and  drill  core  splits.  The  test  program  focused  on  mineralogy  including  modal analyses, gravity separation, sulphide and scheelite flotation as well as pre-concentration. The head grades for these samples ranged between 0.12-0.03% WO3 and 0.09-0.02% Mo.

Gravity  separation  test  results  on  these  samples  indicated  that  medium  grade  tungsten concentrates could be produced at recoveries acceptable in the industry.  Scheelite flotation tests  indicated that high stage tungsten recoveries could be achieved using conventional reagents at medium fine grinds. A limited number of moly flotation tests on assay rejects and  drill  core  samples  indicated  that  relatively  high  Mo  rougher  recoveries  could  be obtained using conventional reagents and at medium to medium-fine primary grind sizes. Pre-concentration  tests  using  ore  sorting  and  heavy  liquid  separation  showed  varying degrees of promise. Ore sorting showed the highest success rate while heavy liquid test results pointed toward the use of lower specific gravity medium in the next phase of testing.

The 2010 preliminary metallurgical testing program was conducted by Inspectorate Mining &amp;  Services  in  Richmond,  BC.  Nearly  3  tonnes  of  drill  core  samples,  reported  to  be representative of the high grade skarn, hornfels and QFP rock types, were used to prepare a single composite test sample. This composite sample assayed 0.094% WO3, 0.033% Mo and 0.76% S(t). The objective of the testwork was to provide sufficient information to assist in  future  process  development  test  programs,  and  it  incorporated  mineralogy,  moly  and scheelite flotation, scheelite gravity separation and pre-concentration tests.

Moly  and  scheelite  rougher  flotation  tests  in  this  program  confirmed  and  in  some  cases exceeded previously achieved metal recoveries. Scheelite gravity separation tests produced marketable grade concentrates at moderate recoveries. Results of the preliminary ore sorting tests using 25 mm size rocks continued to show potential for rejection of low grade waste from the feed materials. Testing for ammonium paratungstate conversion of tungsten concentrates will be tested in future test programs.

Collectively,  the  results  from  these  tests  led  to  the  development  of  conceptual  process flowsheets as presented in this section.

## 15.3  Mineralogy

Modal  analyses  using  the  QemScan  technique  mineralogy  on  the  high-tungsten  and  himoly samples from the 2008 test program showed that scheelite and molybdenite were the only minerals of tungsten and molybdenum respectively. Wolframite was not detected in the

investigation.  The  high-tungsten  sample  contained  significant  levels  of  calcium  minerals such as wollastonite, fluorite and apatite while the same were in low-to-trace amounts in the high-moly sample. Silicate minerals constituted the majority of mass in both samples and iron  sulphide  minerals  such  as  pyrite  and  pyrrhotite  were  less  than  2.5%  in  the  hightungsten sample and less than 1% in the high-moly sample. Liberation data demonstrated that  scheelite  liberation  reaches  +50%  levels  in  the  150  µm  size  range  in  both  samples investigated. However, molybdenite liberation reaches nearly 60% level in the 300 µm size range in the high-tungsten sample while the same liberation levels are reached in the 38 µm size range in the high-moly sample.

Optical  mineralogy  on  the  composite  sample  from  the  2010  test  program  showed  that scheelite is the primary tungsten mineral however, trace amounts of wolframite were also observed. Molybdenite was observed to be the only molybdenum mineral. Silicate minerals accounted  for  &gt;98%  of  the  sample  mass  along  with  minor  amounts  of  iron  sulphides including pyrite.

## 15.4  Description of Process Developed

In  the  process  conceptualized  for  Northern  Dancer  the  run  of  mine  feed  materials  are crushed and sized to prepare size ranges suitable for ore sorting. The low grade waste is removed into a reject stockpile for future processing, use in dam and/or road building as appropriate. The resulting upgraded product from the sorting are further crushed to prepare feed for the process plant. Following grinding to a size suitable for liberation of the minerals of interest, the feed materials are subjected to molybdenite and sulphide flotation including their regrind and cleaner circuits.

Rougher tailings from the moly/sulphide flotation circuit are sent to the scheelite flotation circuit for the recovery of a medium grade scheelite flotation concentrate. Both concentrates are  dewatered  in  their  respective  circuits  and  the  moly  concentrate  is  filtered  and  dried before  shipment  to  markets.  The  scheelite  concentrate,  after  thickening,  is  sent  to  the ammonium  paratungstate  (APT)  plant  for  conversion  into  a  direct  marketable  product. Figure 15.1 shows the main steps of this conceptualized process.

Figure 15.1 Conceptualized Process Diagram (From M. Bolu Engineering Inc.)

<!-- image -->

A brief description of each major process circuit is provided below.

Crushing  and  Ore  Sorting : Feed  material  from  the  open  pit  mine  is  crushed  to nominal 75-mm and is screened to suitable size ranges for ore sorting. Ore sorting is predicted to reduce overall throughput from 11.2 M t/a to 7.3 M t/a rate through the separation of a low grade reject stream from the feed materials. The concentrate and a  fines  product  are  further  crushed  to  prepare  feed  for  the  downstream  grinding circuit.

Grinding: The  crushed  feed  materials  are  ground  to  a  liberation  size  suitable  for optimum rougher flotation recovery of minerals of interest such as molybdenite and scheelite.  Rod  mills  and  screens  are  proposed  for  this  circuit  in  order  to  mitigate slimes  generation  and  the  resulting  scheelite  losses  in  the  downstream  flotation circuits.  Final  ground  product  is  thickened  to  a  density  suitable  for  the  subsequent moly flotation circuit.

Molybdenum and Bulk Sulphide Flotation: The  ground  and  thickened  product  is sent to moly rougher flotation and the resulting rougher concentrate is reground and cleaned in a multi cleaner stage flotation circuit to produce a marketable grade moly product.  Fine  grind  mills  and  column  flotation  cells  are  considered  for  the  cleaner circuit  while  the  rougher circuit is expected to employ tank cells. Moly concentrates are dewatered and dried before packaging for the markets. Moly rougher tailings are

sent  to  a  bulk  sulphide  flotation  circuit  to  remove  additional  sulphides  ahead  of scheelite  flotation,  and  the  bulk  sulphide  concentrate  is  sent  to  the  tailings  storage facility for disposal. Bulk sulphide tailings continue to scheelite flotation circuit.

Tungsten  Flotation: Bulk  sulphide  tailings  are  conditioned  with  the  appropriate reagents  through  stages  of  conditioning  ahead  of  scheelite  rougher-scavenger flotation. Rougher concentrate is sent to cleaner flotation while scavenger concentrate is recycled to the rougher feed, through a regrind circuit. Cleaner flotation will utilize column  cells  in  producing  a  medium  grade  concentrate  for  the  downstream  APT conversion. Tungsten concentrate is thickened and stored for the downstream APT conversion at site.

APT Plant: The proposed process for converting tungsten concentrates to ammonium  paratungstate  (APT)  is  based  on  alkali  digestion  method.  Tungsten concentrates from the process plant are digested in autoclaves at high temperature and  pressure  with  alkali reagents.  The  resulting sodium  tungstate  solution  is recovered from the gangue residue. The residue is sent to the tailings storage facility for  disposal  while  the  concentrated  sodium  tungstate  solution  is  treated  through various purification steps to remove compounds of such impurities as; As, P, Si, and Mo.  Sodium  tungstate  solution  is  converted  to  ammonium  tungstate  which  is  then crystallized to produce APT for markets. All waste products will be sent to engineered ponds within the tailings storage facility for storage.

Tailings disposal and Fresh Water Supply: Process  tailing  streams  such  as  the bulk sulphide concentrate and tungsten flotation tailings are sent to the tailings pond for disposal. Tailings supernatant water will be recycled to the mill as process makeup  water.  Residues  and  waste  products  from  the  APT  plant  are  also  sent  to  the tailings  pond  or  engineered  and  dedicated  storage  ponds  for  disposal  as  required. Fresh water source for potable, reagent mixing and other process make-up purposes is envisaged to be obtained from surrounding rivers.

## 15.5  Process Throughput, Metallurgy and Production

The  following  metallurgical  predictions  are  based  on  results  of  preliminary  testwork conducted on Northern Dancer samples and on previous experience on similar projects.

The throughput for the proposed plant is 11.2M t/a ROM feed material at average ROM feed  grades  of  0.095%  WO3  and  0.031%  Mo.  A  summary  of  metallurgical  predictions  is provided in Table 15.1.

## Table 15.1 Metallurgical Predictions

| Plant Feed                           |
|--------------------------------------|
| 0.095 %WO3                           |
| 0.031 %Mo                            |
| 11,242,000 t/a                       |
| Process Feed after Ore Sorting       |
| 0.137% WO3                           |
| 0.041% Mo                            |
| 7,300,000 t/a                        |
| Process Plant Concentrate Production |
| Tungsten: 75% at 40% WO3             |
| Moly: 72% at 50% Mo; 5.5M Lbs/a      |
| APT Plant Recovery and Production    |
| 95% Tungsten Recovery                |
| 761,000 mtu WO3                      |

Through crushing and ore sorting the throughput rate is reduced to 7.3 M t/a after low grade material is separated within the ore sorting circuit. The process plant, starting from grinding and  through  to  downstream  circuits  treats  7.3M  t/a  of  feed  material.  Overall  metal recoveries to concentrates are predicted at 75% for tungsten and 72% for molybdenum at concentrate grades of +40% WO3 and +50% Mo respectively. APT conversion recovery is predicted at 95% on concentrates treated, resulting in an annual production of 761,000 mtu of WO3.  Moly  production  is  estimated  at  5.5M  Lbs  per  annum  of  contained  Mo  in concentrates.

## 16 MINERAL RESOURCE AND MINERAL RESERVE ESTIMATES

The Northern Dancer Mineral Resource estimate was prepared by Largo. Dr. Warwick S. Board, P. Geo., Principal Consultant with Snowden in 2009, independently reviewed and verified  the  estimate  (March  2009  Northern  Dancer  Mineral  Resource  Estimate)  and assumes responsibility for it in the Technical Report.

All statistical and geostatistical analyses presented in this section are focused on tungsten and molybdenum as they are the most economically important constituents of the Northern Dancer deposit. Tungsten and molybdenum grade data were converted to WO3 and MoS2 for resource estimation purposes.

It is  recommended  that  further  study  and  possible  estimation  of  fluorine  (as  CaF2)  is performed due to its possible deleterious effect on metallurgical recovery of tungsten.

## 16.1  Disclosure

## 16.1.1 Important Information

It is important to note the following when considering the Mineral Resource estimates in this Technical Report.

Mineral  Resources  that  are  not  Mineral  Reserves  do  not  have  demonstrated  economic viability.

- · A Measured mineral resource (CIM, 2005) is that part of a mineral resource for which quantity,  grade  or  quality,  densities,  shape,  and  physical  characteristics  are  so  well established that they can  be estimated with confidence sufficient to allow the appropriate  application  of  technical  and  economic  parameters,  to  support  production planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit. The estimate is based on detailed and reliable exploration, sampling and testing information gathered through appropriate  techniques  from  locations  such  as  outcrops,  trenches,  pits,  workings  and drill holes  that  are  spaced  closely  enough  to  confirm  both  geological  and  grade continuity. This classification requires a high level of confidence in, and understanding of, the geology and controls of the mineral deposit.
- · An Indicated mineral resource (CIM, 2005) is that part of a mineral resource for which quantity, grade  or  quality, densities, shape,  and  physical  characteristics  can  be estimated  with  a  level  of  confidence  sufficient  to  allow  the  appropriate  application  of technical  and  economic  parameters,  to  support  mine  planning  and  evaluation  of  the economic  viability  of  the  deposit.  The  estimate  is  based  on  detailed  and  reliable exploration  and  testing  information  gathered  through  appropriate  techniques  from locations  such  as  outcrops,  trenches,  pits,  workings  and  drill  holes  that  are  spaced closely  enough  for  geological  and  grade  continuity  to  be  reasonably  assumed.  An Indicated  mineral  resource  estimate  is  of  sufficient  quality  to  support  a  preliminary feasibility study.
- · An Inferred mineral resource (CIM, 2005) is that part of a mineral resource for which quantity and grade or quality can be estimated on the basis of geological evidence and limited  sampling  and  reasonably  assumed,  but  not  verified,  geological  and  grade continuity. The estimate is based on limited information and sampling gathered through

appropriate  techniques  from  locations  such  as  outcrops,  trenches,  pits,  workings  and drill  holes.  Confidence in an Inferred mineral resource estimate is insufficient to allow the  meaningful  application  of  technical  and  economic  parameters  or  to  enable  an evaluation of economic viability worthy of public disclosure. Inferred mineral resources must  be  excluded  from  estimates  forming  the  basis  of  feasibility  or  other  economic studies.

- · 0.06% WO3 was considered as being a likely cut-off grade for this deposit for the 2009 Resource Estimate that is described herein. With current economic inputs (2011) a cutoff grade of 0.04% WO3 has been established for pit design purposes.

The Mineral Resource presented in this report was estimated using the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy, and  Petroleum  (CIM)  Standards  on  Mineral Resources  and Reserves, Definitions and Guidelines prepared by the CIM Standing Committee on Reserve Definitions and adopted by CIM Council on the 11 December 2005.

## 16.2  Known Issues That Materially Affect Mineral Resources

Snowden and Largo are not aware of any issues that materially affect the Mineral Resource estimates. This conclusion has been based on the following:

- · There are no known environmental liabilities attached to the property
- · Largo has represented that all licenses are in good standing
- · Largo has represented that there are no outstanding legal issues; no legal action, or injunctions pending against the project
- · Largo has represented that the mineral and surface rights have secure title
- · There are no known permitting, marketing, or socio-economic issues
- · Largo has represented the project has government support and does not lie within an area selected as First Nations Settlement Land

## 16.3  Database

The Gemcom mining software database generated for the Northern Dancer deposit during the  2006  drilling  program  was  updated  with  drilling  data  (geological,  survey,  density  and assay  data)  collected  during  the  2007  and  2008  drilling  programs.  The  latest  (as  of February  2009)  Northern  Dancer  Gemcom  database  contains  information  for  134  drill holes, including 53 historic drill holes and 81 drill holes drilled during the 2006, 2007 and 2008 drilling programs.

Eleven of the 53 historical drill holes (drill holes 77-01, 77-02, 77-03, 77-04, 77-13, 77-14, 78-22,  78-29,  78-30,  78-32,  and  93-52)  were  not  used  for  Mineral  Resource  estimation purposes as they were outside of the area of interest. Five drill holes from the 2006, 2007 and 2008 drilling programs were not used in the generation of the current Mineral Resource estimate:  drill  holes  LT06-64,  LT07-88  and  LT07-93  were  abandoned  due  to  ground conditions;  drill  hole  LT07-94  is  a  geotechnical  drill  hole  and  was  not  sampled;  drill  hole LT08-131 was drilled outside of the area of interest.

The final de-surveyed drill hole database used in the generation of the March 2009 Mineral Resource estimate contained 15,795 records. The database was validated with Gemcom's internal  validation  tools  and  double  checked  with  hard  copies  of  original  data.  Snowden imported  survey,  lithology,  density  and  assay  data  into  the  Datamine  Studio  2  mining software  and  independently  conducted  a  series  of  basic  database  validation  tests.  No significant database errors were noted.

## 16.4  Geological Solids and Domain Interpretation

Historical  maps,  including  several  cross-sections  and  two  geological  maps  from  Amax (circa 1970s), were scanned and digitised in AutoCAD, and converted to NAD83 UTM grid coordinates. These drawings were imported into the Gemcom mining software and used as a  reference  guiding  geological  domain  interpretation  and  the  construction  of  a  threedimensional model.

Geological domains were clipped to the recent quality topographical surface, generated as part of the 2006 drilling program.

Seven lithological domains were delineated. Drilling data in the Gemcom Database were coded according to the domain codes presented in Table 16.1. Four of these domains are considered as being mineralized domains. Example sections through the geological model for the Northern Dancer Deposit are presented in Appendix D of the Snowden 2009 report.

Unmineralized  domains  are  treated  as  waste  domains.  However,  due  to  the  nature  of Northern  Dancer  deposit,  weak  mineralization  is  developed  in  drill  hole  intersections  in parts  of  the  unmineralized  diorite  (4100)  and  monzonite  (5000)  domains.  It  was  deemed appropriate  for  mine  planning  purposes  to  assign  the  average  drill  hole  grade  for  the variables of interest as the domain grade for these domains, rather than assign a null or absent grade value to them. The shale and argillite domain occurs outside of the area of interest for resource estimation and mine planning and was therefore not considered in the generation of the March 2009 Mineral Resource model.

The  mineralized  diorite  dyke  domain  (8000),  used  in  previous  resource  models  (e.g., Snowden,  2007a;  2008),  was  critically  reviewed  in  the  generation  of  the  March  2009 Mineral  Resource  model.  It  was  decided,  on  the  basis  of  geostatistical,  geological  and spatial  analyses,  that  this  domain  was  an  unnecessary  complication  and  should  be removed.  Data  coded  as  domain  8000  were  incorporated  into  one  of  the  remaining mineralized domains, based on spatial location (e.g., where the dyke domain intersected the hornfels domain, the data were reassigned a domain code of 1000). The majority of the diorite dyke data were included in the skarn (2000) and hornfels (1000) domains.

Table 16.1 Lithological Domains and Mineralization

| Lithology                       |   Rock code | Mineralization   |
|---------------------------------|-------------|------------------|
| Hornfels                        |        1000 | yes              |
| Skarn                           |        2000 | yes              |
| Mineralized diorite             |        4000 | yes              |
| Unmineralized diorite           |        4100 | no               |
| Quartz-monzonite porphyry (QMP) |        5000 | no               |
| Quartz-feldspar porphyry (QFP)  |        6000 | yes              |
| Shale and argillite             |         900 | no               |

## 16.5  Block Modeling

Block model coordinates were based on the extents of the modelled geological domains, with a lower elevation suitable for pit optimisation. The block model azimuth is rotated 45° counter clockwise.

Block  size  was  set  to  20  mE  by  20  mN  by  20m  elevation  based  on  assumed  open  pit mining  selectivity  requirements  and  drill  hole  spacing.  Kriging  Neighbourhood  Analysis (KNA) testing  was  conducted  on  a  series  of  different  block  sizes  to  assess  the  selected block size. The selected block size is considered as being acceptable for the current drill spacing and level of study. The block model origin (in Gemcom mining software format) is presented in Table 16.2.

## 16.6  Density Assignment

The  average  densities  determined  for  each  rock  type  (see  Section  0)  were  used  in conjunction  with  the  geological  domain  codes  to  assign  density  data  to  the  block  model (see). A total of 263 samples were sent to the Eco Tech Laboratory in Kamloops, B.C. for density testing in 2008. A further 181 samples were tested in the same laboratory facility in 2007 (see Snowden, 2008). An additional 467 density data from the 2006 density testing carried out by Archer Cathro on site, were incorporated into the density database for the purposes of generating lithological density averages.

| Rock Type                       |   Rock Code |   Assigned Density  (t/m3) |
|---------------------------------|-------------|----------------------------|
| Hornfels                        |        1000 |                       2.71 |

| Unmineralized diorite           |        4100 |                       2.72 |
| Quartz-monzonite porphyry (QMP) |        5000 |                       2.61 |
| Quartz-feldspar porphyry (QFP)  |        6000 |                       2.62 |

## 16.7  Compositing of Assay Intervals

Drill hole assay intervals must be composited to maintain consistent sample support during grade estimation. Largo selected a 5 meter composite length such that internal dilution and variance would be appropriate for the selective mining unit and estimation block size. Most assay intervals in historical drill holes were sampled at 4 meter intervals.

Snowden conducted a series of tests to assess different composite lengths and found that a 5 meter composite length was most suitable for the Northern Dancer project.

## 16.8  Top Cuts

Analysis of histograms and log probability plots indicated that top cuts only were necessary for MoS2 in the skarn domain and WO3 in the monzonite domain to minimise local bias in the estimate. A top cut of 0.7% was applied to MoS2 in skarn domain and a top cut of 0.106 %  was  applied  to  WO3 in  the  monzonite  domain.  Top  cuts  were  applied  after  data compositing.  Ideally  top  cuts  should  be  applied  post-compositing  to  minimize  metal  loss through data manipulation. Snowden conducted a series of tests to assess the impact of the application of top cuts pre- and post-compositing and noted no significant differences.

## 16.9  Variogram Analysis

Three  dimensional  grade  continuity  analyses  were  conducted  on  the  gold  data  using Snowden's Supervisor software. Domain-coded, composited sample data were used for the variography. Variogram fans and experimental variograms were generated in normal scoretransformed space. Variograms were modelled in normal score-space and back transformed prior to use in estimation. Nested nugget and spherical models were used to model  the  experimental  variograms.  Back  transformed  variogram  models  were  checked against  untransformed  experimental  variograms,  where  these  could  be  meaningfully generated,  as  a  validation  step.  Variogram  model  parameters  for  WO3  and  MoS2  are presented in Table 16.4 and Table 16.6. Strike orientations for domains 1000 (hornfels), 2000 (skarn) and 4000 (diorite) were modelled using the known geometry of the sheeted veins.  Dip  and  dip  plane  orientations  were  modelled  using  orientations  developed  in  the variogram fans, which were assessed for geological reasonableness. Anisotropy in domain 6000  (quartz-feldspar  porphyry)  was  modelled  with  an  average  northerly  strike  and  a vertical  dip.  Additional  drilling  would  assist  in  refining  the  geological  anisotropy  model  for domain 6000.

## 16.10   Grade Interpolation and Boundary Conditions

MoS2  and  WO3  grades  were  estimated  into  all  domains  using  ordinary  kriging.  Domain boundaries were considered as hard boundaries (i.e., blocks coded as one domain did not use grades from drill holes coded as a different domain). Block discretisation was set to 3 x 3 x 3. An expanding search ellipsoid approach was adopted. The orientation of the search ellipsoid was defined by the orientation of the continuity ellipsoid modelled by variography. The first search ellipse was defined with maximum extents within the range of the variogram for the domain of interest (between two thirds and 90% of the variogram range), ensuring that  the  anisotropy  of  the  continuity  model  was  honoured.  The  second  search  pass  was conducted  at  between  1.5  times  and  two  times  this  initial  range  (depending  on  domain, grade variable and continuity model for that domain) with the third search pass expanded to inform all blocks in the domain.

A  minimum  of  twelve  and  a  maximum  of  25  samples  were  used  to  generate  grade estimates during the first  and  second  search  passes  for  all  domains.  A  maximum  of  five samples  per  drill  hole  was  used  in  the  estimation  of  block  grades  in  domains  4000  and 6000. No such restriction was necessary in the estimation of block grades in the 1000 and 2000 domains. The minimum and maximum number of samples was changed to six and 15, respectively, for the third search pass, the other constraints remaining unchanged.

Kriging efficiency and slope of regression parameters were recorded in the block model for model  validation  purposes.  A  nearest  neighbour  model  was  also  generated  for  model validation purposes.

Largo's  geological  wireframes  were  generated  such  that  there  was  overlap  between  the different domains. As a result of this a precedence approach is required to resolve overlap between  the  different  mineralized  domains.  The  coding  precedence  used  by  Largo  is presented in Table 16.6 (i.e., overlaps between skarn and hornfels would be overprinted by rocks  coded  as  hornfels;  overlaps  between  the  recoded  hornfels  and  mineralized  diorite would  be  overprinted by rocks coded  as  mineralized diorite, etc.). Largo  followed Snowden's  recommendation  (Snowden,  2008)  and  significantly  revised  the  wireframe interpretation to remove gaps in the interpretation.

Table 16.6 Domain Precedence Order (Gemcom software format)

|   Precedence Order | Rock Type                 |   Rock Code |
|--------------------|---------------------------|-------------|
|                  1 | Quartz-feldspar porphyry  |        6000 |
|                  2 | Quartz monzonite porphyry |        5000 |
|                  3 | Diorite (Waste)           |        4100 |
|                  4 | Diorite (Mineralized)     |        4000 |
|                  5 | Hornfels                  |        1000 |
|                  6 | Skarn                     |        2000 |

Largo  generated  a  fault-bounded  grade  shell  based  on  a  0.17%  WO3  equivalent  grade (WO3 Eq.) to constrain and report the high grade portions of the deposit, in addition to the global mineral resource estimate. Various sensitivity tests were conducted using hard and soft boundary conditions on the grade shell. Based on the sensitivity test data Largo elected to use the hard boundary results for reporting the mineral resource within the of the high

grade part of the deposit. The WO3 Equivalent grade is based on a Mo price of $12/lb, a WO3 price of $9.07/lb, a recovery of 80% for Mo and 65% for WO3, in the formula: WO3 Eq. = WO3 (%) + 1.736 * Mo (%). These metal prices and recoveries are of historical nature and would have applied to the analysis that was performed in 2009.

## 16.11   Mineral Resource Classification

The Mineral Resource estimate was classified in accordance with CIM Definition Standards (2005), taking drill hole spacing, data quality (and confidence therein), variogram confidence, search volume, and kriging quality into account. Snowden considers that there is  sufficient  drilling  and  sampling  information,  and  that  this  information  is  of  a  sufficient quality, to support a Measured, Indicated and Inferred classification for the Northern Dancer Mineral Resource.

Resource  classification  was  conducted  by  generating  three  dimensional  wireframe  solids around those parts of the block model for which the drill hole data and grade estimates met certain  criteria  (that  differed  by  resource  estimation  category).  The  resulting  classification was iteratively refined to be geologically reasonable to prevent the generation of numerous discontinuous and small areas of a higher confidence category being separated by a larger area of a lower confidence category (i.e., a 'spotted dog' or 'postage stamp' approach to resource classification was precluded in this way). Attention was also given to the mining method and potential pit  optimization  scenarios  in  the  generation  of  coherent  confidence classification  wireframes.  Areas  in  the  Inferred  category,  where  grade  extrapolation  was considered unrealistic, were removed from the mineral resource.

## 16.12   Model Validation

The March 2009 Mineral Resource estimate was validated using the following techniques:

- · Global comparison of model and input sample grades by domain.
- · Visual inspection of block and sample grades in section and plan.
- · Trend  plots  of  average  input  sample  and  block  grades  in  easting,  northing  and elevation.
- · Grade-tonnage reporting checks using alternative software.
- · Snowden independently generated a parallel model using the Datamine Studio 2 mining software. Comparisons between this model and Largo's model indicated several minor issues  that  required  resolution.  Largo  iteratively  refined  its  model  on  the  basis  of Snowden's recommendations. A final comparison between the two models revealed no significant differences.

Snowden was satisfied that the grade estimation reproduced the grade characteristics of the  input  sample  data  with  an  appropriate  level  of  variance  reduction  due  to  change  of support (i.e., from sample to block support).

Notes: The higher grade shell is included in the mineral resource presented in Table 17.7. Although a 0.17% WO3 equivalent was considered a likely cut-off  grade  for  this  deposit  based  on  comparisons  to  other  similar  deposit  types  at  the  time  the resource  was  estimated  in  2009,  it  has  not  been  confirmed  by  the  appropriate  economic  studies.  Totals  may  not  add  up exactly due to rounding.

## 17 OTHER RELEVANT DATA AND INFORMATION

AMC, in corroboration with other Largo consultants, has completed this section of the PEA. A summary of the results of that work is presented in this section.

It  should be noted that the economic assessment is preliminary in nature, and there is no certainty that the results of the preliminary economic assessment will be realized.

This preliminary economic assessment considers as its base case the construction of an open  pit  and  mineral  processing  plant  for  the  production  and  sale  of  a  Molybdenum concentrate and Tungsten in APT form.

## 17.1  Mine Operations

For the purpose of this PEA, it has been assumed that the Northern Dancer deposit will be mined using open pit mining methods.

The selected mining operating rate is 30 Mt/a to supply the processing plant with 11.2 Mt/a of ore. The total Life of Mine (LOM) waste to mineralized material ratio is 0.15t of waste per 1t of ore produced.

The operation is amenable to conventional truck and shovel/front end loader mining, with blasting as required. The initial primary equipment fleet for the study consists of four 229 mm blasthole capable drill rigs, two 12 m  diesel hydraulic face shovels, one 11 m  front 3 3 end loader and fourteen 100 t haul trucks. In addition, the primary fleet is supported by track dozers, motor graders, water trucks and other suitably sized ancillary equipment.

In general, both the face shovels and loader would be used to mine in bulk ore and waste on  a  10  m  bench.  Use  of  a  wheel  loader  allows  some  flexibility  in  mining  locations  for blending  and  ore  supply  purposes.  The  wheel  loader  may  also  be  used  for  rehandle  of mineralized material on the ROM.

The mining schedule has been based on a five phase approach. Three grade bands based on Net Smelter Return (NSR) have been used in the schedule: High Grade, Medium Grade and Low Grade. The mining sequence has been set to preferentially mine and treat High Grade  material  early  in  the  mine  life  to  improve  the  project  Net  Present  Value  (NPV). Medium and Low Grade materials are stockpiled for rehandle and processing later in the mine life.

Mine  planning  was  conducted  through  the  application  of  Gemcom  Software  International Inc. (Gemcom) Whittle™ and Gemcom Surpac™ software packages.  This includes block model  manipulations,  pit  optimization,  conceptual  planning,  and  preliminary  assessment level production scheduling.

All mining estimates are at PEA or Scoping Study level accuracy, +/- 30%. The mine plan also includes Inferred material.

## 17.1.1 Block Model

The  Datamine  block  model  generated  by  Snowden  in  its  2009  resource  estimation  work was  supplied  to  AMC  for  mine  design  purposes.  For  reference,  physical  details  for  the model are shown in Table 17.1.

| Rotation            | 0         |         |      |

## 17.1.2 Optimization Parameters

AMC used the LG algorithm application in Gemcom's Whittle™ program to perform the pit optimization.  The Whittle™ input parameters are explained below.

## Processing Rate

A production rate of 11.242 Mt/a mill feed was confirmed by Largo as the basis for the pit optimization.

## Metal Prices and Exchange Rates

Metal prices and exchange rates used as pit optimization parameters for this project were provided  by  Largo  and  are  shown  in  Table  17.2.  AMC  considers  the  metal  prices  to  be reasonable under 2011 economic conditions and the exchange rate to be acceptable for a PEA assessment of a potentially long-life mining project.

## Geotechnical Parameters

Currently there has been no formal geotechnical assessment completed for the Northern Dancer property. Inspection of limited core from 3 drillholes by AMC indicated that the rock mass appears to be generally of good quality. For this reason, and to remain consistent with previous studies completed on the project, an overall slope angle of 45 degrees has been used for the optimization. Further design criteria are shown in Table 17.4. Completion of a geotechnical assessment will form part of the recommendations of this study.

Table 17.4 Geotechnical Parameters

| Design Criteria                      | Unit    |   Value Used |
|--------------------------------------|---------|--------------|
| Overall Slope Angle for Optimization | Degrees |           45 |

## Costs of Metal Production

Costs  of  metal  production,  also  known  as  selling  costs  as  shown  in  Table  17.5,  were provided by BCE and Largo. These include all costs associated with selling the final metal products, such as royalties, smelting charges and transport.

The  cost  of  metal  production  also  includes  the  cost  of  operating  the  APT  plant  and  is expressed, for optimization purposes, in $/t of concentrate (wet).

## Table 17.5 Selling Costs and Criteria

| Design Criteria                   | Unit        | Value Used   |
|-----------------------------------|-------------|--------------|
| WO3 Concentrate Grade             | %           | 50.0         |
| Mo Concentrate Grade              | %           | 50.0         |
| Concentrate Moisture Content      | %           | 0.5          |
| APT Recovery (% WO3)              | %           | 95.0         |
| APT Cost per tonne of Concentrate | C$/t        | 1,313.91     |
| Mo Concentrate Freight Cost       | C$/t        | 140          |
| Mo Roasting and Sales             | C$/lb Metal | 1.1          |
| Royalty                           | % of NSR    | 1.0          |

## Net Smelter Return Calculation

Each block in the block model has had a Net Smelter Return (NSR) calculated, with the values recorded using C$/t terms. The NSR is net of all selling costs and criteria as detailed above.

The NSR has been calculated using a Net Smelter Price (NSP), which deducts the selling costs  from  the  base  metal  price  to  arrive  at  a  'mine  gate'  value  of  in-situ  material.  The calculated NSP values are shown in Table 17.6.

Table 17.6 Metal Prices and NSP

| Metal   | Metal Price  (US$)   | Metal Price  (US$)   | Metal Price  (C$)   | NSP (C$)   |
|---------|----------------------|----------------------|---------------------|------------|
| WO3     | 275 / MTU            | 27,500 / t           | 30,220 / t          | 25,781 / t |
| Mo      | 16 / lb              | 35,274 / t           | 38,763 / t          | 35,671 / t |

## The NSP formula is:

NSP ($/t) = (Metal Price ($/t) * APT or Smelting Recovery (%)) - Selling Costs ($/t)

Selling Costs ($/t) = (Metal Price ($/t) * Royalty (%)) + APT, Smelting and Transport ($/t)

## The NSR formula is:

NSR ($/t) = WO3(%) x Recovery(WO3%) / 100 x NSP(WO3)

+ Mo(%) x Recovery(Mo%) /100 x NSP(Mo)

## Mine Operating Costs

Mine operating costs have been based on AMC operating and project experience of similar sized operations in Canada and internationally. Processing plus General and Administration (G&amp;A) costs for the project were provided by BCE.

Operating costs used for the optimization are shown in Table 17.7.

Table 17.7 Site Operating Costs

| Project Area         | Unit           |   Value |
|----------------------|----------------|---------|
| Mining, all material | C$/t mined     |    2.2  |
| Stockpile rehandle   | C$/t rehandled |    0.88 |
| Processing           | C$/t processed |    4.93 |
| G&A                  | C$/t processed |    1.6  |

## Mining Dilution and Recovery

The Northern Dancer project is a large tonnage, low grade deposit. Material on the edges of the ore zones is likely to be mineralized to some extent. The effects of mining recovery and dilution are therefore expected to be minimal. For this reason, the approach taken in this PEA is to set dilution at 0% and mining recovery to 100%.

## 17.1.3 Open Pit Optimization and Analysis

The pit optimizations were conducted using the Lerchs-Grossman (LG) algorithm utilizing Gemcom's Whittle™ software.  Each block is assigned a value that shows the net cash flow that would result from mining that block.  This value is calculated as the sale price minus the operating  costs  and  selling  costs;  blocks  that  return  a  zero  or  negative  are  considered waste blocks.  Blocks with a zero density are coded as air blocks.

LG optimization is used to identify the optimal limit of an open pit.  The process considers the potential revenue generated from a block, the cost of mining the block, and the cost of mining the blocks above for access. The blocks that must be mined to access a mineralized material block are selected based on an overall slope angle that estimates the final slope including  design  face  angle,  catch  benches,  and  ramps.    If  the  result  of  the  net  revenue minus the cost is positive, the increment, including the mineralized material block and those which must be mined to access it, are added to the shell.  The process considers deeper and deeper material until the increment does not add value.  This is considered the optimal pit under the financial scenario being tested.  The process is run iteratively with increasing commodity prices to generate a suite of shells of increasing size which can be evaluated under  a  range  of  financial  scenarios.  The  analysis  provides  an  understanding  of  the potential  return  from  a  shell  and  the  financial  risks  associated  with  selecting  a  particular shell as the basis of design work if the inputs are different to those forecast.

The suite of shells is  used  as  a  guide  for  selecting  pit  stages  as  well  as  the  final  pit.    It should be noted that the LG algorithm does not apply a factor for the time value of money and therefore a schedule needs to be run to assess the effect of time costs and discount rates. Whittle 4X allows the shells to be scheduled and a discounted surplus calculated to estimate this effect. A discount rate of 8% has been used for this project.

When determining the value of a block, a grade of material is assessed against the recovery of the material and the sale price, minus processing costs and selling costs. When an NSR

value is used, the recovery is 100%, as metal recoveries have already been accounted for in  the  NSR  calculation.  Similarly,  the  selling  costs  are  already  accounted  for  and  the effective  sale  value  of  the  NSR  is  1,  or  100%.  Site  mining  and  processing  costs  are allocated as per normal. This scenario creates an effective NSR break even cut-off grade equal to the total cost of processing a tonne of ore.

## Cut-off and Cut-over Grades

Based on the information given above, cut-off and cut-over grades can be calculated for each  of  the  processing  paths.  The  break  even  cut-off  grade  is  the  grade  at  which  the material, when processed, will neither make a profit nor cause a loss. Any material above this grade will, by definition, create a positive value for the mine.

Using tungsten equivalent as the grade, Figure 17.1 shows this situation graphically for the Northern Dancer project using the inputs from the previous section, with the actual WO3 cutoff grade shown in Table 17.8. In the graph, the point at which the value curves cross the x axis, having a value of $0/t, represents the break-even cut-off grade.

For  the  purpose  of  this  PEA  and  based  on  current  metal  prices  and  costs  AMC  has calculated a cut-off grade of 0.04% WO3, which is lower than the 2009 Resource estimate cut-off  grade  of  0.06%  WO3 described  in  this  report.  AMC  recommends  that  in  the  next phase of this project a new Resource Estimate be prepared reflecting up-to-date economic parameters and other relevant  information.

## Optimization Results

The results of the open pit optimizations are shown graphically in Figure 17.2.

The  three  cash  flow  curves  shown  in  the  figure  are  defined  in  the  Whittle™  manual  as follows:

- · Blue  Curve:  The  undiscounted  open  pit  value.  Its  usefulness  lies  in  identifying  the 'Optimal Pit' as identified by the LG algorithm. This is unaffected by scheduling.
- · Red Curve: The discounted open pit value for the Best Case.  The best case schedule consists of mining out the smallest pit, and then mining out each subsequent pit shell from the top down, before starting the next pit shell.  This schedule is seldom feasible because the pushbacks are usually much too narrow.  Its usefulness lies in setting an upper limit to the achievable NPV.
- · Green  Curve:  The  discounted  open  pit  value  for  the  Worst  Case.  The  worst  case schedule consists of mining each bench completely before starting on the next bench. This schedule or one very close to it is usually feasible. It also sets a lower limit to the NPV.
- · Purple  Curve:  The  purple  curve  on  the  graph  indicates  tonnes  of  ore  within  the  pit shells.

Figure 17.2 Whittle Optimization Results

<!-- image -->

The  undiscounted  cashflow  for  the  Northern  Dancer  project  displays  the  regular  value curve, increasing rapidly before flattening out near revenue factor 1, then reducing again. However, the  discounted  best  case  scenario  is  almost  a  flat  line.  This  indicates  that  the processing  rate  selected  is  relatively  low  in  relation  to  the  amount  of  ore  in  the  pit.  For example,  the  revenue  factor  1  pit  contains  927Mt  or  ore,  which  corresponds  to  over  80 years of processing. With discounting the effect of revenue from the end of the mine life in this situation is very low, resulting in very little change in NPV between shells and creating the flat-line discounted cash flow seen in the graph.

## Phase and Final Pit Selection

Five phases have been selected for scheduling the Northern Dancer project. The phases have been selected to reduce the level of initial stripping and increase head grades in the early  years  of  production  as  a  means  of  improving  NPV.  The  phases  are  based  on  a minimum mining width of 80m and selected for practicality of mining.

The final shell has been selected using scheduling iterations to test for maximum NPV and Internal  Rate  of  Return  (IRR).  The  optimal,  or  Revenue  Factor  1,  shell  as  identified  by Whittle™  is  the  shell  with  the  highest  undiscounted  cashflow,  which  does  not  take  into account the effect of scheduling and the discount rate. Once the discount rate is applied, the pit shell with the highest, or in this case equivalent, NPV is generally smaller than the identified  optimal,  an  effect  that  is  highlighted  in  the  optimization  results  graph  in  Figure 17.2.

Given the above and the long mine life, the final pit selected for this study is much smaller than the Revenue Factor 1 pit. In this case, increasing the size of the pit did not have a material  effect on  NPV.  A  smaller  pit  therefore  generates  the  same  return  with  a proportionately  lower  risk  profile.  The  difference  between  the  selected  final  shell  and Revenue Factor 1 shells is detailed in Table 17.9.

Table 17.9 Revenue Factor 1 vs. Final Shell Comparison

| Pit               | Rev.  Factor 1   |   Selected  Final |
|-------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Pit Number        | 36               |             15    |
| Total Tonnes (Mt) | 1,195.1          |            624.5  |
| Waste Tonnes (Mt) | 268.1            |             78.7  |
| Ore Tonnes (Mt)   | 927.0            |            545.8  |

| Mo (%)            | 0.02             |              0.02 |
| NSR ($/t)         | 17.95            |             20.83 |

The  pit  phases  are  shown  in  plan  view  in  Figure  17.3  while  Figure  17.4  shows  the  pit phases in a southwest to northeast cross-section, looking northwest, with calculated NSR grades from the block model highlighted.

Scheduling  for  the  project  was  completed  based  on  the  adjusted  pit  shells  from  the minimum mining width procedure. A scoping level pit design based on the ultimate pit was also completed to test for practicality and determine a likely pit exit location. This design is shown in plan view in Figure 17.5.

## 17.1.4 Mine Schedule

Scheduling  for  the  Northern  Dancer  project  has  been  completed  using  a  model  built  in Microsoft Excel. The inputs used for scheduling are shown in Table 17.10.

Table 17.10 Scheduling Inputs

| Schedule Input                  | Value       |
|---------------------------------|-------------|
| Processing plant throughput     | 11.242 Mt/a |
| Mining rate                     | 30.0 Mt/a   |
| Maximum mining benches per year | 16          |
| High Grade cut-off ($/t NSR)    | > 21        |
| Medium Grade cut-off ($/t NSR)  | 15 to 21    |
| Low Grade cut-off ($/t NSR)     | 7.41 to 15  |
| Waste cut-off                   | < 7.41      |

Initial scheduling iterations indicated that stockpiling material in the Low and Medium Grade categories while selectively processing High Grade material made a marked improvement to the NPV over using a flat break-even cut-off grade scenario. The Medium and Low Grade materials are processed during periods when there is limited High Grade material available, while the stockpiles are assumed to be rehandled and processed at the end of the mine life.

Using this methodology there is no pre-stripping period, with ore being available to process in the first year of mining. In the current schedule, the mine operates for 23 years, while the process plant operates for a total of 49 years.  The maximum size of the ore stockpile is 295 Mt.

The  mine  schedule  is  displayed  graphically  in  Figure  17.6,  with  the  complete  schedule shown in Figure 17.6.

The  total  mineral  inventory  within  each  phase  is  shown  in  Table  17.13.  The  inventory contains  Indicated  and  Inferred  material,  which  is  acceptable  for  a  PEA.  The  level  of confidence  of  a  PEA  is  not  high  enough  to  quote  a  Mineral  Reserve  and  therefore  the inventory should not be referred to as such.

## 17.1.5 Mining Operations

Operations  are  planned  for  365  days/year,  with  crews  working  in  two  12-hour  shifts. Selection of mining equipment was based on the geometry and style of the orebody and the required mining rates. The machine classes are appropriate for the operation but have not been optimized for the purpose of this study.

Fleet requirements were estimated based on available operating hours, individual machine availability,  utilization  of  availability  and  site  conditions  such  as  haulage  profiles  and production cycle times. Mobile support fleet requirements were estimated using operating experience to match the active mining fleet. Major fleet classes, assumptions, and numbers are show in Table 17.14.

Table 17.14 Primary Mining Fleet Assumptions

| Fleet      | Class         | Example          | Availability   | Utilization   |   Initial Fleet |   Max Fleet |

Initial haulage profiles for the project are downhill as the pit straddles a ridge line. For the purpose  of  the  study  it  has  been  assumed  that  waste  will  be  hauled  to  a  dump  in  the northwest of the pit, while ore will either be directly hauled to the crusher or stockpiled to the southeast of the pit.

The general layout of the project is shown in Figure 17.8, detailing the location of the final pit, crusher, ore stockpile and waste dump.

There is limited hydro-geological information for the Northern Dancer project. The project is in a high rain and snowfall area, however as the pit is situated on a ridge line the catchment area for surface inflow is relatively small.

Given the limited amount of data it has been assumed for this study that pit dewatering will be achieved through pumping from the pit floor to a holding pond on the surface via staging points where necessary. Initial capital of C$1.5M has been allocated for pumps, pipes and other infrastructure, while ongoing costs are captured under sustaining capital.

## 17.1.6 Personnel Estimate

The  mine  at  Northern  Dancer  is  assumed  to  operate  24  hrs/day,  365  days/yr,  with  two twelve-hour shifts per day. A roster of 14 days on, 14 days off has been used to estimate

the  required  personnel  for  the  site.  Table  17.15  shows  a  proposed  list  of  initial  site personnel in the form of an example organizational chart.

## 17.1.7 Capital Expenditure Estimate

An estimate of capital expenditure has been completed for the mining fleet and associated items based on the mine schedule in Section 17.1.4. The estimate for initial mine capital is shown in Table 17.16.

The  costs  for  the  equipment  have  been  sourced  from  a  number  of  locations,  including supplier  budgetary  quotes,  the  CostMine  Estimator's  Guide  from  InfoMine  USA  Inc.  and operational experience. Some of the values were provided in US dollar terms, and were converted to Canadian Dollars using the exchange rate given in Table 17.16.

A  contingency  value  of  30%  has  been  included  to  cover  variability  in  supplier  pricing, transport, exchange rate and allowance for other undefined items.

A fleet replacement schedule has been completed for the life of the mine and extended to include the period of rehandling after the completion of the open pit.

## 17.1.8 Risks and Opportunities - Mining

There  are  inherent  risks  involved  with  any  potential  mining  operations.  There  are  risks specific  to  the  mine  plan,  as  well  as  possible  areas  of  improvement.  Some  of  these  are identified below.

The mine schedule has been run using a relatively aggressive maximum bench advance rate  of  16  benches  per  year.  However,  this  maximum  occurs  only  twice  in  the  mine  life, relating to the upper benches of Phases 1 and 2 where the volumes per bench are quite low.  While  this  advance  rate  should  be  achievable  through  adequate  management  and scheduling it does introduce a small risk factor that should be investigated during the next level of study.

The  schedule  described  in  Section  17.1.4  includes  inferred  material  in  the  estimate  of mineral  inventory.  This  is  acceptable  for  a  study  at  PEA  level  however  is  generally  not acceptable for more advanced study types. This introduces a risk factor to the mine plan that  the  inferred  material  may  not  be  converted  to  a  higher  confidence  level  (materials, measured  and/or  indicated),  at  during  later  studies.  The  amount  of  inferred  material contained within the mine plan is detailed in Table 17.17.

The stockpiling strategy that results in a stockpile of approximately 295 Mt of mineralized material introduces its own risks. First is the possible oxidation of the ore over time resulting in changing  metallurgical  parameters.  Next,  the  material  may  consolidate  over  time, creating issues with re-handling. Finally, there is also the potential for acid generation within the stockpile that may require capture and treatment of runoff water.

There are other risks to the project that are common to all mining operations. These include potential issues with availability of key equipment and consumables, and the availability of properly  qualified  personnel.  Both  issues  will  need  further  investigation  as  the  project advances.

While  there  are  many  opportunities  for  improving  the  project,  there  are  three  main opportunities that directly affect the mine plan and that could possibly improve the NPV of the project.

The first opportunity relates to the possible use of contract mining. For the purpose of the PEA it has been assumed that an owner operator scenario has been used with initial mining fleet  being  purchased  and  expanded  as  necessary  through  sustaining  capital.  The  long mine life at Northern Dancer makes it amenable to owner-operator mining however there may be efficiency gains through the use of a contractor. This should be investigated during the next phase of study, including assessment of the availability of suitable contractors in the region.

Secondly, there may be scope to improve the schedule through the use of cut-off grade optimization. For the purpose of this PEA manually selected grade bands have been used for mine scheduling. It is possible that the cut-off grade used to determine the feed to the processing  streams  could  be  varied  on  a  period  by  period  basis  using  an  optimization strategy  to  vary  stripping  and  metal  production  throughout  the  mine  life  with  the  goal  of increasing NPV.

Finally,  linked  to  the  theory  of  cut-off  grade  optimization  is  the  added  step  of  schedule optimization. The current schedule has been manually created to satisfy set constraints of mining  rate,  processing  rate  and  maximizing  the  identified  High  Grade  material.  Use  of optimization software could automate this process, making it possible to vary mining rates and  cut-off  grades  to  determine  what  improvements  could  be  made  to  the  project  NPV under different scenarios.

## 17.2  Tailings Management, Water Treatment

## 17.2.1 Preliminary Site Investigation

Largo  engaged  Mr.  John  Lemieux  of  Journeaux  Bedard  &amp;  Associates  Inc.,  Montreal, Quebec  to  conduct  an  assessment  of  potential  tailings  sites  for  the  Northern  Dancer Project. Mr. Lemieux visited the site in July, 2008.

A total of 6 sites, along with two variations to two of the six sites, for a total of 8 sites were studied. The assessment initially examined the potential handling volume of each site using a tailings deposition angle of 1%. Using an estimated volume of 200 million tonnes of tailings to be stored with an assumed 1.5 tons per cubic meter with uniform silt with a specific gravity of approximately 2.8, it was estimated that the space required for tailings storage was  approximately 150  million cubic meters. The  scenario  considered assumed that the tailings could be transported via pipeline as 40% solid slurry. Water would be decanted from the tailings and returned to mill for recycle.

Based on these assumptions, Lemieux (2008) concluded that all eight (8) options examined  could  provide  the  required  storage  area.  To  compare  the  sites  a  typical  dam cross-section was used.

Major considerations of the assessment then included several factors such as:

- · Cost of construction, operation and maintenance
- · Minimizing  risks  associated  with  high  dams,  liquefiable  tails,  earthquakes, landslides, avalanches, and flash floods
- · Foundation issues
- · Accessibility
- · Aggregate quality and proximal supply

## 17.2.2 Surficial Materials

Lemieux (2008) also examined the surficial geology of the area. From this examination he noted  that  it  was  clear  that  granular  material  was  abundant,  whereas  fine  impermeable material was limited to dense, sandy, humid, boulder till that could be difficult to excavate.

## 17.2.3 Dam Type and Construction Materials

For assessment purposes, a granular fill dam was selected as the dam type. This form of dam would use run of pit granular material costed at $7 per cubic meter as the mass of the  dam. Engineered granular material costed at $15 per cubic meter would sandwich a geomembrane  costed  at  $37.50  per  square  meter,  on  the  upstream  slope.  Rip  rap, comprising of crushed stone from the pit and/or natural boulders costed at $15 per cubic meter, would cover everything. Stripping for the foundation key of the membrane at a one (1)  meter  thickness  was  estimated  to  cost  $7.50  per  square  meter.  Lemieux  (2008) noted that a possible option to a membrane could be a good till but whether suitable tills existed  in  the  region  of  the  tailings  site  was  not  examined  during  the  short  field  visit. Lemieux did not include any cost estimates associated with foundation preparation such as dealing with bedrock, soil injection, rock injection, diversion ditches or other possible key considerations.

## 17.2.4 Potential Site Volumes and Other Site Characteristics

For  each  of  the  eight  sites,  Lemieux  (2008)  noted  the  potential  contained  quantity,  site elevation, maximum height, and preliminary cost estimate for the tailing site.

Lemieux (2008) then reviewed the options on a preliminary basis to narrow down further studies. As a result further analysis was conducted in the Upper Screw Creek area to the east in 2008 and, in later studies, by Lemieux in 2011 on Cabin Creek to the north, and Logjam creek to the south.

## 17.2.5 Evaluation of Thickened and Paste Tailings Management Options

In 2011,  Lemieux  completed  a  comparative  preliminary  feasibility  evaluation  of  both thickened and paste tailings management options including estimated capital and operating costs in an effort to reduce pumping/pipeline requirements and the initial capital expenditures in the early stages of the Project.

For the purposes of this investigation the following design criteria were established:

- 1. The  tailings are non acid generating, but may  leach contaminants and  some contaminants may be added during the milling process. The tailings and process water are considered contaminated, storm floods must be contained and dams must be made relatively  impermeable  to  reduce  seepage.  Surplus  water  must  be  treated  before leaving the site.
- 2. The  tailings  will  consist  of  55%  fine  sand  and  45%  silt  and  finer  particles.  The anticipated  grain  size  distribution  is  shown  on  Figure  1,  Appendix  3  of  the  Lemieux (2011) report, along with the grain size distribution of the tailings at the Xstrata Nickel Kidd Met tailings management site, which is referenced for comparison purposes in that the author believes that it provides a reasonable basis for benchmarking the proposed tailing disposal at ND.
- 3. The tailings will be thickened to 60-65% solids by weight.
- 4. The mill location is fixed.
- 5. Total quantity of tailings to store is 172.5Mt over 24 years at an in-situ thickened tailings dry  density  of  1.5t/  m   (reference  the  recently  measured  Kidd  Met  site  value  of 3 1.58t/m3) equals 115M m . 3
- 6. To facilitate  calculations  at  this  early  feasibility  stage  of  the  project  an  average  linear tailings  deposition  angle  of  2%  was  used.  This  is  the  same  average  linear  tailings deposition angle as that of the Kidd Met site.

For the 2011 assessment it is assumed that any water remaining in the thickened tailings once it reaches the tailings management area will not be returned to the mill but instead will be left to flow to the environment with treatment as required.

The thickened and paste tailings comparative estimate was prepared using the unit costs from the 2008 study.

## 17.2.6 Methodology

All  valleys  surrounding  the  pit  site  were  analysed  and  three  scenarios  were  examined relative to containment of the required tonnage at a 2% deposition angle. Two approaches were considered:

- · place one dam at the required life of mine location and lift it sequentially over the years or
- · construct  many  small  dams  moving  further  and  further  down  the  valley  over  time  to accommodate the increasing volume of tailings. Considering that road construction, tree clearing and foundation preparation can be significant cost components it was decided to choose the sequential raising of one dam at the life of mine location.

## 17.2.7 Project Approach and Water Treatment

The approach is to construct a main dam that will initially be built of sand and gravel. As tailings become available the main dam will be raised, downstream method, sequentially as  required  with  tailings  over  the  years.  At  the  same  time,  a  rock  fill  berm  will  be constructed, parallel to the main dam, offset upstream by about 250 meters. This rock fill berm  will  simply  serve  as  a  physical  barrier  to  hold  back  the  fine  tailings  particles (leaving  water  flow  through)  that  would  fill  the  shallow  water  pond  upstream  of  the main dam.

A small pond is required to ensure minimal treatment of the water for total suspended solids before recirculating to the mill. The rock berm will also be raised sequentially over time being only slightly higher (2 meters max.) than the main dam at anytime. The rock berm raises will be built using the upstream method which means that each new lift will be built on tailings thus reducing significantly the quantity of rock fill required.

Process water seeping and decanting through the relatively permeable main dam will be contained by a second recirculation dam thus creating the recirculation basin. The design flood  event  chosen  to  dimension  the  recirculation  dam  is  the  combined  100  year  return period rain and snow melt. Lemieux (2011) further provides a rationale for this design as per practice in other provinces.

Lemieux  (2011)  also  notes  that  it  is  advantageous  to  have  some  containment  as  it  can provide a readily available supply of process water that can be pumped to the mill in order to  increase  recirculation  and  limit  fresh  water  usage,  especially  during  winter  months.  At this  point,  it  is  thought  that  the  process  water  will  have  relatively  low  suspended  solids (TSS) and could be recycled back to the mill or treated and released to the environment. As indicated  above,  it  is  assumed  for  the  PEA  that  any  water  remaining  in  the  thickened tailings once it reaches the tailings management area will not be returned to the mill. The cost of a treatment plant has not been estimated.

## 17.2.8 Site Alternatives

The Cabin Creek valley was initially evaluated but has the important disadvantage over the other two sites in that it has a large opening to the west halfway down the length of the

valley  thus  requiring  two  important  dams  whereas  the  other  sites  only  require  one.  The Cabin Creek option was not developed further.

Dam construction volumes were calculated for both Screw and Logjam Creeks. Unit costs from the 2008 study were used to allow for comparison. The Logjam creek dam will require about 3.2Mm 3 of materials whereas the Screw creek dam would require 0.62Mm . Figure 17.9 3 shows the location of these 2 sites in relation to the mine and process plant.

17.2.9 Cost Estimate for Tailings Impoundment

<!-- image -->

An initial  detailed  estimated  capital  cost  and  Tailings  Impoundment  Investment  Schedule was developed by Lemieux (2008) based on a range of information including:

- · Estimated critical and normal water balance
- · Preliminary stability (static and 0.08g seismic)
- · Site layout plan
- · Tailings pipe, head loss, and profile

- · Process return pipe, head loss, and profile
- · Typical road/ditch/pipeline cross section
- · Typical cross section of dam
- · Volume elevation curve for polishing basin

Lemieux (2008) noted that the costs derived at that time, were not absolute construction costs but should be considered as comparative cost index values (CCIV). The basis of the  cost  assumption  was  to  provide  a  full  comparison  of  the  sites  for  scoping  study purposes, with the need for further evaluation to provide a better definition of costs in further studies likely associated with a prefeasibility assessment of the Northern Dancer Project.

This data was later integrated into the additional studies conducted in 2011 to derive the current cost estimate.

Clearly from a dam construction point of view the Screw creek option is more economical and presents a much lesser risk liability. However, all other elements being the same, the Screw Creek option will require a 13km pipeline estimated at a cost of approximately $C 13M. Lemieux (2011) provides detail on the capital  cost  estimates  for  both  sites  in  his report. Lemieux (2011) noted a preliminary investment schedule as shown in Table 17.18.

Table 17.18 Preliminary Investment Schedule

| Logjam Creek      | Year 0    | Year 1-2   | Year 10+   | Total   |
|-------------------|-----------|------------|------------|---------|
| Wood clearing     | $CM  2.00 | $CM  1.10  | $CM        | $CM     |
| Road              | 0.80      |            |            |         |
| Recirculation Dam | 6.30      |            |            |         |
| Main Dam          | 9.70      | 8.00       | 14.00      |         |
| Total             | 18.80     | 9.10       | 14.00      | 41.90   |
| Screw Creek       | Year 0    | Year 1-2   | Year 10+   | Total   |
|                   | $CM       | $CM        | $CM        | $CM     |
| Pipeline          | 13        |            |            |         |
| Wood clearing     | 2         | 1.8        |            |         |
| Recirculation Dam | 6.3       |            |            |         |
| Main Dam          | 3.2       |            | 3.3        |         |
| Total             | 24.5      | 1.8        | 3.3        | 29.6    |

A 25% contingency was applied to the above values for economic evaluation. The total capital cost for the Screw Creek Option is almost 42% lower than the Logjam Creek option and the initial  investment during the first two years is approximately $C1.7M less for the Screw Creek option. Both of these options are significantly lower cost than the $C115.5M conventional tailings deposition option evaluated in 2008.

## 17.2.10  Project Considerations and Suitability

Lemieux  (2008)  noted  that  other  considerations  such  as  permitting  issues,  restoration elements,  dust,  detailed  water  balance,  land  ownership,  climate  data,  and  watershed characteristics  are  some  of  the  elements  that  will  require  detailed  examination  in completing an assessment of the potential of Logjam Creek and Upper Screw Creek as  tailings  sites  for  the  Northern  Dancer  Project.  Total  capital  investments  for  dam construction are significantly less because the use of a high capacity thickener allows most of the process water to return directly to the mill. This eliminates the need to construct a recycle pump/pipeline to ensure operation of the mill during the winter when free flowing water  is  limited.  Water  to  the  mill  will  come  from  high  capacity  thickeners  connected  in series and  from  fresh water  sources; no  water  will be  recycled from  the tailings management facility.  The  thickened  tailings  are  expected  to  form  a  2%  deposition  slope rather  than  the  1%  slope  initially  estimated  (2008),  this  results  in  significantly  lower  dam heights. Surface drainage ditches around the tailings area will be required where possible in order to reduce the quantity of fresh water entering it.

Lemieux  (2011)  noted  that  thickening  the  tailings  more  to  achieve  a  paste  has  no  net advantage in the case of the Northern Dancer project.

## 17.3  Site Services - Power and Infrastructure

## 17.3.1 Power

SFPC StreamFlow Power (Canada) (SFPC), a Division of Almarah Technical Services Inc., of South River, Ontario was contracted by Largo in 2010 to complete a prefeasibility study of potential  hydroelectric  capacity  for  the  Project.  Mr.  Dennis  E.  Netherton  (P.Eng, M.ASCE) of SFPC visited the region in July 2010 to evaluate potential site alternatives for hydroelectric generation within reasonable transmission distance from the Northern Dancer site.

After  an  initial  desktop  study  involving  a  review  of  all  known  potential  power  sites  in  the region and studies conducted on individual power sites, SFPC selected to further evaluate four potential sites in the region. These four sites were: (i) Morley River below Morley Lake; (ii) Swift River below Swift Lake; (iii) Dorsey Lake and (iv) Morley River above Morley Lake.

## 17.3.1.1 Site Evaluation

At  Morley  River  below  Morley  Lake,  denoted  in  SFPC  (2010)  as  Alternative  2,  SFPC examined a site that had been examined in detail by Acres Consulting Group in 1983 as a potential  run-of-river  power  site.  The  site  is  characterized  with  a  38  meter  drop  over  the projected  run  trajectory.  It  would  have  the  longest  transmission  line  to  Northern  Dancer, although  has  benefits  such  as  close  access  from  the  Alaska  Highway  to  the  proposed location of the power canal intake and the power house. However SFPC (2010) noted that this  alternative  would be challenging from annual flow capacity levels as the damming of

Morley  Lake  would  be  difficult  and  would  require  a  control  dam  height  of  more  than  20 meters  in  order  to  provide  a  little  more  than  half  the  required  flow  for  less  than  half  the energy supply provided in the site proposed at Morley River above Morley Lake, denoted as Alternative 1 in the SFPC (2010) report.

At Swift River below Swift Lake, denoted in SFPC (2010) as Alternative 3, SPC envisioned a power house installation below Swift Lake at the falls location situated approximately 14 kilometres downstream from the proposed Swift Lake Control Dam and outlet works within a  generally  flat  sloping  valley  setting.  SFPC  (2010)  ranked  this  alternative  lowest  of  all alternatives examined due to poor access, lack of good reservoir sites, a long transmission corridor, and little ability for expansion.

Although Dorsey Lake was not examined in great detail, it was examined as a potential reservoir site for the Smart River. SFPC (2010) noted that the capacity of this alternative is very limited and flows would be considerably smaller than all other alternatives examined, based on a watershed area of only 360 square kilometres. By comparison the watershed areas at Swift River are 3320 square kilometres and that of the Wolf/Morris lake system north of Morley Lake is approximately 1700 square kilometres. SFPC noted that if additional power capacity of 2-4 MW was required, it may prove useful to evaluate this site in more detail.

SFPC concluded that the Morley site above, and north of, Morley Lake (Alternative 1 in the SFPC (2010) report) demonstrated the best means for the provision of power required by the Project. SFPC proposed that the approach consist of the construction of low dams on the Wolf and Morris Lakes. In this way it would be possible to maintain the desired energy levels  year-round.  SFPC  proposed  a  system  of  three  generating  stations  utilizing  run-ofriver  power  systems,  with  a  two  machine  development  at  each  site  to  provide  a  robust energy system that could provide a system capacity of 67% even with the complete loss of a station. This development would require timber removal around the two reservoir lakes that could be sold, or possibly stockpiled for use in a wood burning boiler for mine and work camp heating.

## 17.3.1.2 Energy Cost Comparison

SFPC (2011) provided  an  addendum  study  that  presents  comparisons  of  annual  energy costs for Owner Build and Operate, Independent Operator Build and Operate, and Diesel Power on site at 30 cents per kW hr. or $300 per MW hr. As noted on Table 17.19, SFPC (2011) assigned a target return on investment (ROI) of 15% for the Independent Operator.

For  the 'Owner  Build  and  Operate'  scenario,  the  total estimated  capital cost was $190,406,372, with an annual energy cost of $14,054,632, that results in an average cost per  kilowatt  hour  of  $0.0446  assuming  approximately  300M  kW  hr  energy  production  pa (see Table 17.19 below). The annual energy cost of the 'Independent Operator Build and Operate' was much higher at $24,883,919 and as such was not considered a viable option

at  this  time.  Furthermore,  the  price  associated  with  the  'Owner  Build'  option  was  very attractive  in comparison  to  that  of  diesel  generated  power  and  is  also  more  of  an environmentally sound approach for resource development.

Largo intends to conduct further examinations of energy options in later planning stages. These  may  include,  but  also  may  not  be  limited  to,  energy  from  possible  gas  pipeline developments such as the Alaska Gas Pipeline or projects being considered in the Eagle Plains  area  of  Northern  Yukon,  the  use  of  transported  liquefied  gas  from  existing  gas developed areas in north-eastern BC until pipelines are established, wind generated power, bio-fuels, and the possibility of generating hydro power through public-private partnership initiatives.

## 17.4  Environmental and Permitting

## 17.4.1 Environmental Baseline Studies

Largo  has  conducted  a  broad  range  of  environmental  baseline  studies  in  the  Northern Dancer area from 2007 to current which have primarily comprised of:

- · Water sampling program of all drainages from the Northern Dancer deposit and some regional testing sites
- · Preliminary acid rock generation investigations
- · Fisheries investigations of the proposed access route and primary drainages in the local watershed
- · Wildlife investigations of the local watershed and outlying areas

During  this  period  Largo  has  also  examined  implications  for  permitting  the  project.  The following will briefly outline the key activities conducted to date and the proposed activities that will be conducted through the pre-development phase to the production phase of this Project.

## 17.4.2 Water Sampling Program

- · As part of the field baseline studies, Access Consulting Group (Access) has conducted regular  site  visits  from  2008  to  current  day.  All  water  quality  samples  were  collected using  standard  field  and  custody  QA/QC  measures,  and  were  analysed  at  Maxxam Analytics Inc. in Burnaby, British Columbia for the following parameters:
- · Physical  parameters  (conductivity,  pH,  total  suspended  solids,  colour,  hardness,  total and dissolved solids, turbidity)
- · Nutrients (ammonia, nitrogen, phosphate)
- · Organics (alkalinity, hydroxide, carbonate, total organic carbon)

- · Cyanide
- · Total  and  dissolved  metals  (suite  of  33  metals,  including  all  parameters  found  in  the CCME and MMER guidelines)

In all sampling events to date, water quality has been considered typical of streams in undisturbed,  alpine  drainages  underlain  primarily  by  igneous  and  metamorphic  rock.  The water was soft, weakly buffered and low in dissolved solids with pH in the range of 6.7 to 8.35. Hardness, alkalinity and dissolved solids fluctuated in concentration  in  an  inverse manner to stream flow - indicating dilution from runoff during high flow periods, and the greater influence of groundwater during low flow periods. In the headwater creeks, chemical  constituents  were  slightly  elevated,  but,  with  few  exceptions,  were  indicative  of good quality  water  for  supporting  aquatic  life  -  only  aluminium  approached  water  quality effects threshold levels for fish. The 2008 sampling program entailed a more consistent sampling effort of water chemistry over the spring-fall period.

Access  has  been  collecting  water  quality  samples  at  thirteen  sites  covering  all  drainages associates with the Northern Dancer site and regional test locations. The locations of these sites are indicated on the map.

## Sites were chosen to include:

- · downstream areas  in  drainages  that  have  the  potential  to  be  affected  by  exploration activities and/or future mine development;
- · reference sites upstream of any potential development, whose data would be useful in determining if changes in water quality were development-related.

Once  the  test  results  were  received,  Access  completed  a  comparative  analysis  of  2008 water  quality  data  with  both  Metal  Mining  Effluent  Regulations  (MMER)  Schedule  4: Authorized  Limits  of  Deleterious  Substances,  and  Canadian  Council  of  Ministers  on  the Environment  (CCME)  Guidelines  for  the  Protection  of  Freshwater  Aquatic  Life  (Access Consulting Group, 2009).

Although  the  Project  is  not  currently  subject  to  authorizations  with  associated  discharge criteria (MMER or Water Licences), the MMER limits were included for comparison with a view towards providing a comprehensive water quality description of the local watershed for potential  project  permitting.  While  some  water  quality  parameters  did  exceed  CCME guidelines, it is important to note that these are guidelines only, and not enforceable criteria. All  parameters  for  all  samples  and  sites  were  below  the  MMER  limits  for  deleterious substances.

The  data  collected  by  Access  did  show  natural  related  metal  exceedances  of  CCME guidelines.  Natural  exceedances  of  aluminium,  cadmium,  copper,  and  selenium  were documented  by  Nordin  (2006)  on  a  water  sample  collected  on  the  northern  side  of  the Northern Dancer deposit. As this locality was isolated from all project related activities, it clearly indicates that elevated exceedances of various elements result from natural runoff in

the  area.  It  also  indicates  that  further  study  is  required  to  appropriately  delineate  natural versus project related exceedances in the area.

In  addition,  MESH  Environmental  Inc  (MESH)  in  2008  conducted  water  quality  samples down-gradient  from  the  old  portal  (ref.  Amax  site  activity  1977  -  1981).  Water  quality samples collected from these stockpile samples was near neutral with respect to pH with low  conductivity  values.  However,  concentrations  of  F,  Al,  Cd,  Mo  and  Se,  and,  in  one sample,  Hg,  were  higher  than  the  concentrations  recommended  by  the  Canadian  Water Quality Guidelines for the Protection of Aquatic Life. As a result of these findings a static test point was established on the stockpile samples but has not been regularly tested to this point. Testing is now expected to resume on these static tests as part of the next phase of the project.

## 17.4.3 Fisheries Investigations

With the exception of the Smart River, documentation of previous fisheries investigations in this area was not discovered. It appears that very little to date is known about the fisheries resources of this part of the Smart River/Swift River. Preliminary watershed Investigations into  fish  and  fish  habitat  in  the  vicinity  of  the  Northern  Dancer  deposit  and  all  possible associated drainages were conducted in 2008 for Largo by Access.

Previous to the investigations by Access, a total of six species of fish had been recorded in the Swift and Smart Rivers in the vicinity of the mining property, namely:

- · Arctic grayling ( Thymallus arcticus )
- · Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha)
- · Dolly Varden char ( Salvelinus malma )
- · Humpback whitefish ( Coregonus clupeaformis )
- · Longnose suckers ( Catostomus catostomus )
- · Slimy Sculpin ( Coitus cognatus )

Previous  investigations  by  Canamax  (1983)  also  indicated  that  the  magnitude  of  the Chinook  salmon  run  in  the  Swift  River  was  considered  moderate,  at  between  50  to  100 individuals and spawning was considered minimal. The Swift River is known to be used by Arctic  grayling  for  spawning proposes. The Smart River is considered to be a productive stream  for  fish,  providing  over-wintering  areas,  although  the  Chinook  salmon  run  was considered to be less than 50.

The  Access  investigations  were  conducted  by  Access  for  Largo  Resources  Ltd  and investigated  fish  and  fish  habitat  in  2008  at  numerous  sites  along  the  Smart  River/Swift River drainage, including Logjam Creek, Two Ladder Creek, "Dorsey Creek" (a temporary name  assigned  to  an  unnamed  creek),  Screw  Creek  and  the  Smart  River.  The  only

fisheries/fish habitat investigations conducted within the three tenures in British Columbia included sites along the western portion of Logjam Creek and all other small creeks along the access route.

The results of these surveys identified that with the exception of the very small tributaries to Logjam  Creek  that  crossed  the  mine  road,  all  streams  sampled  are  swift,  high  gradient systems cascading from higher altitude terrain, providing very limited or no suitable habitat for fish. Additionally, the very cold water temperatures encountered would generally serve as a deterrent to most species of fish moving into these streams from the Swift and Smart Rivers. Small resident bull trout populations are noted exceptions to this rule, as they have been  documented  as  requiring  very  clear,  cold,  sediment-free  high  gradient  headwater streams for successful survival. Studies to date have indicated that there appears to be a limited population of bull trout identified in the Screw Creek area. This will require further investigation to be conducted with advancement of the Northern Dancer Project.

## 17.4.4 Wildlife Investigations

Preliminary  wildlife  investigations  have  been  conducted  in  the  Northern  Dancer  area.  A report by Canamax (1983) noted that, based upon interviews with Yukon game biologists and  field  observations,  the  area  does  not  appear  to  be  important  as  wildlife  habitat, especially  for  large  mammals  such  as  Dall's  sheep.  Only  a  few  woodland  caribou  were thought to migrate to the area during the summer. Moose were found to be fairly common at  lower  elevations.  Grizzly  bears  appeared  few  in  numbers,  although  wolves  were  fairly common and little data was collected with respect to birds, furbearers or small mammals.

To further verify the initial findings on the presence of wildlife in the area, Largo contracted Dr. Grant Lortie in July of 2008 to conduct a helicopter reconnaissance for wildlife within the environmental baseline study area. Lortie (2009) reported sighting several moose moving from lower elevations into the upper elevation in response to plant phenology and that the duration of their occupancy in higher elevations while variable, was likely highly dependent on  arrival  of  prohibitive  snow  conditions.  Lortie  also  concluded  that,  due  to  the  dense conifer  cover,  a  determination  of  the  actual  moose  population  and  rut  activity  in  the environmental study area would require a Fall survey after early snowfall (i.e. October). He also  reported  no  past  or  current  evidence  of  mountain  sheep  or  mountain  goat  in  the environmental  baseline  study  area.  Sheep  trails  on  upper  scree  slopes  and  ridges  were absent. He did note that the presence of these species is known to occur further north in the mountains east of Dorsey Lake but this is outside of the environmental baseline study area.

Lortie (2009) also noted that there was a lack of evidence of presence of golden eagle and  gyrofalcon.  Populations  of  ptarmigan  were  probably  limited  by  snow  depth  in  the Northern dancer region with a subsequent lack of gyrofalcon for which the ptarmigan is food source. Lortie also speculated that, even though vegetation in areas such as on a dry ridge to the immediate southeast of the drilling areas at Northern Dancer provided suitable

habitat for ground squirrels which are prey for eagles and gryrofalcons, their populations may also be limited by other factors.

Several moose, one grizzly with a two year old cub, and an inactive beaver house were identified within the environmental baseline study area. There were no sightings of caribou.

## 17.4.5 ARD Characterization

MESH Environmental Inc. (Mesh) was requested in 2008 to  conduct a  desktop  study  to identify potential environmental and/or permitting considerations for the Project. This work included  a  preliminary  analysis  of  geochemical  indicators  from  testwork  completed  in  20 drill core samples, 4 surface grab samples of weathered stockpile material that came from the adit (ref. Amax site activity (1977 - 1981), and 3 water quality samples.

Results  indicated  that,  while  sulphide  values  are  generally  considered  low  to  moderate, similarly low to moderate neutralization potential exists in the rock types anticipated to be excavated in an open pit operation. The majority of samples tended to classify as uncertain with respect to acid generating potential based on standard ABA testing. Based on limited results, the hornfels, diorite and quartz monzonite units would likely be considered PAG or uncertain,  albeit  with  relatively  low  sulphide  contents.  The  skarn  and  quartz  feldspar porphyry  unit  would  likely  be  considered  uncertain  to  non-PAG  with  respect  to  ARD classification. Material that had already been weathered in small stockpiles adjacent to the portal  (assumed  to  be  hornfels)  consistently  classified  as  PAG,  however  pH  values  are currently only weakly acidic after 26+ years of exposure and weathering.

Metal contents of all units consistently reported elevated levels of W and Mo as might be expected from the area, as well as Se. Occasionally, elevated contents of Bi, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, S and in one sample, F and U, were detected in certain samples representing the skarn and intrusive units, but not in the hornfels samples.

Leach extraction  tests  conducted  on  the  four  surface  samples  anticipated  to  be  hornfels indicated that the weathered material is slightly acidic with low alkalinity and conductivity values and low sulphate concentrations (4 to 40 mg/L) indicating relatively minimal content of minerals soluble in near neutral pH conditions. Leachate concentrations of Al, Cd, Cu, Mo and Zn were considered elevated based on a comparison to Canadian Water Quality Guidelines  for  the  Protection  of  Aquatic  Life.  Se  values  in  the  weathered  hornfels  were significantly lower than those in the drill core samples, indicating either high variability in the deposit, or the release of Se during the 26+ years of exposure and weathering.

The  ABA  tests  on  four  very  preliminary  tailings  samples  suggest  that  Sulphide  Rougher Tails can be produced that are likely non-potentially acid generating, with negligible sulphur content.

Other  tailings  streams  (such  as  Molybdenum  Rougher  Tails)  are  likely  to  contain  higher sulphur  content,  with  low  neutralization  potential,  such  that  acid  generation  potential  is

uncertain. Based on these preliminary results, it appears that there may be some potential for ARD and ML from the wastes associated with the Northern Dancer project, and potential for  Mo  and  Se  leaching  under  neutral  pH  conditions.  MESH  (2008)  concluded  that  more detailed testwork would be required to better delineate and quantify these issues.

## 17.4.6 Climatology Surveys

The Pelly Mountains region is highlighted by the Pelly Mountain range, within which the Property is located. Largo established a base weather station on the mountain and has been monitoring climatological conditions since 2008. Situated in higher elevations, the Property  experiences  mean  yearly  temperatures  near  -3  °C,  with  January  and  July means  near  -20  °C  and  10  °C  respectively.  Precipitation  is  moderate  throughout  the year, with a mean annual deposition of 500 to 650 mm. Largo intends to establish more robust climatological instrumentation and surveys of various parts of the environmental baseline study areas as the Project advances through the pre-development phase.

## 17.4.7 Permitting

Currently  there  are  only  limited  regulatory  environmental  monitoring  requirements  for  the site activities, as only the Yukon Mining Land Use permit, the Yukon Water Use permit and the equivalent  British Columbia  regulations  govern  exploration  activity  requirements. Environmental monitoring activities have been established at the Project in advance of and in preparation for project proposal development and project assessment using BC protocols and Metal Mining Effluent Regulations (MMER) guidelines as standards. By applying these standards to the environmental monitoring program, Largo is preparing for the program's eventual  application  to  authorizations  such  as  the  federal  MMER  and  territorial  quartz mining and water use regulations, and British Columbia mine development regulations.

MESH in 2008 conducted a preliminary  review  of  permitting  requirements.  It    concluded that, beyond some possible geochemical aspects that are yet to be sufficiently tested and based on previous work conducted  by Canamax (1983), there did not appear to be any major  environmental  or  ecological  constraints  to  the  development  of  the  Project.  MESH added that  key  issues  would  be  the  typical  fisheries  habitat  and  water  quality  concerns, which could be adversely impacted, particularly  by  the  large  volumes  of  waste  materials proposed  for  the  site.  MESH  made  several  recommendations  on  the  collecting  and/or upgrading of baseline information to help further understand how the Project would meet the current standards for detailed information.

MESH  in  2008  noted  that  in  moving  through  the  environmental  assessment  phase  of development,  the  project  will  likely  be  governed  by  a  relatively  new  process  under  the Yukon  Environmental  and  Socio-economic  Assessment  Act  (YESAA).  The  project  would also likely require an environmental assessment under the federal Canadian Environmental Assessment Act  (CEAA),  and  a  Section  2  Authorization  under  the  Metal  Mining  Effluent Regulations (MMER) for initially considered tailings storage scenarios. Key permits that are

likely  required  include  a  Yukon  Water  Licence  and  Yukon  Land  Use  Permit,  a  Territorial Hardrock (Quartz) Mining Permit, and BC Ministry of Forests Special Use Permit for use or upgrading of roads in BC. While YESAA allows for concurrent evaluation of environmental impacts  and  permits,  no  permits  can  be  issued  until  the  various  environmental  review processes have been completed. Overall timing for the YESAA process, once the Project Proposal  has  been  submitted,  and  excluding  time  for  the  proponent  to  respond  to supplemental information requests, is 348 to 858 days. And while the various review and permitting  processes  (i.e.  YESAA,  CEAA,  MMER)  attempt  to  operate  in  a  coordinated manner,  each  has  its  own  information  requirements  and  timelines.  To  minimize  the timeframe  required  to  move  through  the  environmental  and  permitting  processes,  it  is imperative to develop a thorough Project Proposal in consultation with all interested parties, and optimize engineering design through consideration of environmental consequences.

Largo  also  contracted  Hemmera  EnviroChem  Inc.  ('Hemmera')    in  2010  to  undertake  a review  of  environment  work  completed  on  the  Project  in  order  to  consider  future  data collection  requirements  related  to  environmental  baseline  studies,  provide  guidance  with respect  to  the  environmental  assessment  processes,  and  to  identify  any  important  next step(s) for the environmental approvals process. This was important as in discussions by Largo  with  BC  and  Yukon  Government  officials  YESAA  and  BCEAA  processes  could possibly adopt a harmonized environmental assessment approach and it was therefore felt that an independent and objective point of view on that possibility should be acquired from Hemmera who have a lot of experience in dealing with EA processes in both jurisdictions.

Hemmera noted that a preliminary project description consistent with Canadian Environmental Assessment (CEAA), British Columbian Environmental Assessment (BCEAA), and Yukon Economic and Socio-Economic Environmental Assessment (YESAA) requirements that acknowledged options, alternates and related project uncertainties could be prepared to facilitate  establishing  a  reasonable  basis  for  a  coordinated  environmental assessment process. Hemmera recommended that a range of activities be conducted to supplement  current  knowledge  should  include  studies  in  hydrology,  fisheries  and  water quality, wildlife and vegetation, and socio-economic factors.

Consequently,  Largo  plans  to  ensure  that  all  requirements  related  to  environmental  and socio-economic monitoring measures are implemented throughout the Property for all predevelopment  phases  of  the  Project,  the  life  of  mine,  and  to  prepare  for  any  regulatory instruments that may be applied to the Project.

## 17.5  Occupational Health and Safety

Largo has developed a comprehensive set of policies governing the activities of employees, consultants, subcontractors and visitors that apply to any activities on site or on behalf of the company. A field manual has been prepared outlining Largo's occupational health and safety  policies.  Field  employees  are  required  to  attend  an  annual  field  orientation  safety program and be aware of emergency measures and incident reporting procedures. Largo

requires that all its employees, subcontractors, and consultants have appropriate coverage through the relevant Worker Compensation Health and Safety jurisdiction.

## 17.6  Community Relations

Northern  Dancer  is  located  within  the  traditional  territory  of  the  Teslin  Tlingit  Council ('TTC'), a First Nation government whose members primarily reside in the community of Teslin, Yukon. Largo has held several meetings with the TTC, other community groups in Teslin  and  Yukon,  and  representatives  from  the  Governments  of  Yukon  and  Canada  to provide regular updates on exploration activities and related environmental and engineering studies for the Project.

Largo is now preparing to enter into the EIA process and will be working with the relevant First  Nations  groups  to  initiate  a  traditional  knowledge  of  the  Project  area  and  to  also discuss  the  range  of  study  findings  and  subsequent  proposed  plans  for  the  mine development. Data will be collected to describe the human environment which will include, but may not be limited to, land use, archaeology, and socio-economics.

## 17.7  Markets

Tungsten  has  particular  properties  that  are  important  to  many  industries.  Its  very  high melting point and  density  make  it invaluable for cutting tools across  a  variety of applications,  with  this  reportedly  accounting  for  about  60%  of  demand.  The  high  melting point also has applications for military hardware.  China is the dominant supplier and, for this  reason,  tungsten  has  been  deemed  to  be  a  strategic  metal.  Exports  from  China  are reported to have decreased since 2008 and, as of February 2011, prices were around all time highs.

A detailed market study has not been completed for tungsten but the current high demand, and potential expansion of applications and emerging market demand suggest that market conditions may be robust in the future.

## 17.7.1 Tungsten - APT Price

Markets  for  the  sale  of  tungsten  products  including  APT  are  currently  very  buoyant  with prices in March 2011 reaching in excess of US$400 per mtu, as indicated by the following chart provided through www.metal-pages.com.

Figure 17.10  Tungsten APT Price

<!-- image -->

The PEA has assumed a price of US$275 per mtu for a base case analysis. AMC considers this to be a reasonably conservative price given the recent history of tungsten prices.

## 17.7.2 Molybdenum - Roasted Concentrates

The main use of molybdenum is in high strength steel alloys, which find uses in a variety of applications  including  the  automotive  and  energy  industries  and  construction  projects. Molybdenum  has  a  particular  ability  in  high  temperature  applications  and  for  corrosion reduction.

Markets for the sale of molybdenum products including molybdenum roasted concentrates have remained fairly stable over the last few years within a range of US$12 -US$18 per lb after sustaining higher levels of about US$35 per lb prior to late 2008, as indicated by the following chart provided through www.metal-pages.com.

Figure 17.11  Molybdenum Roasted Concentrates Price

<!-- image -->

A  report  by  Metal-Pages  dated  16  February  2011  by  analysts  at  New  York-based  CPM Group  predicted that molybdenum roasted concentrate prices will average $US21.75/lb in 2011, rising to $28.50/lb in 2012, according to projections.

It  was considered to be relatively conservative to assume a base case price of US$17.50 per lb for the purposes of the PEA.

## 17.8  Contracts

No  contracts  have  been  established  to  date  for  sales  of  tungsten  and/or  molybdenum concentrates.

## 17.9 Taxes

The  current  economic  analysis  has  been  completed  on  a  before-tax  basis.  With  further project planning Largo will be seeking an interpretation of applicable taxes that will relate to the project from the Governments of Yukon, British Columbia, and Canada.

## 17.10 Operating Cost Estimate

## 17.10.1  Process Operating Cost Estimate

Process operating cost estimates includes costs for operating and maintaining the process and APT plants from primary crusher feed through to concentrate load out facilities, tailings management,  and  the  APT  processing  including  residue  disposal  of  the  same.  Total average life of mine operating cost for the combined process and APT plants is estimated at US$67.5M/a, or US$6.01/t of feed material processed.  These costs include major cost centres  such  as  labour,  power,  consumables,  maintenance,  reagents,  fuel  oil  and  other miscellaneous items and are shown in Table 17.20.

Table 17.20 Estimate of Process Operating Costs

| Cost Centre   |   US$M/a |   US$/t |
|---------------|----------|---------|
| Labour        |     10.1 |    0.9  |
| Power         |     14.2 |    1.26 |
| Consumables   |     40   |    3.56 |
| Misc/Other    |      3.2 |    0.29 |
| Total         |     67.5 |    6.01 |

The  estimated  process  operating  costs  are  also  summarized  below  in  Table  17.21  as: Concentrator operations @ C$4.71/t and APT operations @ C$1.88/t. The sum of these figures converted to $US is approximately $US6.01/t.

Consumables,  the  largest  cost  centre,  include  reagents,  grinding  steel  and  maintenance supplies. Labour costs include management  and  labour for plant operations and maintenance.  Estimates of consumable use are based on test results and past experience, while  consumable  prices  are  based  on  in-house  data  base  for  the  same.  All  freight  for consumables  is  included  in  the  prices.  Maintenance  supplies  and  repairs  are  based  on factors  on  capital  costs  as  widely  used  in  the  industry.  Power  consumption  is  based  on average loads obtained from the preliminary equipment list and experience of other process estimates.

CDN$ Exchange rate used is 0.91 and power cost used for the estimate is US$0.046/kWh.

Table 17.21 outlines the summary of estimated operating costs.

## 17.11 Capital Cost Estimate

The estimated total project capital cost is $C 824M. Contingencies have been applied in individual project areas together with a global contingency of $C126M (20%). The overall project  capital  contingency  is  $C177M  (27%).The  pre-production  portion  of  the  Capital Costs is estimated to be $C718 million which includes contingency. Sustaining capital costs are assessed at an average of $C5.32M per production year. Table 17.22 shows the Mine capital estimate and Table 17.23 shows the mill and infrastructure capital estimate.

A further breakdown of the surface facilities capital cost is as follows:

## 17.11.1  Surface facilities capital cost estimate

The Capital Cost Estimate below is for the surface facilities of the Northern Dancer Project. The surface facilities are part of the overall tungsten-molybdenum project described in this Preliminary Economic Assessment.

The  estimate  was  prepared  in  US  Dollars  and  was  based  on  prices  ruling  February  11, 2011. An exchange rate of Can$1.00 = US$1.00 was used.

The Capital Cost Estimate for the Surface Facilities is summarized in Table 17.24.

Excluded  from  Indirect  Capital  Costs  which  are  not  dealt  with  in  the  PEA  report  are; escalation, taxes, and duties. Should this project proceed to the pre-feasibility level, these costs must be determined.

## Assumptions

Aggregates  and  backfill  soils  are  available  locally;  actual  soil  bearing  conditions  are adequate for estimated foundations; the construction work will be continuous

## Process Equipment

Based on current preliminary process flow sheets, an equipment list of major process and mechanical equipment was developed by Bolu Consulting Inc. for the concentrator and APT plants.  Major equipment prices were obtained from in-house data. All other equipment was estimated using factored costs from similar projects.

## Buildings

The milling and concentrator building envelope was estimated to be 12,000m  in size and 2 the APT building 1,900m . A truck shop suitable for servicing the ore trucks in all weather 2 was estimated based on recent experience. All other buildings were sized and priced based on similar projects.

## Labour

Installation man-hours and costs were estimated as a % of direct costs based on historical data.  A  factor  of  30%  was  added  to  account  for  the  remote,  northern  conditions  and  a tightening labour supply.

## EPCM

The  EPCM  costs  were  estimated  as  13%  of  the  direct  costs.  This  estimate  took  into account the remote, northern conditions for the CM work.

## Contingency

A  contingency  of  25%  was  added  to  all  direct  and  indirect  costs  to  reflect  the  level  of estimate.

## 17.12 Economic Analysis

The assumption was made that the mining fleet was leased from Caterpillar. A mining cost of C$2.20/t has been assumed for both ore and waste.

The undiscounted cash-flow summary for the mine is shown in Table 17.25.

## 17.13 Mine Life

The financial projections associated with this preliminary economic assessment employ a mining rate for ore and waste of approximately 30M tpa for 23 years. During this time there will be sufficient ore stock piled to run the process plant for another 26 years once mining has stopped.

## 17.13.1  Production Quantities Based on Grade

A summary of the mining schedule is shown in Table 17.27. The adopted pit contains a total  tonnage  of  approximately  624Mt.  The  mill  feed  schedule  is  shown  in  Table  17.28. Plant feed fraction totaled 545Mt grading 0.08% WO3 and 0.02% Mo.

## 18 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS

The Northern Dancer property is a tungsten molybdenum deposit in the Yukon Territory that has been explored by several surface mapping and diamond drilling programs. A tungstenmolybdenum mineralized skarn-porphyry system has been outlined by historic drilling to a depth of at least 500 m. Drilling during the 2007 and 2008 drilling programs succeeded in confirming  the  presence  of  tungsten  and  molybdenum  mineralization  in  the  deposit,  and increasing confidence in the Northern Dancer Mineral Resource estimate. The 2008 drilling program  was  successful in partially delineating zones  with elevated tungsten and molybdenum. Additional infill drilling in the vicinity of these zones will assist in delineation refinement and raise confidence in geological and grade continuity associated with them.

There  is  sufficient  drilling  and  with  drilling  data  being  of  acceptable  quality  to  support  a Measured  and  Indicated  classification  for  a  portion  of  the  Northern  Dancer  Mineral Resource. Largo has conducted additional delineation type drilling in 2010; however those results are not included in this report. The results of this additional drilling will be addressed in  the  next study phase. A Measured, Indicated and Inferred Mineral Resource has been estimated  using  information  from  134  diamond  drill  holes  drilled  on  the  property.  That estimate (the March 12, 2009 Mineral Resource Estimate), reported at a 0.06% WO3 cut-off grade, contains Measured mineral resources of 30.8 million tonnes grading 0.114% WO3 and 0.030% Mo, and Indicated mineral resources of 192.6 million tonnes grading 0.100% WO3  and  0.029%  Mo.  The  Measured  and  Indicated  mineral  resource  estimate  contains 500.1  million  pounds  of  WO3  (226.8  k  tonnes)  and  143.8  million  pounds  of  Mo  (65.3  k tonnes).  Inferred  mineral  resources  were  estimated  to  be  201.2  million  tonnes  grading 0.089% WO3 and 0.024% Mo containing 393.1 million pounds of WO3 (178.3 k tonnes) and 107.7 million pounds of Mo (48.9 k tonnes). The cut-off grade at 0.06% was based on the assumption  that  the  deposit  could  be  mined  by  open-pit  mining  and  that  tungsten  and molybdenum would be economically recoverable using economic parameters appropriate for a 2009 estimate. The assumptions used were not confirmed by appropriate economic studies. For the purpose of the 2011 PEA and this Technical Report AMC has calculated a new cut-off grade of 0.04% WO3 based on current metal prices and what it considers are reasonable  assumptions  for  exchange  rate  and  operating  costs.  The  mineral  inventory based at 0.04% WO3 cut-off grade is shown below:

AMC  recommends  that  in  the  next  phase  of  this  project  a  new  resource  estimate  be established reflecting contemporary prices and other relevant information.

Largo has conducted various environmental investigations since 2007 in an effort to collect required  environmental  baseline  data  for  filing  of  a  project  description  with  appropriate regulatory  authorities  in  Yukon,  British  Columbia,  and  Canada.  Efforts  to  date  have concluded that, beyond some possible geochemical aspects that are yet to be sufficiently tested, there do not appear to be any major environmental or ecological constraints to the development of the Project (MESH, 2008). This is encouraging Largo to advance a range of studies in order to complete a comprehensive environmental and socio-economic assessment of the Project as soon as possible. It has also led to the conclusion that there appear  to  be  no  major  environmental  or  ecological  constraints  that  impact  the  potential economics of the Project. AMC considers that this conclusion is reasonable at this stage of the  project  but  that  the  projected  comprehensive  assessment  is  necessary  to  provide  a more definitive basis for that conclusion.

The results of the mining section of this report indicate that mining of the Northern Dancer deposit  by  open  pit  methods  is  a  viable  option  from  a  practical  operations  perspective, subject to the risks and opportunities covered in section 17.1.8. Total mining production has been  estimated  at  545.24Mt  over  a  23  year  Life  of  Mine.  Ore  processed  has  been estimated  at  545.24Mt  at  average  grades  of  .08%  WO3  and  0.02%  Mo  and  assuming  a 11.2Mtpa processing rate for 49 years.

A  very  preliminary  design  and  budget  is  included  in  this  report  for  the  potential  tailings disposal program. This will require an in-depth review to assess viability for the PFS phase.

Based on the current understanding of the Northern Dancer deposit, and assuming longterm metal prices of $US 275/mtu of WO3 and molybdenum $US 17.5/lb, exchange rate of $C  1.00  =  $US  0.91  and  WO3  overall  recovery  to  concentrate  of  75%  and  Mo  overall recovery to concentrate of 72% respectively;

- · Cumulative undiscounted cash flow is $C 5.299 billion (before taxes and depreciation).
- · Pre-tax Net Present Value (NPV) at an 8% discount rate is $C1, 009M
- · The project has an unleveraged Internal Rate of Return (IRR) from the project start date (Year -2) of 20.0%.
- · Payback is achieved in Year 6 of production (Year 8 from start of project).

An economic sensitivity assessment has shown that, for the resource, price, cost and other key parameter assumptions used in the project, it is most sensitive to metal price and grade moderately sensitive to operating cost and less sensitive to capital cost variations.

The  main  conclusion  from  the  PEA  is  that,  barring  any  major  and  prolonged  decline  in tungsten  and  molybdenum  prices,  the  next  logical  step  for  the  project  is  to  move  to  a prefeasibility study phase. A list of recommendations relevant to that next step is found in Section 19 below.

## 19 RECOMMENDATIONS

The list of recommendations encompasses comments from the various contributors to the Technical Report. AMC recommends the following actions be undertaken:

## · Exploration and Resource upgrade

- o Re-examine  the  deposit  and  produce  a  revised  resource  estimate  using  all appropriate drilling, up-to-date pricing and costs, and other relevant information. The revised pit outline produced for the PEA may form the basis for that estimate but AMC notes  that  further  exploration  work  will  be  required  to  upgrade  the  inferred portions  of  the  resource  unless  a  lower  tonnage  option  based  on  the  current measured and indicated resource is selected.
- o In  t h e  future  drilling  programs  incorporate  recommendations  on  downhole  survey data collection requirements as per section 13.2 of this report.
- o Revisit  the  previous  QA/QC  database  and  investigate  and  resolve  issues  as  per recommendations in section 13.2 of this report.
- Estimated cost of infill drilling and assaying program is $1,950,000. (The resource estimation cost is included in the PFS study estimate below).

## · Geotechnical Investigations

- o Collect additional geotechnical data to allow determination of suitable geotechnical parameters for pit wall slope design. This work would include drilling, data collection and assessment. Estimated cost of the geotechnical investigation is $675,000.

## · Additional Metallurgical and Processing Test Work

- o Undertake additional metallurgical test work on composite samples that represent the higher grade material outlined in the 2009 Mineral Resource Estimate.
- o Perform  density  testing  on  any  and  all  metallurgical  samples  collected  to  provide additional  verification  of  the  density  database.  Continue  to  collect  representative density measurements on drillhole core for additional drilling programs to be initiated on the property, especially for the units with more variable densities (e.g., skarn). Request  all  density  QAQC  data  from  the  independent  laboratory  conducting  the density testing. All future sampling programs should include an analysis of fluorine (as  CaF2)  due  to  its  deleterious  influence  on  metallurgical  recovery  of  tungsten. Should  additional  metallurgical  test  work  indicate  that  fluorine  presence  is  a significant  issue,  its  implications  should  be  included  in  future  Mineral  Resource estimates.
- o Generate processing flowsheet, metal recoveries and PFS level plant design.
- Estimated cost for the above metallurgical and process testing is $450,000.

## · Environmental and Socio-Economic Assessment

- o Advance a comprehensive environmental and socio-economic assessment concurrently with completing a prefeasibility of the project. Due to the broad range of activities  associated  with  this  proposed  assessment,  a  two  phased  approach  is suggested. Phase I of the project will develop an implementation plan that will also better define required activities and associated costs. Phase II will cover implementation  of  those  activities  in  order  to  prepare  a  Project  Description  for regulatory  authorities.  Estimated  cost  for  Phase  I  is  $50,000  and  the  program implementation is expected to be in the range of $1,000,000.

## · Mine Engineering and Prefeasibility Study

- o New  Resource  Estimate: Following  the  infill  drill  program  create  a  new  block model and produce a revised resource estimate. Estimated cost $100,000.
- o Infrastructure and Site Investigations: Conduct a PFS level assessment of civil related  issues  -  road  alignments,  avalanche  analysis,  survey  benchmarks,  and  a topographic survey. Estimated cost $250,000.
- o Hydrogeology Investigations: Conduct  a  field  work  program,  data  analysis  and reporting. It should be possible to combine the hydrogeological field work with the geotechnical drilling program. The hydrogeological work is estimated to cost of the order of $150,000.
-  Contractor Analysis: Evaluate the benefits of using a mining contractor vs. an owner operator scenario, including investigating the quality and availability of suitable contractors in the region. Estimated cost $50,000.
-  Drill  and  Blast  Study: Perform  a  more  detailed  investigation  into  suitable blasting  parameters.  This  information  will  help  determine  suitable  powder factors and explosive type mixes, which will flow on into the operating costs. This  should  include  investigating  the  quality  and  availability  of  suitable explosives supply and contract blasting groups within the region. Assuming that  good  rock  characteristic  data  is  available,  the  estimated  cost  of  this recommendation is $10,000.
-  Cut-off Grade Optimization: Complete a cut-off grade study to determine if varying the cut-off grade over the life of the mine with the current schedule has  a  material  effect  on  the  NPV  of  the  project.  Particularly  examine  the impact  of  running  for  a  significant  number  of  years  in  the  later  part  of  the project at low grade. The estimated cost of this recommendation is $40,000.
-  Schedule  Optimization: Re-schedule  the  project  using  an  automated schedule  optimization  package  such  as  MineMax  Scheduler.  This  can  be

completed independently or simultaneously with the cut-off grade optimization. Estimated cost $80,000.

- o Fleet  Size  Optimization :  Complete  a study  into  the  sizing  of  the  loading equipment and truck fleet comparing fleet numbers, capital and mining rates, examining  possible  effects  on  dilution,  mining  recovery  and  downstream effects on processing and revenue. Estimated cost $15,000.
- o Energy Evaluation: Further investigate energy alternatives relative to the importance  of  power  as  a  major  part  of  both  capital  and  operating  costs  of  this project.  This  will  include  a  comprehensive  evaluation  of  all  energy  options  for  the project  and  then  definition  of  an  improved  cost  estimate  of  the  preferred  energy alternative  (likely  to  be  run-of-river);  this  assessment  will  go  beyond  the    initial evaluation given in this report to also address development specific issues with that alternative. Estimated cost of this study is: $75,000
- o Waste  and  Tails  Management: Develop  a  better  understanding  and  produce  a more definitive plan for the proposed tails management facility. Estimated cost of a study is $100,000.
- o Community Relations: Maintain  an  ongoing  liaison  and  consultation  with  groups such as Teslin Tlingit Council and the community of Teslin and others. Estimated cost is $50,000.
- o Market  and  Transportation  Analysis: Pursue  a  strategy  to  identify  optimized markets and evaluate the most economic mode of final product transport to those markets. Estimated cost is $50,000.
- o Project Management,  Cost  and  Economics  Assessment  and  Reporting: Manage project and coordinate sub-consultants over all PFS project aspects. Peer review  geology,  geotechnical,  mining  and  processing  report  sections.  Co-ordinate and/or conduct cost estimating. Perform financial and economic analysis. Perform site visits and generate final PFS report. Estimated cost is $250,000.
