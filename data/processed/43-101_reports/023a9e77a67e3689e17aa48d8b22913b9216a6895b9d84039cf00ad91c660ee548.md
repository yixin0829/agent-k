## 1 SUMMARY

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Scott Wilson Roscoe Postle Associates Inc. (Scott Wilson RPA) was retained by First Nickel Inc. (FNI) to carry out a resource estimate and prepare an independent Technical Report for the Conwest Zone on the West Graham property, Sudbury area, Ontario.  This Technical Report conforms to NI 43-101 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects. Scott Wilson RPA visited the property on November 26, 2008.

FNI is a nickel-copper producer and exploration company listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange  (TSX).    FNI  acquired  the  Lockerby  Mine  from  Falconbridge  Limited (Falconbridge), now Xstrata Canada Inc. (Xstrata), in May 2005, reopened the mine and produced run of the mine crushed ore from the Depth and East zones, selling it to Xstrata under an Off-Take agreement.  Lockerby operated from December 2005 to October 19, 2008, when operations were suspended due to falling nickel prices.

The West Graham property, east adjacent to the Lockerby Mine, is being explored and  evaluated  by  FNI  under  the  terms  of  an  earn-in  option  agreement  with  Landore Resources  Canada  Inc.  (Landore).    FNI  may  earn  up  to  85%  interest  in  the  property subject  to  a  2%  net  smelter  return  (NSR)  royalty.    The  Conwest  Zone  on  the  West Graham  property  was  discovered  by  drilling  in  1960  and  has  witnessed  three  drilling campaigns, the last of which was by FNI in 2007-2008.  The deposit lies at a depth of 50 m and approximately 150 m up dip of the Lockerby Mine East Zone and thus has the potential for access from the East Zone underground workings as well as the Lockerby Mine infrastructure.

## INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS

Scott Wilson RPA independently estimated Mineral Resources for the Conwest Zone on the West Graham property.  The Conwest Zone is interpreted to represent a large, low grade Ni-Cu-Co-Ag±PGE±Au bearing contact-type disseminated sulphide deposit hosted

by  dark  norite  and  located  stratigraphically  above  sublayer  norite  at  the  base  of  the Sudbury Igneous Complex.  The Conwest Zone tops at 45 m depth, extends for some 375 m on strike and 573 m along dip and is up to 66 m thick.  The zone dips moderately at approximately 53º to the north and is 500 m up dip from the Lockerby Mine East Zone, which was developed and has witnessed limited mining by Falconbridge and FNI in the past.    The  Conwest  Zone  continues  onto  Vale  Inco's  Corridor  Claim  to  the  west, however,  no  drilling  data  for  the  Vale  Inco  property  were  available  for  the  resource estimate  and  the  resource  estimate  is  terminated  to  within  five  metres  of  the  west boundary to allow for a boundary pillar.

The resource estimate is  based  entirely  on  surface  diamond  drilling,  core  sampling and assaying.  Drilling was completed in three campaigns by three operators since the 1960s.  FNI's drilling was designed to fill-in and expand the zone, resulting in a 25 m drill  hole  section  spacing  with  30  m  to  50  m  zone  intercepts  along  dip  to  provide sufficient sampling to class a portion of the resources as Indicated.

Scott Wilson RPA reviewed and audited the drilling and assaying data and the drill hole database.  Scott Wilson RPA is of the opinion that the exploration has been industry standard and in compliance with best practices.  The sampling and assaying and database preparation  are  industry  standard  and  acceptable  for  Mineral  Resource  and  Mineral Reserve  estimation,  however,  there  is  some  risk  arising  from  the  lack  of  downhole surveys, with only dip tests available for the 1960s holes as further noted below.

The resource estimate was carried out by conventional wireframing of mineralization at  0.30%  nickel  equivalent  (NiEq)  and  3D  computer  block  modelling  using  ordinary kriging for grade interpolation.  The resource was classified into Indicated and Inferred based on drill hole and sampling density.  Drilling is focused in the area close to the west and north property boundaries, where Indicated Resources are delineated, and becomes more widely spaced to the east, where Inferred Resources are outlined.  The wireframed mineral  envelope  is  estimated  to  contain  8.55  million  tonnes  of  Indicated  Resources averaging  0.45%  Ni,  0.31%  Cu  and  0.01%  Co  and  2.0  million  tonnes  of  Inferred Resources averaging 0.38% Ni, 0.30% Cu and 0.01% Co.

## SCOTT WILSON RPA

Scott Wilson RPA notes that the downhole deviation surveys for the 1960s drilling by Conwest  Exploration  Company  (Conwest)  were  limited  but  industry  standard  for  the time.  Coupled with the tendency to higher deviation for the narrower diameter (AX) drill tooling  used,  there  is  some  uncertainty  in  the  spatial  location  of  the  Conwest  assay intercepts with respect to the well-located Falconbridge and FNI drilling resulting from modern, industry standard downhole surveys.  In addition, the Conwest assays for nickel appear to be somewhat higher overall than the Falconbridge and FNI assays and there may be a problem with the assays for three consecutive Conwest drill holes on the west side  of  the  deposit  adjacent  to  the  property  boundary.    These  assays  are  located  in  the upper portion of the zone where there is proportionately less sampling by Falconbridge and FNI.

## RECOMMENDATIONS

Scott Wilson RPA has the following recommendations:

- · Complete  metallurgical  testing  to  confirm  metal  recoveries  by  conventional processing.
- · Carry  out  a  scoping  study/preliminary  assessment  of  the  Conwest  Zone  to evaluate  the  potential  for  economic  viability  and  consider  options  as  either  a stand-alone milling operation or with mine production sold to Xstrata as part of the FNI-Xstrata Off-Take agreement, metallurgical aspects permitting.
- · Contingent on encouragement from the preliminary economic assessment:
- o Twin  Conwest  holes  WG-25  to  WG-27  to  verify  their  higher  grade  nickel intercepts.
- o Carry  out  diamond  drilling  on  the  east  portion  of  the  zone  to  upgrade  the Inferred Resources to Indicated Resources.
- o Update  the  Conwest  Zone  resource  estimate  to  reflect  additional  drill  hole data.

In consultation with FNI,  Scott Wilson  RPA  has  prepared  a  budget  for  the recommended work (Table 1-1).

## TECHNICAL SUMMARY

## PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION

The  West  Graham  property  is  located  in  Graham  Township,  Sudbury  District, Sudbury Mining Division, Ontario, some 30 km west of the city of Sudbury and at the southwestern  end  of  the  South  Range  of  the  Sudbury  Igneous  Complex.  The  property consists of 129.9 ha contained in the patented Parcel 29073 that occupies the N½ and S½ of Lot 12, Concession 5, Graham Township.

Lot 12 is located 1.5 km east of the Lockerby Mine and is bordered on the east and south by the Vale Inco property, on the north by the FNI Lockerby Mine property, and on the west by the Lockerby Mine and Vale Inco holdings.  The Vale Inco claim on the west is  known  as  the  'Corridor  Claim'  or  'Crean  Hill  #3'  and  is  surrounded  by  the  FNI property.  The Lockerby East Zone, down dip from the Conwest Zone, is located on FNI parcel numbers 9106 SWS to 9109 SWS in Lot 12 Concession 6 to the north of the West Graham property.

## LAND TENURE

Title to the West Graham patented claims is held by Landore and is maintained by the annual payment of taxes of $519.62.  The patents include surface and mineral rights.

Under the terms of an option agreement executed on November 21, 2005, FNI may earn up to an 85% interest in the West Graham property subject to a 2% NSR royalty. The agreement calls for payment of $150,000 in cash and the expenditure of $6 million on exploration and development on the property over four years to earn a 70% interest. Once  FNI  has  vested  to  70%,  Landore  can  elect  to  participate  in  further  work  on  the property to maintain its 30% interest.  Should Landore decline participation, FNI has the right to increase its interest to 85% by completing a bankable feasibility study over two years thereafter.

## SITE INFRASTRUCTURE

Site  infrastructure  is  limited  to  dirt  roads  and  bush  roads.    The  Lockerby  Mine complex is within 1.5 km to the west, with the nearest underground mine access being to the  Lockerby Mine East Zone some 500 m down dip and to the north of the Conwest Zone.

## HISTORY

The Conwest deposit was discovered in 1960 by Conwest.  Conwest diamond drilled 27 holes (6,447.19 m) in 1960-1961 and 1969 and estimated a mineral inventory at 4.3 million  tons  (3.9  million  tonnes)  averaging  0.52%  Ni  and  0.33%  Cu.    This  historic estimate  predates  the  implementation  of  NI  43-101  reporting  regulations  and  Scott Wilson  RPA  considers  it  to  be  non-compliant  with  CIM/NI  43-101  standards  and guidelines.

From  1987  to  1989,  Falconbridge  carried  out  airborne  geophysical  surveys  and geologic mapping followed by the diamond drilling of six holes totalling 7,403.03 m and downhole pulse electromagnetic (PEM) geophysical surveys.

Landore  acquired  the  West  Graham  property  in  a  reverse  takeover  of  Brancote Canada  Ltd.  in  2001  but  did  not  undertake  significant  exploration.    FNI  commenced exploration in 2005 after signing the earn-in agreement with Landore in August 2005.

FNI completed 14.8 line kilometres of magnetometer surveys and 11.8 line kilometres of deep penetrating, gradient induced polarization surveying.  From 2005 to 2008, FNI diamond drilled 62 holes totalling 22,237.5 m on the West Graham property.  Selected FNI holes were surveyed downhole by UTEM (large loop time domain electromagnetic survey) and PEM geophysical methods.  The drill hole spacing, at approximately 25 m sections and 30 m to 50 m zone intercepts along dip, has been designed by FNI to provide the drilling density acceptable for resource estimation under CIM definitions

All diamond drilling on the property to date has been from surface.

## GEOLOGY

The West Graham property is situated in the southwest area of the Sudbury Igneous Complex (SIC) South Range.  The SIC straddles the boundary between the Archean-aged Superior  Geologic  Province  to  the  north  and  west,  and  the  Southern  Province  of  early Proterozoic  age  (Huronian)  to  the  south  and  east.    The  Grenville  Front,  the  northern margin of the Grenville Province, lies about 10 km to the southeast of the SIC.

The northern portion of the West Graham property straddles the contact of the lower norite  unit  of  the  SIC  and  the  Creighton  Pluton.    The  contact  dips  at  45º  to  50º  to  the north.  A discontinuous sublayer norite is exposed on the western portion of the property at the SIC contact.  The sublayer unit, identified by diamond drilling, occurs above the basal  contact  of  the  SIC  and  is  unusual  in  terms  of  both  its  stratigraphic  location  and composition.  This sublayer unit contains fragments of granite and norite.

The Conwest Zone is located on the northwest portion of the West Graham property. The contact style mineralization, as traced by drilling, forms a continuous body striking east-west and dipping 53º north.  The Conwest Zone extends from 40 m below surface to a depth of approximately 475 m.  Sulphides occur in the norite above the sublayer norite and at the SIC contact.  As modelled at 0.3% NiEq, the zone ranges from 1.7 m to 66 m thick and strikes for 375 m with a dip extent of up to 533 m.  At depth, the Conwest Zone is interpreted to be contiguous with the Lockerby Mine East Zone.  Drilling has tested the

Conwest  Zone  to  the  west  boundary  of  the  West  Graham  property  where  the  zone continues onto the Corridor Claim held by Vale Inco.

The Conwest Zone is composed of disseminated, blebby, stringer and semi-massive sulphide zones hosted entirely within the norite unit some 30 m to 100 m above the SICbasement  contact.    The  nickel  mineralization  is  generally  low  grade,  however,  higher grade  zones  in  excess  of  1%  Ni  have  been  intersected  within  the  broader  envelope  of disseminated sulphides.

Pyrrhotite, chalcopyrite and pentlandite are the dominant sulphides within the zone. The  nickel  content  of  sulphides  is  8%  to  10%  and  is  high  for  the  Sudbury  camp, reflecting  the  relatively  pentlandite-rich  nature  of  the  sulphides.    Within  the  resource wireframe contoured at 0.3% NiEq, the nickel in sulphide averages 8.25%.

## MINERAL RESOURCES

The resource estimate was prepared by conventional 3D computer block modelling based  on  surface  diamond  drill  hole  data  and  utilizing  ordinary  kriging  for  grade interpolation.    Grade  was  estimated  for  Ni,  Cu,  Co,  Pt,  Pd,  Au,  Ag,  S  and  NiEq.    The estimate was constrained by geological interpretation and a wireframe model based on contouring a NiEq grade of 0.3%.  NiEq factors are based on Ni, Cu and Co grades and are derived from metal accountability in the FNI-Xstrata Off-Take agreement.  The factor is:  NiEq% = Ni% + (0.32 x Cu%) + (0.53 x Co%).  The precious metals are generally low.

The resource is estimated on the West Graham property to within five metres of the Vale  Inco  Corridor  Claim  boundary  assuming  a  pillar  will  be  left  allowing  for independent mining on both sides of the north-south property boundary.  Resources tied up in the pillar are reported independently.  The resource was classified into Indicated and Inferred Mineral Resources based on drill hole and sampling density.  Appropriate validation  checks  were  performed  to  ensure  the  estimate  is  reasonable.    Table  1-2 summarizes the Mineral Resources.  Table 1-3 shows the resources at various incremental NiEq block cut-off grades.

## MINERAL RESERVES

No pre-feasibility study or feasibility study has been carried out by Landore or FNI and  consequently,  under  CIM  definitions,  there  are  no  reserves  reported  for  the  West Graham property.

## METALLURGY AND MINERAL PROCESSING

FNI is undertaking a metallurgical study of the Conwest deposit concurrently with the resource estimate carried out in this report.  During the third quarter of 2008 a composite sample was prepared from drill core and submitted to SGS Lakefield Research Limited, Lakefield, Ontario, for preliminary metallurgical test work  consisting of sample preparation  and  rougher  kinetic  tests,  which  will  provide  an  estimate  of  the  recovery characteristics for the Conwest deposit.  Samples for compositing were selected so as to provide a head grade of 0.5% NiEq assuming low grade bulk mining, to reflect differing mineralogy and styles of mineralization, and to be spatially representative of the deposit.

Results are pending.

## ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS

No  environmental  permitting  has  been  completed  by  FNI  for  the  West  Graham property, however, the claims fall within the area of the MMER study (Mining Effluent Regulations  of  the  Fisheries  Act) completed  for  the  Lockerby  Mine  and  submitted  to Environment Canada in 2006.  FNI is currently in the process of completing the second cycle EEM (Mining Environmental Effects Monitoring) - MMER report for the period of 2006 to 2008.

## 2 INTRODUCTION AND TERMS OF REFERENCE

Scott Wilson Roscoe Postle Associates Inc. (Scott Wilson RPA) was retained by First Nickel Inc. (FNI) to carry out a resource estimate and prepare an independent Technical Report for  the  Conwest  Zone  on  the  West  Graham  property,  adjacent  to  the  Lockerby Mine, Graham Township, Sudbury area, Ontario.  This Technical Report conforms to NI 43-101 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects.

FNI is a nickel-copper producer and exploration company listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange  (TSX).    FNI  acquired  the  Lockerby  Mine  from  Falconbridge  Limited (Falconbridge), now Xstrata Canada Inc. (Xstrata), in May 2005, reopened the mine and produced run of the mine crushed ore from the Depth and East zones, selling it to Xstrata under an Off-Take agreement.  Lockerby operated from December 2005 to October 19, 2008, when operations were suspended due to falling nickel prices.

The West Graham property, east adjacent to the Lockerby Mine, is being explored and  evaluated  by  FNI  under  the  terms  of  an  earn-in  option  agreement  with  Landore Resources Canada Inc.  FNI may earn up to 85% interest in the property subject to a 2% net smelter return (NSR) royalty.  The Conwest Zone on the West Graham property was discovered  by  drilling  in  1960  and  has  witnessed  three  drilling  campaigns,  the  last  of which was by FNI in 2005-2008.  The deposit lies at a depth of 50 m and approximately 500 m up dip of the Lockerby Mine East Zone and thus has the potential for access from the East Zone underground workings as well as the Lockerby Mine infrastructure.  The latter includes:

- · The physical plant site  including  mine  shafts  and  associated  facilities,  paste backfill plant, coarse ore bin, ventilation, workshops, warehouses, administration buildings, and dry facilities.
- · Facilities  including  electric  power,  heat,  water  treatment  and  supply,  and sewage treatment.
- · Underground  infrastructure  including  two  mine  shafts,  ramps,  ventilation raises, maintenance shops, and mobile equipment fleet.

- · Access by highway and gravel roads to Sudbury area mills and smelters.

Scott  Wilson  RPA  has  no  prior  involvement  with  the  West  Graham  property, however,  Scott  Wilson  RPA  has  prepared  three  technical  reports  for  the  adjacent Lockerby Mine property:

- 1. Technical report on the Lockerby Mine, Sudbury, Ontario (Clow et al., 2005)
- 2. Technical  report  on  the  2007  resource  estimate  for  the  Depth  and  East  zones, Lockerby Mine, Sudbury, Ontario (Routledge, 2007)

## 4 PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION

The  West  Graham  property  is  located  in  Graham  Township,  Sudbury  District, Ontario,  some  30  km  west  of  the  city  of  Sudbury  and  at  the  southwestern  end  of  the South Range of the Sudbury Igneous Complex (Figure 4-1).

The property is patented Parcel 29073 which consists of 129.9 ha contained in the N½ and S½ of Lot 12, Concession 5, Graham Township.  Lot 12 is centred approximately at:

Latitude 46º 25' 4.7'N; longitude 81º 18' 46.3'

UTM Zone 17, 476,850E, 5,141,600N (NAD 27)

Lot 12 is located 1.5 km east of the Lockerby Mine and is bordered on the east and south by the Vale Inco property, on the north by the FNI Lockerby Mine property, and on the  west  by  the  Lockerby  Mine  and  Vale  Inco  holdings  (Figure  4-2).    The  Vale  Inco claim  on  the  west  is  known  as  the  'Corridor  Claim'  and  is  surrounded  by  the  FNI property.  The Lockerby East Zone, down dip from the Conwest Zone, is located on FNI parcel numbers 9106 SWS to 9109 SWS in Lot 12 Concession 6 to the north of the West Graham property (Figures 4-2 and 4-3).

Title to the West Graham patented claims is held by Landore Resources Canada Inc. (Landore)  and  is  maintained  by  the  annual  payment  of  taxes  of  $519.62.    The  patents include surface and mineral rights.

Under the terms of an option agreement executed on November 21, 2005, FNI may earn up to an 85% interest in the West Graham property subject to a 2% NSR royalty. The agreement calls for payment of $150,000 in cash and the expenditure of $6 million on exploration and development on the property over four years to earn a 70% interest. Once  FNI  has  vested  to  70%,  Landore  can  elect  to  participate  in  further  work  on  the property to maintain its 30% interest.  Should Landore decline participation, FNI has the

right to increase its interest to 85% by completing a bankable feasibility study over two years thereafter.  Lot 12 is subject to two easements to:

1. the Manitoulin and North Shore Railway

2. the Hydro Electric Power Commission of Ontario

## 5 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE AND PHYSIOGRAPHY

## ACCESS

The West Graham property is located approximately 30 km west of Sudbury by road. Paved and unpaved roads connecting to highways 144 and 17 give access from the north, crossing  over  the  Vermillion  River,  and  from  the  south,  respectively.    A  dirt  road approximately  one  kilometre  long  connects  the  north  portion  of  the  property  to  the Lockerby  Mine  complex.    Commercial  scheduled  air  service  is  available  at  Sudbury Airport located northeast of the city.  There is no rail access to the property.

## LOCAL RESOURCES

Sudbury is a ready source of skilled labour, equipment and supplies for the mining industry.  It is one of Canada's most developed mining areas, with 93,000 inhabitants in the city and a total population of 166,000 in the surrounding district.  The city is also a major centre in northeastern Ontario for commerce, government administration, education and medical facilities.  Xstrata's Strathcona mill is located at Onaping 60 km northwest  of  Sudbury,  and  Xstrata's  smelter  is  located  15  km  to  the  northeast  in Falconbridge.  Vale Inco's Clarabelle concentrator and smelting facilities are located on the southwest side of Sudbury at Copper Cliff.

## SITE INFRASTRUCTURE

There is no site infrastructure at the West Graham property, however, FNI's Lockerby Mine would provide mine infrastructure for the property in the event FNI vests in the property  and  develops  it.    Lockerby  Mine  site  infrastructure  is  described  in  Routledge (2007,  2008)  and  Clow  et  al.  (2005).    The  closest  existing  underground  access  to  the Conwest Zone from the Lockerby Mine is the East Zone access drift from the Shaft #2

load-out on the 40 Level that crosses the Vale Inco Corridor Claim to the 34 Level at the East Zone (Figure 4-3).

## PHYSIOGRAPHY AND CLIMATE

Terrain in and surrounding the West Graham property is characterized by moderate to subdued topographic relief and second growth northern boreal forests and small lakes and swamps.  Elevations range from 265 m ASL to 296 m ASL on the property.  Bedrock is poorly exposed in lower relief areas.  Farmlands within the interior of the Sudbury Basin are  underlain  by  flat-lying  sedimentary  and  epiclastic  rocks  covered  by  Quaternary glacial deposits and thin soils.

The climate is northern continental temperate, with warm summers and cold winters. Seasonal temperatures average 24.8ºC in summer and -8.4ºC in winter.  Average annual precipitation is 62.2 mm of rain and 247.5 mm of snow.

## 6 HISTORY

Nickel-copper  mineralization  in  the  Sudbury  area  was  first  discovered  in  1865  by Alexander Murray, who followed up on a land surveyor's report of a marked deflection in compass readings while surveying.  Murray took samples-one of which assayed about 1% Ni and 2% Cu-from a gossan-stained ridge that ran along the hanging wall of what was to become the Creighton Mine orebody, located 10 km west of the West Graham property.  Due to inaccessibility, nothing further was done until interest was rekindled by the mineral outcropping discovery of 1883 during the railway construction in the Sudbury area.  The Creighton orebody was rediscovered in 1886, and in 1900, after 14 years of intensive  exploration,  an  open-pit  mining  operation  was  started  at  Creighton  by  the Canadian  Copper  Company.    The  first  shipment  of  Sudbury  ore  from  Creighton  was made in August 1901, and in 1907 underground mining began.  The Canadian Copper Company eventually  became  part  of  Inco.    Since  the  1800s,  historic  metal  production from Inco and Falconbridge operations for the Sudbury Basin, from over 100 mines, is in the order of 8.5 million tonnes of nickel and 8.4 million tonnes of copper.  Total reserves and production in the camp are estimated at 1.6 billion tonnes (Patterson, 2001).

FNI's adjacent Lockerby Mine property was originally held by the Lockerby family from 1888 to 1908, then the Dominion Bank and a succession of mining companies until purchased  by  Falconbridge  in  1942.    Falconbridge  drilled  extensively  throughout  the 1960s.  Shaft sinking at Lockerby began in 1969 and the first ore was produced from the Main Zone in 1971.  Annual production peaked at 635,000 tonnes in 1984.  Construction of  a  milling  facility  on  site  was  halted  shortly  after  foundations  were  poured,  when  a decision was made to process Lockerby ore at the Strathcona mill.

The  Lockerby  Depth  and  East  zones  were  mined  starting  in  1991-1992.    To December 31, 2003, a total of 8.26 million tonnes averaging 1.79% Ni and 1.07% Cu were produced from the Main, Depth, and East zones at Lockerby Mine.  During its 33 years  of  Falconbridge  production,  mining  was  suspended from 1978 to 1980 and from

1994  to  1997,  due  to  low  nickel  prices.    Falconbridge  placed  the  mine  on  care  and maintenance in September 2004.

Under  FNI  ownership  as  of  May  2005,  the  mine  resumed  commercial  production from  the  Depth  Zone  in  December  2005.    Recent  Lockerby  production  has  been approximately 400 tpd.  Ore is delivered by ramp to the 40 Level crusher and hoisted to surface via Shaft #2where it is recrushed, sampled and stockpiled before being trucked to the Strathcona mill for processing under an Off-Take agreement with Xstrata.  Production has been mostly confined to the 63 Level and 64 Level of the Depth Zone, with limited tonnage pulled from the East Zone.  In light of the declining nickel and copper prices and challenging financial environment, FNI announced on October 19, 2008, that it placed the Lockerby Mine on care and maintenance.

Recent Lockerby Mine production from 2001 to 2007 is summarized in Table 6-1.

The Conwest deposit was discovered in late 1960 by Conwest on the north half of the West Graham property.  Conwest diamond drilled six WG series holes (1,598.13 m) in 1960-1961, and 21 holes (4,849.06 m) in 1969 and estimated a mineral inventory at 4.3 million  tons  (3.9  million  tonnes)  averaging  0.52%  Ni  and  0.33%  Cu.    This  historic estimate  predates  the  implementation  of  NI  43-101  reporting  regulations  and  Scott

Wilson  RPA  considers  it  to  be  non-compliant  with  CIM/NI  43-101  standards  and guidelines.

In  1987-1988,  Falconbridge  carried  out  a  regional  Aerodat  very  low  frequency electromagnetic (VLF-EM) and magnetometer airborne geophysical survey covering the property and geologic mapping for major structural features and surface mineralization on the property.  This work was followed up in 1989 with six GRA series diamond drill holes  totalling  7,403.03  m  and  downhole  pulse  electromagnetic  (PEM)  geophysical surveys.  Of these holes, five were drilled in the Conwest deposit.

Landore  acquired  the  West  Graham  property  in  a  reverse  takeover  of  Brancote Canada  Ltd.  in  2001  but  did  not  undertake  significant  exploration.    FNI  commenced exploration in 2005 after signing the earn-in agreement with Landore in August 2005.

## 7 GEOLOGICAL SETTING

## REGIONAL GEOLOGY

The West Graham property is situated in the southwest area of the Sudbury Igneous Complex (SIC) South Range.  The SIC straddles the boundary between the Archean-aged Superior  Geologic  Province  to  the  north  and  west,  and  the  Southern  Province  of  early Proterozoic  age  (Huronian)  to  the  south  and  east.    The  Grenville  Front,  the  northern margin of the Grenville Province, lies about 10 km to the southeast of the SIC.

Superior Province rocks consist of granitic intrusives and gneisses and minor volcanic rocks  of  the  Levack  Gneiss  Complex  that  have  been  dated  at  2,700  Ma.    These  were deformed  and  metamorphosed  at  2,640  Ma  and  subsequently  intruded  by  northwest trending Matachewan dikes.  The Southern Province metavolcanic and metasedimentary formations were deposited between 2,490 Ma and 2,200 Ma and extensively intruded by sills and dikes of Nipissing Diabase circa 2,200 Ma.

## LOCAL GEOLOGY

The  SIC  is  an  elliptical,  layered  intrusive  body  forming  the  walls  of  the  Sudbury Basin that is 60 km long and 28 km wide (Figure 7-1).  The SIC itself is 2.5 km to 3 km thick at surface.  SIC igneous rocks dip about 35º to 45º towards the centre of the basin on  the  north  side  and  up  to  vertical  on  the  south.    SIC  rocks  dip  subvertically  in  the Graham Township area.  The West Graham property itself straddles the SIC-basement contact east adjacent to the Lockerby Mine (Figure 7-2).

Geologic  relationships  and  age  dating  indicate  an  emplacement  age  of  1,850  Ma, subsequent to a meteor impact that caused extensive brecciation and associated contact metamorphism of the SIC footwall  rocks.    The  original  structure  exceeded  150  km  in diameter.    Later  tectonic  compression,  faulting  and  thrusting  at  the  margins,  and  deep erosion have modified the structure to its present shape.  More extensive thrusting in the South  Range  has  exposed  deeper  portions  of  the  SIC  compared  to  the  North  and  East ranges  and  is  reflected  in  differences  in  the  lithologies,  mineralogies,  and  ore  deposit metal contents.

The  three  main  geologic  components  related  to  the  meteor  impact  are  the  SIC emplacement, deposition of the Whitewater sedimentary rocks occupying the centre of the Sudbury Basin, and the Sudbury Breccia.

The  SIC  itself  is  composed  of  an  igneous  suite  of  coarse-grained  felsic  norites succeeded upwards into the basin by a transition layer of quartz gabbro, and granophyric micropegmatites.

The Whitewater Group consists of synformal, Aphebian age epiclastic and sedimentary  rocks  comprising  the  Onaping  Breccia  and  Onwatin  Slate  topped  by  the Chelmsford Sandstone in the centre of the basin.  The Whitewater Group was deposited after  emplacement  of  the  SIC  with  the  tuffs  related  to  volcanic  activity,  followed  by erosion of the SIC and sedimentation within the basin.

The Sudbury Breccias occur as dikes, stringers, and irregular bodies of pseudotachylite that is commonly developed between contacts of contrasting rock types within the footwall of the SIC.  The breccias have an aphanitic matrix bearing xenoliths of local rocks, with matrix colour progressively lighter grey and bleached as the footwall is approached.

## PROPERTY GEOLOGY

The northern portion of the West Graham property straddles the contact of the lower norite  unit  of  the  SIC  and  the  Creighton  Pluton.    The  contact  dips  at  45º  to  50º  to  the north.  A discontinuous sublayer norite is exposed on the western portion of the property at the SIC contact.  The sublayer unit, identified by diamond drilling, occurs above the basal  contact  of  the  SIC  and  is  unusual  in  terms  of  both  its  stratigraphic  location  and composition.  This sublayer unit contains fragments of granite and norite.

The  southern  portion  of  the  property  is  underlain  by  the  Creighton  Pluton  which consists  of  fine-grained,  porphyritic  quartz  monzonite.    Large  gabbroic  xenoliths  and crosscutting  zones  of  Sudbury  Breccia  are  common.    Sudbury  Breccia  occurs  as numerous dyke-like and irregular bodies within the granite pluton.  Breccia zones vary from a few centimetres to several tens of metres in width.  The Sudbury Breccia on the property  is  composed  of  a  dark  grey  granite  matrix  containing  fragments  of  granite, gabbro, amphibolite, quartz, and rarely ultramafic rocks.  Some of the Sudbury Breccia contains zones of biotite, chlorite and carbonate alteration.

Quartz diabase dikes varying in width between one and three metres cut all SIC and basement rocks.  The dikes appear to be fault-related and trend in two directions across the property.  The youngest rocks on the property, olivine diabase dikes of the Sudbury Dike Swarm, are up to 20 m wide and have extensive strike length.

Disseminated  pyrrhotite,  pentlandite  and  chalcopyrite  mineralization  is  exposed  in outcrop and has been intersected in drill holes in the norite above the sublayer norite and the SIC contact.  Drilling has confirmed the presence of both contact and hanging wall hosted  nickel-copper  sulphide  mineralization  between  45  m  and  475  m  vertical  depth. The  Conwest  Zone  is  located  1.5  km  east  of  the  Lockerby  Mine  Depth  Zone  and approximately 500 m up dip from the East Zone.  The Conwest Zone is undeveloped, whereas the East Zone down dip was developed and mined by Falconbridge above the mine grid system 2,900 m RL (1,055 m depth) on five sublevels to the 30 Level overcut. The East Zone mineralization is controlled by a nose structure of norite/sublayer in the

footwall that plunges from west to east at 40º.  The Conwest Zone is at the top of the nose structure where the dip begins to steepen and reverse to the south.  The Conwest Zone dips an average of 53  north, 'pant legs' down dip and to the east, and then occurs in o parallel sheets of nickel-copper mineralization on its east side.

## 8 DEPOSIT TYPES

Three main types of Ni-Cu±PGE deposits are recognized in the SIC:

- 1. Contact-type  massive  to  disseminated  sulphides  occur  in  the  SIC  noritic sublayer. Mineralization is composed of pyrrhotite, pentlandite, chalcopyrite, pyrite, and magnetite. Bornite and millerite may occur in higher grade zones and arsenides are more common in the South Range.
- 2. Copper and PGE-rich footwall veins and stockworks are hosted by Sudbury Breccia within the SIC footwall gneisses or greenstones, often in the shadow of contact-type deposits. Chalcopyrite and cubanite predominate, with lesser pentlandite, magnetite, and pyrrhotite.
- 3. Offset quartz-norite dikes radiate from, or subparallel, the margin of the SIC and  may  host  either  lenticular  zones  of  sulphide  blebs  or  sulphide  skins  on Sudbury Breccia fragments on the margin of the dikes.

Most of Sudbury production has come from contact deposits in the sublayer rocks. The resources on the West Graham property have been estimated for the Conwest Zone contact-type deposit.

## 9 MINERALIZATION

The Conwest Zone is located on the northwest portion of the West Graham property. The contact style mineralization, as traced by drilling, forms a continuous body striking east-west and dipping 53º north.  The Conwest Zone extends from 40 m below surface to a depth of approximately 475 m.  As modelled at 0.3% nickel equivalent (NiEq), the zone ranges from 1.7 m to 66 m thick and strikes for 375 m with a dip extent of up to 533 m. At depth the Conwest Zone is interpreted to be contiguous with the Lockerby Mine East Zone.  Drilling has tested the Conwest Zone to the west boundary of the West Graham property where the zone continues onto the Corridor Claim held by Vale Inco.

The Conwest Zone is composed of disseminated, blebby, stringer and semi-massive sulphide zones hosted entirely within the norite unit some 30 m to 100 m above the SICbasement  contact.    The  nickel  mineralization  is  generally  low  grade,  however,  higher grade  zones  in  excess  of  1%  Ni  have  been  intersected  within  the  broader  envelope  of disseminated sulphides.

Pyrrhotite, chalcopyrite, and pentlandite are the dominant sulphides within the zone. The  nickel  content  of  sulphides  is  8%  to  10%  and  is  high  for  the  Sudbury  camp, reflecting  the  relatively  pentlandite-rich  nature  of  the  sulphides.    Within  the  resource wireframe contoured at 0.3% NiEq, the nickel in sulphide averages 8.25%.

In addition to the norite, sulphide mineralization has been observed in the sublayer norite, the footwall contact of the SIC and in the granitic basement.  Finely disseminated, and  joint fillings of, chalcopyrite,  accompanied  by  platinum,  palladium  and  gold mineralization,  have  been  intersected  over  narrow  widths  at  some  distance  into  the footwall granites.  The best values assayed in the Falconbridge drilling occurred between 20 m and 60 m below the SIC-basement contact.

## 10 EXPLORATION

After  executing  a  letter  of  intent  for  the  earn-in  option  in  August  2005,  FNI completed 14.8 line kilometres of magnetometer surveys and 11.8 line kilometres of deep penetrating, gradient induced polarization surveying.  Nine diamond drill holes totalling 2,564  m  filled-in  and  traced  mineralization  in  the  Conwest  Zone  north  and  down  dip towards the Lockerby East Zone.

In 2006, FNI drilling expanded the Conwest Zone and tested the SIC contact to the east and down plunge by diamond drilling 21 holes for 9,711 m.  Selected FNI holes were surveyed downhole by UTEM (large loop time domain electromagnetic survey) and PEM (pulse electromagnetic) geophysical methods.

FNI completed 21 holes totalling 5,190 m of fill-in drilling on the Conwest Zone in 2007 and an additional 11 holes totalling 4,772.5 m in 2008.  The drill hole spacing, at approximately  25  m  sections  and  30  m  to  50  m  zone  intercepts  along  dip,  has  been designed  to  provide  the  drilling  density  acceptable  for  resource  estimation  under  CIM definitions.    FNI  plans  to  undertake  a  metallurgical  study  of  the  Conwest  deposit concurrently with the resource estimate being carried out in this report (FNI, 2008).

All diamond drilling on the property to date has been from surface.

## 11 DRILLING

The  drill  hole  database  contains  94  diamond  drill  holes  totalling  36,897.78  m  of which 66% of the holes by length are subvertical.  All holes were drilled from surface. Recent FNI drilling accounts for 66% of the holes and 62% by length.  Figure 11-1 shows the location of drill holes.

Most holes cut the zone at acute angles resulting in core lengths longer than the true width of the zone.

FNI surveyed the collars of all its FNI series holes and resurveyed all available collars from Conwest and Falconbridge drilling.  Collar surveys were carried out by an Ontario Land Surveyor under contract using GPS  instrumentation accurate to &lt;10 cm. Coordinates are in UTM based on the North American Datum 1927, i.e., NAD 27 (Zone 17).

FNI and GRA series holes were surveyed downhole for azimuth and dip with the first reading appearing to be below the casing.  Falconbridge holes were surveyed using gyro instrumentation.    The  FNI  series  drill  holes  were  surveyed  in  part  using  a  Reflex Instruments EZ-Shot (single shot) unit and in part by multi-shot surveying with a north seeking  gyro  unit.    Some  tests  were  done  using  a  FlexIt  magnetic  based  instrument similar  to  the  EZ-Shot.    The  Reflex  EZ-Shot  and  FlexIt  instruments  are  suitable  for inclined and horizontal holes but may be affected by magnetic fields.

Of the 27 Conwest WG series holes, 14 (52%) have no downhole surveys.  Ten holes have readings for collar and toe only, and of these, two holes appear to have had azimuth surveyed as well as dip.  Three holes have downhole survey readings taken at intervals of 50 ft. or 100 ft., with two at 200 ft. (15 m or 30 m; up to 61 m), however, the azimuth is the same for all readings indicating that only dip tests were taken.  The Conwest holes that  were  surveyed  downhole  were  likely  acid  dip  tests,  or  Tropari  where  azimuth  is recorded.  Despite the average hole length of 239 m that is less than the averages for the FNI  series  (372  m)  and  the  Falconbridge  deep  holes  (1,481  m),  the  confidence  in  toe locations for the Conwest holes is not as good as for the other well surveyed holes owing to  lack  of  high  level  downhole  surveying  and  the  smaller  hole  diameter  (AQ)  that  is subject to more deviation.

Geotechnical data available for the FNI  series holes, including rock quality designation (RQD) measurement, fracture/breaks density and disking recording, indicates that core recovery and rock quality is generally very good (70% at 100% RQD) and there is thus only small potential for problems with sample representativity for assaying.  Scott Wilson RPA's visual inspection of the core confirmed generally excellent core recovery in mineralization.

## 12 SAMPLING METHOD AND APPROACH

The resources for the Conwest Zone are based on surface diamond drilling and core sample assays.

During the FNI drilling program, drill core was collected once daily from the drill rigs and  securely  transported  by  the  mine  personnel  to  a  core  logging  facility  located  at surface  on  the  Lockerby  Mine  site.    Geotechnical  measurements  (RQD,  core  recovery, fracture densities), rock  types  with  descriptions, structure, sulphide  mineralization percentages,  and  visual  grade  estimates  were  logged  directly  into  the  digital  computer database  in  a  conventional  manner  according  to  industry  standard  practices.  Core  is routinely photographed by digital camera and images kept on file for reference as checks against assays and visual grade estimates.

All  drill  core  with  significant  sulphide  mineralization  (&gt;1%)  was  sampled  over intervals  ranging  from  0.02  m  to  46.7  m  depending  on  the  intensity  of  sulphides  and geological  characteristics.    The  long  sample  length  (46.7  m)  from  a  Falconbridge  hole was likely an overall interval of grab sampling.  Ninety-eight percent of the sampling was ≤ 3.05 m (10 ft.).  No drill core recovery or sampling factors were present which could materially impact on the accuracy or reliability of core assaying.

Core that was sampled by FNI was outlined by geology/mineralization, rock type and visual grade estimates, so sample lengths were all standardized, although 66% of the FNI samples  were  taken  on  1.5  m  lengths.    Falconbridge  standardized  its  sampling  since approximately 60% of its core samples are at 1.5 m lengths.  Conwest sample lengths are 23% at 5 ft. (1.52 m) and 50% at 10 ft. (3.05 m).  In general, there is little to no nickel grade relationship with sample length, i.e., sample lengths are relatively grade independent as shown in the graphs below.

Mineralized core was diamond sawed in half, with one half bagged for assay and the other  half  returned  to  the  core  box  for  archive  at  the  Lockerby  Mine  Core  Storage Facility.    Unsampled  core  above  the  mineralized  zone  was  discarded  in  the  Lockerby

Mine  waste  dump  unless  some  technical  reason  dictated  that  it  be  stored  for  future reference.

The FNI diamond drilling programs were carried out under the supervision of FNI's Sudbury  Geology  Manager,  Phil  Vicker,  M.Sc.,  P.Geo.,  and  Senior  Geologist,  Scot Halladay, B.Sc., P. Geo., 'qualified persons' as defined by NI 43-101.

Scott Wilson RPA notes that FNI core sample numbers include the drill hole identity which  facilitates  data  management.    This  is  not  optimal  in  terms  of  security  where analyses are carried out at commercial laboratories and Scott Wilson RPA recommends the use of an alphanumeric or numeric system independent of drill hole identifiers.

## 13 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND SECURITY

Between August 2005 and March 2007, sample preparation and analyses for drill holes FNI2001 to FNI2030 inclusive were as follows: core samples were sent for assay at the SGS Mineral Services (SGS) preparation facility in Garson, Ontario, where they were  dried,  crushed  to  75%  passing  2  mm  (10  mesh),  riffle  split  to  250  g,  and pulverized  to  85%  passing  75  microns  (200  mesh).    The  specific  gravity  of prepared sample pulps was determined by pycnometer.  One extra selected pulp per drill hole batch was retained for future testing at a second independent laboratory.  SGS sent  the  pulps  to  Toronto  (SGS  XRAL)  for  analysis  of  nickel,  copper,  cobalt  (sodium peroxide  fusion  with  inductively  coupled  plasma  -  optical  emission  spectroscopy (ICP-OES)  finish),  gold,  platinum,  palladium  (fire  assay-lead  collection  with  ICPOES  finish),  sulphur  (Leco  furnace),  and  silver (aqua  regia  digestion, atomic absorption spectroscopy, AAS).

## SGS Lakefield Research/XRAL

| Element   | Detection Limit   |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Ni        | 5 ppm             |
| Cu        | 5 ppm             |
| Co        | 0.5 ppm           |
| Au        | 1 ppb             |

| Pt        | 1 ppb             |
| Pd        | 1 ppb             |

From  March  2007  forward,  FNI  procedures  were  as  follows:  split  diamond-sawed core  samples  from  drill  holes  FNI2031  to  FNI2062  inclusive  were  sent  for  initial preparation to Accurassay Laboratories (Accurassay), a commercial laboratory in Lively, Ontario.  The FNI core was dry crushed to 90% passing 8 mesh (2.38 mm) and split in a multi-gate Jones Riffler until a 200 g to 400 g sample split was produced.  Riffler rejects were bagged and returned to FNI.  The 200 g to 400 g sample was bagged and shipped via Manitoulin Transport to Accurassay in Thunder Bay, Ontario.

At Lively, the crusher was tested and calibrated to 90% passing 8 mesh daily.  The crusher was cleaned with compressed air after every sample, and the crushing area and crusher were cleaned and 'wiped down' after each job.  If there was visual evidence of contamination after a given sample, the crusher was wiped down immediately.

In  the  Accurassay  Thunder  Bay  laboratory,  the  sample  split  is  pulverized  to  90% passing  150  mesh  (106 μ m)  using  a  ring  and  puck  pulverizer.    A  silica-clean  of  the pulverizer is performed between each sample to prevent cross-contamination.  Pulps were homogenized  and  further  split  to  prepare  pulp  duplicates  for  the  various  analytical methods. One extra pulp per drill hole batch is retained for further testing at a second independent  laboratory.    Specific  gravity  measurements  are  done  by  pycnometer  on sample pulps.

Samples  were  analyzed  at  the  Accurassay  laboratory  for  nickel,  copper  and  cobalt using sodium peroxide fusion with an ICP-AES finish; for gold, platinum and palladium by fire assay collection with an AAS finish; and for silver by aqua regia digestion and AAS finish.  Specific gravity measurements are performed on pulps by pycnometer at the Accurassay laboratory.

Accurassay ships sample pulps for sulphur analysis to International Plasma Laboratories in Vancouver via Priority Post (Canada Post), where they are analyzed by LECO furnace.

Detection limits for the Accurassay are:

| Element   | Detection Limit   |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Ni        | 0.005%            |
| Cu        | 0.005%            |
| Co        | 0.002%            |
| Au        | 5 ppb             |
| Ag        | 1 ppm             |
| Pt        | 15 ppb            |
| Pd        | 10 ppb            |

In Scott Wilson RPA's opinion, the FNI sampling and assaying is industry standard and adequate for Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve estimation.

The Falconbridge sampling was likely carried out at SGS Lakefield Research Limited (SGS  Lakefield)  using  methods  similar  to  those  used  by  FNI  at  the  SGS  XRAL laboratory.  The preferred method of SGS Lakefield in the past for Ni, Cu and Co has been sodium peroxide fusion with ICP finish.

Little information is available regarding the Conwest assaying for nickel and copper. Cobalt, platinum, palladium, gold, sliver and sulphur were not assayed.

## 14 DATA VERIFICATION

Scott Wilson RPA did not carry out any independent sampling and assaying to verify the project sampling and assaying.  Core from the Conwest drilling was stored in outdoor wood  racks  which  have  partially  collapsed  and  location of specific samples  for resampling could not be reliably done.  Scott Wilson RPA examined core for two FNI drill holes to compare and confirm FNI assayed grades with Scott Wilson RPA's visual estimates from split core.

## DATABASE

Scott Wilson RPA ran verification routines on the FNI data after importing the files to Gemcom Systems International  Limited  GEMS  v.6.14  software.    GEMS  has  stringent verification routines that are not found in other mining software.  First pass after loading the  FNI  CSV  data  files,  hole  GRA-27  was  found  to  have  one  zero  length  interval  at 953.10 m, an artefact of FNI's practice of using the last 0.10 m of the hole to record the end  of  the  hole  (EOH).    No  other  discrepancies,  such  as  from-to  errors  and  out  of sequence or overlapping assays or lithologic units were found.

Scott  Wilson  RPA  obtained  the  hard  copy  assay/analysis  certificates  for  the  FNI drilling and checked assay results for 22% of the drill holes against assay entries in the drill hole database.  In the initial check, Scott Wilson RPA found 11 nickel and copper entries  that  were  transposed  compared  to  the  drill  hole  logs  for  hole  WG-5.    All  WG series  holes  were  subsequently  reviewed  since  the  likelihood  of  errors  is  higher,  with respect to modern digital transfer, because of manual transcription from the 1960s logs. Three additional errors for copper values were found and corrected in holes WG-1, 8 and 12.  These errors were corrected in the resource database.

For some Accurassay values below detection limit (BDL), FNI has entered the value as the detection limit x 0.1 versus the conventional approach of multiplying by 0.5.  Scott Wilson RPA notes that the BDL entries appear to be applied inconsistently, particularly for silver.  Three silver entries for FNI series holes were found to be 0.01 g/t higher in the

database  versus  the  certificate,  likely  from  a  reassay.    None  of  these  disparities  has  a material effect on resource estimation.

## DRILL HOLE SURVEYS

Scott  Wilson  RPA's  field  checks  on  the  collars  of  four  holes,  including  one Falconbridge and one Conwest hole, were all within five metres of the collars recorded in the resource database, well within the limits of accuracy of the hand-held GPS instrument used.

In  the  downhole  survey  file,  the  initial  readings  for  the  collar  for  45  FNI  and  five GRA  series  holes  are  missing  and,  for  the  purpose  of  import  to  GEMS  software  for review,  missing  zero  distance  downhole  entries  were  substituted  by  data  from  the  FNI collar  file  that  also  includes  collar  location  and  hole  length.    Downhole  magnetic  field based instrumentation does not survey within the drill hole casing.  Scott Wilson RPA notes  that  there  are  discrepancies  of  up  to  6º  in  azimuth  between  the  gyro  downhole survey records for the collar and the collar file entries, and questions whether the collar records are as-planned or as-built.  In the former case, some of the 50 holes lacking the surface  downhole  entry  in  the  survey  file  and  using  the  as-planned  entry  may  have inaccurate spatial representation in 3D space.

Two GRA series vertical holes contain blank azimuths and these were reset to 360º.

FNI2033  and  FNI2034  have  duplicate  downhole  distances  with  different  azimuths and dips posted.  This resulted from the non-removal of the initial uncorrected magnetic reading (10ºW) in the database.  Since the holes are near vertical, the hole trace in 3D is virtually unaffected, with no impact on modelling.

Scott  Wilson  RPA  briefly  examined  downhole  surveys  for  excessive  deviation indicating  possible  spurious  readings/database  entries,  and  for  overall  drilling  quality. Scott  Wilson  RPA  notes  that  the  FNI  series  has  less  deviation  and  better  quality surveying and/or drilling compared to the older holes.  This is in part due to larger drill

tooling.  Hole FNI2023 appears to have a spurious reading at 20 m depth.  For the older Falconbridge holes surveyed at larger intervals, there is higher deviation and holes GRA27, GRA-27A and GRA-26 appear to have spurious readings that should be addressed. Hole GRA 26 shows some extreme readings, and flattening in the lower portion of the hole.  It should be reviewed and resurveyed if possible.

## QUALITY ASSURANCE/QUALITY CONTROL

FNI  follows  rigorous  quality  assurance/quality  control  (QA/QC)  protocols  which include the insertion of standards and blanks for each drill hole batch of core samples. One pulp duplicate sample is taken from each batch and analyzed at a second commercial laboratory (SGS, Toronto).

FNI  analytical  work  prior  to  March  2007  was  completed  at  SGS,  with  the  pulp duplicates being analyzed at ALS Chemex.  Historic analytical work by Falconbridge was completed  by  SGS  Lakefield.    All  are  independent,  commercial  certified  mineral laboratories.

Each drill hole sample lot has a blank sample and certified nickel reference standard submitted to the laboratories (SGS and Accurassay) by FNI at a frequency of at least one blank or standard per 25 samples.  Drill holes with less than 25 samples had one standard submitted.    Ten  reference  standards  have  been  used  from  Geostats  Pty  Ltd.  of  Perth, Western Australia.  Of these, two are less than 1% Ni with the others ranging up to 4.58% Ni.

Standards and blanks are checked by FNI personnel upon receipt from the lab to assure the quality of assaying is maintained.  In the case of the failure of the reference standard  or  blank  to  analyze  in  the  acceptable  error  field,  the  sample  batch  was reanalyzed from the pulps stored at the laboratory.  Importation of the failed batch into the FNI Fusion database is prohibited by the software.

Assay values are compared to expected results from visual estimates recorded in drill logs.    In  the  event  the  assay  values  are  not  in  reasonable  agreement  with  the  visual estimates, the core or core photographs are re-examined to confirm or revise the sulphide visual estimate.  Where the sulphide visual estimate is considered reasonable, the samples are reanalyzed either from the pulps or rejects, or from resampled (quartered) core.

Correlation  between  elements  (e.g.,  Ni  and  S)  is  also  examined  to  determine  data quality.  Where the data does not correlate as expected, the samples are reanalyzed, either from the pulps or rejects, or from resampled (quartered) core, if necessary.

The extra pulps requested with the original analyses were sent for check analysis at other independent, commercial mineral laboratories

Assay results are received digitally and integrated into the Fusion drill hole database in order to eliminate data transfer errors, and are also received by hard copy certificate for filing.

Scott Wilson RPA examined the analyses for FNI's reference standards and control blank samples.  For Ni grades above 2%, the reference standard analyses tended to be slightly low for three standards and accurate for one standard (Figure 14-1).  For the 1.1% to 1.2% Ni standards, the analyses were at the standard mean value or slightly above with one standard at the borderline of acceptability (mean ± 3 δ ).  The low grade standards in the 0.3% to 0.4% Ni range, returned acceptable results.  Overall, the reference standards were within acceptable limits.

Blank sample grades were plotted in sequence with respect to acceptability thresholds of 3 x detection limits (Figure 14-2).  The plots show some noise above the threshold for Ni and Cu but not at levels that impact on the assaying.  Similarly, for Pt, Au and Ag there is some noise, with one Pt value above threshold.  Scott Wilson RPA notes that if silver and the other precious metals were payable, alternative analytical methods would be  necessary  to  achieve  lower  detection  limits  consistent  with  the  low  levels  of  the precious metals in the zone.

Scott  Wilson  RPA  compiled  and  examined  the  precision  for  Ni  and  Cu  pulp duplicates from Accurassay's internal QA/QC as exported from the FNI Fusion database and cross-reference to original assays (Figure 14-3).  Linear correlation coefficients (R ) 2 for Ni and Cu are acceptable at &gt;98%.  Relative difference plots show some noise, with most assays falling within the 5% envelope, particularly for assays above detection and within resource grades.

| Envelope   | ±5%   | ±10%   |
|------------|-------|--------|
| Ni         | 84%   | 94%    |
| Cu         | 88%   | 96%    |

Ni shows a slight bias for the original to be slightly lower than the duplicate.  The pooled relative standard deviation (PRSD) for the original-duplicate pairs is 10% for Ni and 8% for Cu.  PRSD for base metal analyses on pulp replicates is generally expected to be ≤ 5%, but 10% is within the limits of acceptability.

Scott Wilson RPA briefly reviewed results of check assaying, of 49 pulp replicates from  FNI  samples,  done  by  similar  analytical  methods  at  alternative  commercial laboratories.  Results of nickel and copper were examined (Figures 14-4 and 14-5) and are considered acceptable.

## Nickel:

- · Mean grades for original and checks are comparable to &lt;1% difference.
- · 70% of the pairs are within a 10% difference.
- · For grades up to 1%, the check assays are somewhat higher than the original, but are lower above 1%.
- · The relative differences are mostly ±12%.
- · PRSD is 12%.

## Copper:

- · Mean grades for original and checks are comparable to within &lt;3% difference.
- · For grades &gt;0.4%, the check assays are somewhat higher than the original.
- · 80% of the assay pairs are within a 10% difference.
- · The relative differences are acceptable and mostly ≤ +5% and ≥ -10%.
- · PRSD is 11%.

In view of the three drilling and sampling campaigns by different operators spanning some  47  years  from  the  Conwest  work,  Scott  Wilson  RPA  briefly  examined  grade distributions for nickel assays within the resource wireframe by means of QQ plots with respect to the FNI assays (Figure 14-6).  The nickel assays were also normalized by using grade  thickness  to  avoid  differences  in  sampling  lengths  campaign  to  campaign.    The plots indicate that the Falconbridge assaying is close to FNI's for most of the grade range up to 0.9% Ni where after Falconbridge grades are lower.  The Conwest assaying appears to be somewhat higher as indicated by a higher mean nickel grade.

| Assaying     | Count   |   Ni% |
|--------------|---------|-------|
| FNI          | 1,548   |  0.42 |
| Falconbridge | 67      |  0.38 |
| Conwest      | 1,395   |  0.48 |

Examination of grade distribution indicates that the higher grades ( ≥ 1% Ni) for the Conwest  holes  clustered  around  the  200  m  elevation  at  the  top  of  the  zone  and  are proportionately more than in the nearest FNI holes (Figure 14-7).  Further examination shows the higher grades are mostly from three holes and these holes are on one section and in  sequence  WG-25 to 27, possibly indicating a batch assaying problem occurred. Scott Wilson RPA recommends twinning one or more of these Conwest holes to confirm the higher grades in this area of the deposit.

Other  than  the  possibility  of  a  problem  in  assaying  for  the  three  Conwest  holes  as described  above,  in  Scott  Wilson  RPA's  opinion,  the  sampling  and  assaying  for  the Conwest Zone are acceptable for resource and reserve estimation.

## 15 ADJACENT PROPERTIES

The  FNI  Lockerby  Mine  property  is  north  adjacent  and  southwest  adjacent  to  the West  Graham  property.    Vale  Inco  holds  the  Corridor  Claim  to  the  west  of  the  West Graham patents and surrounds the West Graham property on the east and south.  The former  Vale  Inco  Crean  Hill  Mine  property  adjoins  the  Lockerby  Mine  on  its  west boundary.

The  Conwest  Zone  extends  onto  the  Corridor  Claim,  however,  there  is  no  public information as to the existence or magnitude of any resources on the claim that may have been estimated by Vale Inco.

The Lockerby Mine has been previously described under 'History' since FNI is the operator of the mine and the West Graham property.  The Lockerby East Zone lies north and down plunge of the Conwest Zone.  Inferred Mineral Resources in the East Zone, as of April 2007 at a cut-off grade of 1.2% NiEq, were 470,000 tonnes averaging 1.86% Ni, 0.67%  Cu  and  0.04%  Co.    The  estimate  of  these  resources  is  NI  43-101  compliant (Routledge, 2007).  FNI has mined a small tonnage from the East Zone since 2007.

## 16 MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING

During the third quarter of 2008, a composite sample was prepared from drill core and  submitted  to  SGS  Lakefield  for  preliminary  metallurgical  test  work  consisting  of sample preparation and rougher kinetic tests that will provide an estimate of the recovery characteristics for the Conwest deposit.  Samples for compositing were selected so as to provide  a  head  grade  of  0.5%  NiEq  (NiEq=  Ni%+0.32*Cu%+0.53%*Co%)  assuming low  grade  bulk  mining,  to  obtain  samples  of  differing  mineralogy  and  styles  of mineralization, and to be spatially representative of the deposit.

Results are pending.

## 17 MINERAL RESOURCE AND MINERAL RESERVE ESTIMATES

## MINERAL RESOURCES

## SUMMARY

The resource estimate was prepared by conventional 3D computer block modelling based  on  surface  diamond  drill  hole  data  and  utilizing  ordinary  kriging  for  grade interpolation.    Grade  was  estimated  for  Ni,  Cu,  Co,  Pt,  Pd,  Au,  Ag,  S  and  NiEq.    The estimate was constrained by geological interpretation and a wireframe model based on contouring a NiEq grade of 0.3%.  NiEq factors are based on Ni, Cu and Co grades and are derived from metal accountability in the FNI-Xstrata Off-Take agreement.  The factor is:  NiEq% = Ni% + (0.32 x Cu%) + (0.53 x Co%).  The precious metals are generally low.

The resource is estimated on the West Graham property to within 5 m of the Vale Inco  Corridor  Claim  boundary  assuming  a  pillar  will  be  left  allowing  for  independent mining  on  both  sides  of  the  north-south  property  boundary.    Resources  tied  up  in  the pillar are reported independently.  The resource was classified into Indicated and Inferred Mineral Resources based on drill hole/sampling density.  Appropriate validation checks were  performed  to  ensure  estimate  is  reasonable.    Table  17-1  summarizes  the  Mineral Resources.

Notes:

- 1. CIM definitions were followed for Mineral Resources.
- 2. Mineral Resources are estimated within a mineralization wireframe cut-off grade of 0.3% nickel equivalent.
- 3. Nickel equivalent is derived from the FNI-Xstrata Off-Take agreement, NiEq%=Ni% + (0.32xCu%) + (0.53xCo%).
- 4. Mineral Resources are estimated using an average long-term nickel price of US$7.00/lb and a C$/US$ exchange rate of $0.90.
- 5. Resources are estimated from a depth of 45 m below surface to a depth of 557 m.

## ESTIMATION METHODOLOGY

A  process  flow  chart  was  followed  to  provide  a  framework  for  the  resource estimation.    The  estimate  was  undertaken  using  Datamine  Studio  Version  2.1.1518.0, using Standard Precision and creating Standard Precision files.

Drill  hole  data  (collar  coordinates,  downhole  surveys,  assays  and  lithology)  were exported from the FNI Fusion database in CSV (comma delimited) format and imported into Datamine.  The cut-off date for the geological and analytical data was October 10, 2008.

Once imported into Datamine, various functions were used to generate basic statistics and highlight missing fields.  As well, drill holes were viewed in conjunction with surface mapping to visually inspect collar locations and the trace of holes.

Drill  hole  segments  greater  than  0.30%  NiEq  were  considered  for  inclusion  in constructing  the  mineralized  wireframe.    The  selection  of  0.3%  NiEq  is  based  on

preliminary  price-recovery-incremental  operating  cost  estimates  for  nickel  as  tabulated below (Table 17-2).  Mining is assumed to be bulk underground at more than 2,000 tpd.

## DATABASE

Analytical data are not available for all fields in the historical data set; in particular for  cobalt,  sulphur  and  density.    To  enable  a  model  estimate  for  all  fields,  regression formula and/or  nickel  tenor  (0  &lt;  NiSd  &lt;  36.0)  was  derived  from  holes  with  analytical data.

During the construction of the mineralized zone, one diamond drill hole (GRA27A) was removed due to absence of samples.

## GEOLOGIC INTERPRETATION AND WIREFRAMING

A wireframe surface was constructed for the norite-footwall (SIC basement) contact. This contact was honoured in giving shape to the mineralization.

Mineralization was interpreted via strings snapped to drill hole intersections on 12.5 m spaced south-north cross-sections  (looking  west).    The  modelled  mineralization  was restricted to mineralization greater than 0.3% NiEq.  A summary of wireframe statistics is as follows:

Tie-lines were used extensively to honour the drill hole assay data when shaping the interpreted  strings  between  data  points.    At  the  edges  of  the  data  set,  strings  were projected up or down dip and pinched out, based on the following guidelines:

## Extrapolation Guidelines

The mineralized wireframe was constructed and the model graded.  The model was then  trimmed  to  the  property  boundaries,  with  a  five  metre  pillar  isolated  along  the boundary.  Figure 17-1 is a 3D screen capture of the mineralized area, diamond drilling and property boundary.

## ASSAY COMPOSITING

The composite length selected at 3.00 m is based on the results of an analysis of the sample length statistics.  Sample length statistics are summarized in Table 17-5.

## Statistic

| Mean (m)              |   1.59 |
|-----------------------|--------|
| Median (m)            |   1.5  |
| Mode (m)              |   1.5  |
| St. Deviation         |   0.61 |
| Sample Variance       |   0.37 |
| Kurtosis              |   2.08 |
| Skewness              |   1.4  |
| Range (m)             |   3.89 |
| Minimum (m)           |   0.14 |
| Maximum (m)           |   4.03 |
| 95th Percentile (m)   |   3.05 |
| Composite Length  (m) |   3    |

Assay  composite  grades  were  weighted  by  length  and  specific  gravity  down  hole. The composite residuals are included in the estimate:

| Summary Stats (m)          |      |
|----------------------------|------|
| % Residuals                | 4.51 |
| Residual/Non-residual % Ni | 1.13 |

## TOP CUTTING

The need for top-cutting of high grades was reviewed for nickel, copper and cobalt. The low to moderate coefficient of variance (CV) for assay composites for the principal metals as shown below, as well as the raw assays in Table 17-3, indicates that grade topcutting is unnecessary.

| Element   |   CV |
|-----------|------|
| Ni        | 0.61 |
| Cu        | 0.51 |
| Co        | 0.57 |

## VARIOGRAPHY AND SEARCH STRATEGY

A  nickel  variogram  was  used  for  the  grading  of  all  elements  in  the  model.  Good correlation with geology was achieved (Figure 17-3).  The relatively high nugget effect at 40% (for base metals) reflects in part the somewhat higher variance in the assaying and introduces a higher degree of smoothing in grade interpolation, which is desirable for a low grade deposit.  Parameters are listed below.

| Parameter   |      |
|-------------|------|
| VANGLE1     | -10º |
| VANGLE2     | 50º  |
| VANGLE3     | -20º |
| VAXIS1      | 3    |
| VAXIS2      | 1    |
| VAXIS3      | 3    |
| NUGGET %    | 0.4  |
| ST1         | 1    |
| ST1PAR1     | 61   |
| ST1PAR2     | 38.5 |
| ST1PAR3     | 44.5 |
| ST1PAR4     | 0.6  |

Subsequent  to  the  variography,  a  search  strategy  was  developed  which  was  drawn from the shape of the variogram ellipse.  No octant search or maximum value limitation

was utilized.  At SVOLFAC2, the maximum range of the variogram is achieved.  The final estimation does not appear to be sensitive to either variography or search strategy.

## RESOURCE CLASSIFICATION

Mineral  Resources  were  classified  into  Indicated  and  Inferred  Resources  based  on drill hole and sampling density resulting in a concentration of Indicated Resources in the west from the property boundary at 476,300E to 476,525E and Inferred Resources in the east extending from 476,525E to 476700E.  Figure 17-4 is a screen capture of plan views of the Datamine block model for each category.

## FIGURE 17-4 PLAN VIEW OF RESOURCE CATEGORIES

## MODEL VALIDATION

The following steps were taken to validate the grade block model.

- · Cross-sections of the graded model were reviewed to ensure the model honoured drill hole data and the geological interpretation (Figure 17-5).
- · Alternate estimations were run using inverse distance squared (ID ) and nearest 2 neighbour (NN), to identify major errors in variography.  Results were virtually identical to ordinary kriging (OK).
- · Average grades of the wireframe intercepts compared favourably with the block model resource grades (Appendix 1).
- · East-west swath plots for nickel grades, showing composited drill data versus the regularized block model (Regmod) with the number of composited samples in 40

| Method   | Tonnes     |   NiEq% |
|----------|------------|---------|
| OK       | 10,819,971 |    0.54 |

| NN       | 10,140,114 |    0.56 |

m  corridors.    The  swath  plot  was  the  prime  classification  consideration  in choosing  476,525E  as  the  boundary  between  Indicated  and  Inferred  Resources (Figure 17-6).

- · Quantile plots of the composited assay data (Mincmp) were compared with the regularized  block  model  (Regmod)  nickel  grades  in  a  QQ  plot  to  assess  the distortion of grade distribution as shown in Figure 17-7.

## MINERAL RESERVES

No pre-feasibility study or feasibility study has been carried out by Landore or FNI and  consequently,  under  CIM  definitions,  there  are  no  reserves  reported  for  the  West Graham property.

## 18 OTHER RELEVANT DATA AND INFORMATION

No  environmental  permitting  has  been  completed  by  FNI  for  the  West  Graham property, however, the claims fall within the area of the MMER study (Mining Effluent Regulations  of  the  Fisheries  Act) completed  for  the  Lockerby  Mine  and  submitted  to Environment Canada in 2006.  FNI is currently in the process of completing the second cycle EEM (Mining Environmental Effects Monitoring) - MMER report for the period of 2006 to 2008.

All other information in connection with the resource estimate for the Conwest Zone on the West Graham property has been addressed above.

## 19 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS

Scott Wilson RPA independently estimated Mineral Resources for the Conwest Zone on the West Graham property.  The Conwest Zone is interpreted to represent a large, low grade Ni-Cu-Co-Ag±PGE±Au bearing contact type disseminated sulphide deposit hosted by  dark  norite  and  located  stratigraphically  above  sublayer  norite  at  the  base  of  the Sudbury Igneous Complex.  The Conwest Zone tops at 45 m depth, extends for some 375 m on strike and 573 m along dip, and is up to 66 m thick.  The zone dips moderately at approximately 53º to the north and is 500 m up dip from the Lockerby Mine East Zone, which was developed and has witnessed limited mining by Falconbridge and FNI in the past.    The  Conwest  Zone  continues  onto  Vale  Inco's  Corridor  Claim  to  the  west, however,  no  drilling  data  for  the  Vale  Inco  property  were  available  for  the  resource estimate  and  the  resource  estimate  is  terminated  to  within  five  metres  of  the  west boundary to allow for a boundary pillar.

The resource estimate is  based  entirely  on  surface  diamond  drilling,  core  sampling and assaying.  Drilling was completed in three campaigns by three operators since the 1960s.  FNI's drilling was designed to fill-in and expand the zone, resulting in a 25 m drill  hole  section  spacing  with  30  m  to  50  m  zone  intercepts  along  dip  to  provide sufficient sampling to class a portion of the resources as Indicated.

Scott Wilson RPA reviewed and audited the drilling and assaying data and the drill hole database.  Scott Wilson RPA is of the opinion that the exploration has been industry standard and in compliance with best practices.  The sampling and assaying and database preparation  are  industry  standard  and  acceptable  for  Mineral  Resource  and  Mineral Reserve estimation, with some reservations as further noted below.

The resource estimate was carried out by conventional wireframing of mineralization at 0.30% nickel equivalent and 3D computer block modelling using ordinary kriging for grade interpolation.  The resource was classified into Indicated and Inferred based on drill hole and sampling density.  Drilling is focused in the area close to the west and north property  boundaries,  where  Indicated  Resources  are  delineated,  and  becomes  more

widely  spaced  to  the  east,  where  Inferred  Resources  are  outlined.    The  wireframed mineral  envelope  is  estimated  to  contain  8.55  million  tonnes  of  Indicated  Resources averaging  0.45%  Ni,  0.31%  Cu  and  0.01%  Co  and  2.0  million  tonnes  of  Inferred Resources averaging 0.38% Ni, 0.33% Cu and 0.01% Co.

Scott Wilson RPA notes that the downhole deviation surveys for the 1960s drilling by Conwest were limited but industry standard for the time.  Coupled with the tendency to higher  deviation  for  the  narrower  diameter  (AX)  drill  tooling  used,  there  is  some uncertainty  in  the  spatial  location  of  the  Conwest  assay  intercepts  with  respect  to  the well-located  Falconbridge  and  FNI  drilling  resulting  from  modern,  industry  standard downhole surveys.  In addition,  the  Conwest  assays  for  nickel  appear  to  be  somewhat higher overall than the Falconbridge and FNI assays and there may be a problem with the assays for three consecutive Conwest drill holes on the west side of the deposit adjacent to the property boundary.  These assays are located in the upper portion of the zone where there is proportionately less sampling by Falconbridge and FNI.

## 20 RECOMMENDATIONS

Scott Wilson RPA has the following recommendations:

- · Complete  metallurgical  testing  to  confirm  metal  recoveries  by  conventional processing.
- · Carry  out  a  scoping  study/preliminary  assessment  of  the  Conwest  Zone  to evaluate  the  potential  for  economic  viability  and  consider  options  as  either  a stand-alone milling operation or with mine production sold to Xstrata as part of the FNI-Xstrata Off-Take agreement, metallurgical aspects permitting.
- · Contingent on encouragement from the preliminary economic assessment:
- o Twin  Conwest  holes  WG-25  to  WG-27  to  verify  their  higher  grade  nickel intercepts.
- o Carry  out  diamond  drilling  on  the  east  portion  of  the  zone  to  upgrade  the Inferred Resources to Indicated Resources.
- o Update  the  Conwest  Zone  resource  estimate  to  reflect  additional  drill  hole data.

In consultation with FNI,  Scott Wilson  RPA  has  prepared  a  budget  for  the recommended work (Table 20-1).
