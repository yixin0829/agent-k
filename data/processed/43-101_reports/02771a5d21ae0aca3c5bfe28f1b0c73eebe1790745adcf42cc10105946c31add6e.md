## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The following report was prepared to provide a NI 43-101 compliant Technical Report on the six deposits situated on the Nunavik Nickel Project, (NNP) for which there are resource estimates (TK  excluded  due  to  its  small  size).  Independent  Resource  Estimates  of  the  nickel,  copper, platinum, palladium, gold, (PGE) mineralization on the Allammaq, Expo, Ivakkak, Mequillon, Mesamax and Puimajuq Deposits comprising the Nunavik Nickel Project, Nunavik, Quebec (the 'Property' or the 'Project') are detailed in this report. Until this report, each of the Deposits had been reported on independently.

The  Nunavik  Nickel  Project  previously  belonged  to  Canadian  Royalties  Inc.,  ('CRI').  As  of January 13, 2010, Jien Canada Mining Ltd., ('JCM') acquired all of the outstanding common shares of Canadian Royalties (being the Shares held by holders other than JCM) in exchange for $0.80 per Share. As a result of the Arrangement, JCM now owns 100% of the outstanding Shares of Canadian Royalties. Goldbrook Ventures Inc. ('Goldbrook') owns 25% of the voting shares of JCM, and for the purposes of this Technical Report, Goldbrook is the client.

The  Expo,  Mesamax,  Mequillon,  Allammaq  and  Ivakkak  Deposits  lie  on  the  Expo-Ungava Property located approximately 80 kilometres west of the village of Kangiqsujuaq, (Wakeham Bay) and approximately 30 kilometres east-southeast of the Katinniq Mine, part of the Raglan operations  of  Xstrata  Nickel,  (a  subsidiary  of  Xstrata  PLC).  The  Property  is  in  the  northern Québec region of Nunavik, and is centred at 6825000N and 585000E in UTM NAD83 Zone 18.

The Puimajuq Deposit lies on the New Foreurs East Property, which is contiguous to the east of the Expo-Ungava Property.

Air  Inuit  and  First  Air  provide  daily  air  service  from  Montreal  and  Val-d'Or  to  the  coastal communities  of  Kuujjuaq,  Salluit  and  nearby  Kangiqsujuaq.  Air  service  from  Salluit  also connects to the community of Radisson in the James Bay hydroelectric development area.

The  Cape  Smith  Belt  in  which  all  of  the  deposits  of  the  Nunavik  Nickel  Project  lie,  is  an interpreted  foreland  thrust-fold  belt  that  constitutes  the  north-eastern  extension  of  the  TransHudson  Orogen,  an  early  Proterozoic  collision  zone,  which  separates  the  Archean  Superior Province  from  the  Proterozoic  Churchill  Province.  The  Trans-Hudson  Orogen  includes  the Thompson Nickel Belt of Manitoba and the New Quebec Orogen (Labrador Trough) on opposite sides of the Superior Province. The Cape Smith (Ungava) Belt extends for 375 kilometres in an east-west direction across the Ungava Peninsula of Nunavik.

The Property is located within the central portion of the assemblage, near the suture separating the  foreland  from  the  hinterland  domains.  The  North  Domain  is  dominated  by  the  mostly volcanic Watts Group, which has been interpreted as an Island-Arc accretionary complex. The South Domain  includes the Lamarche, Povungnituk, and Chukotat Groups, which are collectively interpreted as an extensional sequence consisting mainly of basalts, sediments and ultramafic rocks grading into oceanic crust towards the north. The boundary between the North and  South  domains  is  marked  by  the  regional  scale  Bergeron  Fault,  considered  to  be  a subduction zone.

The geology of all six deposits for which there are currently resource estimates is all essentially the same, though the morphology of each can be very different. It is believed that all deposits are part of the Expo Intrusive Suite, as detailed by Mungall, 2004. The dyke portions within which

the  deposits  lie  can  be  essentially  horizontal  to  essentially  vertical,  and  the  proportions  of massive to net-textured to disseminated sulphides can vary greatly.

The mineral occurrences along the South Trend as well as those of the Raglan Trend to the north belong to the class of magmatic sulphide deposits, (Eckstrand, 1996).

A broad  group  of  deposits  containing  nickel-copper-platinum  group  elements  (PGE)  occur  as sulphur segregations associated with a variety of mafic and ultramafic magmatic rocks. Among such deposits, two main subtypes are distinguishable. In the first, the Ni-Cu sulphide type, nickel and copper are economic commodities contained in sulphide-rich ores that are associated with differentiated  mafic  sills  and  stocks  and  ultramafic  volcanic  (komatiitic)  flows  and  sills.  The second type, magmatic PGE is mined principally for PGE's which are associated with sparsely dispersed sulphides in medium to large, typically layered mafic to ultramafic intrusions.

As a group, magmatic nickel-copper sulphide deposits have accounted for most of the world's past and current production of nickel. International reserves of magmatic sulphide nickel remain large, though they are exceeded by those of lateritic nickel deposits, the only other significant source of nickel.

Most  nickel  sulphide  deposits  consist  of  several  closely  adjacent,  but  discrete  orebodies, therefore the definition of a 'deposit' is rather arbitrary. Individual orebodies may contain from a few hundred thousand to a few million tonnes of ore, and in some instances tens of millions of tonnes of ore. Mining grades are generally about 1 to 3% Ni, but may be higher in some small deposits.

Although  Eckstrand  (1996)  groups  the  Expo  Ungava  Deposit  with  those  related  to  komatiitic flows and related intrusions, considerable evidence suggests that the deposits located along the South Trend are related to continental or continental margin intrusive suites. The fact that these deposits have nickel/copper ratios of approximately 0.8:1 and are universally endowed in PGE also contrasts with the standard komatiitic model.

Petrographic work by Walker (2004) identified pyrrhotite (FeS) as the main sulphide mineral, followed by pentlandite ([Fe, Ni], S) and chalcopyrite (CuFeS2). Pentlandite occurs generally as a separate mineral and only rarely as exsolution lamellae in pyrrhotite. It appears to be the main cobalt carrier. Magnetite, (Fe3O4) is rare to absent.

The  results  of  more  detailed  mineralogical  work  at  the  Mesamax  Deposit  (Cabri,  2003)  are pertinent  to  Mequillon,  Expo,  Allammaq,  Ivakkak  and  Puimajuq.  At  Mesamax,  accessory sulphides are galena (PbS), sphalerite (ZnS), cubanite (CuFe2S3) and cobaltite (CoAsS). Cabri also  reported  a  large  number  of  platinum  group  minerals  (PGEs).  He  identified  sudburyite (PbSb) and a new Pd2Sb mineral as the principal palladium carriers in net textured and massive sulphides, respectively, and PGE tellurides such as michenerite (PdBiTe), merenskyite (PdTe2), moncheite (PtTe2) and kotulskite (PdTe) as well as  sperrylite  (PtAs2).  Electrum  (a  gold-silver alloy of varying composition) appears to be the main gold carrier.

The Nunavik Nickel Project currently holds resources in six (plus the very minor TK Deposit) Deposits.

In  2007,  SNC  Lavalin  completed  a  Definitive  Feasibility  Study,  ('DFS',  or  'BFS')  on  the Nunavik Nickel Project. For the purposes of the DFS, the project comprises the development of three open pit mines: The Expo Mine, the Mesamax Mine and the Ivakkak Mine. The Ivakkak Mine  also  has  planned  underground  workings  that  will  be  developed  once  the  open  pit  is exhausted. The Mequillon, Puimajuq and Allammaq Deposits at the time the DFS was completed were not considered advanced enough in terms of resources to be able to consider them.

Conventional  open  pit  mining  methods  would  be  used  to  exploit  98%  of  the  reserves  of  the project. Mesamax and Ivakkak ores would be blended with Expo ores for the first four years of the project. Reserves from the Ivakkak underground zones A and C would be mined in years 5 and 6 and also blended with ore from the Expo open pit.

Open  pit  designs  incorporate  allowances  for  appropriate  access  ramps,  wall  slope  angles, catchment  berms  and  minimum  mining  widths  for  the  equipment  selected.  The  following parameters  were  used  in  the  pit  design:  US$6.00/lb  nickel,  US$1.50/lb  copper,  US$900/oz platinum and US$300/oz palladium.

Reserve determinations include allowances for dilution, which vary with each resource. Mining losses were assumed to be 5% (not included in the following table), and were factored into the mining plan and financial analysis. The average strip ratio for open pit mining is 3.37:1 over the life of mine, excluding the waste material extracted during the underground mine development.

Discounted cash flow modeling of the project yields a full equity base case internal rate of return (IRR) of 8.1% and a net present value (NPV) of CAD$0.85 million at a discount rate of 8%, both

calculated after tax and in nominal terms. A construction escalation rate of 3.5% annually and an inflation rate of 2% during the mine operation were assumed.

Mine site construction of the Nunavik Nickel Project commenced on May 20th, 2008, however in response to the global financial crisis, on August 5th, 2008, the Project was placed on care and maintenance.

The Project infrastructure currently consists of:

- • An access-road that links into the existing road-network;
- • Employee housing complex for 300 people;
- • Potable water and waste-water treatment plants;
- • Concentrator foundation with thermosyphons;
- • Temporary shelters for equipment and materials;
- • Detailed concentrator engineering 90% completed;
- • Structural steel, flotation cells and other mill components on site;
- • Long-lead items procured (ball mills etc.).

Prior to resumption of the Project construction, Jien Canada Mining should undertake a detailed engineering  review.  The  budget  necessary  in  order  to  resume  construction  should  reflect  the engineering approach and any variance from the original development plans. An amount close to the original estimate of $465 million is anticipated.

Once the Company is satisfied with the current Project economics, construction should resume with the goal of attaining commercial production as soon as possible.

## 3.0 PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND TENURE

## 3.1 DESCRIPTION AND TENURE

The  Expo,  Mesamax,  Mequillon,  Allammaq  and  Ivakkak  Deposits  lie  on  the  Expo-Ungava Property located approximately 80 kilometres west of the village of Kangiqsujuaq, (also known as  Wakeham  Bay)  in  the  northern  Québec  region  of  Nunavik,  and  centred  at  6825000N  and 585000E  in  UTM  NAD83  Zone  18.  The  Puimajuq  Deposit  lies  on  the  New  Foreurs  East Property, which is contiguous to the east of the Expo-Ungava Property.

Jien Canada Mining Ltd., ('JCM') owns the Nunavik Nickel Project. JCM is a wholly owned subsidiary  of  Goldbrook  (25%)  and  Jilin  Jien  Nickel  Industry  Company  Ltd.  (75%).  For  the purposes of this report, Goldbrook is the client.

The Expo-Ungava Property, which is one of the 41 properties belonging to the Nunavik Nickel Project,  is  owned  80%  by  Jien  Canada  Mining  Ltd.  ('JCM'),  and  10%  by  Ungava  Minerals Corp./Nearctic Nickel Mines Inc. As of June 30, 2009, the steps necessary to acquire a 100% interest in the Expo-Ungava Property were underway, given that Ungava had failed to bring its joint venture account into good standing.

## 4.0 LOCATION, ACCESS, CLIMATE, PHYSIOGRAPHY &amp; INFRASTRUCTURE

## 4.1 LOCATION AND ACCESS

The Nunavik Nickel Project area is located approximately 80 kilometres west of the village of Kangiqsujuaq, (also known as Wakeham Bay) in the northern Québec region of Nunavik and approximately 30 kilometres east-southeast of the Katinniq Mine, part of the Raglan operations of  Xstrata  Nickel,  (a  subsidiary  of  Xstrata  PLC).  The  Property  is  centred  at  6825000N  and 585000E in UTM NAD83 Zone 18.

Air  Inuit  and  First  Air  provide  daily  air  service  from  Montreal  and  Val-d'Or  to  the  coastal communities  of  Kuujjuaq,  Salluit  and  nearby  Kangiqsujuaq.  Air  service  from  Salluit  also connects to the community of Radisson in the James Bay hydroelectric development area.

Goldbrook uses commercial air services from Montreal and Quebec City to Iqaluit and Salluit during the summer months to support the exploration programs. Project logistics are facilitated by Air Inuit charter, Twin Otter (DHC-6), shuttle service to the Belanger camp from the coastal village  of  Salluit,  Nunavik,  or  from  Iqaluit  in  Nunavuk.  The  Property  can  also  be  reached  by helicopter from the nearby coastal villages. Daily fieldwork requires helicopter support.

Shipping operations (sealift) during the summer months is conducted at Bombardier Beach on Deception Bay and, to a much lesser extent, Douglas Harbour.

In  2005,  an  access  road  was  constructed  from  the  Deception  Bay  /  Katinniq  /  Donaldson  / Douglas Harbour road network south to the Mesamax Deposit, which has improved access to the Mesamax, Allammaq and Expo areas .

In addition, construction was completed on an additional access road in the fall of 2007 from the east-west Katinniq / Donaldson road south to the Expo Deposit, a distance of approximately 18 kilometres.  The  road  facilitates  ground  transportation  to  and  from  Bombardier  Beach  at Deception Bay.  Work around the Expo complex and the Deposit is now fully ground-supported.

## 4.2 CLIMATE AND PHYSIOGRAPHY

The Expo-Ungava Property is located on a broad plateau, in an area of gently rolling topography north  of  the  tree  line,  within  the  Povungnituk  Range.  The  topography  is  characterized  by moderate to steep east-west  trending  ridges  and  valleys.  Vegetation  consists  of  sparse  shrubs, plants  and  grasses,  which  grow  to  less  than  25  centimetres  in  height.  Outcrop  ridges  are generally  bare  rock,  devoid  of  vegetation,  where  outcrop  or  subcrop  is  commonly  reduced  to heaps of frost-heaved blocks and boulders. The low areas between outcrop ridges are typically flat, grass-covered tundra traversed by small streams.

The entire area is affected by permafrost resulting in the widespread formation of soil polygons and other soil solifluction features that form in response to a type of creep that takes place in regions  where  the  ground  freezes  to  a  considerable  depth  and  as  it  thaws  during  the  warm seasons the upper thawed position creeps downhill over the frozen material. The soil moves as a viscous liquid down slopes of as little as 2 or 3 degrees and may carry rocks of considerable size in  suspension. At Raglan, the permafrost reaches a depth of 400 metres, and the average rock temperature is -6 Cº (Falconbridge Annual Report 1998). Elevation is 550-600 metres above sea

level  and  the  relief  is  subdued  and  ranges  from  50  to  75  metres.  Overburden  in  the  area  is generally less than 20 metres in thickness (from drillhole information). The climate of the area is harsh,  with  summer  (July  and  early  August)  temperatures  ranging  from  0  Cº  to  20  Cº  while winter temperatures range from 0 Cº to -50 Cº. Snow can accumulate in any month of the year, and  parts  of  some  sheltered  ridges  can  remain  snow  covered  throughout  the  year.  The  field season  for  surface  exploration  activities  optimally  lasts  the  months  of  June,  July,  August  and early September, with some early winter snow expected in late August and early September. The area is subject to strong wind conditions and periods of dense fog.

## 4.3 INFRASTRUCTURE

Construction  of  the  Nunavik  Nickel  Project  commenced  on  May  20th,  2008,  however  in response to the global financial crisis, on August 5th, 2008, the Project was placed on care and maintenance.

The Project infrastructure currently consists of:

- • An access-road that links into the existing road-network;
- • Employee housing complex for 300 people;
- • Potable water and waste-water treatment plants;
- • Concentrator foundation with thermosyphons;
- • Temporary shelters for equipment and materials;
- • Detailed concentrator engineering 90% completed;
- • Structural steel, flotation cells and other mill components on site;
- • Long-lead items procured (ball mills etc.).

## 5.0 HISTORY AND PREVIOUS EXPLORATION

## 5.1 INTRODUCTION

Previous records indicate that approximately 9,144 metres of core were drilled in the area of the deposits since the 1950's. Much of the historical and relatively recent (1997) drill core from the Property was located by Canadian Royalties and found to be well preserved. Canadian Royalties initially tested for platinum-palladium-gold mineralization in sample pulps from the High North Resources / Expo Ungava 1997 drill program, as none of the previous owners had analysed for PGE. The sample pulps from mineralized zone intercepts from holes EX 97-1, EX 97-2, EX 973, and EX 97-4 representing mainly disseminated sulphide mineralization were analysed. As a result of these encouraging findings, Canadian Royalties initiated a re-logging and re-assaying program  during  the  2001  field  program  on  historic  drill  core  from  the  Expo  Deposit,  with particular emphasis on the PGE. Positive results launched multiple, continuous exploration and diamond  drilling  campaigns  which  led  to  the  discovery  of  five  deposits  and  a  considerable increase in resources for two others.

## 5.2.1 EARLY REGIONAL EXPLORATION HISTORY

Exploration  of  the  Nunavik  Nickel  Project  area  has  a  long  history  beginning  in  the  general Ungava  area  with  Mr.  Murray  Watts  in  the  1930's.  Major  discoveries  over  the  years  include Falconbridge's Raglan deposits in 1964-66, the Amax Expo deposit in 1967, and the CRI TK, Mesamax, Mequillon and Ivakkak deposits in 2001-2005. A summary of the early exploration in the region of the Project area is given in table 5-1 below:

## 5.2.2 RECENT EXPLORATION CARRIED OUT BY CRI

The following is a summary of the more recent exploration carried out at the Mesamax, Expo, Mequillon, Ivakkak, Allammaq and Puimajuq deposits.

## 2001

From July through September of 2001, Canadian Royalties completed an integrated exploration program  on  portions  of  the  Nunavik  Nickel  Project,  targeting  disseminated,  net-textured,  and massive sulphides within the basal portions of ultramafic flows and/or intrusions.

## Mesamax Main Grid

- · The  main  grid,  originally  established  in  1997  by  High  North  Resources  Inc.,  was  reestablished.

- · Two diamond drill holes completed.

## Mesamax NW Grid

- · 20.5 line kilometres of grid established in this area.
- · Geological mapping, together with a review of historical drill core, identified the North and South Ultramafic units.
- · Diamond drilling carried out in a series of fanned holes on a single section intersected PGE mineralization.
- · Grab samples returned assays up to 6.6 g/t PGE, in association with Ni-Cu mineralization, with  one  sample  indicating  an  extension  of  mineralization  350  metres  east  of  main occurrence.
- · Magnetic and HLEM surveys completed on the Mesamax NW grid by High North Resources in  1997 and CRI in 2001 on 100-metre spaced lines define a short and wide near-surface, very conductive zone, dipping to the north and having a limited depth extent.

## Expo Deposit

- · Initial re-assaying program of four historical drill holes from 1997 for PGE. Positive results lead to CRI commencing a re-logging and re-assaying program on historic drill core from the Expo deposit.

## 2002

The 2002 field exploration program focused on exploring areas deemed favourable for hosting Ni-Cu-PGE mineralization, including  mineralized ultramafic  bodies  identified  during  previous exploration  programs,  areas  identified  by  CRI  during  the  2001  exploration  program,  areas  of documented  sulphide  occurrences  within  or  adjacent  to  ultramafic  bodies,  and  geophysical targets along the ultramafic trend with coincident surface mineralization.

## Mesamax Rainbow Grid

- · Rainbow Grid re-established, with a total of 22.6 km of picketed grid lines established.
- · Exploration,  including  mapping,  sampling  and  the  assessment  of  a  number  of  airborne anomalies  in  the  area  focussed  on  the  evaluation  of  the  north-eastern  continuation  of  the Mesamax Main ultramafic body.
- · A number of grab samples returned results up to 0.1%Ni, 1.1% Cu, and 2.8 g/t PGE.

## Mesamax Main Grid

- · An HLEM test was also carried out using a 50-metre coil separation, confirming the previous interpretation.
- · 40 diamond drill holes were completed along a 250 metre strike extent of the ultramafic.

## Expo Deposit

- · Diamond drilling in the Expo Northeast area identified a significant mineralized horizon with a strike length in excess of 122 metres.

## Mequillon North Grid

- · The Mequillon North grid established by High North Resources in 1997 was refurbished with the focus on evaluating an area of surface mineralization with associated historic diamond drilling.
- · Mapping outlined a 1,500 m by 100 m peridotite ultramafic body, oriented in a northeastsouthwest direction.
- · A  historical  showing  of  sulphide  mineralization  was  re-located  along  the  southwestern margin of the peridotite.
- · 10 grab samples yielded up to 0.3% Ni, 0.6% Cu and 1.5 g/t PGE.
- · 6 drill holes were completed along the pyroxenite-peridotite body with significant sulphide mineralization encountered in all holes.

## Mequillon Northeast Grid

- · The  Mequillon  Northeast  Grid  was  established  with  the  purpose  to  evaluate  the  northeast continuation of the ultramafic body extending from the Mequillon North grid.
- · The ultramafic body was mapped for 900 m in a northeast direction, up to 300 m in width, with sulphide mineralization along the north and south margins.
- · A  total  of  28  grab  samples  were  collected  from  the  areas  of  mineralization  and  central portions of the peridotite. The highest grab sample returned 0.5% Ni, 0.9% Cu and 2.3 g/t PGE.
- · An electromagnetic  survey  using  the  MaxMin  II  horizontal-loop  system  with  a  100-metre coil separation was completed by Discovery Geophysics Inc. over the Mequillon Northeast grid, indicating a strong near-surface conductor over the centre of the Mequillon ultramafic body.

## 2003

The successful 2001-2002 exploration programs resulted in an expanded $5 million program in 2003, including over 20,000 metres of drilling in 170 drill holes at nine exploration areas.

CRI conducted an extensive AeroTEM airborne electromagnetic survey in 2003, of 4,818 line kilometres on the central and eastern portion of the Nunavik Nickel Project area.

With  the  mineral  potential  of  the  Raglan  South  Nickel  Project  becoming  more  apparent,  and based on an expanding knowledgebase, CRI acquired an additional 228 km  of ground in 2003. 2 CRI also initiated environmental baseline studies in 2003.

## Mesamax Deposit

- · An initial resource estimate on the Mesamax deposit, prepared by Strathcona, was received by CRI on April 15, 2003, incorporating information from 41 diamond drill holes.
- · 39 diamond drill holes were completed, confirming the continuity of mineralization within the deposit and extending the deposit to the east, west and depth.

## Expo Deposit

- · 67  diamond  drill  holes  were  drilled  in  the  Expo  Northeast  area,  identifying  a  significant mineralized horizon with a strike length in excess of 122 metres.

## Mequillon Northeast Grid

- · 18  diamond  drill  holes  completed,  defining  disseminated  to  locally  massive  Ni-Cu-PGE sulphide mineralization of a 400 metre strike length

## 2004

With some of its project areas reaching an advanced stage CRI began undertaking predevelopment studies in preparation for any future development of mining operations on the property. In 2004, mineralogical, petrological, metallurgical, mineralogical studies to determine PGE distribution, environmental baseline studies, and additional evaluation of the setting, origin, and  emplacement  of  the  Ni-Cu-PGE  mineralization  in  the  Expo  and  Mesamax  deposits  were initiated.

Preliminary  metallurgical  results  were  received  by  CRI  in  late  2004  with  the  following recoveries indicated.

## Mesamax Deposit

- · An  updated  resource  estimate  for  the  Mesamax  Deposit  based  on  the  2003  drilling  was received  from  Strathcona  Mineral  Services  Limited,  increasing  the  estimate  to  1,840,000 tonnes grading 1.9% Ni, 2.3% Cu, 0.08% Co, 0.9 g Pt/t, 4.3 g Pd/t, and 0.3 g/t gold. The deposit was considered well suited for open pit mining.
- · Pre-feasibility level drilling commenced in late 2004 with 41 holes completed, including 14 metallurgical holes.
- · SGS  Lakefield  completed  interim  metallurgical  test  work  prior  to  year-end  2004  on  ore samples  collected  earlier  in  the  year.  Initial  results  indicated  no  unusual  metallurgical characteristics with respect to grindability or payable sulphide concentration using standard floatation techniques.

## Expo Deposit

- · A topographic survey providing accurate drill hole collar elevations and a basic contour map was  completed  in  2004  allowing  most  of  the  historical  data  to  be  incorporated  into  the database.
- · 43  diamond  drill  holes  were  completed  and  111  drill  holes  from  2003  and  2004  were incorporated  into  the  database,  allowing  for  the  initiation  of  a  resource  estimate  by Strathcona Mineral Services Limited.
- · SGS  Lakefield  completed  interim  metallurgical  test  work  on  net-textured  ore  samples collected in 2004. Initial results showed no unusual metallurgical characteristics with respect to grindability or payable sulphide concentration using standard floatation techniques, with recoveries significantly better than work completed by AMAX in the late 1960's and 1970.

## Mequillon Deposit

- · 77  diamond  drill  holes  were  completed,  revealing  high-grade  palladium  intercepts  greater than 10 g/t over significant intervals at the then eastern limit of the deposit.
- · SGS  Lakefield  completed  interim  metallurgical  test  work  prior  to  year-end  2004  on  ore samples  collected  earlier  in  the  year.  Initial  results  indicated  no  unusual  metallurgical characteristics with respect to grindability or payable sulphide concentration using standard floatation techniques.
- · An initial  estimate  of  the  inferred  resources  at  Mequillon  was  reported  on  September  22, 2004,  of  1.4  million  tonnes  at  average  grades  of  0.7%  Ni,  0.9%  Cu,  2.9  g/t  PGE.  The estimate was carried out by Strathcona Mineral Services Limited and based on 18 diamond drill holes drilled from 2002 to 2003.

## 2005

Work at the Nunavik Nickel Project included a significant AeroTEM airborne electromagnetic survey of 2,674 line kilometres on the western portion of the project area. A 15 kilometre road was also constructed from the vicinity of the Donaldson airport on Falconbridge's Raglan mine site  to  the  Mesamax  Deposit,  allowing  equipment  access  to  the  deposit  area,  and  the  ground transportation  of  personnel  and  supplies.  A  temporary  equipment  and  supply  shelter  was  also constructed  to  improve  project  efficiency  and  extend  the  season,  and  environmental  baseline field studies were conducted for the third season.

## Mesamax Deposit

- · An  updated  resource  estimate  increased  the  resource  at  Mesamax  to  1,848,000  tonnes grading 2.1% Ni, 2.6% Cu, 0.08% Co, 0.2 g Au/t, 1.0 g Pt/t and 3.8 g Pd/t. Contributing factors to the new estimate included the drilling of 27 new holes, the loss of massive sulphide due to the geometry of the deposit, the inclusion of one metre of skin of dilution around the deposit,  as  well  as  to  the  metallurgical  test  work  indicating  that  the  near  surface  oxidized massive  sulphide  overlying  the  original  resource  will  produce  saleable  concentrates  at reasonable recoveries.
- · A 34 tonne representative bulk sample of drill core from 63 HQ-sized holes was collected from  the  Mesamax  Deposit  and  used  as  feed  for  pilot  plant  metallurgical  testing  to  be conducted by SGS Lakefield.
- · 22 diamond drill holes were completed, 3 of which were drilled for geotechnical purposes and 2 holes (drilled in 2003) were deepened, with drilling defining massive and disseminated Ni-Cu-PGE mineralization over a strike length of 250 metres and widths of up to 100 metres largely occurring between the surface and 80 metres depth.

## Expo Deposit

- · A fully compliant resource estimate on the Expo deposit, carried out by Strathcona Mineral Services Limited was received by CRI on August 8, 2005.
- · 32 drill holes were completed within and proximal to the Expo deposit, sufficiently defining the limits of the main deposit to allow for the initiation of geotechnical studies.

## Mequillon Deposit

- · A 20 person exploration camp was constructed at the Mequillon Deposit to improve project logistics and efficiency.
- · Strathcona prepared an updated resource estimate on the Mequillon Deposit as outlined in their technical report dated May 30, 2005.
- · 19 holes were drilled at the Mequillon Deposit, extending the known mineralization of the deposit 50 metres east traced continuously for approximately 1300 metres along strike.

## Ivakkak Deposit

- · The Ivakkak Deposit was distinguishable on at least two flight lines of the 2005 AeroTEM II geophysical survey flown over the western portion of the Nunavik Nickel Project area.
- · Ground geophysical surveys including Max-Min Mk II and Crone TEM (time domain EM) surveys were also carried out over the Ivakkak Deposit. The Max-Min survey defining the deposit  over  a  200  metre  strike  length,  with  a  steep  dip  to  the  north  and  a  plunge  to  the northwest. The MAG survey indicated a strong coincident positive response and the TEM survey  indicated  at  least  a  100  metre  extension  to  the  west  and  an  abrupt  termination towards the east.
- · The  area  was  geologically  mapped  and  sampled,  with  disseminated  sulphide-bearing pyroxenite/gabbro float found to be containing geochemically anomalous Ni, Cu and PGE values.
- · 32 holes were drilled at approximately 25 metre intervals over a strike length of 275 metres, with the Ivakkak Deposit zone remaining open to expansion.
- · In  March  of  2006,  CRI  reported  indicated  resources  at  the  Ivakkak  Deposit  of  520,000 tonnes grading 1.62% Ni, 2.06% Cu, 0.07% Co and 4.4 g/t PGE and 105,000 tonnes inferred resources grading 1.66% Ni, 1.88% Cu, 0.07% Co, and 4.3 g/t PGE.

## 2006

A Preliminary Economic Assessment was completed by P&amp;E and Roche Ltd., Consulting Group, the  objective  of  which  was  to  define  an  initial  8-10  year  mining  plan  for  the  Nunavik  Nickel Project.

Geological mapping, specifically with regard to structural and genetic controls on the distribution of metals in the deposit was undertaken by Dr. James Mungall. Dr. Mungall also conducted a series of modeling  exercises  which  were  designed  to  elucidate  the  origins of sulphide mineralization at the Mesamax NW, Expo-Ungava and Mequillon Deposits.

## Mesamax Deposit

- · The  pilot  plant  metallurgical  testing  on  the  34  tonne  bulk  sample  collected  from  the Mesamax Deposit in 2005 was initiated by SGS Lakefield in January of 2006.

## Expo Deposit

- · In 2006, 44 holes were drilled, including 8 geotechnical holes, four of which were sampled and included in the resource estimate.
- · Half  drill  core  samples  of  Expo  mineralization  were  sent  to  SGS  Lakefield  in  January  of 2006  and  again  in  April,  2006  with  the  goal  of  investigating  grindability  and  flotation characteristics of blended Expo and Mesamax mineralization. Of principal interest was the metallurgical response to coarsening primary grind while maintaining acceptable concentrate recovery and grade. Results of the study are reported in 'SGS Lakefield Report 10749-004 Report 8', dated August 8, 2006.
- · In  December  2006,  CRI  reported  indicated  resources  for  the  Expo  Deposit  of  8,562,000 tonnes  grading  0.8%  Ni,  0.8%  Cu,  0.04%  Co,  0.3  g  Pt/t,  1.4  g  Pd/t  and  0.1  g  Au/t  and inferred resources of 478,000 tonnes grading 0.8% Ni, 0.8% Cu, 0.04% Co, 0.3 g Pt/t, 1.3 g Pd/t and 0.1 g Au/t.

## Mequillon Deposit

- · 9 holes were drilled to further test the easterly extension of the Mequillon Deposit.

## Ivakkak Deposit

- · 58 diamond  drill holes were  completed  at the Ivakkak  Deposit in 2006, outlining mineralization of at least 250 metre strike-length.

## 2007

A  Preliminary  Feasibility  Study  considering  the  Mesamax,  Expo  and  Ivakkak  Deposits  was completed  by  SNC-Lavalin  Inc.,  in  June  of  2007.  The  study  demonstrated  robust  project economics with a rapid payback of the capital investment (1.9 to 2.9 years at US$10/lb Ni and US$6/lb Ni, respectively), with significant cash flow being generated by annual metal production that would average over the first four years:

- · 11,800 tonnes per year (26,014,000 lb) of nickel in concentrate;
- · 17,600 tonnes per year (38,800,000 lb) of copper in concentrate;
- · 78,600 oz per year of palladium in concentrate.
- · 14,500 oz per year of platinum in concentrate; and

By the end of 2007, the company was ready to commence construction for the Nunavik Nickel Project.

## Mesamax Deposit

- · In  May  of  2007,  CRI  reported  indicated  resources  for  the  Mesamax  Deposit  of  2,217,804 tonnes  grading  1.9%  Ni,  2.6%  Cu,  0.08%  Co,  1.0  g  Pt/t,  3.6  g  Pd/t  and  0.2  g  Au/t  and inferred resources of 31,137 tonnes grading 1.6% Ni, 1.8% Cu, 0.07% Co, 0.6 g Pt/t, 3.6 g Pd/t and 0.2 g Au/t.

- · In January of 2007, CRI reported indicated resources for the Ivakkak Deposit of 1,128,000 grading  1.2%  Ni,  1.5%  Cu,  0.05%  Co,  0.6  g  Pt/t,  3.1  g  Pd/t  and  0.2  g  Au/t  and  inferred resources of 41,000 tonnes grading 1.2% Ni, 1.3% Cu, 0.05% Co, 0.7 g Pt/t, 2.9 g Pd/t and 0.1 g Au/t.

## Allammaq Deposit

- · The Allammaq Deposit was discovered during the 2007 drill program in which 32 diamond drill holes were drilled, delineating two separate zones of net-textured sulphide mineralization.
- · In  June  of  2008  Canadian  Resources  announced  that  it  had  successfully  and  conclusively detected  the  Allammaq  Deposit  using  advanced  electromagnetic  geophysical  techniques (SQUID sensors).
- · A  production  SQUID  survey  between  the  Allammaq  and  Mesamax  Deposits  commenced during the winter of 2008 and was completed during early summer.

## Puimajuq Deposit

- · Canadian  Royalties  also  discovered  the  Puimajuq  Deposit  in  2007  while  drill-testing  a suspected  ultramafic  intrusion  based  on  EM  surveying.  Drilling  at  the  deposit  totalled  7 holes.

## 2008

Early in 2008, Canadian Royalties met several important objectives, including the signing of the Nunavik Nickel Agreement (Impact Benefits Agreement), being issued critical land leases for the  4  mining  leases  and  the  4  waste  dumps  at  Ivakkak,  Mequillon,  Expo  and  Mesamax,  the commencement  of  site  construction  work  and  the  continued  growth  of  its  resource  base. However, later in the year, CRI was materially impacted by the global financial crisis at the peak of construction activity on the Nunavik Nickel Project and accordingly implemented their Asset Conservation Plan.

On  August  5,  2008,  CRI  announced  that  activities  being  carried  out  on  the  Nunavik  Nickel Project would begin to transition away from full construction and move towards implementing a care and maintenance program. Effectively, all major construction and engineering work were suspended  as of that date in order to protect the company's  treasury and investment infrastructure.

## Mequillon Deposit

- · A Preliminary Economic Assessment on the Mequillon Deposit was completed by P&amp;E in March  of  2008,  to  assess  the  technical  and  economic  viability  of  mining  the  Mequillon mineral deposit as a stand alone project using open pit and underground mining methods.

## Allammaq Deposit

- · 35 holes were completed in 2008, with the aim to delineate extensions to the existing deposit and upgrade resource classifications for an open pittable resource.

## Puimajuq Deposit

- · 17  holes  were  drilled  at  the  Puimajuq  Deposit,  with  drilling  delineating  net  textured sulphides with a massive sulphide core, within a quasi-vertical pyroxenite dyke.

## 2009 - January 2010

On January 13, 2010 Canadian Royalties announced the completion of a plan of arrangement between Canadian Royalties and Jien Canada Mining Ltd., under which Jien Canada acquired all

of CRI's outstanding common shares in exchange for $0.80 per share and now has 100% interest in the Nunavik Nickel Project.

## Allammaq Deposit

- · In October of 2009, CRI reported measured resources for the Allammaq Deposit of 559,855 tonnes grading 0.9% Ni, 1.1% Cu, 0.04% Co, 0.6 g Pt/t, 2.7 g Pd/t and 0.1 g Au/t, indicated resources of 3,760,518 grading 0.9% Ni, 1.1% Cu, 0.04% Co, 0.5 g Pt/t, 2.2 g Pd/t and 0.1 g Au/t and inferred resources of 1,591,493 tonnes grading 0.5% Ni, 0.5% Cu, 0.02% Co, 0.3 g Pt/t, 1.2 g Pd/t and 0.1 g Au/t.

## Puimajuq Deposit

- · Also  in  October  of  2009,  CRI  reported  indicated  resources  for  the  Puimajuq  Deposit  of 209,182 tonnes grading 1.6% Ni, 2.7% Cu, 0.06% Co, 0.9 g Pt/t, 2.5 g Pd/t and 0.1 g Au/t and inferred resources of 11,728 grading 2.3% Ni, 3.2% Cu, 0.09% Co, 1.2 g Pt/t, 2.6 g Pd/t and 0.1 g Au/t.

## 5.3 PREVIOUS DRILLING

## 5.3.1 MESAMAX DEPOSIT

Section  5.2.1  of  this  report  draws  heavily  upon  material  contained  within  the  report  titled, 'Technical  Report  on  the  South  Trend  Group  of  Properties,  Nunavik,  Quebec,  for  Canadian Royalties Inc.' authored by Henrik Thalenhorst and dated May 29, 2003, and the report titled 'Raglan South Nickel Project, Nunavik, Quebec, Technical Report and Preliminary Economic Assessment  on  the  Mequillon,  Mesamax,  Expo  and  Ivakkak  Deposits  for  Canadian  Royalties Inc.' authored by P&amp;E Mining Consultants Inc., and Roche Ltd., Consulting Group., and dated May 5, 2006. These reports have been filed on www.sedar.com. For more complete and detailed information on past drilling at the Mesamax Deposit the reader is referred to these reports.

The Mesamax Property contains two Ni-Cu-PGE mineralized ultramafic units, termed the North Ultramafic and South Ultramafic bodies, of which the Southern Ultramafic body is host to the Mesamax Deposit. A summary of past drilling for the Mesamax Property is given below.

Ron Roy Uranium Mines Ltd ('Ron Roy') along with Amax Exploration Inc. ('Amax') initiated exploration at Mesamax in 1969 and carried out a follow-up drill program in 1970 at both the Mesamax Main Grid and what is now known as the Mesamax NW Grid. The Mesamax Main Grid is entirely located within the Expo-Ungava Property and the Mesamax NW Grid overlaps the boundary between the Phoenix Prospect and the Expo-Ungava Property.

A total of seven holes over 821 metres was drilled at the NW Grid and a total of 19 holes over 1633 metres was drilled at the Main Grid. The focus of the drilling program was to locate Ni-Cu sulphide  mineralization  and  the  core  was  therefore  not  analysed  for  PGE.  The  program  was successful in intersecting both massive and disseminated Ni-Cu sulphide mineralization. Some of the 1970 drill holes were later re-sampled and re-assayed by CRI in 2001 and the results of this work have been discussed in Section 5.2 of this report.

CRI commenced drilling in the Mesamax area in 2001 after re-establishing the Mesamax Main grid that was originally established by High North Resources Inc. and Ungava Minerals Corp. Two diamond drill holes over 166 metres were completed at this time at the Main Grid. Both holes intersected mineralized channel-shaped  pyroxenite bodies, potentially indicative of proximity to a higher-grade source of massive sulphide mineralization.

In 2002, CRI carried out a comprehensive diamond drill program on the Mesamax Deposit (NW Grid) as follow up to the encouraging results from the previous year. A total of 40 holes were drilled at the deposit at a 25-metre to 50-metre spacing. Drilling defined a near-surface lens of massive sulphide mineralization over a strike length of 250 metres.

The  2002  follow-up  program  also  included  four  diamond  drill  holes  located  within  the  Main Grid, which continued to identify mineralized channel-shaped ultramafic bodies.

CRI undertook infill and step-out diamond drilling at the Mesamax Deposit in 2003. A total of 30  holes  were  drilled,  providing  an  increase  in  the  level  of  confidence  in  the  initial  resource figures.  The  drilling  extended  the  strike  length  of  the  known  mineralization  by  approximately 30% to the east and west.

In 2004, CRI carried out a mixture of exploration and metallurgical drilling at the Deposit, which included 14 closely-spaced metallurgical holes over 1,640 metres and 27 exploration holes over 1,900 metres. The metallurgical holes were drilled in the central area of the Deposit to initiate flotation testwork on the oxidized portion.

The 2005 drill program by CRI comprised 63 HQ-sized metallurgical drill holes. A 34 tonne bulk sample was collected to obtain information relating to recovery optimization and mill and concentration  plant  design.  The  bulk  sample  was  sent  to  Lakefield  Research  in  Lakefield, Ontario for testing.

In 2006, CRI completed 19 diamond drill holes at the Mesamax Deposit, deepened two holes drilled  in  the  2003  program  and  drilled  another  three  holes  for  geotechnical  engineering purposes. The total length of resource drilling undertaken in the 2006 program was 3,438 metres.

Beginning in 2003, Canadian Royalties contracted J. L. Corriveau &amp;  Associates Inc. ('Corriveau'), registered Land Surveyors in Quebec to provide survey control for all field grids and  diamond  drill  hole  collars.  All  holes  drilled  at  the  Mesamax  Deposit  were  surveyed  by Corriveau using a differential GPS method. The surveys are considered accurate to within about 0.1 metre in all three dimensions.

For  the  holes  drilled  by  CRI,  down-hole  dip  measurements  were  taken  using  acid  tests  at approximately 50-metre intervals. A Reflex down-hole survey instrument was also used to take dip and azimuth measurements at the bottom of each hole.

All  past  drill  programs  within  and  proximal  to  the  Mesamax  Deposit  prior  to  Goldbrook's involvement in the project are summarized in Table 5-1 below.

## 5.3.2 EXPO DEPOSIT

Section  5.2.2  of  this  report  draws  heavily  upon  material  contained  within  the  report  titled, 'Technical  Report  on  the  Mineral  Resource  Estimate  Expo  Nickel-Copper  Deposit,  Nunavik, Quebec', dated August 8 th ,  2005 and authored by T. Keast and H. Thalenhorst, and the report titled  'Technical  Report  and  Resource  Estimate  Update  on  the  Expo  Ni-Cu-PGE  Deposit, Raglan  South  Nickel  Project,  Nunavik,  Quebec',  dated  February  26th,  2007  and  authored  by P&amp;E Mining Consultants Inc. These reports have been filed on www.sedar.com.

Exploration  of  the  Expo  Deposit  area  dates  back  to  the  1950's,  with  drilling  of  the  area commencing in 1967 by Expo Ungava Mines Ltd. ('Expo Ungava') who drilled the discovery hole  at  Expo  at  that  time.  The  discovery  hole  intersected  5.8  metres  of  massive  sulphides averaging 2.2% nickel and 1.6% copper. By the end of 1968 Expo Ungava had completed 43 drill  holes  outlining  the  main  part  of  the  Deposit  over  a  strike  length  of  600  metres.  Amax continued drilling the deposit in 1969, however they did not substantially increase its size.

The next period of exploration was initiated in 1997 by High North Resources Inc. and Ungava Minerals Corp. ('Ungava'), who undertook a confirmatory drill program comprising six holes.

Canadian  Royalties  commenced  work  on  the  project  in  2001  with  a  re-sampling  program  of historical  drill  core.  Drilling  was  initiated  by  CRI  at  the  Expo  Deposit  in  2003  and  several programs of diamond drilling were completed from this time until 2006. A total of 268 holes over 32,777 metres were completed during this period.

CRI's 2003 and 2004 drill programs covered the entire known area of mineralization at Expo, with 67 holes being drilled over a total of 6,747 metres in 2003 and 43 holes over a total of 4,825 metres in 2004. During the 2003/2004 drilling programs a total of eight holes were twinned and of those eight holes, three were originally drilled in 1967 and the remaining five in 1968.

The 2005 and 2006 drill programs were designed to expand the resources at Expo. A total of 6,153 metres of drilling were undertaken in 2005, and a total of 4,578 metres in 2006, along with eight  geotechnical  holes,  four  of  which  were  included  in  the  resource  calculation.  The  total number of metres drilled in 2005 and 2006, including the four geotechnical holes was 11,317 metres.

The  drill  contractor  for  the  2003  to  2006  Expo  drill  programs  was  Major  Drilling  Group ('Major') who used JKS 300 wireline drill rigs equipped to recover BQ-sized core.

During  the  2005  and  2006  exploration  programs,  CRI  once  again  contracted  Corriveau, registered Land Surveyors in Quebec, to survey grids and drill holes at Expo and other deposits within the Project area. Corriveau surveyed all drill hole collars up to and including hole EX-06143 (excluding hole EX-06-141) at Expo using a differential GPS. The surveys are considered accurate to within about 0.1 metres in all three dimensions.

For  the  holes  drilled  by  CRI,  down-hole  dip  measurements  were  taken  using  acid  tests  at approximately 50-metre intervals. A Reflex down-hole survey instrument was also used to take dip  and  azimuth  measurements  at  the  bottom  of  each  hole.  Dip  deviations  are  typically  one degree  or  less  per  100  metres,  while  azimuth  deflection  is  difficult  to  evaluate  due  to  the magnetism encountered in the peridotite body.

All  past  drill programs  within  and  proximal  to  the  Expo  Deposit  prior  to  Goldbrook's involvement are summarized in Table 5-2 below.

## 5.3.3 MEQUILLON DEPOSIT

Section  5.2.3  of  this  report  draws  heavily  upon  material  contained  within  the  report  titled, 'Technical  Report  on  the  Updated  Mineral  Resource  Estimate,  Mequillon  Nickel-Copper Deposit,  Nunavik,  Quebec,  for  Canadian  Royalties  Inc.'  authored  by  T.  Keast  and  H. Thalenhorst and dated May 30, 2005. This report has been filed on www.sedar.com .

Drilling at the Mequillon Deposit area commenced  in  1957  by  Minière de l'Ungava ('Cominga'),  following  the  completion  of  promising  geophysical  surveys  in  the  area.  Three packsack  holes  and  five  diamond  drill  holes  (699  metres)  were  completed  between  1957  and 1958, testing the western section of the Mequillon Deposit. All holes intersected significant NiCu  sulphide  mineralization.  No  analysis  was  done  for  PGE  at  this  time.  From  this  drilling, Cominga concluded that the deposit was not economic and no further drilling was recommended.

The drill hole collars from this period of drilling have been located in the field by CRI and tied to the present day grid.

CRI began work at the Mequillon Property in 2001, with drilling in 2002 and since that time have conducted several phases of drilling. All drilling was undertaken by Major Drilling Group and core was BQ-size.

In the initial 2002 phase of drilling, Canadian Royalties completed six holes, followed-up by 12 holes in 2003. A total of 2,243 metres was drilled during this time, covering a strike length of 500 metres, with drilling carried out on sections 100 metres apart. An extensive follow-up drill program by CRI in 2004 saw the completion of 77 diamond drill holes over 11,575 metres.

CRI continued drilling at the Mequillon Deposit in 2005, completing 19 holes over 5,081 metres and nine holes in 2006 over 2,827 metres. At this time, drilling had defined the deposit over a

total  strike  length  of  1.4  kilometres  and  to  a  depth  of  260  metres,  with  the  deposit  remaining open to the east.

During the 2005 and 2006 exploration programs, CRI contracted Corriveau to survey grids and drill holes at Mequillon and other deposits within the Project area. Corriveau surveyed all drill hole collars up to and including hole MQN-06-125 at Mequillon using a differential GPS. The surveys are considered accurate to within about 0.1 metres in all three dimensions.

For  the  holes  drilled  by  CRI,  down-hole  dip  measurements  were  taken  using  acid  tests  at approximately 50-metre intervals. A Reflex down-hole survey instrument was also used to take dip  and  azimuth  measurements  at  the  bottom  of  each  hole.  Dip  deviations  are  typically  one degree  or  less  per  100  metres,  while  azimuth  deflection  is  difficult  to  evaluate  due  to  the magnetism encountered in the peridotite body.

All  past  drill  programs  within  and  proximal  to  the  Mequillon  Deposit  prior  to  Goldbrook's involvement in the project are summarized in Table 5-3 below.

## 5.3.4 IVAKKAK DEPOSIT

Section  5.2.4  of  this  report  draws  heavily  upon  material  contained  within  the  report  titled, 'Technical Report (2007) and Resource Estimate Update on the Ivakkak Ni-Cu-PGE Deposit, South Trend Property, Raglan South Nickel Project.' authored by G.A. Harron &amp; Associates Inc. and  P&amp;E  Mining  Consultants  Inc.,  and  dated  March  22,  2007.  This  report  has  been  filed  on www.sedar.com .

The Ivakkak Deposit was initially drilled and discovered by Canadian Royalties in 2005. There is no record of drilling prior to this time in the Ivakkak area and only reconnaissance geological mapping has been recorded prior to 2005 in this area of the Nunavik Nickel Project.

The 2005 drill program included exploration drilling in the western extremity of the Project area, leading to the discovery of the Ivakkak Deposit. In total, 32 delineation holes were drilled over 3,532 metres. At the end of the 2005 program, the Deposit remained open to further expansion, and  follow-up  drilling  continued  in  2006.  At  the  beginning  of  the  2006  drill  program,  the Deposit had been traced for at least 250 metres along strike and to a depth of 125 metres. The 2006 drill program comprised 58 diamond drill holes over 7,362 metres.

All holes drilled at the Ivakkak Deposit were surveyed by Corriveau using a differential GPS method. The surveys are considered accurate to within about 0.1 metre in all three dimensions.

Down-hole dip measurements were taken using acid tests at approximately 50-metre intervals. A Reflex down-hole survey instrument was also used to take dip and azimuth measurements at the bottom of each hole.

The 2005 and 2006 drilling programs undertaken by Canadian Royalties at the Ivakkak Deposit are summarized in Table 5-4 below.

## 5.3.5 ALLAMMAQ DEPOSIT

Section  5.2.5  of  this  report  draws  heavily  upon  material  contained  within  the  report  titled, 'Technical  Report  and  Resource  Estimate  on  the  Allammaq  Ni-Cu-PGE  Deposit,  Nunavik Nickel Project, Nunavik, Quebec.' authored by P&amp;E Mining Consultants Inc., and dated May 30,  2008  and  the  report  titled,  'Technical  Report  and  Updated  Resource  Estimate  on  the Allammaq Ni-Cu-PGE Deposit, Nunavik Nickel Project, Nunavik, Quebec.' authored by P&amp;E Mining  Consultants  Inc.,  and  dated  November  20,  2009.  These  reports  have  been  filed  on www.sedar.com .

The Allammaq Deposit is located approximately three kilometres east of the Mesamax Deposit. Canadian  Royalties  commenced  drilling  at  Allammaq  in  2007  and  drilled  the  discovery  hole (MX-07-30) on July 7, 2007, intersecting a 6.60 metre basal zone of 1.68% Ni and 2.34% Cu. A total  of  32  holes  (MX-07-30  to  MX-07-53) were drilled in the 2007 Allammaq program over 5,736  metres,  at  a  spacing  of  50  metres  and  over  a  strike  length  of  250  metres.  Drilling delineated two separate zones of net-textured sulphide mineralization, of which the basal zone (Allammaq) is of far greater economic significance.

CRI continued drilling in the 2008 season, with the aim of delineating extensions to the existing deposit  and  upgrading  resource  classifications  for  an  open  pittable  resource,  rather  than  the previously reported underground resource of May 2007.

The 2008 CRI drill program at Allammaq comprised both infill and step-out drilling, with 35 holes over 6,697 metres completed. Drilling in the central region of the deposit was at a 25 metre to 50 metre spacing and step-out drilling at 50 metre to 100 metre spacing. Step-out drilling was extended 300 metres to the west.

At the end of the 2008 drill season, in addition to the Upper and Basal Zones, a third zone (the West Extension) thought to be related to the Upper Zone was outlined. The Basal Zone was also found to exceed 45 metres thickness in the central region of the Deposit. All three zones were included in the updated resource given the newly considered open pit mine design.

Major carried out the drilling at the Allammaq Deposit in 2007, utilising JKS 300 wire line drill rigs  and  all  core  recovered  was  of  BQ-size.  In  2008,  these  rigs  were  replaced  with  modern

Duralite  500  heli-portable  diamond  drills,  with  a  significantly  greater  depth  capacity.  Core recovery was BQ and NQ-size.

During the 2007 and 2008 exploration programs, Corriveau was contracted to survey grids and drill holes at Allammaq and other deposits within the Project area. Corriveau surveyed all drill hole collars from MX-07-30 up to and including MX-08-107 at Allammaq using a differential GPS. The surveys are considered accurate to within about 0.1 metres in all three dimensions.

Down-hole dip measurements were taken using acid tests at approximately 50-metre intervals. A Reflex down-hole survey instrument was also used to take dip and azimuth measurements at the bottom  of  each  hole.  Dip  deviations  are  typically  one  degree  or  less  per  100  metres,  while azimuth  deflection  is  difficult  to  evaluate  due  to  the  magnetism  encountered  in  the  peridotite body, however based upon holes that were drilled into the nonmagnetic footwall sediments, the azimuth deviation was found to be around two degrees per 100 metres.

The  2007  and  2008  drilling  programs  undertaken  by  Canadian  Royalties  at  the  Allammaq Deposit are summarized in Table 5-5 below.

## 5.3.6 PUIMAJUQ DEPOSIT

Section  5.2.6  of  this  report  draws  heavily  upon  material  contained  within  the  report  titled, 'Technical Report and Resource Estimate on the Puimajuq Ni-Cu-PGE Deposit, Nunavik Nickel Project, Nunavik, Quebec.' authored by P&amp;E Mining Consultants Inc., and dated November 20, 2009. This report has been filed on www.sedar.com .

Canadian  Royalties  discovered  the  Puimajuq  Deposit  in  2007  while  drill-testing  a  suspected ultramafic intrusion based on EM surveying located within their New Foreurs East Property. The discovery drill  hole  (NF-07-02)  intersected  19.3  metres  of  net  textured  mineralization  and  six follow-up drill  holes  over  814  metres  were  completed  in  the  remaining  2007  season.  Drilling was carried out at 50-metre spacing over a strike length of 200 metres.

Further delineation drilling was carried out by CRI in 2008, with a total of 17 holes completed over  1402  metres.  The  program  successfully  outlined  net  textured  sulphides  with  a  massive sulphide core, within a quasi-vertical pyroxenite dyke.

Major carried out all of the drilling at the Puimajuq Deposit, utilising JKS 300 wire line drill rigs in  2007  (recovering  BQ-sized  core)  and  Duralite  500  heli-portable  diamond  drills  in  2008 (recovering both BQ and NQ-sized core).

During the 2007 and 2008 exploration programs, Corriveau continued to survey grids and drill holes at Puimajuq and other deposits within the Project area. Corriveau surveyed all drill hole collars from NF-07-02 up to and including NF-08-25 at Puimajuq using a differential GPS.

Down-hole dip and azimuth measurements were taken using a combination of acid tests and a Reflex down-hole survey instrument in 2007 and solely utilizing the Reflex instrument in 2008. Measurements were taken at approximately 50-metre intervals and at the bottom of each hole. Dip  deviations  are  typically  one  degree  or  less  per  100  metres,  while  azimuth  deflection  is difficult to evaluate due to the magnetism encountered in the peridotite body. Based upon holes that were drilled into the nonmagnetic footwall sediments, the azimuth deviation appears to be around two degrees per 100 metres.

The 2007 and 2008 drilling programs undertaken by Canadian Royalties at the Puimajuq Deposit are summarized in Table 5-6 below.

## 5.4 PREVIOUS FEASIBILITY STUDIES

In  2007,  SNC  Lavalin  completed  a  Definitive  Feasibility  Study,  ('DFS',  or  'BFS')  on  the Nunavik Nickel Project. For the purposes of the DFS, the project comprises the development of three open pit mines: The Expo Mine, the Mesamax Mine and the Ivakkak Mine. The Ivakkak Mine  also  has  planned  underground  workings  that  will  be  developed  once  the  open  pit  is exhausted. The Mequillon, Puimajuq and Allammaq Deposits at the time the DFS was completed were not considered advanced enough in terms of resources to be able to consider them.

Conventional  open  pit  mining  methods  would  be  used  to  exploit  98%  of  the  reserves  of  the project. Mesamax and Ivakkak ores would be blended with Expo ores for the first four years of the project. Reserves from the Ivakkak underground zones A and C would be mined in years 5 and 6 and also blended with ore from the Expo open pit.

Open  pit  designs  incorporate  allowances  for  appropriate  access  ramps,  wall  slope  angles, catchment  berms  and  minimum  mining  widths  for  the  equipment  selected.  The  following parameters  were  used  in  the  pit  design:  US$6.00/lb  nickel,  US$1.50/lb  copper,  US$900/oz platinum and US$300/oz palladium.

Reserve determinations include allowances for dilution, which vary with each resource. Mining losses were assumed to be 5% (not included in the following table), and were factored into the mining plan and financial analysis. The average strip ratio for open pit mining is 3.37:1 over the life of mine, excluding the waste material extracted during the underground mine development. The probable open pit reserve estimates for the three pits on the project are presented in Table 59.

At a site in close proximity to the Expo open pit a process plant will process ore from the pits at a nominal rate of 3,500 tonnes per day. A nickel sulphide and a copper sulphide concentrate will be produced and trucked to the port at Deception Bay for shipment.

A series of low-emission, diesel fired, reciprocating generators will supply electrical power to the  project.  Waste  heat  will  be  recovered  from  these  engines  in  order  to  increase  the  overall energy efficiency of the project.

Permanent  accommodations  are  planned  for  172  persons,  including  dining  and  recreation services.

A service complex will be provided to service the project's equipment fleet.

A rockfill  dam will impound a reservoir to supply the project with fresh water. The reservoir capacity will provide for nine months of water consumption.

A waste rock and tailings co-disposal facility will be constructed adjacent to the Expo open pit and industrial complex.

Upgrades are planned to the existing Donaldson airport infrastructures.

A dedicated wharf and concentrate storage facility will be constructed at Deception Bay. Diesel and jet fuel handling and storage facilities will be provided.

Discounted cash flow modeling of the project yields a full equity base case internal rate of return (IRR) of 8.1% and a net present value (NPV) of CAD$0.85 million at a discount rate of 8%, both calculated after tax and in nominal terms. A construction escalation rate of 3.5% annually and an inflation rate of 2% during the mine operation were assumed.

## 5.5 PREVIOUS METALLURGICAL TESTING

## 5.5.1 PRE-CRI METALLURGICAL TESTING

Amax  (1969)  reported  on  initial  metallurgical  testwork  on  the  Expo  Ungava  mineralization undertaken at their Climax (Colorado) facility that was directed towards the production of a bulk concentrate without  separation of the nickel and  copper  bearing  minerals  into separate concentrates.

While  the  massive  sulphides  at  Expo  Ungava  were  coarse  grained  and  produced  a  bulk concentrate grading 15% to 20% nickel plus copper at reasonable recoveries, the disseminated sulphides (the material tested assayed from 0.4% to 0.5% nickel and copper each) required very fine  grinding  to  below  75  microns  to  effect  reasonable  mineral  liberation.  There  were  three adverse mineralogical factors reported by Amax in the disseminated sulphides at Expo Ungava. (1) A portion of the total nickel (0.06%) is silicate nickel and cannot therefore be recovered; (2) ' An appreciable percentage of all of the sulphides occurred as fine disseminations in serpentine gangue that were not subject to liberation by conventional ball milling… '  (Amax 1969, GM26102,  page  16).  (3)  Pyrrhotite,  the  most  common  sulphide  mineral  that  the  flotation  process attempts to exclude from the concentrates, carries from 0.3% to 0.6% nickel.

## 5.5.2 METALLURGICAL TESTING UNDERTAKEN BY CRI

The following is taken directly  from  the  Mining  and  Metallurgy  Section  of  the  Raglan  South Nickel Project Technical Report #017387 authored by SNC Lavalin, and dated July 2007. This section forms part of the Definitive Feasibility Study (DFS or BFS).

Metallurgical testing of samples from the Nunavik Nickel Project deposits began in 2004, when SGS  Lakefield  conducted  preliminary  testing  on  Mesamax  samples  and  Expo  net-textured samples in order to provide projections for two types of flowsheets.

In  2005,  testwork  was  conducted  on  the  Mesamax,  Mequillon  and  Expo  Deposits  including grindability  investigations,  flotation  development,  tailings  characterizations  and  concentrate characterizations.

Major findings were that:

- · Expo ore is dictating the fineness of primary grinding;
- · Copper floated preferentially for Mesamax. It was not as obvious with Expo ore.

## Mineralogical Study

At the end of 2005 CRI prepared a 33 t bulk sample in order to perform a pilot plant test at SGS Lakefield. The following summarizes the body of work completed on CRI's NNP Mesamax NiCu-PGE Deposit. The scope of the program encompassed comminution studies, laboratory and pilot plant flotation, concentrate and tailings characterization, and determination of the filtration characteristics. The following Tables 5-10 to 5-12 show respectively the analytical analysis from the pilot plant, the results from locked cycle tests and the estimated flotation metallurgy by pit.

The Mequillon and Ivakkak Deposits were also subjected to testing for the purpose of the Study. The Mequillon net-textured ore has been tested to determine its flotation response. There was no grindability testing done on the Mequillon ore at the time of the DFS. Flotation results from the Mequillon  Deposit  have  indicated  that  its  response  was  very  similar  to  the  net-textured component of the Mesamax Deposit.

The Ivakkak ore is comprised of two distinct zones, a massive sulphide zone grading 2.55% Ni and 2.89% Cu and a net-textured zone grading 0.44% Ni and 0.90% Cu. The Ivakkak zones were tested in early 2007.

The purpose of the additional testing program was to determine the Ball Bond work indices and Rod Bond work indices and to confirm the individual responses of the Mequillon and combined Ivakkak ore and to test the response to blending ore from each deposit.

Two samples were submitted for bench-scale testing. These were a Mequillon sample (Eastern and deeper part of the Deposit), and an Ivakkak ore sample. Approximately 150-kg of Mequillon ore and approximately 150-kg of the Ivakkak ore were required to complete the test program.

Ore was received at SGS Lakefield as a coarse minimum of ½' or ¼' drill core with minimum dimension of ½'. Each of the ore samples was subjected to the following sample preparation:

- · Ore received was inventoried and weighed;
- · The sample was stage-crushed to ½', blended, and 25-kg was riffled out for grindability testwork;
- · The 25-kg grindability  sample  was  split  with  15-kg  dedicated  for  Bond  rod  mill  work index testing and the remainder stage-crushed to 6 mesh for Bond ball mill work index testing;
- · The remainder of the sample was stage-crushed to -10 mesh and blended. Approximately 60-kg was riffled out and rotary split into 2-kg test charges and a head sample for assay;
- · A fraction of the remainder was combined with the other sample in a ratio set by SLI as an  overall  representative  of  blended  Mequillon-Ivakkak  ore  sample.  It  was  anticipated that this blend would be 4 parts Mequillon to 1 part Ivakkak. The blended ore was rotary split into 2-kg test charges and a head sample for assay. Sufficient components of each of the ores must be used to make up 40-kg of blended ore;
- · All test charges and bulk reject material was stored in a freezer to minimize opportunities for oxidation;
- · Head samples were submitted for Cu, Ni, S, Pt, Pd, Ni (sulf).

The tests for gold, platinum and palladium were assayed by fusion fire assays, ICP OES and the cobalt, copper and nickel were assayed by pyrosulfate fusion, XRF.

## Metallurgical Test Work

## Crushing

It  was  recognized that the ore contained an asbestos-form tremolite. Necessary dust collection and related safety precautions were taken throughout the sample preparation processes. Various samples  were  submitted  for  an  assessment  of  asbestos  mineral  content.  Three  accredited independent laboratories quantified the Mesamax pilot plant feed ore as containing in the range of 0.5% - 1% tremolite.

## Grinding

Grindability testing on the massive component of pilot plant ore determined the ore to be soft in terms of impact breakage, abrasion breakage and hardness. The Bond ball mill work index was 9.0 kWh/t. The net-textured component was variable in grindability response, but was on average hard with respect to impact and abrasion breakage. Bond ball mill work indices ranged from 10.5 - 13.7 kWh/t and averaged 12.8 kWh/t. Pilot plant feed ore was determined to be soft overall with a Bond ball mill work index of 10.5 kWh/t. The direct measurement from the pilot plant averaged 9.3 kWh/t.

For the additional  test,  the  two  samples  were  submitted  for  Bond  rod  mill  work  index  testing (RWI) and Bond ball mill work index testing (BWI). The Bond RWI test is performed according to  the  original  Bond  procedure.  It  requires  15  kgs  of  minus  ½'  material  that  is  preferably prepared at the testing facility. The Bond RWI has been widely used for rod mill (or primary ball mill) sizing.

The Bond BWI test is performed according the original Bond procedure. It requires 10 kgs of minus 6-mesh material that is preferably prepared at the testing facility. The Bond BWI has been widely used for mill sizing, but is also utilized in computer simulation, and variability testing. The  closing  mesh  size  for  these  tests  was  150  mesh,  consistent  with  previously  tested  CRI samples.

In order to calibrate the laboratory mill against flotation product size, an allowance was given for a  single  grind  and  particle  size  analysis  on  each  of  the  samples.  This  established  the  grinding time required to achieve the desired product size of 80% passing 75 microns, and is part of mill selection criteria.

## Flotation

Bench-scale  flotation  was  completed  on  pilot  plant  feed  ore  prior  to  pilot  plant  operations.  A flowsheet identified in previous test programs was adopted. The optimum pH range in the bulk rougher and scavenger stages for copper and nickel metallurgy is on the lower side of pH 10. Pilot plant collector dosages should be set to achieve approximately 20% mass pull to the bulk rougher concentrate and a further 15 - 20% mass pull in the bulk scavenger circuit to ensure that sufficiently high grade Ni concentrates are met at maximum recovery.

A pilot plant was set up to treat 33 tonnes of Mesamax ore considered to be representative of the Deposit. The pilot plant test was completed over 13 day-long runs and one extended run lasting more than 50 hours. The pilot plant metallurgy was refined and optimized. Over the daylong runs recycle  process  water  was  gradually  introduced  into  the  operations.  The  recycle  rate  of  the process water was determined to be 91% under stable operation.

Additional tests investigated the separate response of the Mequillon and the Ivakkak ore samples to the developed flowsheet to gauge the appropriate reagent conditions and the amenability of the established flowsheet. The flotation testing also investigated the response of a blended IvakkakMequillon ore.

Six tests were carried out on the Mequillon ore. It was anticipated that the provided ore sample would respond in a similar manner to previously tested Mequillon samples. Three of these tests were rougher kinetics tests and the remainder were batch cleaner tests.

Six rougher tests and six batch cleaner tests were performed on Ivakkak ore. The testing focused on  optimization  of  rougher  collector  and  non-sulphide  gangue  depressant,  appropriate  mass recovery split between the bulk rougher and bulk scavenger, and pyrrhotite depressant dosage in the Cu/Ni circuit. A confirmatory locked cycle test was conducted under optimized conditions.

Testing on a blend of Ivakkak-Mequillon ore was initiated once the above testing was completed. One rougher test and one batch cleaner test were performed to confirm the anticipated response. One  locked  cycle  test  was  completed  on  blended  ore  to  assess  concentrate  grade-recovery relationship in a continuous environment.

Products  were  analyzed  for  Cu,  Ni,  and  S.  Batch  cleaner  tests  generated  no  more  than  10 products each that were assayed for Cu, Ni, and S. Locked cycle tests generated no more than 40 products.  Products were assayed for Cu, Ni, Pt, Pd. Selected products were additionally assayed for Pt and Pd. Various particle size analyses were conducted on selected test products.

## Tailings Desulphidation

The purpose of the testing program was to evaluate potential techniques to desulphidize tailings from NNP ore in order to obtain non acid-generating tailings.

Flotation testing was performed in order to explore sulphide recovery from the process tailings. Tests  have  explored  the  roles  of  collector,  CMC,  alkalinity,  and  promoters  in  the  recovery kinetics  of  the  sulphides  present.  It  was  expected  that  successful  recovery  of  sulphides  would involve  the  use  of  potassium-amyl-xanthate  (PAX),  and  carboxy-methyl-cellulose  (CMC)  to control floatable magnesium silicates.

Up to 90% of sulphide could have been removed, but there was no guarantee that the treated tailings would not generate acid. Golder's geochemical analysis with potentially acid generating waste  rock  that  contained  a  small  amount  of  sulphide  showed  that  there  was  a  technical  risk related  to  this  concept.  Desulphidation  also  meant  that  two  different  tailings  ponds  would  be required which would be more complex to manage. The tailings desulphidation was therefore not further considered.

## Magnetic Separation Testing

In addition to flotation testing, the potential of magnetic separation to enhance sulphide recovery and concentrate grades was explored. Magnetic separation in several stages was carried out to test different concentrate stages. High-intensity magnetic separation is used to recover magnetic pyrrhotite. Two tests were carried out on Ivakkak ore, using the first Ni-Cu cleaner feed which showed  promising  potential  for  rejecting  up  to  80%  of  the  pyrrhotite  in  one  and  60%  in  the second test.

## 5.6 PREVIOUS RESOURCE ESTIMATES

Canadian  Royalties  completed  many  resource  estimates  on  the  Nunavik  Nickel  Project  from 2003 through 2009. All the pertinent reports for the deposits were filed on www.sedar.com.

The Expo, Mesamax, Mequillon and Ivakkak Deposit Resource Estimates were reported during 2007. Allammaq and Puimajuq Deposit Resource Estimates were reported in 2009.

All metal prices and $C/$US exchange rates were derived from the prevailing 24 month trailing average at the time the individual deposit resources were calculated, and as such, the estimates reported in 2007 and 2009 have different parameters. With one exception (Mequillon, which has an  open  pit  and  an  underground  component)  all  $C  NSR  cut-off  values  are  $C40/tonne.    For Mequillon,  the  NSR  open  pit  cut-off  value  used  was  $42.50/tonne  and  for  the  underground component it was $75/tonne.

Table 5-13 below presents a summary of the resources discovered and tabulated to date on the Nunavik Nickel Project. The table includes $C NSR cut-off values, commodity prices and the $C/$US exchange rate. As per Table 5-9 above, less than half of the total resources were used in the feasibility study.

The TK Deposit is very small and has not been detailed in this section.

The Allammaq, Puimajuq and Mequillon Deposits were not sufficiently advanced in terms of drilling at the time the DFS was completed.

In addition to the summary table, the complete resource estimation parameters for each deposit are presented in the sub-sections that follow.

## 5.6.1 EXPO DEPOSIT RESOURCE ESTIMATE

## 5.6.1.1 INTRODUCTION

The purpose of this report section is to delineate the Expo Deposit Resources in compliance with NI  43-101  and  CIM  standards.  This  resource  estimate  was  undertaken  by  Eugene  Puritch,  P. Eng. and Antoine Yassa, P. Geo. of P &amp; E Mining Consultants Inc. of Brampton, Ontario. The effective date of this resource estimate is December 24, 2006.

## 5.6.1.2 DATABASE

All drilling data were provided by Canadian Royalties Inc. in the form of Microsoft Excel files, drill logs and assay certificates.  Thirty (30) drill cross sections were developed on a local grid looking west-southwest on azimuth 261.33  with a 30 metre spacing named 9,790-E to 10,660-E. 0 A Gemcom database was provided by the client containing 265 diamond drill holes of which 204 were  utilized  in  the  resource  calculation.  The  remaining  data  were  not  in  the  area  that  was modeled for this resource estimate.

The database was validated in Gemcom with minor corrections required.  The assay table of the database contained 10,392 assays for Ni, 10,738 for Cu, 10,932 for Co, 9,773 for Au, 9,931 for Pt  and  9,935  for  Pd.    All  data  are  expressed  in  metric  units  and  grid  coordinates  are  in  the NAD83 UTM system.

## 5.6.1.3 DATA VERIFICATION

A previous technical report authored in 2005 by Strathcona Mineral Services Limited verified all data  entry,  drill  hole  surveys  and  laboratory  results  and  found  the  database  to  be  in  good condition and reliable for resource evaluation. At that time close to 6,000 samples made up the assay database.

At the end of 2006, a verification of assay data entry was performed on 1,884 assay intervals for Ni,  Cu,  Co,  Au,  Pt  and  Pd.  A  few  data  entry  errors  were  observed  and  corrected.  The  1,884 verified  intervals  were  checked  against  assay  lab  data  files  from  ALS  Chemex  of  Vancouver, B.C., (three samples were still missing at the time of this resource evaluation). The 2006 checked assays represent 18.3% of the data to be used for the resource estimate and all verified assay results represent 76.5% of the entire database.

| Period   |   Assayed  intervals |   Used  in  Resource | Status    | Percentage  of database   | Percentage  of Resource   |
|----------|----------------------|----------------------|-----------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| Pre-2005 |                 6072 |                 5024 | Verified  | 58.4%                     | 67.4%                     |

## 5.6.1.4 DOMAIN INTERPRETATION

Domain boundaries were determined from lithology, structure and Ni, Cu and PGE boundary interpretation from visual inspection of drillhole sections.  Four domains were developed named Massive Sulphide, Net Textured, Vein and Ultramafic.  These domains were physically created with computer screen digitizing on drillhole sections in Gemcom by the authors of this report. The outlines were influenced by the selection of mineralized material that demonstrated massive, net  textured,  vein  and  ultramafic  grade  characteristics,  and  zonal  continuity  along  strike  and across  the  sections.    In  a  very  few  cases  mineralization  below  massive,  net  textured  or  vein characteristic grades was included for the purpose of maintaining zonal continuity.

On each section, polyline interpretations were digitized from drill hole to drill hole but typically not extended more than 25 metres into untested territory.  Minimum constrained true width for interpretation was 2.0 metres. The interpreted polylines from each section were 'extruded' into Gemcom into 3-dimensional polygonal domains.  The resulting solids (domains) were used for statistical analysis, grade interpolation, rock coding and resource reporting purposes.

## 5.6.1.5 ROCK CODE DETERMINATION

The rock codes used for the resource model were derived from the mineralized domain solids. The list of rock codes used is as follows:

## Rock Code Description

|   0 | Air                   |
|-----|-----------------------|
|  10 | Massive Sulphide      |
|  20 | Vein                  |
|  20 | Net Textured Sulphide |
|  30 | Ultramafic Rocks      |
|  99 | Waste Rock            |
| 100 | Overburden            |

## 5.6.1.6 COMPOSITES

Length weighted composites were generated for the drill hole data that fell within the constraints of the above-mentioned domains. These composites were calculated for Ni, Cu, Co, Au, Pt and Pd over 1.0 metre lengths starting at the first point of intersection between assay data hole and hanging wall of the 3-D zonal constraint. The compositing process was halted upon exit from the footwall of the aforementioned constraint. Any composite calculated that was less than 0.5 metre in length was added to the preceding one metre composite so as to include all composite data. This  was  done  in  order  to  not  introduce  a  short  sample  bias  in  the  interpolation  process.  The composite data were extracted to Gemcom extraction files for the grade interpolation as X, Y, Z, Ni, Cu, Co, Au, Pt, Pd files.

## 5.6.1.7 GRADE CAPPING

Grade capping was investigated on the raw assay values in the combined domains to ensure that the  possible  influence  of  erratic  high  values  did  not  bias  the  database.  Extraction  files  were created for constrained Ni, Cu, Co, Au, Pt and Pd data within each mineralized domain. From these  extraction  files,  log-normal  histograms  were  generated  and  subsequently  analyzed  to determine  the  location  of  and  capping  value  required  to  remove  outliers  that  would  unduly influence the grade interpolation.

## 5.6.1.8 VARIOGRAPHY

Variography was not carried out on the constrained domain composites within the four domains in  the  deposit  model.  The  mineralized  domains exhibited good sectional continuity but due to erratically distributed populations, did not yield discernable variograms.

## 5.6.1.9 BULK DENSITY

The  bulk  density  used  for  the  resource  model  was  derived  from  measurements  of  test  work performed  by  ALS  Chemex  of  Val  d'Or,  Quebec  on  regular  core  samples  obtained  from  the assay sample submission to the laboratory. A bulk density model was created from these data and  utilized  to  calculate  the  reported  tonnes.  The  average  bulk  density  from  samples  was calculated  to  be  4.59  tonnes  per  cubic  meter  in  the  massive  sulphide  and  vein  domains,  3.11 tonnes  per  cubic  metre  in  the  net  textured  domain  and  2.92  tonnes  per  cubic  metre  in  the ultramafic domain.

## 5.6.1.10 BLOCK MODELING

The  resource  model  was  divided  into  a  3-D  block  model  framework.  The  block  model  has 3,136,000  blocks  that  were  5m  in  the  X  direction,  5m  in  the  Y  direction  and  5m  in  the  Z direction.  There  were  280  columns  (X),  160  rows  (Y)  and  70  levels.  The  block  model  was rotated  8.33  degrees  counter  clockwise.  Separate  block  models  were  created  for  rock  type, density, percent, Ni, Cu, Co Au, Pt and Pd.

The percent block model was set up to accurately represent the volume and subsequent tonnage that  was  occupied  by  each  block  inside  each  constraining  domain.  As  a  result,  the  domain boundaries were properly represented by the percent model ability to measure infinitely variable inclusion percentages within a particular domain.

The Ni, Cu, Co Au, Pt and Pd composites were extracted from the Microsoft Access database composite table into separate files for each Mineralized Zone. Inverse distance squared (1/d2) grade interpolation was utilized. There were two interpolation passes performed on each domain for  each  element  for  the  indicated  and  inferred  classifications.  The  grade  blocks  within  all domains were interpolated using the following parameters.

## 5.6.1.11 RESOURCE CLASSIFICATION

For the purposes of this resource, classifications of all interpolated grade blocks were determined from  the  Ni  interpolations  for  indicated  and  inferred  due  to  Ni  being  the  dominant  revenue producing element in the NSR calculation. All blocks coded by the first interpolation pass were coded as indicated while the remaining blocks coded on the second interpolation pass as inferred.

## 5.6.1.12 RESOURCE ESTIMATE

The  resource  estimate  was  derived  from  applying  an  NSR  cut-off  grade  to  the  block  model within  a  Whittle  4X  optimized  pit  shell  and  reporting  the  resulting  tonnes  and  grade  for potentially mineable areas. The following calculations demonstrate the rationale supporting the NSR cut-off grade that determines the potentially economic portion of the mineralized domains.

The mineral resources were estimated using the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum  (CIM),  CIM  Standards  on  Mineral  Resources  and  Reserves,  Definitions  and Guidelines  prepared  by  the  CIM  Standing  Committee  on  Reserve  Definitions  and  adopted  by CIM Council December 11, 2005.

## 5.6.1.13 CONFIRMATION OF ESTIMATE

As a test of the reasonableness of the estimate, the block model was queried at a 0.01 % Ni cut off  grade  with  blocks  in  all  classifications  summed  and  their  grades  weight  averaged.  This average  is  the  average  grade  of  all  blocks  within  the  mineralized  domains.  The  values  of  the interpolated grades for the block model were compared to the length weighted capped average grades and average grade of composites of all samples from within the domain. The results are presented below.

The comparison above shows the average grade of all of the Ni, Cu, Co, Au, Pt and Pd blocks in each domain to be similar to the weighted average of all capped assays and composites used for grade estimation in the Net Textured Domain, however, many isolated higher grade assays in the Massive and Vein Domains are contributing to higher block model values than capped assays or composites. The block model invariably represents the metal distribution most correctly of all three methods. This effect is essentially the reverse of assay data clustering.

In addition, a volumetric comparison was performed with the block volume of the model vs. the geometric calculated volume of the domain solids.

## Massive Sulphide Domain

Block Model Volume            =  164,956 m3

Geometric Domain Volume  =  164,913 m3

## 5.6.2 MESAMAX DEPOSIT RESOURCE ESTIMATE

## 5.6.2.1 INTRODUCTION

P&amp;E  Mining  Consultants  Inc.  ('P&amp;E')  of  Brampton,  Ontario  was  engaged  by  Canadian Royalties Inc. ('CRI) to update the Mesamax Deposit Resources in compliance with NI 43-101 and CIM standards taking into account all drilling up to and including the 2006 drill program. This resource estimate was undertaken by qualified persons Eugene Puritch, P.Eng. and Antoine Yassa, P.Geo. of P&amp;E Mining Consultants Inc. The effective date of this resource estimate is December 14, 2006.

## 5.6.2.2 DATABASE

All drilling data was provided by CRI in the form of Microsoft Excel files, drill logs and assay certificates.  Thirteen (13) drill cross sections were developed on a local grid looking north-west on  azimuth  298.69   with  a  nominal  25  metre  spacing  named  from  850-W  to  1,100-W.    A 0 Gemcom database was provided by the client containing 243 diamond drill holes of which 104 were  utilized  in  the  resource  calculation.  The  remaining  data  were  not  in  the  area  that  was modeled for this resource estimate or were metallurgical sample and geotechnical holes without any assaying performed on them.

The database was validated in Gemcom with minor corrections required.  The Assay Table of the database contained 4,784 assays for Ni, 4,784 for Cu, 4,760 for Co, 4,760 for Au, 4,784 for Pt and 4,784 for Pd.  All data are expressed in metric units and grid coordinates are in the NAD83 UTM system.

## 5.6.2.3 DATA VERIFICATION

Verification of assay data entry was performed on 4113 assay intervals for Ni, Cu, Co, Au, Pt and Pd. From the 4113 assay intervals, 3543 were verified by comparing double-entry. Original data entry was done for the previous 2004 Resource Evaluation. All assay certificates were reimported in 2005 from the SGS assay lab certificates and both dataset were compared. A few data entry errors were observed and corrected. The 570 samples from 2006 were checked against assay lab data files from ALS Chemex of Vancouver, B.C. The checked assays represented 78% of the data to be used for the resource estimate and approximately 84% of the entire database.

## 5.6.2.4 DOMAIN INTERPRETATION

Domain boundaries were determined from lithology, structure and Ni, Cu and PGE boundary interpretation from visual inspection of drillhole sections.  Four domains were developed named Massive Sulphide, Net Textured, Oxidized Massive Sulphide and Oxidized Net Textures.  These domains  were  physically  created  with  computer  screen  digitizing  on  drill  hole  sections  in Gemcom  by  the  authors  of  this  report.    The  outlines  were  influenced  by  the  selection  of mineralized material that demonstrated massive and net textured grade characteristics, and zonal continuity along strike and across the sections.  In a very few some cases mineralization below massive or net textured characteristic grades was included for the purpose of maintaining zonal continuity.

On each section, polyline interpretations were digitized from drill hole to drill hole but typically not extended more than 25 metres into untested territory.  Minimum constrained true width for

interpretation was 2.0 metres. The interpreted polylines from each section were 'extruded' into Gemcom into 3-dimensional polygonal domains.  The resulting solids (domains) were used for statistical analysis, grade interpolation, rock coding and resource reporting purposes.

## 5.6.2.5 ROCK CODE DETERMINATION

The rock codes used for the resource model were derived from the mineralized domain solids. The list of rock codes used follows:

## Rock Code Description for Domains

- 0 Air
- 10 Massive Sulphide
- 20 Oxidized Massive Sulphide
- 30 Net Textured Sulphide
- 40 Oxidized Net Textured Sulphide
- 99 Waste Rock
- 100 Overburden

## 5.6.2.6 COMPOSITES

Length weighted composites were generated for the drill hole data that fell within the constraints of the above-mentioned domains.  These composites were calculated for Ni, Cu, Co, Au, Pt and Pd over 2.0 metre lengths starting at the first point of intersection between assay data hole and hanging wall of the 3-D domain constraint.  The compositing process was halted upon exit from the  footwall  of  the  aforementioned  constraint.    Any  composites  calculated  that  were  less  than 0.5m in length, were added to the preceding one metre composite so as to include all composite data. This was done so as to not introduce a short sample bias in the interpolation process. The composite data were extracted to Gemcom extraction files for the grade interpolation as X, Y, Z, Ni, Cu, Co, Au, Pt, Pd files.

## 5.6.2.7 GRADE CAPPING

Grade capping was investigated on the raw assay values in the combined domains to ensure that the  possible  influence  of  erratic  high  values  did  not  bias  the  database.    Extraction  files  were created for constrained Ni, Cu, Co, Au, Pt and Pd data within each mineralized domain. From these  extraction  files,  log-normal  histograms  were  generated  and  subsequently  analyzed  to determine  the  location  of  and  capping  value  required  to  remove  outliers  that  would  unduly influence the grade interpolation.

## 5.6.2.8 VARIOGRAPHY

Variography was not carried out on the constrained domain composites within the four domains in  the  deposit  model.  The  mineralized  domains exhibited good sectional continuity but due to erratically distributed populations, did not yield any discernable variograms.

## 5.6.2.9 BULK DENSITY

The  bulk  density  used  for  the  resource  model  was  derived  from  measurements  of  test  work performed by ALS Chemex of Val d'Or, Quebec on regular core samples obtained from the assay sample submission to the laboratory. A bulk density model was created from this data and utilized to  calculate  the  reported  tonnes.    The  average  bulk  density  from  samples  was  calculated  to  be

4.23 t/m3 for the massive sulphide domain, 4.49 t/m3 for the oxidized massive sulphide domain, 3.24 t/m3 for the net textured domain and 3.33 t/m3 for the oxidized net textured domain.

## 5.6.2.10 BLOCK MODELING

The  resource  model  was  divided  into  a  3D  block  model  framework.  The  block  model  has 480,000 blocks that were 5m in the X direction, 5m in the Y direction and 5m in the Z direction. There were 120 columns (X), 80 rows (Y) and 50 levels. The block model was rotated 28.691 degrees clockwise.  Separate block models were created for rock type, density, percent, Ni, Cu, Co Au, Pt and Pd.

The percent block model was set up to accurately represent the volume and subsequent tonnage that  was  occupied  by  each  block  inside  each  constraining  domain.    As  a  result,  the  domain boundaries were properly represented by the percent model ability to measure infinitely variable inclusion percentages within a particular domain.

The Ni, Cu, Co Au, Pt and Pd composites were extracted from the Microsoft Access database composite table into separate files for each Mineralized Zone.  Inverse distance squared (1/d2) grade interpolation was utilized. There were two interpolation passes performed on each domain for  each  element  for  the  indicated  and  inferred  classifications.  The  grade  blocks  within  all domains were interpolated using the following parameters:

## 5.6.2.11 RESOURCE CLASSIFICATION

For the purposes of this resource, classifications of all interpolated grade blocks were determined from  the  Ni  interpolations  for  indicated  and  inferred  due  to  Ni  being  the  dominant  revenue producing element in the NSR calculation. All blocks coded by the first interpolation pass were coded as indicated while the remaining blocks coded on the second interpolation pass as inferred.

The above data were derived from the July 2006 Preliminary Economic Analysis on the Mesamax Deposit.

In the anticipated open pit operation, Mill Processing and G&amp;A costs combine for a total of ($25.00 + $15.00) = $40.00/tonne milled which became the internal NSR cut-off value.

In order for the constrained mineralization in the Mesamax model to be considered as a resource which  is  potentially  economic,  a  0.25%  Ni  cut-off  grade  was  applied  to  the  model  blocks resulting in the resource estimate that can be seen in the following table.

The  mineral  resources  were  estimated  using  the  Canadian  Institute  of  Mining,  Metallurgy  and Petroleum (CIM), CIM  Standards on Mineral Resources and Reserves, Definitions and Guidelines  prepared  by  the  CIM  Standing  Committee  on  Reserve  Definitions  and  adopted  by CIM Council December 11, 2005.

## 5.6.2.13 CONFIRMATION OF ESTIMATE

As a test of the reasonableness of the estimate, the block model was queried at a 0.01 % Ni cut off  grade  with  blocks  in  all  classifications  summed  and  their  grades  weight  averaged.  This average  is  the  average  grade  of  all  blocks  within  the  mineralized  domains.  The  values  of  the interpolated grades for the block model were compared to the length weighted capped average grades and average grade of composites of all samples from within the domain. The results are presented below.

The preceding comparison indicates the average grade of all of the Ni, Cu, Co, Au, Pt and Pd blocks  in  each  domain  compared  to  the  length  weighted  average  of  all  capped  assays  and composites. used for grade estimation.  The Net Textured Domains show a very close comparison among all three values, however, many isolated higher grade assays in the Massive Domains are contributing to higher block model values than capped assays or composites. The block model invariably  represents  the  metal  distribution  most  correctly  of  all  three  methods.  This  effect  is essentially the reverse of assay data clustering.

In addition, a volumetric comparison was performed with the block volume of the model vs. the geometric calculated volume of the domain solids.

## 5.6.3 MEQUILLON DEPOSIT RESOURCE ESTIMATE

## 5.6.3.1 INTRODUCTION

The purpose of this report section is to delineate the Mequillon Deposit Resources in compliance with NI 43-101 and CIM standards. This resource estimate was undertaken by Eugene Puritch, P.Eng. and Antoine Yassa, P.Geo., of P &amp; E Mining Consultants Inc. of Brampton Ontario. The effective date of this resource estimate is September 7, 2007.

## 5.6.3.2 DATABASE

All drilling data were provided by Canadian Royalties Inc. in the form of a Microsoft Access database,  Excel  files,  drill  logs  and  assay  certificates.    Thirty  (30)  drill  cross  sections  were developed on a local grid  looking  southwest  on  an  azimuth  of  246.4   on  a  nominal  50  meter 0 spacing named from -850E to 600E.  A Gemcom database was provided by the client containing 130 diamond drill holes of which 92 were utilized in the resource calculation. The remaining data were not in the area that was modeled for this resource estimate.

The database was validated in Gemcom with minor corrections required.  The assay table of the database contained 9,572 assays for Ni, Cu, Co, Au, Pt and Pd.  All data are expressed in metric units and grid coordinates are in the NAD83 UTM system.

## 5.6.3.3 DATA VERIFICATION

Verification of assay data entry was performed on 9,572 assay intervals for Ni, Cu, Co, Au, Pt and Pd.  A few very minor data entry errors were observed and corrected. The 9,572 verified intervals  were checked against digital assay lab certificates from ALS Chemex of Vancouver, B.C. The checked assays represented 100% of the data to be used for the resource estimate and approximately 100% of the entire database.

## 5.6.3.4 DOMAIN INTERPRETATION

Domain boundaries were determined from lithology, structure and Ni, Cu and PGE boundary interpretation  from  visual  inspection  of  drillhole  sections.    One  domain  was  developed  and named as Net Textured.  This domain was physically created with computer screen digitizing on drill hole sections in Gemcom by the authors of this report.  The outlines were influenced by the selection  of  mineralized  material  that  demonstrated  net  textured  characteristics,  and  zonal continuity  along  strike  and  down  dip.    In  a  very  few  cases,  some  mineralization  below characteristic net textured grades was included for the purpose of maintaining zonal continuity. Smoothing  was  utilized  to  remove  obvious  jogs  and  dips  in  the  domains  and  incorporated  a minor  addition  of  inferred  mineralization.  This  exercise  allowed  for  easier  domain  creation without triangulation errors from solids validation.

On  each  section,  polyline  interpretations  were  digitized  from  drill  hole  to  drill  hole  but  not extended  more  than  25  metres  into  untested  territory.    Minimum  constrained  true  width  for interpretation was 2.0 metres. The interpreted polylines from each section were 'wireframed' in Gemcom into a  3-dimensional  domain.    The  resulting  solid  (domain)  was  used  for  statistical analysis, grade interpolation, rock coding and resource reporting purposes.

## 5.6.3.5 ROCK CODE DETERMINATION

The rock codes used for the resource model were derived from the mineralized domain solid and four  sub  domains  that  were  developed  to  control  search  ellipse  orientation  within  the  parent domain. The list of rock codes used follows:

## Rock Code Description

|   0 | Air                                |
|-----|------------------------------------|
|  10 | Net Textured South Sub Domain      |
|  20 | Net Textured North Sub Domain      |
|  30 | Net Textured North Tail Sub Domain |
|  40 | Net Textured Central Sub Domain    |
|  99 | Waste Rock                         |

## 5.6.3.6 COMPOSITES

Length weighted composites were generated for the drill hole data that fell within the constraints of the above-mentioned domains.  These composites were calculated for Ni, Cu, Co, Au, Pt and Pd over 1.0 metre lengths starting at the first point of intersection between assay data hole and hanging wall of the 3-D zonal constraint.  The compositing process was halted upon exit from the footwall of the aforementioned constraint.  Un-assayed intervals were treated as null data. Any calculated composites that were less than 0.4 metres in length were discarded in order to not introduce a short sample bias in the interpolation process. The composite data were transferred to Gemcom extraction files for the grade interpolation as X, Y, Z, Ni, Cu, Co, Au, Pt, Pd files.

## 5.6.3.7 GRADE CAPPING

Grade capping was investigated on the raw assay values in the combined domains to ensure that the  possible  influence  of  erratic  high  values  did  not  bias  the  database.    Extraction  files  were created for constrained Ni, Cu, Co, Au, Pt and Pd data within each mineralized domain. From these extraction files, log-normal histograms were generated.

## 5.6.3.8 VARIOGRAPHY

Variography was not carried out on the constrained domain composites within the domain of the deposit  model.  The  mineralized  domain  exhibited  good  sectional  continuity  but  due  to  an erratically distributed population, did not yield discernable variograms. Additional future drilling may enhance variography for this deposit.

## 5.6.3.9 BULK DENSITY

The bulk density used for the resource model was derived from measurements of bulk density test  work  performed  by  ALS  Chemex  on  seventy  two  net  textured  sulphide  representative samples obtained by the client from drill core.  The resulting average bulk density model within the  constraining  domain  created  utilizing  these  samples  was  calculated  to  be  3.21  tonnes  per cubic metre.

## 5.6.3.10 BLOCK MODELING

The  resource  model  was  divided  into  a  3D  block  model  framework.  The  block  model  has 4,915,200  blocks  that  were  5m  in  the  X  direction,  5m  in  the  Y  direction  and  5m  in  the  Z direction.    There  were  320  columns  (X),  160  rows  (Y)  and  96  levels.  The  block  model  was rotated  23.57  degrees  counter-clockwise.    Separate  block  models  were  created  for  rock  type, density, and percent, Ni, Cu, Co, Au, Pt and Pd.

The percent block model was set up to accurately represent the volume and subsequent tonnage that  was  occupied  by  each  block  inside  each  constraining  domain.    As  a  result,  the  domain boundaries were properly represented by the percent model ability to measure infinitely variable inclusion percentages within a particular domain.

The Ni, Cu, Co Au, Pt and Pd composites were extracted from the Microsoft Access database composite table into separate files for each Mineralized Zone.  Inverse distance squared (1/d2) grade interpolation was utilized. There were two interpolation passes performed on each domain for  each  element  for  the  Indicated  and  Inferred  classifications.  The  grade  blocks  within  the domain were interpolated using the following parameters:

## 5.6.3.11 RESOURCE CLASSIFICATION

For the purposes of this resource, classifications of all interpolated grade blocks were determined from  the  Ni  interpolations  for  Indicated  and  Inferred  due  to  Ni  being  the  dominant  revenue producing element in the NSR calculation.

## 5.6.3.12 RESOURCE ESTIMATE

The resource estimate was derived from applying an NSR cut-off grade to the block model and reporting the resulting tonnes and grade for potentially mineable  areas. The  following calculations  demonstrate  the  rationale  supporting  the  NSR  cut-off  grade  that  determines  the potentially economic portion of the mineralized domains.

The above data were derived from the July 2006 Preliminary Economic Analysis. The $C/$US exchange rate of $0.80 was chosen so as to keep the Mequillon resource estimate in line with the parameters that were used for evaluating the Mesamax, Expo and Ivakkak Deposits in late 2006 and  early  2007.  This  $0.80  exchange  rate  was  initially  chosen  to  reflect  long  term  rate predictions and to align with the very conservative metal prices used for the NSR calculation.

In the anticipated open pit portion of the Mequillon Deposit, the processing, ore transport to  plant  and  G&amp;A  costs  combine  for  a  total  of  ($25.00  +  $2.50  +  $15.00)  =  $42.50/tonne milled which became the internal NSR cut-off value.

In order for the constrained mineralization in the Mequillon Deposit model to be considered as an open pit resource which is potentially economic, a first pass Whittle 4X pit optimization was carried out utilizing the following criteria:

Waste mining cost per tonne   ................................................................$3.18

Ore mining cost per tonne   ....................................................................$3.18

Ore transport to process plant cost per tonne…………………………$2.50

Process cost per tonne  .........................................................................$25.00

G&amp;A cost per ore tonne ......................................................................$15.00

Process production rate (ore tonnes per year)  ...................................875,000

Pit slopes (inter ramp angle) ...............................................................  50 deg

Net Textured Sulphide Bulk Density  .............................................. 3.21t/m3

Ultramafic Bulk Density ................................................................ 2.92 t/m3

Waste Rock Bulk Density………………………………………...2.90 t/m3

In the anticipated underground portion of the Mequillon Deposit, the mining, ore transport to  plant,  processing  and  G&amp;A  costs  combine  for  a  total  of  ($32.50  +  $2.50  +  $25.00  + $15.00) = $75.00/tonne milled which became the NSR cut-off value.

The resulting open pit and underground resource estimate can be seen in Table 5-27.

It should be noted that the mineral resources in this estimate were calculated using the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (CIM), CIM Standards on Mineral Resources and Reserves,  Definitions  and  Guidelines  prepared  by  the  CIM  Standing  Committee  on  Reserve Definitions and adopted by CIM Council December 11, 2005.

## 5.6.3.13 CONFIRMATION OF ESTIMATE

As a test of the reasonableness of the estimate, the block model was queried at a 0.01 % Ni cut off  grade  with  blocks  in  all  classifications  summed  and  their  grades  weight  averaged.  This average  is  the  average  grade  of  all  blocks  within  the  mineralized  domains.  The  values  of  the interpolated grades for the block model were compared to the length weighted capped average grades and average grade of composites of all samples from within the domain. The results are presented below.

## Net Textured Sulphide Domain

The comparison above shows the average grade of all of the Ni, Cu, Co, Au, Pt and Pd blocks in each domain to be similar to the weighted average of all capped assays and composites used for grade estimation.

In addition, a volumetric comparison was performed with the block volume of the model vs. the geometric calculated volume of the domain solids.

## Net Textured Sulphide Domain

Block Model Volume                           2,735,259 m3

## 5.6.4 IVAKKAK DEPOSIT RESOURCE ESTIMATE

## 5.6.4.1 INTRODUCTION

The purpose of this report section is to delineate the Ivakkak Deposit Resources in compliance with NI 43-101 and CIM standards. This resource estimate was undertaken by Eugene Puritch, P.Eng.  of  P  &amp;  E  Mining  Consultants  Inc.  of  Brampton  Ontario  along  with  the  assistance  of Gerald Harron, P.Eng., of G. A. Harron &amp; Associates Inc. The effective date of this resource estimate is December 31, 2006.

## 5.6.4.2 DATABASE

All drilling data were provided by Canadian Royalties Inc. in the form of their Microsoft Access Ungava Master  database,  Excel  files,  drill  logs  and  assay  certificates.    Twenty  two  (22)  drill cross  sections  were  developed  on  a  local  grid  looking  northwest  on  an  azimuth  of  300   on  a 0 nominal 25 metre spacing named from 150-W to 375-E.  A Gemcom database was provided by the client containing 90 diamond drill holes of which 80 were utilized in the resource calculation. The remaining data were not in the area that was modeled for this resource estimate.

The database was validated in Gemcom with minor corrections required.  The assay table of the database contained 1,888 assays for Ni, Cu, Co, Au, Pt and Pd.  All data are expressed in metric units and grid coordinates are in the NAD83 UTM system.

## 5.6.4.3 DATA VERIFICATION

Verification of assay data entry was performed on 1,888 assay intervals for Ni, Cu, Co, Au, Pt and Pd.  A few very minor data entry errors were observed and corrected. The 1,888 verified intervals were checked against assay lab certificates from ALS Chemex of Vancouver, B.C. The checked  assays  represented  100%  of  the  data  to  be  used  for  the  resource  estimate  and approximately 100% of the entire database.

## 5.6.4.4 DOMAIN INTERPRETATION

Domain boundaries were determined from lithology, structure and Ni, Cu and PGE boundary interpretation from visual inspection of drill hole sections.  Two domains were developed named Massive  Sulphide  and  Net  Textured.    These  domains  were  physically  created  with  computer screen digitizing on drill hole sections in Gemcom by the authors of this report.  The outlines were  influenced  by  the  selection  of  mineralized  material  that  demonstrated  massive  and  net textured characteristics, and zonal continuity along strike and down dip.  In a very few cases, some mineralization  below  characteristic  massive  or  net  textured  grades  was  included  for  the purpose  of  maintaining  zonal  continuity.  Smoothing  was  utilized  to  remove  obvious  jogs  and dips in the domains and incorporated a minor addition of inferred mineralization. This exercise allowed for easier domain creation without triangulation errors from solids validation.

On  each  section,  polyline  interpretations  were  digitized  from  drill  hole  to  drill  hole  but  not extended more than 12 to 15 metres into untested territory.  Minimum constrained true width for interpretation was 1.0 metre. The interpreted polylines from each section were 'wireframed' in Gemcom into 3-dimensional domains.  The resulting solids (domains) were used for statistical analysis, grade interpolation, rock coding and resource reporting purposes.

## 5.6.4.6 COMPOSITES

Length weighted composites were generated for the drill hole data that fell within the constraints of the above-mentioned domains.  These composites were calculated for Ni, Cu, Co, Au, Pt and Pd over 2.0 metre lengths starting at the first point of intersection between assay data hole and hanging wall of the 3-D zonal constraint.  The compositing process was halted upon exit from the footwall of the aforementioned constraint.  Un-assayed intervals were treated as null data. Any  composites  calculated  that  were  less  than  0.5m  in  length,  were  discarded  so  as  to  not introduce a short sample bias in the interpolation process. The composite data were transferred to Gemcom extraction files for the grade interpolation as X, Y, Z, Ni, Cu, Co, Au, Pt, Pd files.

## 5.6.4.7 GRADE CAPPING

Grade capping was investigated on the raw assay values in the combined domains to ensure that the  possible  influence  of  erratic  high  values  did  not  bias  the  database.    Extraction  files  were created for constrained Ni, Cu, Co, Au, Pt and Pd data within each mineralized domain. From these extraction files, log-normal histograms were generated.

## 5.6.4.8 VARIOGRAPHY

Variography was not carried out on the constrained domain composites within the two domains in  the  deposit  model.  The  mineralized  domains exhibited good sectional continuity but due to low  population  densities  did  not  yield  discernable  variograms.  Additional  future  drilling  may enhance variography for this deposit.

## 5.6.4.9 BULK DENSITY

The bulk density used for the resource model was derived from measurements of bulk density test  work  performed  by  ALS  Chemex  on  thirty-two  massive  sulphide  and  thirty-eight  net textured  sulphide  representative  samples  obtained  by  the  client  from  drill  core.    The  resulting average  bulk  density  model  created  from  these  samples  was  calculated  to  be  4.37  tonnes  per cubic meter for the massive sulphide domain and 3.22 tonnes per cubic metre in the net textured domain.

## 5.6.4.10 BLOCK MODELING

The  resource  model  was  divided  into  a  3D  block  model  framework.  The  block  model  has 548,100 blocks that were 5m in the X direction, 5m in the Y direction and 5m in the Z direction. There  were  100  columns  (X),  160  rows  (Y)  and  40  levels.  The  block  model  was  rotated  30 degrees clockwise.  Separate block models were created for rock type, density, percent, Ni, Cu, Co Au, Pt and Pd.

The percent block model was set up to accurately represent the volume and subsequent tonnage that  was  occupied  by  each  block  inside  each  constraining  domain.    As  a  result,  the  domain boundaries were properly represented by the percent model ability to measure infinitely variable inclusion percentages within a particular domain.

The Ni, Cu, Co Au, Pt and Pd composites were extracted from the Microsoft Access database composite table into separate files for each Mineralized Zone.  Inverse distance squared (1/d2) grade interpolation was utilized. There were two interpolation passes performed on each domain for  each  element  for  the  indicated  and  inferred  classifications.  The  grade  blocks  within  all domains were interpolated using the following parameters:

## 5.6.4.11 RESOURCE CLASSIFICATION

For the purposes of this resource, classifications of all interpolated grade blocks were determined from  the  Ni  interpolations  for  indicated  and  inferred  due  to  Ni  being  the  dominant  revenue producing element in the NSR calculation.

## 5.6.4.12 RESOURCE ESTIMATE

The resource estimate was derived from applying an NSR cut-off grade to the block model and reporting  the  resulting  tonnes  and  grade  for  potentially  mineable  areas.    The  following calculations  demonstrate  the  rationale  supporting  the  NSR  cut-off  grade  that  determines  the potentially economic portion of the mineralized domains.

The above data were derived from the July 2006 Preliminary Economic Analysis on the Ivakkak Deposit.

In the anticipated open pit operation, Mill Processing and G&amp;A costs combine for a total of ($25.00 + $15.00) = $40.00/tonne milled which became the internal NSR cut-off value.

In order for the constrained mineralization in the Ivakkak model to be considered as a resource which is potentially economic, a first pass Whittle 4X pit optimization was carried out utilizing the following criteria:

Waste mining cost per tonne   ..................................................................3.18

Ore mining cost per tonne   ....................................................................$3.18

Process cost per tonne  .........................................................................$25.00

General &amp; Administration cost per ore tonne .....................................$15.00

Process production rate (ore tonnes per year)  ...................................875,000

It should be noted that the mineral resources in this estimate were calculated using the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (CIM), CIM Standards on Mineral Resources and Reserves,  Definitions  and  Guidelines  prepared  by  the  CIM  Standing  Committee  on  Reserve Definitions and adopted by CIM Council December 11, 2005.

## 5.6.4.13 CONFIRMATION OF ESTIMATE

As a test of the reasonableness of the estimate, the block model was queried at a 0.01 % Ni cut off  grade  with  blocks  in  all  classifications  summed  and  their  grades  weight  averaged.  This average  is  the  average  grade  of  all  blocks  within  the  mineralized  domains.  The  values  of  the interpolated grades for the block model were compared to the length weighted capped average

grades and average grade of composites of all samples from within the domain. The results are presented below.

## 5.6.5 ALLAMMAQ DEPOSIT RESOURCE ESTIMATE

## 5.6.5.1 INTRODUCTION

The purpose of this report section is to delineate the Allammaq Deposit Resources in compliance with NI 43-101 and CIM standards. This resource estimate was undertaken by Eugene Puritch, P.Eng. and Antoine Yassa, P.Geo. of P &amp; E Mining Consultants Inc. of Brampton Ontario. The effective date of this resource estimate is October 4, 2009.

## 5.6.5.2 DATABASE

Drilling  data  were  provided  by  Canadian  Royalties  Inc.  in  the  form  of  a  Microsoft  Access database, Excel files, drill logs and assay certificates.  Forty two (42) drill cross sections were developed on a local grid looking east on an azimuth of 88.4  on a 25 metre spacing named from 0 1500E to 2525E.  A Gemcom database was provided by CRI containing 135 diamond drill holes of which 84 were utilized in the resource calculation. The remaining data were not in the area that was modeled for this resource estimate.

The database was validated in Gemcom with minor corrections required.  The assay table of the database contained 5,467 assays for Ni and Cu, 5,410 assays for Co, 5,238 assays for Au and 5,371 assays for Pt and Pd.  All data are expressed in metric units and grid coordinates are in the NAD83 UTM system.

## 5.6.5.3 DATA VERIFICATION

Verification of assay data entry was performed on 4,646 assay intervals for Ni, Cu, Co, Au, Pt and Pd.  A few very minor data entry errors were observed and corrected. The 4,646 verified intervals  were checked against digital assay lab certificates from ALS Chemex of Vancouver, B.C. The checked assays represented 100% of the data to be used for the resource estimate and approximately 85% of the entire database.

## 5.6.5.4 DOMAIN INTERPRETATION

Domain boundaries were determined from lithology, structure and Ni, Cu and PGE boundary interpretation from visual inspection of drill hole sections.  Nine domains were developed and were named as Hanging Wall Cu, Hanging Wall Massive, Hanging Wall Net Textured, Hanging Wall  Vein,  Footwall  Massive,  Footwall  Net  Textured,  Footwall  Vein,  West  Extension  Net Textured and West Extension Vein.  These domains were created by computer screen digitizing on drill hole sections in Gemcom by the authors of this report.  The outlines were influenced by the selection of mineralized material that demonstrated mineralization style characteristics and zonal  continuity  along  strike  and  down  dip.    In  a  very  few  cases,  some  mineralization  below characteristic  mineralization  style  grades  was  included  for  the  purpose  of  maintaining  zonal continuity.  Smoothing  was  utilized  to  remove  obvious  jogs  and  dips  in  the  domains  and incorporated a minor addition of inferred mineralization. This exercise allowed for easier domain creation without triangulation errors from solids validation.

On  each  section,  polyline  interpretations  were  digitized  from  drill  hole  to  drill  hole  but  not extended  more  than  50  metres  into  untested  territory.    Minimum  constrained  true  width  for interpretation was 2.0 metres. The interpreted polylines from each section were 'wireframed' in

Gemcom into 3-dimensional domains.  The resulting solids (domains) were used for statistical analysis, grade interpolation, rock coding and resource reporting purposes.

## 5.6.5.5 ROCK CODE DETERMINATION

The  rock  codes  used  for  the  resource  model  were  derived  from  the  nine  mineralized  domain solids and are listed below:

## Rock Code Description

- 10 Hanging Wall Cu Domain
- 20 Hanging Wall Massive Domain
- 30 Hanging Wall Net Textured Domain
- 40 Hanging Wall Vein Domain
- 50 Footwall Massive Domain

## 5.6.5.6 COMPOSITES

Length weighted composites were generated for the drill hole data that fell within the constraints of the above-mentioned domains.  These composites were calculated for Ni, Cu, Co, Au, Pt and Pd over 1.0 metre lengths starting at the first point of intersection between assay data hole and hanging wall of the 3-D wireframe constraint.  The compositing process was halted upon exit from  the  footwall  of  the  aforementioned  constraint.    Un-assayed  intervals  were  treated  as  ½ assay  detection  limit  values.  Any  composites  calculated  that  were  less  than  0.25  m  in  length, were  discarded  so  as  to  not  introduce  a  short  sample  bias  in  the  interpolation  process.  The composite data were transferred to Gemcom extraction files for the grade interpolation as X, Y, Z, Ni, Cu, Co, Au, Pt, Pd files.

## 5.6.5.7 GRADE CAPPING

Grade capping was investigated on the raw assay values in the combined domains to ensure that the  possible  influence  of  erratic  high  values  did  not  bias  the  database.    Extraction  files  were created for constrained Ni, Cu, Co, Au, Pt and Pd data within each mineralized domain. From these extraction files, log-normal histograms were generated.

## 5.6.5.8 VARIOGRAPHY

Variography was carried out on the constrained domain composites within the deposit model. The Hanging Wall and Footwall Net Textured domain composites yielded reasonable directional variograms while the West Extension Net Textured domain composites yielded only omnivariograms. The remaining domains consisted of populations too small to yield discernable variograms. Additional future drilling may enhance variography for those domains.

## 5.6.5.9 BULK DENSITY

The bulk density used for the resource model was derived from bulk density test work performed by  ALS Chemex on 1,923 pulp samples that represented all nine domains.  The bulk density block model was coded with a simple spherical interpolation pass. The resulting average bulk densities  within  the  constraining  domains  utilizing  these  samples  were  calculated  to  be  4.2 tonnes/m3 for massive, 3.5 tonnes/m3 for veins and 3.1 tonnes /m3 for net textured.

## 5.6.5.10 BLOCK MODELING

The  resource  model  was  divided  into  a  3D  block  model  framework.  The  block  model  has 12,480,000 blocks that were 2.5m in the X direction, 2.5m in the Y direction and 2.5m in the Z direction.  There were 520 columns (X), 240 rows (Y) and 100 levels (Z). The block model was rotated  1.55  degrees  counter-clockwise.    Separate  block  models  were  created  for  rock  type, density, percent, Class, Ni, Cu, Co, Au, Pt, Pd and NSR.

The percent block model was set up to accurately represent the volume and subsequent tonnage that  was  occupied  by  each  block  inside  each  constraining  domain.    As  a  result,  the  domain boundaries  were  properly  represented  by  the  percent  model's  ability  to  measure  infinitely variable inclusion percentages within a particular domain.

The Ni, Cu, Co, Au, Pt and Pd composites were extracted from the Microsoft Access database composite table into separate files for each Mineralized Zone.  Inverse distance squared (1/d2) grade interpolation was utilized. There were three interpolation passes performed on the hanging wall  net  textured  domain  for  each  element  for  coding  blocks  in  the  Measured,  Indicated  and Inferred classifications. The remaining domains were subjected to two interpolation passes for the Indicated and Inferred classifications. The grade blocks within the domains were interpolated using the following parameters:

## 5.6.5.11 RESOURCE CLASSIFICATION

For  the  purposes  of  this  resource,  the  classification  of  all  interpolated  grade  blocks  was determined  from  the  Ni  grade  interpolations  for  Indicated  and  Inferred  due  to  Ni  being  the dominant revenue producing element in the NSR calculation.

## 5.6.5.12 RESOURCE ESTIMATE

The resource estimate was derived from applying an NSR cut-off grade to the block model and reporting the resulting tonnes and grade for potentially mineable  areas. The  following calculations  demonstrate  the  rationale  supporting  the  NSR  cut-off  grade  that  determines  the potentially economic portion of the mineralized domains.

It should be noted that the mineral resources in this estimate were calculated using the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (CIM), CIM Standards on Mineral Resources and Reserves,  Definitions  and  Guidelines  prepared  by  the  CIM  Standing  Committee  on  Reserve Definitions and adopted by CIM Council December 11, 2005.

## 5.6.5.13 CONFIRMATION OF ESTIMATE

As a test of the reasonableness of the estimate, the block model was queried at a 0.01 % Ni cut off  grade  with  blocks  in  all  classifications  summed  and  their  grades  weight  averaged.  This average  is  the  average  grade  of  all  blocks  within  the  mineralized  domains.  The  values  of  the interpolated grades for the block model were compared to the length weighted average capped assay grades and average grade of composites of all samples from within the domain. The results are presented in Table 5-36:

Table 5-36: Allammaq Deposit Comparison of Weighted Average Grade of Capped Assays and Composites with Total Block Model Average Grade

| Category      |   Ni  (%) |   Cu  (%) |   Co  (%) |   Au   (g/t) |   Pt  (g/t) |   Pd  (g/t) |
|---------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|--------------|-------------|-------------|
| Capped Assays |      0.81 |      0.97 |      0.04 |         0.09 |        0.45 |        1.94 |
| Composites    |      0.81 |      0.96 |      0.04 |         0.09 |        0.45 |        1.93 |
| Block Model   |      0.7  |      0.88 |      0.03 |         0.08 |        0.39 |        1.71 |

The comparison above shows the average grade of all of the Ni, Cu, Co, Au, Pt and Pd blocks in each  domain  to  be  somewhat  lower  than  the  weighted  average  of  all  capped  assays  and composites used for grade estimation. This effect resulted from the clustering of some of the data used  for  grade  interpolation.  The  block  model  grades  reflect  a  more  representative  three dimensional grade distribution than the capped assays and composites.

In addition, a volumetric comparison was performed with the block volume of the model vs. the geometric calculated volume of the domain solids.

Block Model Volume                           2,143,828 m3

Geometric Domain Volume                  2,145,482 m3

## 5.6.6 PUIMAJUQ DEPOSIT RESOURCE ESTIMATE

## 5.6.6.1 INTRODUCTION

The purpose of this report section is to delineate the Puimajuq Deposit Resources in compliance with NI 43-101 and CIM standards. This resource estimate was undertaken by Eugene Puritch, P.Eng. and Antoine Yassa, P.Geo. of P &amp; E Mining Consultants Inc. of Brampton Ontario. The effective date of this resource estimate is September 14, 2009.

## 5.6.6.2 DATABASE

Drilling  data  were  provided  by  Canadian  Royalties  Inc.  in  the  form  of  a  Microsoft  Access database, Excel files, drill logs and assay certificates.  Six (6) drill cross sections were developed on a local grid looking east on an azimuth of 90.5  on a 25 metre spacing named from 1200E to 0 1325E.  A Gemcom database was provided by CRI containing 24 diamond drill holes of which 17 were utilized in the resource calculation. The remaining data were not in the area that was modeled for this resource estimate.

The database was validated in Gemcom with minor corrections required.  The assay table of the database contained 626 assays for Ni, Cu, Co, Pt and Pd and 593 assays for Au. All data are expressed in metric units and grid coordinates are in the NAD83 UTM system.

## 5.6.6.3 DATA VERIFICATION

Verification of assay data entry was performed on 626 assay intervals for Ni, Cu, Co, Au, Pt and Pd.  No data entry errors were observed. The 626 verified intervals were checked against digital assay  lab  certificates  from  ALS  Chemex  of  Vancouver,  B.C.  The  checked  assays  represented 100% of the  data  to  be  used  for  the  resource  estimate  and  approximately  100%  of  the  entire database.

## 5.6.6.4 DOMAIN INTERPRETATION

Domain boundaries were determined from lithology, structure and Ni, Cu and PGE boundary interpretation from visual inspection of drill hole sections.  Two domains were developed and were  named  Massive  and  Net  Textured.    These  domains  were  created  by  computer  screen digitizing  on  drill  hole  sections  in  Gemcom  by  the  authors  of  this  report.    The  outlines  were influenced  by  the  selection  of  mineralized  material  that  demonstrated  mineralization  style characteristics  and  zonal  continuity  along  strike  and  down  dip.    In  a  very  few  cases,  some mineralization below characteristic mineralization style grades was included for the purpose of maintaining  zonal  continuity.  Smoothing  was  utilized  to  remove  obvious  jogs  and  dips  in  the domains and incorporated a minor addition of inferred mineralization. This exercise allowed for easier domain creation without triangulation errors from solids validation.

On  each  section,  polyline  interpretations  were  digitized  from  drill  hole  to  drill  hole  but  not extended  more  than  25  metres  into  untested  territory.    Minimum  constrained  true  width  for interpretation was 2.0 metres. The interpreted polylines from each section were 'wireframed' in Gemcom into 3-dimensional domains.  The resulting solids (domains) were used for statistical analysis, grade interpolation, rock coding and resource reporting purposes.

## 5.6.6.5 ROCK CODE DETERMINATION

The  rock  codes  used  for  the  resource  model  were  derived  from  the  two  mineralized  domain solids and are listed below:

## Rock Code Description

- 10 Massive Domain
- 20 Net Textured Domain

## 5.6.6.6 COMPOSITES

Length weighted composites were generated for the drill hole data that fell within the constraints of the above-mentioned domains.  These composites were calculated for Ni, Cu, Co, Au, Pt and Pd over 1.0 metre lengths starting at the first point of intersection between assay data hole and hanging wall of the 3-D wireframe constraint.  The compositing process was halted upon exit from  the  footwall  of  the  aforementioned  constraint.    Un-assayed  intervals  were  treated  as  ½ assay detection limit values. Any composites calculated that were less than 0.25m in length, were discarded so as to not introduce a short sample bias in the interpolation process. The composite data were transferred to Gemcom extraction files for the grade interpolation as X, Y, Z, Ni, Cu, Co, Au, Pt, Pd files.

## 5.6.6.7 GRADE CAPPING

Grade capping was investigated on the raw assay values in the combined domains to ensure that the  possible  influence  of  erratic  high  values  did  not  bias  the  database.    Extraction  files  were created for constrained Ni, Cu, Co, Au, Pt and Pd data within each mineralized domain. From these extraction files, log-normal histograms were generated.

## 5.6.6.8 VARIOGRAPHY

Variography was carried out on the constrained domain composites within the deposit model. The  Net  Textured  domain  composites  yielded  reasonable  directional  variograms  while  the Massive  domain  did  not  yield  any  discernable  variograms.  Additional  future  drilling  may enhance variography for that domain.

## 5.6.6.9 BULK DENSITY

The bulk density used for the resource model was derived from bulk density test work performed by ALS Chemex on 195 pulp samples that represented both domains.  The bulk density block model was coded with a simple spherical interpolation pass. The resulting average bulk densities within the constraining domains utilizing these samples were calculated to be 4.2 tonnes/m3 for massive and 3.2 tonnes /m3 for net textured.

## 5.6.6.10 BLOCK MODELING

The  resource  model  was  divided  into  a  3D  block  model  framework.  The  block  model  has 690,000 blocks that were 2.5m in the X direction, 2.5m in the Y direction and 2.5m in the Z direction.  There were 150 columns (X),100 rows (Y) and 460 levels (Z). The block model was rotated  0.47  degrees  clockwise.    Separate  block  models  were  created  for  rock  type,  density, percent, Class, Ni, Cu, Co, Au, Pt, Pd and NSR.

The percent block model was set up to accurately represent the volume and subsequent tonnage that  was  occupied  by  each  block  inside  each  constraining  domain.    As  a  result,  the  domain boundaries  were  properly  represented  by  the  percent  model's  ability  to  measure  infinitely variable inclusion percentages within a particular domain.

The Ni, Cu, Co, Au, Pt and Pd composites were extracted from the Microsoft Access database composite table into separate files for each Mineralized Zone.  Inverse distance squared (1/d2) grade interpolation was utilized. There were two interpolation passes performed on each domain for each element for coding blocks in the Indicated and Inferred classifications. The grade blocks within the domains were interpolated using the following parameters:

## 5.6.6.11 RESOURCE CLASSIFICATION

For  the  purposes  of  this  resource,  the  classification  of  all  interpolated  grade  blocks  was determined  from  the  Ni  grade  interpolations  for  Indicated  and  Inferred  due  to  Ni  being  the dominant revenue producing element in the NSR calculation.

## 5.6.6.12 RESOURCE ESTIMATE

The resource estimate was derived from applying an NSR cut-off grade to the block model and reporting the resulting tonnes and grade for potentially mineable  areas. The  following calculations  demonstrate  the  rationale  supporting  the  NSR  cut-off  grade  that  determines  the potentially economic portion of the mineralized domains.

In the anticipated open pit mining operation of the Puimajuq Deposit, the ore transport to plant, processing and G&amp;A costs combine for a total of ($5 + $20+ $15) = $40/tonne milled which became the NSR cut-off value.

The above data were derived from similar resource estimates for the Nunavik Nickel Project. In order for the constrained mineralization in the Puimajuq resource model to be considered as a resource which is potentially economic, a first pass Whittle 4X pit optimization was carried out to create a pit shell utilizing the criteria below.

Waste mining cost per tonne

$3.50

Ore mining cost per tonne

$5.00

Ore transport to mill and process cost per tonne

$25.00

| General & Administration cost per ore tonne   | $15.00   |
|-----------------------------------------------|----------|
| Process production rate (ore tonnes per year) | 750,000  |
| Pit slopes (inter ramp angle)                 | 50 deg   |
| Massive Sulphide Bulk Density                 | 4.2t/m3  |
| Vein Bulk Density                             | 3.5t/m3  |
| Net Textured Sulphide Bulk Density            | 3.1t/m3  |
| Waste Rock Bulk Density                       | 2.8t/m3  |

The resulting open pit resource estimate can be seen in the following table:

It should be noted that the mineral resources in this estimate were calculated using the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (CIM), CIM Standards on Mineral Resources and Reserves,  Definitions  and  Guidelines  prepared  by  the  CIM  Standing  Committee  on  Reserve Definitions and adopted by CIM Council December 11, 2005.

## 5.6.6.13 CONFIRMATION OF ESTIMATE

As a test of the reasonableness of the estimate, the block model was queried at a 0.01 % Ni cut off  grade  with  blocks  in  all  classifications  summed  and  their  grades  weight  averaged.  This average  is  the  average  grade  of  all  blocks  within  the  mineralized  domains.  The  values  of  the interpolated grades for the block model were compared to the length weighted average capped assay grades and average grade of composites of all samples from within the domain. The results are presented below:

Table 5-40: Puimajuq Deposit Comparison of Weighted Average Grade of Capped Assays and Composites with Total Block Model Average Grade

| Category      |   Ni  (%) |   Cu  (%) |   Co  (%) |   Au   (g/t) |   Pt  (g/t) |   Pd  (g/t) |
|---------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|--------------|-------------|-------------|
| Capped Assays |      1.37 |      2.42 |      0.05 |         0.09 |        0.83 |        2.42 |
| Composites    |      1.37 |      2.42 |      0.05 |         0.09 |        0.82 |        2.41 |

The comparison above shows the average grade of all of the Ni, Cu, Co, Au, Pt and Pd blocks in each  domain  to  be  somewhat  lower  than  the  weighted  average  of  all  capped  assays  and composites used for grade estimation. This effect resulted from the clustering of some of the data used  for  grade  interpolation.  The  block  model  grades  reflect  a  more  representative  three dimensional grade distribution than the capped assays and composites.

In addition, a volumetric comparison was performed with the block volume of the model vs. the geometric calculated volume of the domain solids.

## 6.0 GEOLOGICAL SETTING

## 6.1 REGIONAL GEOLOGY

The  Cape  Smith  Belt  in  which  all  of  the  deposits  of  the  Nunavik  Nickel  Project  lie,  is  an interpreted  foreland  thrust-fold  belt  that  constitutes  the  north-eastern  extension  of  the  TransHudson  Orogen,  an  early  Proterozoic  collision  zone,  which  separates  the  Archean  Superior Province  from  the  Proterozoic  Churchill  Province  (Hynes  and  Francis,  1982;  Hoffman  1990). The Trans-Hudson Orogen includes the Thompson Nickel Belt of Manitoba and the New Quebec Orogen  (Labrador  Trough)  on  opposite  sides  of  the  Superior  Province.  The  Cape  Smith (Ungava) Belt extends for 375 kilometres in an east-west direction across the Ungava Peninsula of Nunavik. The greenschist facies foreland portion of the belt is divided into three structurally superimposed  Proterozoic  units,  from  south  to  north  and  oldest  to  youngest:  Lamarche, Povungnituk and Chukotat Groups (Lamothe, 1994). The amphibolite grade hinterland is divided into  four  structurally  superimposed  Proterozoic  units  from  south  to  north;  Sparton,  Parent, Perreault, and Watts Groups (Lamothe, 1994; St-Onge et al., 1992).

The tectono-stratigraphic  elements  of  the  belt  record  a  rifting  event  2.0-1.9  billion  years  (Ga) ago, with accumulation of sedimentary and volcanic units (Povungnituk and Chukotat Groups) on  a  north-facing  continental  margin.  Subsequent  closing  of  the  rift  during  the  Hudsonian Orogeny  ( ca 1.8  Ga),  resulted  in  a  complex  interaction  of  thrusting,  penetrative  shearing, metamorphism and imbrication of the foreland thrust belt with the tectono-stratigraphic units of the hinterland (Lamothe, 1994; Lucas and St.-Onge 1989; St-Onge and Lucas, 1990; St-Onge et al.,  1992).  After  detailed  geological  mapping  on  the  Expo  Ungava  Property  in  recent  years, Mungall  (2004)  has  queried  the  existence  or  structural  necessity  of  the  various  thrust  faults postulated by the earlier workers.

The Property is located within the central portion of the assemblage, near the suture separating the  foreland  from  the  hinterland  domains.  The  North  Domain  is  dominated  by  the  mostly volcanic Watts Group, which has been interpreted as an Island-Arc accretionary complex. The South Domain  includes the Lamarche, Povungnituk, and Chukotat Groups, which are collectively interpreted as an extensional sequence consisting mainly of basalts, sediments and ultramafic rocks grading into oceanic crust towards the north. The boundary between the North and  South  domains  is  marked  by  the  regional  scale  Bergeron  Fault,  considered  to  be  a subduction zone (Bergeron, 1957; Bergeron, 1959; Lamothe et al., 1983; Lamothe, 1986). The basin is interpreted to record a protracted regime of extension followed by sea-floor spreading and subsequent convergent tectonics marked by folding and thrusting.

## 6.2 LOCAL GEOLOGY

The geology of all six deposits for which there are currently resource estimates is all essentially the same, though the morphology of each can be very different. It is believed that all deposits are part of the Expo Intrusive Suite, as detailed by Mungall, 2004. The dyke portions within which the  deposits  lie  can  be  essentially  horizontal  to  essentially  vertical,  and  the  proportions  of massive to net-textured to disseminated sulphides can vary greatly. A detailed description of the Expo Intrusive Suite ('EIS') as per Mungall is presented below, and the geology of each deposit is detailed in individual sub-sections, accompanied by cross sections typical of each.

## Expo Intrusive Suite

An  extensive,  irregular  body  of  ultramafic  rocks,  typically  500  metres  wide  in  outcrop  and termed  the  Expo  Intrusive  Suite  ('EIS')  by  Mungall  (2004),  characterizes  the  general  ExpoUngava  Property  area.  The  EIS  ' forms  a  complex  of  overlapping  gabbroic  dikes,  ultramafic replacement bodies, dunite pipes, and sill-like peridotite massifs ... in the area surrounding the Expo Ungava Deposit '.  The  northern  member or branch of the EIS, which contains the Expo Deposit  extends  for  a  distance  of  nearly  50  kilometres  in  an  east-north-easterly  direction  and bifurcates  several  times,  enclosing  what  appear  to  be  large  'horses'  of  host  rock.  There  is  an intimate association with a gabbro phase that, based on the mapping, becomes the dominant rock type along strike both to the north-east and the southwest. The southern member, with a westnorth-westerly  strike,  has  been  traced  for  a  distance  of  at  least  10  kilometres  and  joins  the northern  branch  toward  the  west  before  it  splits  again.  The  host  rocks  in  the  general  ExpoUngava area are predominantly meta-sediments. Both the northern and southern parts of the EIS can be conformable to the host rocks, as well as clearly cross-cut them, (see Figure 6.1).

## 6.2.1 ALLAMMAQ DEPOSIT GEOLOGY

The  Allammaq  Deposit  is  hosted  by  a  discordant  east-west  striking  subvertical  ultramafic intrusion belonging to the Expo Intrusive Suite. Located some three kilometres to the west, the Mesamax  Deposit  is  thought  to  be  hosted  by  the  same  family  of  intrusions.  Intercalated metabasaltic sheet flows and metasediment of the middle member of the Beauparlant Formation are hosts for the intrusion and its related mineralization. In the immediate vicinity of the deposit, the host rocks strike approximately 100° and dip gently at 20° to 30° to the north.

The overall form of the intrusion hosting the Allammaq Deposit is dyke-like.  On the geology map and in surface magnetic maps it is distinctly linear and strikes at a low angle to the strike of the host rocks along the west limb of the syncline.  As it passes through the hinge of the syncline it is deflected somewhat into a N-W strike before resuming its E-W strike on the east limb of the fold.    It  is  important  to  note  that  along  the  west  limb,  the  level  of  exposure  of  the  dyke  is essentially along a paleo-horizontal trend, whereas on the east limb it is a vertical section.  In the west limb the dyke is expressed as a peridotite mass, sheathed in pyroxenite at its margins.  The peridotite grades westward into pyroxenite, as the level of exposure gradually moves downward through the dyke.  This is suggestive of a dyke formed with pyroxenite near its base and around its edges, and a core of peridotite with a lower limit approximately 100 metres above the base of the dyke.  In the east limb there is a rapid transition from peridotite to pyroxenite and then to olivine melano-gabbronorite ('hornblende gabbro').

At  the  deposit  scale,  diamond  drilling  reveals  a  much  more  complex  structure  than  can  be observed from the limited amount of outcrop available. There are at least three and possibly four phases of the intrusion, each of which may have been emplaced as completely distinct cooling units along the same zone of weakness that guided the first. See Figures 6.2, 6.3 and 6.4.

The most obvious intrusive unit is observed at surface as the peridotite mesa that gives its name to  the  Mesamax  Deposit  (Allammaq  being  the  name  for  the  deposit  found  along  the  eastern extension of the Mesamax Main grid).  Where this unit has been drilled directly on top of the mesa it is observed to be only a few tens of metres thick, and in the field it can be seen to be surrounded by a sub-horizontal fault that offsets it a few tens of metres from the rest of the dyke. This fault is interpreted as a minor thrust fault, perhaps forming a splay off a more important one that can be followed through the subcrop to the north of the mesa and would be several metres

above the present erosional level at the mesa itself.  Where this unit was drilled on section 2400E in 2002 (MX-02-06), it was found to be composed of peridotite and pyroxenite through a vertical extent of more than 150 metres, terminating downward against metabasalt.

Another intrusive unit is a dyke of hornblende gabbro that was intersected in hole MX-07-42. This dyke was intersected at depth over approximately 20 metres. Contact relations between this unit and the others have not been observed. It may represent an extension of the gabbro dyke that is inferred to underlie the peridotite and has been mapped out toward the east as a possible 'keel' to  the  mineralized  intrusion  or  it  may  be  a  separate  narrow  dyke.  Such  bodies  are  commonly observed near mineralized intrusions in the Nunavik Nickel Project area and although they are considered to be co-magmatic with the mineralization, they do not themselves appear to have any economic potential at the level of exposure at which they manifest themselves as gabbro.

There are two ultramafic intrusive units that carry significant quantities of sulphide mineralization. The upper consists of a trough-shaped mass of pyroxenite which grades upward and  inward  into  peridotite.    This  body  has  a  clearly  defined  base  north  of  and  at  a  higher elevation than the massive peridotite and pyroxenite intersected by hole MX-02-06 as described above.  It therefore appears to represent a separate body, although it may link to the southern body  at a slightly higher structural level than the current level of exposure.  Sulphide mineralization  is  expressed  as  disseminated  to  net-textured  pyroxenite  near  the  base  of  the trough, and locally there are narrow vein-like masses of massive sulphide near the basal contact. Contact relations in drill core include 'hot' contacts with partially melted basalt and sediment as well as clearly chilled blebby pyroxenite contact facies.

The  upper  mineralized  ultramafic  body  locally  cuts  into  the  upper  portion  of  the  lower mineralized  body,  and  where  it  does  so  it  forms  a  chilled  margin  against  the  coarse-grained pyroxenite of the lower body.  In other places the two ultramafic bodies are separated by a screen of metabasalt and metasediment that show clear signs of extensive contact metamorphism.  Most of the upper mineralized ultramafic body is barren; significant mineralization is restricted to a relatively narrow zone near its base (Upper Zone).

In sharp contrast, the lower ultramafic intrusion is almost entirely composed of mineralization (Allammaq  Deposit).  It  generally  has  a  sharp  chilled  pyroxenitic  margin  above  and  below, containing blebby and disseminated sulphides, but this margin grades over less than a metre into net-textured sulphide hosted by pyroxenite that fills almost the entire intrusion in some sections. Accompanying the net-textured sulphides is a considerable amount of massive sulphide, which forms  intersections  up  to  10  metres  thick  and  locally  forms  veins  that  brecciate  the  chilled margin and penetrate into the host rocks.  Locally the upper margin of the lower ultramafic body is marked by a gradation transition from pyroxenite through gabbro to contact-metamorphosed basalt, indicating that a considerable amount of ultramafic liquid may have passed through this small body before it solidified.

## 6.2.2 MESAMAX DEPOSIT GEOLOGY

The  Mesamax  Deposit  is  hosted  by  a  discordant  east-west  striking  subvertical  ultramafic intrusion belonging to the Expo Intrusive Suite.

This  deposit  dips  at  approximately  45°  and  butts  up  against  a  fault  zone.  The  host  rock  is pyroxenite which is surrounded by unmineralized peridotite and slivers of sediment and mafic tuff.  The  massive  sulphide  component  comprises  approximately  one  third  to  one  half  of  the mineralization, while disseminated sulphides account for the remainder. See Figures 6.5 and 6.6.

## 6.2.3 PUIMAJUQ DEPOSIT GEOLOGY

The Puimajuq Deposit is hosted within a near-vertically dipping pyroxenite dyke having a more or less regular shape. The mineralization is generally tabular and vertically dipping but certain drillholes  indicate  an  irregular  bulbous  thickening  close  to  surface  on  at  least  three  25  metre spaced sections. Compared to other deposits on the Property, the massive sulphide component makes up a larger percentage of the deposit compared to the net-textured component. The grades of the Puimajuq Deposit are higher than all the other deposits on the Property. See Figures 6.7 to 6.9.

## 6.2.4 MEQUILLON DEPOSIT GEOLOGY

The geology of the general Mequillon area and the immediate Mequillon Deposit is based on surface  geological  mapping  by  James  Mungall  from  2003  to  2006,  the  interpretation  of geophysical information in areas of poor outcrop, and on the cross sectional interpretation of drill results. The following description of the deposit is taken directly from Mungall, 2003.

The Mequillon Deposit occurs in an ultramafic dike having a very regular form over a strike length of approximately one kilometre as it plunges from its basal exposure in the west to a depth of &gt; 200 metres in the east.  The dike has a peridotite core, grading through pyroxenite to gabbro on the vertical margins.  At the base, the peridotite grades to pyroxenite which persists right to the basal contact with basalt or graphitic schist.  The gabbroic upper contacts are gradational in many cases.  A pyroxene hornfels or hornblende hornfels thermal aureole grades into a gabbroic hybrid  or  rheomorphic  facies  at  the  contact  with  intrusive  gabbro.  There  is  rarely  a  chilled margin  in  these  cases,  but  the  edge  of  the  intrusion  is  gabbroic.  The  gabbro  in  the  margins contains sparsely disseminated sulfides sometimes showing network texture or blebby sulfides with  variable  tenor  but  usually  a  fair  amount  of  chalcopyrite.    The  gabbroic  margin  typically grades  inwards  through  barren  pyroxenite  and  into  very  low-grade  disseminated  sulphidebearing peridotite. In the lower  margins  the gabbro  runs quickly into pyroxenite with disseminated to net-textured sulfides. The hornfels in the base tends to be thinner, possibly due to  thermal  erosion  and  assimilation  of  the  contact  and  consequent  telescoping  of  the  thermal aureole,  but  this  may  in  part  be  an  artifact  of  the  high  angle  at  which  basal  contacts  are intersected.

The lower pyroxenite generally has a blebby contact facies which grades rapidly upward into net-textured sulphide with semi-massive portions and locally ragged massive sulphide veins or large blebs.  In some instances the pyrrhotite in the net-textured rock has recrystallized to form single oikocrysts up to 6 centimetres in diameter surrounding millimetre-scale pseudomorphs of the pyroxene and olivine primocrysts.  The amount of sulphide in the net-textured pyroxenite is steady  for  about  25  to  20  metres  but  then  drops  to  a  rather  lower  value,  accompanied  by  the appearance  of  roughly  1  centimetre  patches  of  sulphide-free  pyroxenite  giving  the  rock  a distinctly  spotty  or  'leopard'  texture.  Above  the  net-textured  pyroxenite-hosted  sulphide  is  a broad zone of pyroxenite grading into peridotite containing disseminated sulphide, locally with a network  texture  but  usually  not  well  connected.  This  unit  contains  abundant  clasts  of  finer grained peridotite, fine-grained dunite, and rare coarse-grained pyroxenite, all of which generally do  not  contain  sulphide  and  which  therefore  substantially  dilute  the  grade.  In  places  this  unit forms a clast-supported  igneous  breccia,  but  in  others  the  clasts  are  rare.  The  generally  clastsupported  texture  persists  over  about  160  metres,  with  some  breaks  into  quiet  domains  of peridotite with disseminated sulphide and rare clasts.

Projecting from the very base of the intrusion there is a sheet like body of moderately to strongly deformed, net-textured pyroxenite and massive chalcopyrite-rich sulphide, showing durchbewegung texture that dips gently to the northwest. The thickness of pyroxenite can drop to as little as a few tens of centimetres, and the sulphide can persist beyond the furthest extent of the  pyroxenite.  The  cataclastic  textures  in  the  sulphide  and  the  presence  of  a  locally  strong foliation in the associated pyroxenite indicate that this tail-like body has been deformed and the massive sulphide has been tectonically transported along the fault. The tail-like body may have originated  as  a  vertical  dike  but  has  been  transposed  into  the  plane  of  a  fault  surface  that  is coincident with a zone of tuffs, volcanic breccia, and graphitic metasediment. The coincidence of

the tail of the dike with the deformed sediments and breccias persists all the way to the surface, where  the  discovery  showing  at  the  western  termination  of  the  dike  outcrop  is  located  in  a narrow  valley  that  is  bordered  or  floored  by  the  same  lithologies.  Although  the  deformation textures  in  this  tail  of  the  deposit  can  be  impressive,  it  is  likely  that  this  fault  served  only  to accommodate  flexural  slip  during  folding  of  the  enclosing  basalt  package,  since  it  does  not demonstrably offset  the  stratigraphy  in  any  way  at  the  map  scale.  See  Figures  6.10,  6.11  and 6.12.

## 6.2.5 EXPO DEPOSIT GEOLOGY

The  geology  of  the  general  Expo  area  and  the  immediate  Expo  deposit  is  based  on  surface geological  mapping  by  James  Mungall  from  2003  to  2006,  the  interpretation  of  geophysical information  in  areas  of  poor  outcrop,  and,  on  the  deposit  scale  on  the  cross  sectional interpretation of drill results.

The local geology is dominated by the northern branch of the EIS, with the Expo Deposit hosted by the northern split of the branch to the north of a large inclusion of sediments. This northern split averages about 200 metres wide on surface, and is trough-shaped in cross section with the southern contact usually steeper (sometimes near-vertical) compared to the shallower, northern

contact. The essentially flat or somewhat undulating bottom of the central part of the trough is usually at a depth of about 100 metres.

There are indications of multiple mineralized ultramafic units at Expo. In addition to the main body described in the preceding paragraph, there is a near-vertical phase below its eastern part (starting on section 10570 E) that may be a feeder to the complex and has been traced by a few drill holes to a depth of greater than 300 metres. It is also in this area that a lower repetition or branch of mineralized peridotite has been encountered on section 10540 E. Due to insufficient drilling, the feeder and the lower branch are presently poorly constrained in their geometry. The occurrence of massive sulphides in more than one 'stratigraphic' position may also be due to multiple ultramafic events.

The  Expo  peridotite  has  adjusted  to  greenschist  metamorphic  conditions  during  subsequent metamorphism.  ' Peridotite  is  almost  invariably  completely  serpentinized,  to  form  a  compact rock  highly  resistant  to  weathering  that  is  deep  maroon  to  brown.  Peridotite  presents  an extremely rough, hackly aspect on weathered surfaces but a smooth dark green to black fresh surface  composed  of  a  fine  intergrowth  of  serpentine  and  chlorite,  dotted  with  grey  tremolite patches. Careful inspection commonly reveals the presence of intercumulus or poikilitic primary hornblende  and  traces  of  sulphides.  The  peridotite  is  generally  strongly  magnetic  due  to  the presence  of  abundant  microscopic  magnetite  crystals  formed  during  serpentinization  of  ironbearing olivine ', (Mungall, 2004). The Expo peridotite is characterized by very high Cr (2500 ppm) and Mg (15%) values, compared to the host rocks at both the Mesamax and the Mequillon Deposits.

Figures  6.13  and  6.14  and  6.15  provide  detailed  Gemcom  cross-sections  at  three  different locations along the trough. The mineralized trough structure shows considerable complexity. At Section  10540  E  (not  shown)  the  trough  actually  comprises  at  least  three  separate  intrusions separated  by  clearly  recognizable  screens  of  meta-sediment  or  well-developed  internal  chilled margins, and is underlain by at least five more separate sills, all of which bear some amount of sulphide mineralization, including two massive sulphide-bearing sills under station 10050 N. The exact  forms  of  the  intrusions  cannot  be  determined  from  the  available  drill  core  information, because many of these bodies have sizes similar to the spacing between drill holes. Figures 6.13 to 6.15 should therefore be taken as a well-constrained illustration of the structural style rather than a faithful representation of reality. A large dike-like body rises up from beneath the main trough and appears to join at between Sections 10540 and 10360 E. This structure may be the feeder for the entire system, but there are not enough data to demonstrate this. Similarly, there appears to be an overall decrease in the number of smaller intrusions under the main trough as one moves westward from Section 10540 E, but this may largely be an artifact of the paucity of deep borehole data in the westerly sections.

The  subhorizontal  blade-shaped  dikes  below  the  main  trough  extend  for  considerable  strike lengths along its base and may have been fed massive sulphide, but there is no direct evidence for this.

## 6.2.6 IVAKKAK DEPOSIT GEOLOGY

The Ivakkak Deposit is located approximately 20 kilometres west of the Mequillon Deposit and is  currently  the  western-most  deposit  for  which  there  is  a  resource  estimate.  The  sulphide mineralization at Ivakkak is hosted in a relatively narrow sill or dyke of peridotite-pyroxenitegabbro composition intruding mafic volcanic rocks and/or a mixed sequence of mafic volcanic and sedimentary rocks, (see Figures 6.16, 6.17 and 6.18). The mineralization consists of massive, net-textured  and  disseminated  sulphides.  Massive  sulphides  are  generally  constituted  of  more than  90%  sulphides;  the  net-textured  type  contains  perhaps  25  to  75%  sulphides  while  the disseminated  mineralization  contains  traces  to  25%  sulphides.  The  massive  and  net-textured types carry sufficiently high base and precious metal concentrations to be of economic interest. The net textured and disseminated types of mineralization are generally of greater volume and extent than the massive sulphides.

The mineral occurrences along the South Trend as well as those of the Raglan Trend to the north belong to the class of magmatic sulphide deposits. The descriptions that follow are cited from the Geology of Canadian Mineral Deposit Types 1995, edited by Eckstrand, Sinclair and Thorpe.

A broad  group  of  deposits  containing  nickel-copper-platinum  group  elements  (PGE)  occur  as sulphur segregations associated with a variety of mafic and ultramafic magmatic rocks. Among such deposits, two main subtypes are distinguishable. In the first, the Ni-Cu sulphide type, nickel and copper are economic commodities contained in sulphide-rich ores that are associated with differentiated mafic sills and stocks and ultramafic volcanic (komatiitic) volcanic flows and sills. The  second  type,  magmatic  PGE  is  mined  principally  for  PGE's  which  are  associated  with sparsely dispersed sulphides in medium to large, typically layered mafic to ultramafic intrusions.

Nickel-copper sulphide deposits are sulphide concentrations that occur in certain mafic and/or ultramafic intrusions or volcanic flows. Nickel is the main economic commodity; copper may be either a co-product or by-product, and platinum group elements (PGEs) are usual by-products. Other commodities recovered in some cases include gold, silver, cobalt, sulphur, selenium, and tellurium. These metals are associated with sulphides, which generally make up more than 10% of the ore.

As a group, magmatic nickel-copper sulphide deposits have accounted for most of the world's past and current production of nickel. International reserves of magmatic sulphide nickel remain large, though they are exceeded by those of lateritic nickel deposits, the only other significant source of nickel.

Most  nickel  sulphide  deposits  consist  of  several  closely  adjacent,  but  discrete  orebodies, therefore the definition of a 'deposit' is rather arbitrary. Individual orebodies may contain from a few hundred thousand to a few million tonnes of ore, and in some instances tens of millions of tonnes of ore. Mining grades are generally about 1 to 3% Ni, but may be higher in some small deposits. Noteworthy exceptions are some of the ore zones in the Talnakh camp of the Noril'sk area, where substantial orebodies average several per cent Ni and greater than 20% Cu.

There  are  four  subtypes  of  this  deposit  and  all  subtypes  have  some  general  similarities.  For example,  the  host  intrusions  in  all  cases  are  either  mafic  or  ultramafic  in  composition.  In addition, most deposits occur as sulphide concentrations toward the base of their magmatic host bodies. Furthermore, all subtypes of nickel sulphide ores usually consist mainly of the simple sulphide assemblage pyrrhotite-pentlandite-chalcopyrite, either as massive sulphides, sulphidematrix  breccias,  or  disseminations  of  sulphides.  Nickel-copper  sulphide  ores  of  any  of  the subtypes that have undergone tectonic remobilization have been converted to similar-appearing sulphide-matrix  breccias.  The  subtypes  differ  significantly  in  their  geological-tectonic  settings and in the geometric form and style of differentiation of the host magmatic bodies. They differ also  in  that  the  magmatic  hosts  in  most  subtypes  are  intrusions,  but  in  the  komatiitic  subtype most are volcanic flows. Furthermore the ores of the various subtypes show some differences in composition, most noticeably in their Ni:Cu ratios.

Although  Eckstrand  (1996)  groups  the  Expo  Ungava  Deposit  with  those  related  to  komatiitic flows and related intrusions, considerable evidence suggests that the deposits located along the South Trend are related to continental or continental margin intrusive suites. The fact that these deposits have nickel/copper ratios of approximately 0.8:1 and are universally endowed in PGE also contrasts with the standard komatiitic model.

According to Mungall (2007), the parent magma of the Paleoproterozoic Expo Intrusive Suite was  a  komatiitic  basalt  with  a  weakly  LILE-depleted  composition.  Neither  the  basalts  of  the Povungnituk Group nor the intrusions  of  the  Expo  Intrusive  Suite  were  emplaced  in  a  rifting environment.  The  Povungnituk  Group  was  emplaced  onto  a  long-lived  passive  continental margin, followed at least 108M years later by the simultaneous intrusion of the sills and dykes that  form the Expo Intrusive Suite and eruption of the lavas of the Raglan Formation. A very strong control on the intrusive style and differentiation of the Expo Intrusive Suite was exerted by its country rocks. Dr. Mungall has also drawn attention to a similar mineralized body sharing many of the characteristics of the Expo Intrusive Suite that is being mined at Jinchuan (Chai &amp; Naldrett, 1992), which might have formed in much the same manner.

## 8.0 MINERALIZATION

Petrographic work by Walker (2004) identified pyrrhotite (FeS) as the main sulphide mineral, followed by pentlandite ([Fe, Ni], S) and chalcopyrite (CuFeS2). Pentlandite occurs generally as a separate mineral and only rarely as exsolution lamellae in pyrrhotite. It appears to be the main cobalt carrier. Magnetite, (Fe3O4) is rare to absent.

The  results  of  more  detailed  mineralogical  work  at  the  Mesamax  Deposit  (Cabri,  2003)  are pertinent  to  Mequillon,  Expo,  Allammaq,  Ivakkak  and  Puimajuq.  At  Mesamax,  accessory sulphides are galena (PbS), sphalerite (ZnS), cubanite (CuFe2S3) and cobaltite (CoAsS). Cabri also  reported  a  large  number  of  platinum  group  minerals  (PGEs).  He  identified  sudburyite (PbSb) and a new Pd2Sb mineral as the principal palladium carriers in net textured and massive sulphides, respectively, and PGE tellurides such as michenerite (PdBiTe), merenskyite (PdTe2), moncheite (PtTe2) and kotulskite (PdTe) as well as  sperrylite  (PtAs2).  Electrum  (a  gold-silver alloy of varying composition) appears to be the main gold carrier.

## 11.0 SAMPLING METHOD AND APPROACH

The previous owner, Canadian Royalties Inc. ('CRI'), began a re-sampling program of old drill core, and re-assay of historic pulp samples for PGE in 2001, once the Property agreement was in place. Due to the positive results obtained from this program, CRI undertook several diamond drilling  campaigns  on  various  targets  from  2002  to  2008,  as  well  as  the  collection  of  grab samples from outcrop and boulders across the Property.

Grab  samples  were  taken  in  the  field  to  characterize  the  host  rock  and  approximate  metal accumulations in obviously mineralized material, and drill core was sampled to determine the metal concentrations in a quantitative way.

The  sampling  method  and  approach  remained  the  same  throughout  the  programs  from  2002 through 2008. The last resource estimates were released in 2009 for the Allammaq and Puimajuq Deposits based on 2008 diamond drilling. No further drilling was undertaken on the Property after the 2008 field season.

## Grab Samples

Geological  mapping,  prospecting  and  collecting  of  individual  rock  samples  ('grab'  sampling) from outcrop or frost-heaved boulders was part of the daily routine in the field.

Sampling  was  focused  on  locating  mineralization  in  outcrop  or  frost-heaved  boulders,  which offer  an  effective  sampling  medium  of  the  sub-crop  geology.  Grab  samples  by  their  nature provide  only  a  characterization  of  any  mineralization  found,  and  being  representative  is  not expected.

Geological  mapping  and  prospecting  were  completed  on  picketed  grids,  and  sample  locations were  referenced  from  the  established  grid  coordinates.  During  reconnaissance  prospecting traverses  off  the  grid  areas,  GPS  units  and  aerial  photographs  were  utilized  to  establish  an accurate  position.  Rock  samples  0.5-1.0  kg  in  size  were  hammered  from  outcrop  and  frost heaved boulders. A unique sample number was assigned to each grab sample, with that unique sample number recorded on the sample bag and a corresponding sample tag placed in the bag.

Coordinates  (grid  and/or  UTM)  for  each  sample  were  recorded,  as  well  as  rock  type,  mineral content, and other relevant observations. A small rock sample from the same site was collected in a separate bag to be stored at the exploration camp for reference purposes. The sample sites are labelled  in  the  field  with  a  sample  number  recorded  on  flagging  tape  so  that  the  site  may  be relocated if required.

Samples are sealed in sample bags with twist ties. The majority of rock samples were examined in camp by the geologists to ensure consistency in mapping, mineral identification and sulphide estimation.  This  information  is  entered  on  computer  spreadsheets.  Samples  were  placed  in shipping bags, tagged and sealed with plastic tie straps for shipping to the assay laboratory.

## Drill Core Sampling

Initially, all core logging and core splitting was completed in a core shack at the Expo Camp. As the years progressed and deposits were discovered east and west of Expo, another camp was set

up at the Mequillon Deposit and core was logged and sampled there as well. All core was logged by  Canadian  Royalties'  personnel.  Discussions  and  observations  by  the  core  loggers  ensured consistent unit identification between them.

The distance between the depth markers added by the drill personnel was measured to check for misplaced markers and for lost core. All logging information was recorded directly into laptop computers. Core intervals identified for sampling were marked with wax crayons, with sample tags placed at the start of a sample interval. The sample length in obvious mineralization was generally  one  metre,  but  individual  samples  were  not  allowed  to  cross  lithologic  contacts  or abrupt changes in mineralization. Core was split in half using a hydraulic core splitter, with a sample tag placed in the bag and the bag sealed with staples. Individual bagged samples were placed  in  shipping  bags.  Where  possible,  contiguous  sample  tag  series  were  used  for  core logging.  Sample  intervals  were  recorded  on  sample  ticket  books,  and  later  recorded  on  the computerized drill logs.

The authors are not aware of any drilling, sampling or recovery factors that would impact the reliability  of  the  core  samples.  The  even  distribution  of  the  sulphides  in  both  the  massive  and disseminated sulphides sampled ensured that the samples were of high quality and representative of the material or mineralization being sampled.

## 12.0 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND SECURITY

Prospecting  rock  samples  and  split  core  samples  were  collected  and  processed  by  personnel contracted by Canadian Royalties. Many of these samples were re-examined in camp, and core splitting was completed under the direction of the project geologist.

Split  core  samples  were  immediately  placed  in  plastic  sample  bags,  tagged  and  recorded  with unique sample numbers. Sealed samples were placed in shipping bags, which in turn were sealed with  plastic  tie  straps.  The  bags  remained  sealed  until  they  were  opened  by  ALS  Chemex personnel in Val-d'Or, Québec.

All samples were stored in the camp to await a scheduled flight. Samples were not secured in locked facilities, this precaution deemed unnecessary due to the remote camp location. Samples were  then  shipped  by  helicopter  to  the  Donaldson  airport  and  loaded  directly  on  a  chartered aircraft for transport to Val-d'Or. Samples were collected at the Val-d'Or airport by Canadian Royalties personnel and delivered to ALS Chemex sample preparation facility in Val-d'Or.

ALS Chemex Laboratories is an internationally recognized minerals testing laboratory operating in  16  countries and has an ISO 9001:2000 certification. The laboratory in Vancouver has also been  accredited  to  ISO  17025  standards  for  specific  laboratory  procedures  by  the  Standards Council of Canada (SCC) .

The split drill core samples were crushed in their entirety to 90% passing 2 millimetres and the crusher was cleaned with barren rock between samples. From the coarse rejects a sub-sample of one kilogram was split and pulverized to 85% passing 75 microns. The pulveriser was cleaned with silica sand between samples.

From  each  such  pulp,  a  100  gram  sub  sample  was  split  and  shipped  to  the  ALS  Chemex laboratory in Vancouver, British Columbia for analysis. The remainder of the pulp (nominally 100 to 150 grams) and the rejects were initially held at the processing lab for future reference, and later transferred to a warehouse held by CRI in Val-d'Or.

The  base  metals  of  economic  interest  (nickel,  copper  and  cobalt),  elements  of  more  general geochemical interest such as arsenic, chromium, iron, magnesium and sulphur, together with 19 additional elements were determined using a 0.25-gram aliquot that was subjected to Geochemical  Procedure  ME-ICP61,  a  four-acid  digestion  followed  by  inductively  coupled plasma  -  atomic  emission  spectroscopy  (ICP  -  AES).  This  method  was  changed  in  2006  to Geochemical Procedure ME-ICP81, (ALS Chemex internal code). This method uses a lithium meta-borate  fusion  to  digest  the  sample,  and  is  more  appropriate  for  the  concentrations encountered for the economic elements.

The precious metals gold, platinum and palladium, were determined by Geochemical Procedure PGM-ICP23, a 30 gram fire assay, followed by ICP-AES. This procedure was changed in 2006 to  Geochemical Procedure PGM-ICP27, which is also a 30 gram fire assay with an ICP-AES finish, but the detection limit is 0.03 g/t Au, Pd and Pt instead of 0.001 for Au and Pd and 0.005 for Pt, making it more appropriate for the grades encountered on the Property.

## 13.0 DATA VERIFICATION

## 13.1 SITE VISIT AND INDEPENDENT SAMPLING

Since 2006, one or more of the authors of this report has visited each of the six deposits at least once and often many times. At each visit, independent sampling of the core was done. Graphs of all the samples taken over the years from 2006 to 2009 inclusively are presented in this section.

## 13.2 HISTORY OF PREVIOUS OWNER QUALITY CONTROL ('QC')

The author of this section has co-authored several reports on the Nunavik Nickel Project for the previous owner from the years 2006 to 2009 and has been responsible for the data verification sections  in  all  of  them.  In  this  section  of  the  current  report,  a  review  of  the  QC  from  2002 through 2008 (the last year for which there are data) is presented.

## 13.2.1  2002 QC PROGRAM

The former Property owner, CRI, began a re-sampling program of sample pulps and drill core from historical holes in 2001 after acquiring the Property. In 2002, the company continued with exploration  and  diamond  drill  programs.  While  the  2002  programs  did  not  include  certified reference  materials,  they  did  include  company  inserted  reference  materials  with  provisional

values for all the elements concerned, and the ALS Chemex internal lab QC for all analytical certificates was examined. A full evaluation of all results was completed by CRI, and the data for the  2002  programs  were  deemed  to  be  of  good  quality.  A  full  discussion  of  the  2002  QC program  is  presented  in  the  report  titled,  'Technical  Report  on  the  South  Trend  Group  of Properties, Nunavik Quebec for Canadian Royalties', authored by H. Thalenhorst and T. Keast and dated May 29, 2003. This report was filed on www.sedar.com. The  author  of  this  section reviewed the data for 2002 and was in agreement with Thalenhorst and Keast that the data were of good quality.

## 13.2.2  2003 TO 2008 QC PROGRAMS

At  the  end  of  the  2002  exploration  program,  a  number  of  'in-house'  or  'property'  standards were prepared from the coarse reject material from Mesamax drill core, for use in subsequent drill programs.

Three  different  reference  materials  were  made:  Net  Textured  (CR-CS02-NT  and  CR-CS03NTv2) and Massive Sulphide (CR-CS01-MS). Initial round robin characterization of the material was done by three different labs.

During  the  next  three  years,  (2003,  2004,  2005)  both  the  net  textured  and  massive  sulphide standards were used systematically for all Nunavik Nickel Projects. Results for the net textured reference material were acceptable, however the massive sulphide standard often demonstrated a low bias in relation to the characterization round robin.

In 2005, H. Thalenhorst of Strathcona Minerals was asked to review the data and control charts for the 2004 and 2005 data. A recalibration of the massive sulphide standard was done at that time.

In 2006, the results from the CR-CS01-MS standard were showing in excess of a 45% failure rate, which is defined as &gt; ± 3 standard deviations from the mean.

It  was  decided  once  again  to  re-calibrate  the  mean  and  standard  deviation  for  the  massive sulphide  reference  material  in  2006.  The  reasoning  behind  doing  this  is  summed  up  in  the following communication with Valerie Murphy, B.Sc., C. Chem., and SGS Minerals Services Quality Control Coordinator.

'It is far more acceptable to calculate the mean and standard deviation with a large data pool over a long time period (even from a single lab) than to use data gathered in a characterization study  that  only  involves  a  few  laboratories.  This  is  not  just  a  more  acceptable  and  rugged practice  for  characterization  studies  but  even  for  certified  reference  materials  as  certificate values  may  be  skewed  and  limited.  Typically,  a  lab  will  generate  large  amounts  of  data  that involve different operators, different days, different environmental conditions etc. to capture the true uncertainty of the material and hence the necessary criteria to set appropriate acceptance criteria.'

The  mean  and  standard  deviation  were  re-calculated  using  standard  procedures  of  trimming values &gt;+/-2 standard deviations prior to determining the final value of these parameters.

Once the massive sulphide reference material was re-calibrated using the pool of data from three years, the analytical results (all from ALS Chemex) fell within the acceptable parameters. This was supported by the fact that the ALS Chemex internal QA/QC showed no failures.

The company was also advised to confirm the quality and reliability of the Reference Material CR-CS01-MS and three different labs were selected for a new round robin.

Results  of  the  new  round  robin  indicated  that  values  for  copper  were  confirmed  with  a  total average  of  the  three  labs  close  to  the  mean  that  was  calculated  from  three  years  of  repeated assaying. Nickel values were represented by a slightly higher mean.

The recalibrated standards were used in 2007 and 2008. In addition to these property standards, CRI also added three certified reference materials to their sample stream.

From 2003 to 2008, blanks and field duplicates in the form of ½ core were also inserted into the sample stream and formed an integral part of the QC program. The author examined the blank data  for  all  years,  and  while  there  were  occasional  values  above  the  threshold  of  three  times detection  limit  for  certain  of  the  elements,  the  grades  in  these  anomalous  blanks  did  not contribute to the metal value in any of the cases.

In  addition  to  the  company  QC  samples,  ALS  Chemex  prepared  and  analyzed  their  own  lab duplicates and inserted their own internal reference standards and blanks. A complete set of the ALS Chemex lab QC data files was obtained and verified.

The author of this section, having been involved continuously with data verification and review from 2005 through 2008, can attest to the fact that the data were of good quality and acceptable for use in all the resource estimates that were produced by CRI.

## 14.0 ADJACENT PROPERTIES

## 14.1 GOLDBROOK VENTURES RAGLAN PROPERTY

Even before the acquisition of CRI, Goldbrook held a vast land position contiguous to the north, east and west of the Nunavik Nickel Project, which is called the Raglan Property.

The Raglan Property was first explored in 1974 by Getty Mining Northeast Ltd. who drilled four holes on the Belanger Prospect. Goldbrook began acquiring the claims that constitute the Raglan Property in 2003, and has been exploring continuously since that time.

From 2003 to  2009,  a  total  of  81,803  metres  of  diamond  drilling  has  been  completed  on  the Property. Goldbrook has also completed AeroTEM airborne magnetic-time domain electromagnetic  surveys,  as  well  as  borehole  EM,  airborne  VTEM  geophysics  and  regional geology, sampling and prospecting.

The Company has discovered to date several Ni-Cu-PGE mineralized zones along a roughly 40 kilometre  trend,  known  as  the  Belanger  Trend.  Currently  five  zones  of  significant  sulphide mineralization have been defined at the Mystery, Getty, Sylvie, Timtu and PAD-1/R2 Zones.

## MYSTERY ZONE

Goldbrook's most important discovery to date is the Mystery Zone which was drilled extensively in  2008 and 2009. Drilling at Mystery suggests a vertical to steeply dipping mineralized zone varying in thickness from approximately 10 to 60 m along a strike length of over 175 metres. It has been drill tested to a vertical depth of over 375 metres.

## TIMTU ZONE

As part of the 2009 exploration program, Goldbrook drilled the Timtu Zone, which was designed to test the potential of nickel sulphides discovered in 2007.

Drilling extended the known Timtu Zone within the ultramafic rocks in hole TIM09-003, as well as what has been termed the 'Copper' zone of approximately eight to ten metres (core length) within the sediments adjacent to the ultramafic footwall. The copper rich zone is characterized by very low nickel and PGE values and is considered a zone of remobilized copper sulphides. Mineralization appears continuous from surface along both limbs of an S-folded peridotite and remains  open  to  depth.  Drilling  east  and  west  of  this  section  also  intersected  Ni-Cu-PGE mineralization, extending the zones to the east and west.

## PAD ZONE

Drilling at Pad consisted of four drillholes at the mid and western portion of the zone which have better defined the sulphide potential and provided needed information for additional exploration of the zone in 2010.

## DELTA NORTHEAST PROSPECT

Historical drillhole data, surface mineralization and potential for additional sulphides at the Delta Northeast  Prospect  were  confirmed  by  2009  drilling.  All  three  drillholes  encountered  Ni-CuPGE mineralization with two holes having intercepts of significant width and grade.

## DRAGON PROSPECT

Two  holes  were  drilled  at  the  Dragon  prospect  to  test  a  surface  showing  and  follow-up  on encouraging  results  in  a  historical  drillhole.  The  results  were  two  short  intersections  of  good grade  nickel  sulphides  which  indicate  sulphide  potential  in  the  immediate  area.  This  prospect will be further tested in 2010.

In 2008, a remote sensing program was undertaken on select portions of the Property, which consisted of a LiDAR (light detection and ranging) survey that was completed over the most explored  part  of  the  Belanger  trend  of  deposits  in  order  to  generate  a  digital  model  of  the earth's surface. A  VNIR  (visible and near infrared) &amp;  SWIR  (shortwave  infrared) hyperspectral survey was completed over large areas of the Goldbrook Property to collect data for visible-thermal imaging of the earth's surface.

A 'SEBASS', a mid-long infrared thermal imaging hyperspectral survey was completed over large sections of the eastern part of the property, along with strips over the western portions. These data are particularly useful in the identification of silicate minerals.

Extensive mapping, prospecting, geochemistry, and a 9,000 km airborne VTEM geophysical survey were completed in 2009.

## 14.2 XSTRATA NICKEL

The deposits of the currently operating Raglan Mine are located along a parallel belt of rocks approximately 15 kilometres to the north of the Nunavik Nickel Project.

The Raglan Trend stretches 55 kilometres from east to west, with a series of many high-grade ore  deposits  scattered  along  its  length.  While  the  general  geology  of  the  South  Trend  and Raglan  Trend  is  similar  with  comparable  sulphide  mineral  paragenesis  and  with  similar sulphide textures, the Ni-Cu ratios are different. The Raglan Trend displays a 3:1 Ni-Cu ratio that contrasts with that of the South Trend, which is generally closer to parity.

Mineralization  at  Raglan  is  associated  with  up  to  nine  separate  peridotite  flows,  which constitute  an  overall  ultramafic  body  that  has  been  identified  along  the  55  kilometres. Deposits along this trend include from east to west the Donaldson, Boundary, West Boundary, 13-14,  5-8,  Katinniq,  East  Lake,  2-3  Zone  and  Cross  Lake  deposits.  The  thickness  of  the sulphide lenses varies from a few metres to a few tens of metres, and the strike length can vary from tens of metres to 200 metres. Production began in April 1998 at Katinniq, which consists of over 20 discrete lenses of massive and disseminated sulphide, which vary in size from 10,000 tonnes to 1.4 million  tonnes  (Falconbridge  Limited,  Website  May  2003).  The lenses  extend  along  an  ultramafic  horizon  1400  metres  in  strike  length,  which  dips  to  the northwest at 45º to 50º. The mineralized horizon has been traced to a depth of 350 metres and is open in that direction.

The  Raglan  operations  consisted  of  open  pits  (which  have  now  been  exhausted),  three underground mines, a concentrator, power plant, accommodation and administration buildings, fresh water supply and fuel storage tanks. The mine site is linked by all-weather roads to an airstrip at Donaldson and to the concentrate, storage and ship-loading facilities at Deception Bay.

The ore from the Raglan mines is crushed, ground and treated at the Raglan mill to produce a nickel-copper  concentrate.  Milling  capacity  is  now  approximately  3,500  tonnes  per  day. Nickel  capacity  at  the  concentrator  is  now  over  28,000  tonnes  of  nickel-in-concentrate  per year.  Xstrata  Nickel  has  expanded  mine  production  to  1.3  million  tonnes  per  year.    The project to further expand capacity to 2.0 million tonnes per year has been shelved indefinitely.

The  concentrate  is  trucked  100  kilometres  to  Deception  Bay  and  then  shipped  via  ocean freighter to Québec City within an expected shipping season of at least eight months of the year, and a minimum of six shipments per year. From there, it is sent by rail to the smelter in Sudbury.  The  smelted  matte  material  is  returned  by  rail  to  Québec  City,  and  then  shipped overseas to Xstrata's Norwegian Nikkelverk refinery for refining into pure metals.

The 2008 versus 2009 production figures are presented in Table 14-5.

While the authors cannot suggest at this point that the GBK deposits will attain the scale of the Raglan deposits in the Raglan Trend, there is an undeniable similarity in host rock, ore genesis, style of mineralization and metallurgy.

## 18.0 CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

## 18.1 CONCLUSIONS

Exploration  of  the  Nunavik  Nickel  Project  area  has  a  long  history  beginning  in  the  general Ungava area since the 1930's. Major discoveries over the years include Falconbridge's Raglan deposits in 1964-66, the Amax Expo deposit in 1967, and the CRI TK, Mesamax, Mequillon, Ivakkak, Allammaq and Puimajuq Deposits from 2001 to 2007.

The  Cape  Smith  Belt  in  which  all  of  the  deposits  of  the  Nunavik  Nickel  Project  lie,  is  an interpreted  foreland  thrust-fold  belt  that  constitutes  the  north-eastern  extension  of  the  TransHudson  Orogen,  an  early  Proterozoic  collision  zone,  which  separates  the  Archean  Superior Province  from  the  Proterozoic  Churchill  Province  (Hynes  and  Francis,  1982;  Hoffman  1990). The Trans-Hudson Orogen includes the Thompson Nickel Belt of Manitoba and the New Quebec Orogen (Labrador Trough) on opposite sides of the Superior Province. The Cape Smith (Ungava) Belt  extends  for  375  kilometres  in  an  east-west  direction  across  the  Ungava  Peninsula  of Nunavik.

The Property is located within the central portion of the assemblage, near the suture separating the  foreland  from  the  hinterland  domains.  The  North  Domain  is  dominated  by  the  mostly volcanic Watts Group, which has been interpreted as an Island-Arc accretionary complex. The South Domain  includes the Lamarche, Povungnituk, and Chukotat Groups, which are collectively interpreted as an extensional sequence consisting mainly of basalts, sediments and ultramafic rocks grading into oceanic crust towards the north. The boundary between the North and  South  domains  is  marked  by  the  regional  scale  Bergeron  Fault,  considered  to  be  a subduction zone.

The geology of all six deposits for which there are currently resource estimates is all essentially the same, though the morphology of each can be very different. It is believed that all deposits are part of the Expo Intrusive Suite, as detailed by Mungall, 2004. The dyke portions within which the  deposits  lie  can  be  essentially  horizontal  to  essentially  vertical,  and  the  proportions  of massive to net-textured to disseminated sulphides can vary greatly.

Early in 2008, Canadian Royalties met several important objectives, including the signing of the Nunavik Nickel Agreement (Impact Benefits Agreement), being issued critical land leases for the four mining leases and the four waste dumps at Ivakkak, Mequillon, Expo and Mesamax, the commencement  of  site  construction  work  and  the  continued  growth  of  its  resource  base. However, later in the year, CRI was materially impacted by the global financial crisis at the peak of construction activity on the Nunavik Nickel Project.

On  August  5,  2008,  CRI  announced  that  activities  being  carried  out  on  the  Nunavik  Nickel Project would begin to transition away from full construction and move towards implementing a care and maintenance program. Effectively, all major construction and engineering work were suspended  as of that date in order to protect the company's  treasury and investment infrastructure.

On January 13, 2010 Canadian Royalties announced the completion of a plan of arrangement between Canadian Royalties and Jien Canada Mining Ltd. under which Jien Canada acquired all of CRI's outstanding common shares in exchange for $0.80 per share and now has 100% interest in the Nunavik Nickel Project. Goldbrook holds a 25% interest in Jien Canada.

## 18.2 RECOMMENDATIONS

Construction of the Nunavik Nickel Project commenced in May, 2008, however since August of that year, the Project has been on care and maintenance.

The Project infrastructure currently consists of:

- • An access-road that links into the existing road-network;
- • Employee housing complex for 300 people;
- • Potable water and waste-water treatment plants;
- • Concentrator foundation with thermosyphons;
- • Temporary shelters for equipment and materials;
- • Detailed concentrator engineering 90% completed;
- • Structural steel, flotation cells and other mill components on site;
- • Long-lead items procured (ball mills etc.).

Prior to resumption of the Project construction, Jien Canada Mining should undertake a detailed engineering  review.  The  budget  necessary  in  order  to  resume  construction  should  reflect  the engineering approach and any variance from the original development plans. An additional 10 Mt  of  resources  are  potentially  available  for  conversion  into  reserves  and  this  should  be considered as well. An amount close to the original estimate of $465 million is anticipated.

Once the Company is satisfied with the current Project economics, construction should resume with the goal of attaining commercial production as soon as possible.
