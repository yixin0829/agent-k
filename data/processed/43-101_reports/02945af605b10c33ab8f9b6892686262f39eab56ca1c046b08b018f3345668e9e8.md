## 1.  SUMMARY

ADEX  Mining  Inc. ('ADEX'),  a  Toronto  based  Canadian  junior  mineral  exploration company, acquired the Mount Pleasant property in 1995.  The property is located in Charlotte County, New Brunswick, and is the site of the past producing Mount Pleasant Tungsten Mine ('MPTM')  which  produced  990,200  tonnes  grading  0.35% WO3  between  1983  and  1985. The company originally traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange ('TSX') under the symbol 'AMG'  but  was  de-listed  from  the  TSX  in  1998  for  failure  to  meet  minimum  listing requirements.

Watts,  Griffis  and  McOuat  Limited ('WGM')  was  retained  by  ADEX  to  carry  out  a technical  review  of  their  Mount  Pleasant  property.    This  report  has  been  prepared  in accordance with the Canadian Securities Administrators' National Instrument 43-101 ('NI 43-101')  governing  standards  for  disclosure  for  mineral  projects  as part of the company's  effort  to  have  the  cease-trading  order  lifted  and  to  engage  in  raising  money  to further develop the property.  The scope of this report is to assess the potential of the known mineralized  zones  and  prepare  an  NI 43-101-compliant  Mineral  Resource  estimate  for  the Fire Tower North and the Fire Tower West portions of the Fire Tower Zone, a WO3-MoS2 deposit, a small portion of which was exploited in the mid-1980s.  The property hosts other mineralized  zones  of  interest,  including  the  tin-indium-bearing  North  Zone.    The  1996/97 Kvaerner Metals Davy Ltd. ('Kvaerner') Feasibility Study and Mount Pleasant Tungsten Mine 1985 Mothball Study were reviewed to determine what use could be made of them and what additional scoping work would be required to allow ADEX to undertake preparation of a new feasibility study.

The  Mount  Pleasant  property  consists  of  102  contiguous  mining  claims  totalling  1,600 ha, located  60 km  south  of  the  city  of  Fredericton.    ADEX  holds  the  surface  rights  for  some 405 hectares  of  the  property.    The  surface  rights  for  the  northern  part  of  the  North  Zone, southern part of the Fire Tower Zone and eastern side of Mount Pleasant are owned by third parties.

ADEX  has  retained  100% ownership  of  the  buildings  and  equipment  remaining  on  the property  with  a  $2.0 million  mortgage  on  the  buildings  held  by  the  Province  of  New Brunswick to  cover  the  cost  of  building  removal  and  rehabilitation.    The  government  also holds a $0.5 million security bond for mine reclamation.

The Mount Pleasant property is located within the Appalachian Orogen of Atlantic Canada just north of the Saint George Batholith.  The eastern portion of the property is dominated by the Mount  Pleasant  Caldera  ('MPC')  and  to  the  west  by  Silurian  to  Devonian  age metasedimentary  rocks.    This  caldera  is  comprised  of  a  multi-layered  granitic  complex (Granite I, II, III) and porphyries and breccias of Mississippian age.  Porphyry-type tungstenmolybdenum  and  tin  deposits  have  been  discovered  along  the  southwestern  margin  of  the MPC.

Tungsten-molybdenum-(bismuth) deposits have been found beneath Mount Pleasant in both the  Fire  Tower  Zone  and  North  Zone.    All  are  hosted  within  Granite  I.    Younger  indiumbearing tin-base metal deposits superimpose the tungsten-molybdenum deposits hosted within Granite II in both zones.  No significant mineralization has been found within the underlying Granite III although this granite has not been fully explored.  All deposits occur within 400 m from surface.

The Fire Tower Zone is dominated by tungsten-molybdenum mineralization occurring within three  distinct  deposits,  the  Fire  Tower  North,  the  Fire  Tower  West  and  Fire  Tower  South. Mineralization occurs as veinlets and as disseminated grains in the breccias hosted within the Mount  Pleasant  Porphyry.    Fine-grained  wolframite  and  molybdenite  are  the  principal minerals  of  economic  interest.    Intense  greisen-type  alteration  (quartz-topaz-fluorite)  is associated with higher grade tungsten-molybdenum zones.

The  Saddle  Zone  is  located  between  the  Fire  Tower  Zone  and  North  Zone.    This  zone contains  an  irregular  distribution  of  tin  mineralization  consisting  of  cassiterite  with  small amounts of tungsten, molybdenite and bismuth hosted within Granite II.

The  North  Zone  contains  five  distinct  indium-bearing  tin-base  metal  deposits  named  the Contact deposit, contact Flank deposit, contact Crest deposit, Endogranitic Zone and the Deep Tin Zone as well as six tin-lode deposits.  The largest tin-base metal deposits occur along the contact of the Granite I or within Granite II.  These deposits superimpose older discontinuous tungsten-molybdenum bodies found within Granite I and breccias.  The shallowest deposit, called the Deep Tin Zone, is hosted within brecciated Granite I.

Since  1954,  the  majority  of  the  exploration  work  has  focused  on  the  development  of  the tungsten-molybdenum deposits of the Fire Tower Zone and the indium-bearing tin-base metal deposits of the North Zone.  Some exploration activities were focused on exploring Hornet Hill  located  1.5 km  west  of  the  North  Zone  for  tin  and  possible  tungsten  mineralization. Hornet Hill is underlain by a fine-grained porphyritic granite that is similar in appearance to the granite porphyry of the North Zone.

Work has consisted of extensive surface and underground drilling programs, bulk sampling and metallurgical work to develop a 'mineral resource' for the Fire Tower Zone and North Zone  deposits.    In  total, 1,330  surface  and  underground  diamond  drillholes  totalling 158,561 m have been drilled, most to delineate the Fire Tower Zone and North Zone.  One of the three holes drilled at Hornet Hill intersected a cassiterite-bearing chlorite vein assaying 0.89% tin over a core length of 3.0 m.  Approximately 90% of this core is currently stored at the minesite.

Surface exploration has included soil and bedrock sampling, ground geophysical surveying, some geological mapping, stripping and trenching activities.  Underground development has included a 1,187 m long access ramp connecting the Fire Tower Zone with the North Zone as well  as  the  excavation  of  several  adits.    All  drillhole  information  and  assay  results  were compiled into a GEMCOM database from 1995 to 1997.  In 1996, Kvaerner was contracted to conduct a Feasibility Study to explore the possibility of mining tin and indium from the North Zone and prepare a 'mineral resource' estimate, which included an audit and verification of ADEX's 'reserve' estimates of the North Zone.  Limited additional surface diamond drilling was carried out to support this study.  There has not been any active field exploration on the property since 1996.

The Mount Pleasant Tungsten Mine, owned 50% by Billiton Exploration Canada Limited ('Billiton')  (as  operator)  and  50% by Brunswick  Tin  Mines ('BTM'),  was  put  into production in September 1983 at a total construction cost of $150 million.  Mining was done by  open  stoping.    The  concentrator  was  designed  to  process  650,000  tonnes  per  year  and produce  2,000-2,500 tonnes  per year  of  70% WO3  tungsten  concentrate  (through  tungsten magnetic separation) and 700-1,000 tonnes per year of 85% MoS2 molybdenum concentrate at 60% recovery through molybdenum leaching steps.  Cost overruns, metallurgical problems and  falling  tungsten  prices  led  to  mine  closure  in  July  1985  after  only  22  months  of

production.  The underground workings were allowed to flood and the mine was placed on care and maintenance.

During  the  production  period,  the  mine  produced  only  990,200  tonnes  of  tungsten  ore,  all from  the  Fire  Tower  Zone,  at  an  average  grade  of  0.35% WO3.    There  was  no  attempt  to extract  molybdenum  or  any  other  metals.    A  total  of  2,000  tonnes  of  tungsten  concentrate graded 70% WO3 was produced.  At the time of closure, the mine reported a total recoverable diluted 'mineable ore reserve' of 6,863,300 tonnes at an average grade of 0.38% WO3 and 0.17% MoS2.  Included in the 'reserve' is an inventory of 800,000 tonnes of broken tungstenmolybdenum material in stopes grading approximately 0.39% WO3 and 0.19% MoS2.  The Fire Tower Zone deposits have not been re-evaluated since the mines closure.

In 1997, Kvaerner estimated a total 'mineable resource' of 3,718,338 tonnes with a grade of 0.662% Sn,  85.72 ppm In,  0.091% WO3,  0.044% MoS2,  0.150% Cu,  0.050% Pb,  0.089% Bi and  0.695% Zn  for  the  North  Zone  using  a  recovery  factor  of  85%,  a  dilution  factor  of 20% and a cutoff grade of 0.1% Sn.    The study concluded that the North Zone deposits were uneconomic due to declining tin prices and high capital costs.

The  historic  'reserves  and  resource'  estimates  noted  above  were  prepared  prior  to  the implementation  of  NI 43-101.    WGM  has  neither  audited  these  estimates  nor  made  any attempt to classify them according to NI 43-101 standards or the Council of the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum definitions ('CIM Standards').  They are presented because ADEX and WGM consider them to be relevant and of historic significance. These estimates should not be relied on.

WGM carried out a site visit to the property, conducted a review of all available reports and data and collected 14 grab samples of outcrop and core samples from the Fire Tower Zone and  North  Zone.    The  independent  WGM  sampling  confirmed  the  presence  of  surface  and underground  tungsten,  molybdenum,  tin,  indium,  bismuth  and  silver  mineralization  and outlined the most appropriate analytical methods to use in future programs.  The drill core analytical results were in good agreement with those obtained by previous operators.

WGM concluded that the historic  drillhole  and  assay  database  for  the  Fire  Tower  Zone  is reliable and that it is suitable for use in the preparation of an NI 43-101and CIM Standardscompliant Mineral Resource estimate.

WGM and  independent  geological  consultant  Trevor  Boyd,  Ph.D.,  P.Geo.,  have  prepared Mineral Resource estimates for the Mount Pleasant Fire Tower West Zone and Fire Tower North  Zone,  which  for  the  purposes  of  this  report  are  collectively  referred  to  as  the  Fire Tower Zone.  A summary of the Mineral Resource estimates is provided below.

In conjunction with the geologically oriented site visit, a WGM engineer examined all of the existing surface mine/mill buildings and equipment.  It was determined that the facilities are in good condition and the underground mine had been stripped of all its infrastructure before being allowed to flood.  Most of the major mill and mine equipment was sold to cover costs such as minesite care and maintenance and some environmental reclamation.

Order-of-magnitude evaluation studies by WGM have determined that the best initial property development scenario would be to pursue development of the tungsten-molybdenum-bearing Fire  Tower  Zone.    WGM  recommends  that  ADEX  carry  out  a  limited  diamond  drilling program to gather material for metallurgical testwork and to enhance the Mineral Resource estimate.

WGM reviewed the Kvaerner study of the North Zone and agrees with the proposed mining methods for exploiting the deposits.  No discussion of economics is possible at this time since there is no defined Mineral Resource, however, at the least, the capital cost estimates used in the Kvaerner study should be updated to reflect current market conditions.  Based on present knowledge, the North Zone appears to be composed of a series of scattered deposits that are not fully understood and require additional definition drilling.  Should a Mineral Resource be determined  for  the  North  Zone  in  the  future,  a  Fire  Tower  Zone  tungsten  circuit  could  be designed to also produce tin and other metals from the North Zone provided a suitable market is found for them.

ADEX is  currently  working  with  the  Province  of  New  Brunswick  to  revoke  a  Ministerial Order issued in 1999 and re-instate their 'Approval to Operate' (allowing water treatment, discharge and monitoring).  In early 2006, an independent engineering firm was engaged by ADEX  to  conduct  a  tailings  dam  study,  which  is  now  almost  complete.    It  has  been determined that a new Environmental Impact Assessment ('EIA') will be required if ADEX wishes to apply for a mining lease to resume mine production.

WGM concludes  that  the  property  is  one  of  merit  and  in  collaboration  with  ADEX  has prepared and recommends a $1,100,000 work plan and budget for Mount Pleasant.

Initial work  will  consist  of  additional  core  splitting  and  assaying  and  completion  of environmental work the tailings dam study and steps will be taken to reinstate the Approval to Operate.

The work plan includes a  four-hole  1,600 m  surface  diamond  drilling  program  on  the  Fire Tower  Zone  to  gather  approximately  600 kg  of  representative  material  for  metallurgical testwork.    Bench-scale  testwork  will  be  carried  out  to  develop  a  preliminary  flowsheet  for recovery of WO3 and MoS2.  The metallurgical testwork and Mineral Resource estimate will be  incorporated  into  a  Scoping  Study  to  evaluate  the  feasibility  of  resuming  tungstenmolybdenum mining operations at Mount Pleasant.

In addition, the potential for near-surface tin-indium above the North Zone will be evaluated. The  North  Zone  drilling  and  assay  database  will  also  be  reviewed  to  determine  what additional drilling is required to enable the preparation of a Mineral Resource estimate for the zone.

Quantitative section (deep penetration) IP surveying is proposed to determine if the tungstenmolybdenum mineralization  is  continuous  between  the  Fire  Tower  Zone  and  Saddle  Zone, and to explore for deeper mineralization beneath Granite II.  This surveying will also be used to explore for additional mineralization at Hornet Hill.  IP surveying may also be useful in conjunction with the evaluation of near-surface tin-indium potential.

It is further recommended that ADEX implement a quality assurance/quality control program for  all  future  analytical  programs,  employing  standardized  analytical  methods  and  check assays to be completed at a second ISO-certified laboratory.

## 2.1 INTRODUCTION

In 1992, ADEX Mining Inc. ('ADEX') was formed as a junior mining company from the amalgamation of Adonis Resources Inc. and Belex Mining Corp. after which it commenced operations  and  began  trading  on  the Toronto  Stock  Exchange ('TSX').    ADEX  initially focussed on properties located in the United States in search of oil and gas through a now closed subsidiary ADEX Resources Corp.  ADEX also owned the mining claims and mineral rights  to  other  Canadian  properties  in  the  Northwest  Territories  and  Quebec  as  well  as international  properties  in  the  Philippines  and  Guyana.    Since  then,  these  properties  have either been sold or the licenses have been allowed to expire.  At this time, ADEX still holds a 10% interest  in  two  mining  leases  (F27153,  F27159)  at  Aylmer  Lake  in  the  Northwest Territories.  These two mining leases are not the subject of this report.

ADEX acquired a 100% interest in the Mount Pleasant property from Piskahegan Resources Limited ('Piskahegan') in 1995.  The property is located at Mount Pleasant, New Brunswick, Canada,  and  is  the  site  of  the  past  producing  Mount  Pleasant  Tungsten  Mine.    The  mine closed in 1985 due to dropping tungsten prices and metallurgical problems and was placed on care and maintenance.  There has been only sporadic exploration activity conducted since the mine's closure as the company searched for strategic partners or development proposals.

There has not been any active field exploration on the property since 1996.

## 2.2 TERMS OF REFERENCE

Watts,  Griffis  and  McOuat  Limited ('WGM') was  retained  by  ADEX  to  carry  out  a technical review of their Mount Pleasant property and to prepare a report in compliance with Canadian Securities Administrators' National Instrument 43-101 ('NI 43-101').  This report has been prepared as part of ADEX's  effort to have a cease-trading order (dated May 27, 1998) by the Ontario Securities Commission lifted and to engage in raising funds to further develop the property.  The Company was de-listed from the TSX for failure to meet minimum listing  requirements.    Prior  to  the  cease  trade  order,  the  shares  traded  under  the symbol 'AMG'.

The scope of this report is to assess the potential of the known mineralized zones and prepare an  NI 43-101-compliant  Mineral  Resource  estimate  for  the  Fire  Tower  North  and  the  Fire Tower West portions of the Fire Tower Zone, a WO3-MoS2 deposit, a small portion of which was exploited in the mid-1980s.  In addition, this report is to provide an initial discussion of the  potential  for  development  to  restart  the  Mount  Pleasant  property  as  a  producer  of tungsten-molybdenum and/or tin-indium.  ADEX provided its GEMCOM database to assist with the Mineral Resource estimate.  It was also necessary to determine which one of the two significant,  but  different,  mineral  deposits  should  be  given  the  highest  priority  for  future exploration  and,  if  feasible,  mine  development  work.    Furthermore,  it  was  necessary  to determine what preliminary scoping work would be required to enable ADEX to undertake preparation of a feasibility study, whether it be a new one or an update of the ones carried out by Mount Pleasant Tungsten Mine ('MPTM') Mothball study prepared following the mine closure  or Kvaerner  Metals  Davy  Ltd. ('Kvaerner')  for  ADEX  in  1996/97.    This  report contains recommendations for a work program and budget to accomplish these objectives.

## 2.3 SOURCES OF INFORMATION

WGM  Senior  Associate  Geologist,  Paul  Dunbar,  P.Geo.;  and  Senior  Associate  Mining Engineer, Andrew Hara, P.Eng.; visited the Mount Pleasant Tungsten Mine property between November 8 and November 10, 2005.  During this period, the authors carried out a review of all available data and information on the property.  All information, such as previous reports, maps,  assays  and  original  data  files,  are  currently  stored  at  the  minesite.    Additional information was provided by Mr. Gustaaf Kooiman, Consulting Geologist to ADEX and by independent  geological consultant Dr. Trevor Boyd,  who  is  currently supervising the exploration activities for ADEX.  Both Dr. Boyd and Mr. Kooiman attended the field visit by WGM and Mr. Boyd has visited the site on other occasions.  Mr. Kooiman lives nearby in the town of St. George, New Brunswick, and has had more than 25 years of experience working at Mount Pleasant.  He was the geologist for previous operator and owner, Billiton and was the  contract  geologist  for  Piskahegan.    Kooiman  has  also  published  several  papers  on  the Mount Pleasant deposits (see References).

One day was spent touring the immediate minesite area visiting the main surface showings and  reviewing  the  geology  exposed  in  outcrop  at  the  Fire  Tower  and  North  Zones. Mr. Andrew Hara also toured the mine buildings to review previous operations and to conduct an overview of equipment still on the minesite.  Mr. Paul Dunbar spent one day at the core

shack  examining  the  drill  core  from  previous  drilling  programs.    Grab  samples  of  surface showings  and  mineralized  core  were  collected  to  independently  verify  the  nature  of  the mineralization encountered.

ADEX provided a copy of the GEMCOM digital database containing all previous drillhole data.    They  also  provided  claim  status  information,  digital  copies  of  their  reports  (when available) and hard copies of various company/government correspondence.

A  complete  list  of  the  material  reviewed  is  provided  under  References  at  the  end  of  this report. Copies of selected reference material are available for review at the WGM office in Toronto.

## 2.4 UNITS AND CURRENCY

Assay  and  analytical  results  for  the  precious  metal  silver ('Ag')  are  quoted  in  grams  per metric tonne ('g/t', 'g Ag/t'), parts per million ('ppm Ag') and gold ('Au') is reported in parts per billion ('ppb Au').  Analyses for tungsten ('W'), molybdenum ('Mo'), tin ('Sn'), indium  ('In'),  bismuth  ('Bi'),  zinc  ('Zn'),  copper  ('Cu'),  lead  ('Pb')  and  ('As')  are reported  in  parts  per million  ('ppm')  and/or  weight  percent  as  % WO3  (tungsten  oxide), % MoS2  (molybdenite),  % W,  % Mo,  % Zn,  % Cu,  % Pb  and  % As.    To  obtain  % WO3, multiply the % W by the conversion factor 1.2611.  The % Mo is calculated as 60% of the % MoS2.  Percent WO3 and MoS2 for all WGM analyses were calculated by the laboratory using their conversion figures.

For some of the historical work, ounces per ton ('opt') are quoted for various assay results. In  these  cases,  metric  conversions  have  been  applied  to  maintain  consistent  units  when possible using 1.0 troy ounce per short ton = 34.2857 grams per tonne (34.2857 ppm).  When previous  drill  data  has  been  reported  in  imperial  units,  the  drillhole  measurements  are converted to metric units with lengths converted using 1.0 m = 3.28 feet.

Metric units are used throughout this report and all dollar amounts are expressed in Canadian funds unless indicated otherwise.

Currency units are Canadian dollars ('C$') unless noted otherwise.  As of mid-June 2006, the exchange rate was C$1.10/US$.

## 2.5 DISCLAIMER

This report or portions of this report are not to be reproduced or used for any purpose other than  to  fulfil  ADEX's  obligations  pursuant  to  Canadian  provincial  securities  legislation, including disclosure on SEDAR, and if ADEX chooses to do so, to support a public financing, without WGM's prior written permission in each specific instance.  WGM does not assume any responsibility or liability for losses occasioned by any party as a result of the circulation, publication or reproduction or use of this report contrary to the provisions of this paragraph.

## 3.  RELIANCE ON OTHER EXPERTS

Currently,  ADEX  exploration  activities  are  being  carried  out  under  the  supervision  of independent consultant Dr. Trevor Boyd.  Mr. G. Kooiman is a geological consultant working on a monthly retainer to ADEX.  Mr. Kooiman has worked on the Mount Pleasant property over the last 25 years.  WGM has relied on information and first hand accounts of previous exploration activities provided by these individuals and Trevor Boyd has contributed directly to the preparation of the Mineral Resource estimate.

The WGM site visit/tour was conducted by Mr. Kooiman.  WGM has relied on information provided  by  Mr.  Kooiman  as  to  the  location  of  previous  diamond  drillholes  and  detailed history of mining operations, bulk sampling, trenching and stripping activities.

WGM has relied  on  technical  reports  and  data  provided  by  ADEX  as  well  as  assessment reports from companies that have previously explored the property; documents filed with the government and hard copies of reports, maps and documents provided directly by some of the previous operators.  ADEX has reviewed a draft copy of this report for accuracy prior to the finalization of this report.

WGM has not conducted a formal 'title search' to verify the validity of the mineral claims held by ADEX and has relied on data provided by ADEX for this purpose.  These data are presented for information purposes.

## 4.  PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION

## 4.1 GENERAL

WGM has relied on the list of claims provided by ADEX and has relied on information about the  status  of  each  claim  from  the  New  Brunswick  Department  of  Natural  Resources  and Energy  website  and  correspondence  from  the  Mining  Recorders  Office,  Minerals  and Petroleum Development Branch.

The Mount Pleasant property is located in Charlotte County, New Brunswick, approximately 60 km south of Fredericton, 65 km northwest of Saint John and 35 km north of St. George at latitude  45°26' Ν and  longitude  66°49'W  (Figure 1).    The  entire  land  package  consists  of 102 contiguous mining claims covering approximately 1,600 ha (Figure 2, Table 1).

The claims are held in two groups.  Claim group 1505 (claim tags 337950-338014, 338019338051) consists of 98 claims and group 1510 (claim tags 338015-338018) consists of four claims.    The  claims  are  held  under  prospecting  license  14338  by  ADEX  Minerals  Corp.,  a 100% owned subsidiary of ADEX.  In January 1989, Hughes Surveys and Consultants legally surveyed the perimeter of each of the two claim groups.

In New Brunswick, there are annual work requirements that must be completed on claims to keep  mining  claims  in  good  standing  otherwise  the  claims  lapse.    All  of  the  claims  are currently  in  good  standing.    Group  1505  has  annual  work  requirements  of  $61,000  and expires on February 2, 2007.  ADEX reports that a reserve of $37,000 is available for future renewals on this group.  Claim group 1510 has annual work requirements of $2,400 and also expires  on  February 2, 2007.    ADEX  reports  that  there  is  a  reserve  of  $1,600  available  for future renewals on this group.  Additional exploration expenditures will be required in 2006 for renewal in 2007 for both claim groups.

The  annual  renewal  fee  for  the  mining  claims  is  $3,060.  The  fees  are  fully  paid  until February 2, 2007.

## 4.2 SURFACE RIGHTS

ADEX no longer holds  the  surface  rights  for  the  entire  property.    The  company  currently holds  the  surface  rights  covering  approximately  405 hectares  including  the  area  of  the minesite  and  mill.    During  late  2003  and  2004,  surface  rights  covering  approximately 800 hectares  were  sold  to  several  new  owners.  ADEX  provided  a  1:10,000  scale  surface rights map to WGM for review covering the ground surrounding the immediate minesite area, the  tailings  compound  and  western  and  central  portions  of  Mount  Pleasant  itself  and  its deposits.  What is apparent from this map is that the surface rights held by others are tightly truncated to the actual minesite and the surface rights to portions of the deposits are no longer owned by ADEX.  The surface rights for the Saddle Zone, the northern half of the Fire Tower Zone and northern part of the North Zone are held by ADEX (see Figures 2 and 7).  The rest of  the  Fire  Tower  Zone,  the  North  Zone  and eastern side of Mount Pleasant are owned by third parties including the province.

There is a right of way for the Province to have access to a fire tower, located at the top of Mount Pleasant, and for New Brunswick Power for the power line.  In addition, there is a 50-year lease  to  farm  blueberries  on  the  property  held  by  Bridges  Brothers  Inc.  (Piskahegan Resources Limited, 1995, ADEX Mining Corp., 1995).

## 4.3 ROYALTY PAYMENTS

A  document  by  D.M.  Fraser  Services  Inc.  (1994)  indicates  that  a  royalty  payment  in  the amount of $0.10 per ton  of  ore  mined  is  payable  to  Mount  Pleasant  Mines  Limited.    This royalty is payable yearly on a non-cumulative basis out of net net profits (the definition of 'net net profits' appears to be more or less the equivalent of industry standard 'net profits'), if and when net net profits are made.  Adex has no original documentation to confirm or deny the existence of this royalty.

## 4.4 MINE/MILL BUILDING AND EQUIPMENT OWNERSHIP

ADEX has 100% ownership of the buildings and equipment remaining on the property, which changed ownership from Piskahegan in 1996.  The Province of New Brunswick still holds a $2.0 million mortgage on the buildings as security to cover the costs of building removal and contouring (ADEX Mining Corp., 1995).  In addition, ADEX has a $0.5 million security bond posted with the New Brunswick government for mine reclamation.

## 5.  ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE AND PHYSIOGRAPHY

## 5.1 ACCESS

The  Mount  Pleasant  property  is  located  in  southwestern  New  Brunswick    The  minesite  is accessible  by  all-weather  roads  from  either  Fredericton,  80 km  by  road  north  of  Mount Pleasant, by road from the small town of St. George, 38 km by road to the south, or 97 km by road from Saint John.

The  property  can  be  accessed  by  proceeding  60 km  west  of  Saint  John  on  Route  1  to provincial highway Route 785 (Beaver Harbour turn off).  Then travel north 33 km on Route 785 (mainly an asphalt road with intermittent gravel) passing a paper mill.  Stay left at the fork in the road at 33 km on Route 785.  The mine gatehouse is an additional 4 km after the fork.

Route 785 is maintained on a year-round basis by the province and is the main access route to the mine property and was used for the transportation of concentrates from the mine to the port of Saint John and the eastern United States seaboard.  The New Brunswick/Maine border is located approximately 80 km to the southwest by road.

## 5.2 CLIMATE

The  majority  of  information  regarding  climate  reported  herein  has  been  gathered  form  the Environment  Canada  internet  website.    The  regional  climate  is  best  described  as  modified continental  with  short,  warm  summers  and  long,  cold  winters.    Topography  has  little influence  on  New  Brunswick's  climate.    The  month  of  January  is  the  coldest  in  New Brunswick and July is the warmest.  On average, thunderstorms occur between 10 to 20 days a year with only one thunderstorm a year severe enough to produce hail.  Tornadoes are rare. Winds  blow  predominantly  from  the  west  and  northwest  in  the  cold  months  and  from  the south and southwest in the warm months.

In  the  summer,  the  daytime  highs  range  between  20  to  22°C  but  inland  temperatures  can reach  25°C  and  higher.    Temperatures  have  exceeded  37.8°C  on  occasion.    The  interior

highlands record about 120 cm of rainfall a year.  Fog occurs on more than one quarter of the days of the year, 35% of the time during the month of July.  Summer wind speeds average 12 to 15 km per hour.  In the summer and fall, storms pass through the Bay of Fundy northeast through the Strait of Belle Isle.  At least one heavy rainstorm accompanies weakened tropical storms and hurricanes affect southern New Brunswick every one or two years.

The January mean temperature is around -7.5°C with inland temperatures experiencing very cold winters especially in areas of high altitude.  Frigid temperatures are not infrequent with extreme lows of -30 to -35°C every winter  Southern sections of the province receive 200 to 300 cm of snow, less than 20% of their annual total precipitation. Winter storms frequently bring rain to the Fundy coast and snow to the interior.  Freezing rain is a hazard on about a dozen or more days a year.  Wind speeds average 15 to 20 km per hour in winter although some winter storms can pack strong winds with snow often changing to rain.  Many of these storms  originate  from  either  the  North  Pacific  or  the  Gulf  of  Mexico.    Along  the  Fundy shoreline, 140 to 160 frost-free days occur on average whereas in the central highlands there are less than 90 days.

Geological  mapping,  soil  geochemical  surveys,  trenching  and  rock  stripping  programs  are best carried out during the months of May to October.  However, ground geophysical surveys and drilling programs can be conducted year round.  Winter drilling can be advantageous for ease of crossing active streams or water sheds as many of these water bodies are frozen solid during the winter season.

## 5.3 LOCAL RESOURCES AND INFRASTRUCTURE

Saint  John,  the  largest  city  in  New  Brunswick  with  a  population  of  around  70,000,  is  the second largest port in Atlantic Canada.  This major seaport is ice-free all year and is located around 80 km by road from the minesite.  Today, this industrial city is dominated by pulp and paper,  oil  refining  and  light  manufacturing.    When  the  Mount  Pleasant  Tungsten  Mine operated from 1983 to 1985, tungsten ore concentrate was regularly shipped via Route 785 to Saint John for shipments to Europe.  Concentrates could also be transported via Route 1 west to potential U.S. customers.

The  City  of  Fredericton  with  a  population  of  around  49,000  is  located  north  of  Mount Pleasant (Government of New Brunswick, 2005).  This city is the provincial capital and home to the University of New Brunswick.

The Mount Pleasant area is not heavily populated.  Labour forces could be recruited locally from the Saint John, St. George, St. Stephen and Fredericton region as well as the Bathurst Mining Camp located in northeastern New Brunswick.  As there is no town at the minesite, mine personnel would most likely live in the nearby town of St. George.

There are commercial airports located at Fredericton (Oromocto) and Saint John.  The closest railway line runs from Saint John through Fredericton Junction northeast of Mount Pleasant to the city of Montreal, Quebec (see Figure 1).

Fresh water is abundant in the region.  Water for the mine is supplied from a pump house located  on  nearby  Piskahegan  River  to  a  storage  reservoir  on  the  hillside  above  the  mill (Billiton, 1985a).

Electric  power  is  supplied  to  the  minesite  by  the  New  Brunswick  transmission  grid.    The supply is delivered at 128 kV and is transformed to 4,160 V and 600 V to feed equipment.

## 5.4 PHYSIOGRAPHY

Southern New Brunswick is characterized by low-lying hills and gently rolling topography with  hills  sloping  down  to  tidal  marshes  at  the  edge  of  the  Bay  of  Fundy  (McLeod,  1990; Environment Canada, 2005).  Mount Pleasant is approximately 370 m above sea level, some 230 m above the valley floor, and is one of the highest points in southern New Brunswick.

The  Mount  Pleasant  area  has  been  heavily  glaciated  and  has  low  relief  characterized  by narrow  ridges  and  wide  valleys.    Outcrop  exposure  is  poor.    During  Pleistocene  glacial erosion  and  deposition,  the  drainage  pattern  became  disrupted  and  consequently  there  are numerous small lakes and ponds that formed during the Late Wisconsinian deglaciation time. A prominent southeast-trending drainage pattern by fairly small streams and rivers parallels the direction of glacial movement.

Very little of the land in the area is suitable for agriculture although there is some marketable timber in the region.  Many of the highland areas are dominated by hardwoods (dominantly sugar  maple).    Mount  Pleasant  itself  was  previously  timbered  so  little  marketable  timber remains on the ground with surface rights held by ADEX in the immediate vicinity of the mine.    The  lowlands  are  dominated  by  softwoods  (predominantly  balsam  fir)  in  poorly drained ground such as the Hatch Brook and Piskahegan River areas.

## 6.  HISTORY

## 6.1 GENERAL

A review paper summarizing all historical work conducted previously on the Mount Pleasant property has been provided by Mr. G. Kooiman, consulting geologist to ADEX.  Text from Kooiman's report  entitled  '20 year  Summary  Report'  has  been  reproduced  below  with  his permission (Kooiman, 2004).  Additional information has been provided from other reports and documents provided by ADEX to complete this review.

WGM did not conduct an independent assessment file search of the Department of Natural Resources and Energy Mineral Branch databases since a considerable amount of information was available from reports and documents supplied by ADEX.

The Mount Pleasant property has a long history of exploration and development.  The focus of exploration over the years has shifted from tin-base metals ('tin lodes') from 1954-1969, to  porphyry  tungsten-molybdenum-bismuth  deposits  (1969-1985),  to  porphyry  tin  deposits (1985-1991) and back to tin-base metals (1991-2004), and now to include indium which is an important  component  of  the  mineralization.    All  of  the  historical  work  completed  on  the property has been summarized in Table 2.

## 6.2 EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT

## 6.2.1 TIN-BASE METAL DEPOSITS (1954-1969)

Tin-base  metal  mineralization  was  first  discovered  in  the  area  in  1937  on  Kedron  Brook located approximately 9 km west of Mount Pleasant.  However, this occurrence of small tinand zinc-bearing quartz veins was non-economic and created little interest.

The Mount Pleasant area was first staked in 1954 by Geochemical Associates and optioned to Selco  Exploration  Limited ('Selco')  following  a  stream  sediment  and  subsequent  soil survey for base metals, which indicated the possible presence of copper and lead mineralization located on the east side of Hatch Brook Valley and on the west flank of Mount Pleasant

(Parrish and Tully, 1976).  This occurred at the time of the large base metal discoveries in the Bathurst Camp located in northeastern New Brunswick.  Selco conducted geological studies and ran a vertical loop electromagnetic ('EM') survey and a reconnaissance radiation survey. A massive boulder of löllingite (FeAs2) was found near the fire tower.

Selco drilled four packsack drillholes to test a geochemical anomaly and preliminary 'Geiger Counter'  radiometric  surveys  were  completed  in  the  vicinity  of  the  Fire  Tower  Zone. However, none of the drillholes intersected any significant metallic mineralization and it was concluded that the mineralized zones themselves showed only background radioactivity.  As a result,  the  property  was  returned  to  Geochemical  Associates  in  July  of  1955.    In  1956, Kennco Exploration (Canada) Limited ('Kennco'), the Canadian subsidiary of Kennecott Copper  optioned the property and drilled ten holes but results were again disappointing and , the option was dropped.  The Geological Survey of Canada ran an aeromagnetic survey of the area  in  May,  1956  (Map  #593G,  Parrish  and  Tully,  1976).    This  survey  determined  that Mount  Pleasant  is  located  on  the  side  of  a  large  aeromagnetic  high.    Furthermore,  it determined that magnetic surveys would be of little help in outlining mineralized zones on the property.    Geochemical  Associates  allowed  the  claims  to  lapse  in  1958.    The  provincial government ran the first geological mapping program through the area that same year.

Renewed interest came with the discovery of in-situ gossanous outcrop material higher up on Mount Pleasant.  Samples of this material contained base metals and high amounts of tin.  In 1959, MPML was formed and it re-staked the property and Kennco re-optioned the property and re-assayed all the old geochemical samples and included the elements tin, molybdenum, copper and lead (Parrish and Tully, 1976).  Additional claims were staked followed by the first  ground  induced  polarization  ('IP')  survey  to  be  conducted  on  the  property.    The  IP Survey identified  two  broad  north-south  trending  anomalies,  one  which  coincided  with  the Fire Tower Zone and the other with the Saddle area.  Both geophysical anomalies correlated fairly well with previously identified anomalous soil values.  IP surveying was followed by the drilling of 24 shallow holes in 1960.  Drilling intersected tungsten, molybdenum and tin mineralization.    However,  because  the  mineralization  could  not  be  followed,  and  with Kennco's exploration policy shifted to mostly Western Canada, the option was dropped.

From  1960  to  1965,  MPML  completed  surface  stripping  (120  m )  and  trenching,  soil  and 2 bedrock  sampling,  ground  geophysics  (IP,  seismic,  self  potential  ('SP')),  magnetic  and gravity  surveys),  surface  diamond  drilling  (Fire  Tower  Zone),  metallurgical  testing  of  drill

cores, detailed geological investigations, extensive underground development and underground sampling and drilling programs (Parrish and Tully, 1976; Kooiman, 2004).  IP surveying was conducted by McPhar Geophysics Ltd. over all of the Fire Tower area, Saddle area and North Zone as well as reconnaissance surveys in the area west of Hornet Hill.  A total of eighteen IP anomalies was identified.  Follow-up diamond drilling indicated that the IP anomalies could not be directly related to the main molybdenum, tungsten, bismuth zones but were most likely related to the cap rock-type disseminated mineralization.

Ground  magnetic  surveys  over  the  North  Zone  and  Fire  Tower  areas  did  not  locate  any significant  magnetic  anomalies.    On  the  North  Zone,  results  indicated  that  silicified  zones showed  up  as  weaker  magnetic  background  readings  and  that  chloritized  zones  stood  up above background.  The provincial government conducted a mapping program of the area in 1963.

The exploration work by MPML outlined widespread but erratic tin-base metal mineralization in the northern part of the property (the North Zone) while surface diamond drilling near a fire tower encountered many mineralised intersections with varying amounts of tin, tungsten and  molybdenum.    MPML  drove  a  1,465 m  adit  (the  600  adit),  where  some  of  the underground drilling  took  place,  and  from  1963-64  outlined  a  number  of  tin-bearing  lodes (the Open Pit Zone).  At that time, it was difficult to establish a geological model for the tinbase  metal  mineralization  at  Mount  Pleasant  as  similar  deposits  were  not  known  in  New Brunswick or anywhere else in Canada.

From 1961 to 1962, several SP and resistivity measurements, both on surface and in diamond drillholes,  were  completed  in  the  North  Zone  and  Saddle  Zone  areas  (Parrish  and  Tully, 1976).  Several weak anomalies were located within the Saddle area but data collected from the  North  Zone  were  inconclusive  possibly  due  to  the  wide  spread  of  sphalerite.    In  May 1963, a 100-ton bulk sample was collected from the North Zone (?) for testing.  A feasibility, development and 'reserve' study based mostly on the North Zone results was completed in 1964.  A gravity survey was conducted over the 600 adit in August of 1965 to try to prove the vertical continuity of the #1 and #3 tin lodes.  The results were inconclusive indicating that tin-base metal lodes might be reflected by low gravity values.  Some exploration work was completed on the #7 tin lode as well.  However, work abruptly stopped when MPML ran into financial problems.

The  property  lay  dormant  until  mid-1967  when  the Sullivan  Mining  Group ('Sullivan') began exploration for tin and copper in the Fire Tower Zone.  Sullivan followed up on some excellent diamond drill intersections by driving two exploration adits.  The 750 adit (1,330 m long) and the 900 adit (194 m long) were driven 2.4 by 2.4 m into the Fire Tower North Zone. Only  small  replacement-style  mineralized  bodies  were  found.    Additional  geophysical  and geochemical work was carried out in 1968 (Parrish and Tully, 1976).

## 6.2.2 PORPHYRY TUNGSTEN-MOLYBDENUM-BISMUTH DEPOSITS (1969-1985)

Sullico Mines Limited, which became part of the Sullivan Mining Group in 1969, optioned the property in 1967.  In 1968, exploration activities focused to the Fire Tower Zone area with the intersecting of tungsten, molybdenum and bismuth mineralization by drillhole MPS 39.

In  1969, Brunswick Tin Mines ('BTM') was formed as a joint venture between Sullivan (78%) and MPML (22%).  That same year, deeper surface diamond drilling discovered large porphyry-type  tungsten-molybdenum-bismuth  zones  in  the  Fire  Tower  Zone.    By  1971,  a 'resource' had been outlined for the Fire Tower Zone with additional 'resources' outlined in the North Zone and Deep Tin Zone in 1972 (see Section 17.0, Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve  Estimates).    All  exploration  attention  was  now  focused  on  the  large  porphyry deposits.

IP  surveying  was  completed  on  adjoining  areas  in  Hatch  Brook,  Niles  Brook,  Beach  Hill, Little Mount Pleasant, McDougall Lake and the East Group area in 1970 (Parrish and Tully, 1976).  Weak anomalies attributed to contact pyritic and graphitic mineralization were located in the Niles Brook and Hatch Brook areas.  The strongest anomaly was identified on the East Group where drilling intersected significant tin mineralization.  Drill testing of a second IP anomaly at Little Mount Pleasant intersected some zinc mineralization.

In 1971, an X-Ray Fluorescent Spectrometer ('XRF') was set up in St. Stephen by BTM and all  core  and  other  materials  were  assayed  using  this  equipment.    The  surface  of  Mount Pleasant was re-mapped and a second IP survey completed.  Exploration shifted to the Deep Tin Zone in 1972 and the #4 tin lode near surface.  An 815-ton bulk sample was collected from  the  750  adit  (North  Zone).    During  1972,  a  preliminary  ground  EM  survey  with  an EM-16 unit was conducted within the Saddle area and Hornet Hill.

BTM drove the 400 adit into the higher grade portion of the Fire Tower West Zone in 1973 to delineate it and to obtain a bulk sample.  Exploration drifts were established on the 30.5 m (100 ft above sea level) level (the 900 adit) and extensive underground diamond drilling was undertaken.  Surface diamond drilling was also completed as well as 1,500 m of underground development.

In 1974, MPML dropped its ownership in BTM to 11% due to its inability to provide its share of  exploration  funding.    BTM  completed  metallurgical  studies  and  in  1976  completed  a feasibility  study  for  a  tungsten  mine  at  Mount  Pleasant  based  on  the  'reserves'  in  the  Fire Tower  Zone  and  then  started  to  actively  search  for  another  partner  to  help  develop  the property.

In November, 1977, Billiton Exploration Canada Limited ('Billiton') formed a 50/50 joint venture  ('JV')  with  BTM  (Sullivan  89%,  BTM  11%)  establishing  the  Mount  Pleasant Tungsten Mine.  The JV gave Billiton the right to undertake a full Feasibility Study and earn a  50% interest  in  the  property  by  putting  it  into  production  (Billiton  Canada  Ltd.,  1985a). Arrangements were made to dewater the 400 decline and the 30.5 and 314.0 m (100 foot and 1,030 foot) level workings to mine a 10,000-tonne bulk sample in the core of the Fire Tower West body.  The sample was shipped to Sullivan's Nigadoo River Mine where a continuous mill test was carried out to evaluate the recovery of wolframite and molybdenite by flotation (Billiton  Canada  Ltd.,  1985a).    Strathcona  Mineral  Services  Limited  was  contracted  to compile the Feasibility Study, which was completed in 1979.  With the outlook for tungsten prices being favourable, a decision to proceed to production was made at a design capacity of 650,000 tonnes  mined/milled  per year  (see  Section  17.0,  Mineral  Resource  and  Mineral Reserve Estimates).

Mine/mill construction commenced  in  April  1980 with a total construction cost of $150 million (Billiton Canada Ltd., 1985a). Underground operations started in December 1982, with the start up of the primary crusher.  Sales of the tungsten (wolframite) concentrate  began  in  December  1983.    A  total  of  14,478 m  of  underground  drilling  was completed to delineate the tungsten-molybdenum zones between 1981 and 1985.  In 1984, mine production was reduced to 325,000 tonnes per year.

The mine experienced numerous setbacks including cost overruns, metallurgical difficulties and falling tungsten prices and resulting poor profitability, which eventually led to the mine

being permanently closed in July 1985.  During the mining operation from 1983 to 1985, a total of 990,200 tonnes of tungsten ore was milled.

After  the  mine  closed,  Sullivan  dropped  its  interest.    MPML  reverted  their  shares  in  the company to a royalty based on $0.10 per short ton of ore mined.

## 6.2.3 PORPHYRY TIN DEPOSITS (1985-1991)

Mount  Pleasant  Tungsten  Mine  geologists  re-logged  most  of  the  surface  and  underground diamond drill cores drilled by BTM.  In the summer of 1981, they recognized that significant tin mineralization in the North Zone occurred in a less altered, fine-grained granite underlying and  intruding  more  intensely  altered  older  rocks.    As  most  of  the  budget  went  to  further outlining and sampling of the tungsten-molybdenum zones, it was not until the spring of 1984 that Billiton made funds available for a tin exploration program in the North Zone.  A total of 4,767 m  of  diamond  drilling  was  carried  out  in  1985.    All  twelve  holes  in  this  program intersected  significant  tin  mineralization  in  the  contact  Crest,  adjacent  contact  Flank  and within the Endogranitic Zone, the latter hosted by a younger intrusive of fine-grained granite.

Site  visits  by  several  leading  experts  on  tin  geology  confirmed  the  significance  of  the discovery.  Dr. R.G. Taylor and Dr. P.J. Pollard of the Tin-Tungsten Research Unit of James Cook University of North Queensland, Townsville, Australia, concluded their visit report by saying that 'it should be realized that to establish 2-3 million tonnes of good grade 'reserves' (0.8-1.0% Sn)  is  an  extremely  difficult  task  and  this  potential  seems  obtainable  at  Mount Pleasant,' (Taylor and Pollard, 1985).  Dr. K.F.G. Hosking of Camborne, Cornwall, U.K, also inspected the key drill cores and sections from the North Zone and was similarly impressed by the drilling results stating that 'the zone was a very promising tin prospect'.

After the closure of the tungsten mine, Billiton started to actively search for a joint venture partner  to  further  explore  the  tin  deposits  of  the  North  Zone.    Of  the  eight  major  mining companies that presented bids, Lac Minerals Limited ('LAC') became the preferred partner. Approximately $6.5 million was spent between 1985 and 1988 to drive a 1,187 m long access drift from the Fire Tower Zone to the North Zone, conduct underground drilling to delineate the zone(s) of tin mineralization and to produce a feasibility study.

The  'Lac-Billiton  Tin  Project' started in October  1985,  with  LAC  as  the  operator, notwithstanding the collapse of the International Tin Council cartel, which saw tin prices drop from US$17.50/kg to US$5.50/kg.  The project completed 2,101 m of development, which included a 3.5 m by 5.0 m, 1,187 m long access ramp, which started from the 1020 level of the service ramp of the Fire Tower Zone to the North Zone.

The joint  venture  completed  25,377 m  of  surface  and  underground  diamond  drilling.    Two bulk samples totalling 2,582 tonnes were excavated from the Contact Crest and Endogranitic Zone and processed in the bulk sample tower on surface.  Some 280 tonnes were shipped to Lakefield Research ('Lakefield') for metallurgical test work.  The remaining material was stored in the 'A-frame' building on site where it remains today.

In 1987, J.S. Redpath Mining Consultants Limited of North Bay, Ontario, prepared a threevolume report on ore handling alternatives for tin ore from the North Zone.  Pilot plant testing was completed on bulk samples collected from the Endogranitic Zone and the Contact Crest deposit.

However, by the end of 1987, the tin price was still hovering in the US$5.50-$6.50/kg range, well below the US$11.00/kg required for a positive production decision.  As a result, LAC put the tin project on hold and the underground workings were allowed to flood.  The plant and  equipment  were  placed  on  a  care  and  maintenance  program.    Some  equipment  was reallocated to operating properties or sold.

During  1988,  LAC  continued  its  exploration  for  other  tin  deposits  on  the  property  with  a modest budget of $250,000 plus government funding (MISP programs).

An IP survey was carried out over the northeast quadrant of the mine property covering an area of 4.0 km .  A six-hole surface drilling program started in June 1988, and was completed 2 in October of that same year.  LAC terminated its exploration activities by the end of 1988.

In  October,  1989, Novagold  Resources  Inc. ('Novagold')  optioned  the  property  from LAC/Billiton.    Novagold  completed  a  three-hole  diamond  drilling  program  in  the  Saddle Zone and conducted metallurgical work on the tin mineralization based on a new flowsheet to investigate the North Zone as a potential polymetallic mineral deposit.  Novagold completed

initial metallurgical studies on the removal and processing of the sulphide mineralization to recover tin, indium, zinc and copper (ADEX Mining Inc., 1995).

Novagold also commissioned a study by Cominco Engineering Services Limited ('Cominco') who developed a flowsheet to produce a 50% tin concentrate at an 80% recovery rate. As part of this study, a total of 30 tonnes of samples for metallurgical test work were shipped to Lakefield, Cominco of Vancouver, British Columbia and the Federal Government's  CANMET  research  facility  in  Ottawa.    In  1990,  Novagold  initiated  a  tin feasibility study by WGM with involvement of Davy Canada Inc. as well as a mineralogical study of 40 core samples.

In 1992, Novagold allowed their option to lapse due to financial constraints.

## 6.2.4 TIN-INDIUM-BASE METAL DEPOSITS

Due to low tin prices and a bleak outlook for significant price recovery, exploration efforts focused on the other metals associated with tin mineralization.  Novagold became seriously interested  in  the  presence  of  indium  in  1991  after  visits  by  indium/bismuth  experts  of  the Geological Survey of Japan and the U.S. Bureau of Mines who provided very useful insight into the geology of indium-bearing deposits, metallurgy and production figures/applications for the indium industry as a whole.  A sampling program was initiated in November 1991, and was eventually completed with assistance of the New Brunswick Department of Natural Resources and Energy ('DNRE').    Around  500  samples  were  analyzed  for  indium.    The Geological  Survey  of  Canada ('GSC')  also  participated  in  the  1991/1992  program  by analyzing  over  100  samples  of  mineralized  and  unmineralized  rocks  from  the  Fire  Tower West Zone.  Prior to the 1991/1992 program, only about 50 indium assays were available.  In addition, only a few hundred semi-quantitative assays were carried out during the 1970s.

In the spring of 1992, the property reverted back to LAC due to Novagold's failure to secure senior  financing  or  find  a  partner  to  advance  the  project.    Ongoing  interest  in  indium  and bismuth  by  the  Japanese  and  Europeans  prompted  DNRE  to  take  on  a  proactive  role  in promoting the property, assisting in technical matters and facilitating meetings with potential investors.

In early 1993, Drew and McKeown began negotiations for the property.  Due diligence work was carried out by WGM and samples shipped to Lakefield and Cominco.  DNRE produced a promotional  video  on  Mount  Pleasant.    A  bismuth-bearing  concentrate  was  shipped  to SIDECH.  During a trade mission to Germany and Belgium, led by then-Premier McKenna, a meeting was held with the principals of SIDECH in Brussels in April 1993.

In  December  1993,  Piskahegan  with  Drew  and  McKeown  as  principals,  purchased  the mine/mill  complex  and  the  mineral  rights  for  Mount  Pleasant  from  Billiton  and  LAC. Piskahegan continued to develop the metallurgical processes for the treatment of tin-sulphides from the North and Deep Tin Zones and prepared a new pre-feasibility study.  A deal was struck with a local contractor to clear-cut most of the forest that covered Mount Pleasant in order for the company to meet its financial obligations.

Piskahegan quickly recognized the importance of indium as a co-product in any future mining operation and over 2,000 samples of previously drilled core were analyzed for indium.  The investigation  confirmed  the  widespread  occurrence  of  indium,  in  particular  in  the  tin-zinccopper-rich deposits.

A five-hole diamond drilling program was completed in 1995 to test indium, zinc and copper mineralization within the Fire Tower Zone.  Drilling intersected a new small zone called the Scotia Zone and determined that the Fire Tower Zone contained a tin-bearing zone as well as good indium, zinc copper values.

In September 1994, D.M. Fraser Services Ltd. prepared a report for Piskahegan reviewing the feasibility  of  producing  tin,  indium,  base  metals  and  rare  earth  metal  from  the  property utilizing all work conducted on the property since 1987.

Finally,  in  January  1995,  a  100 kg  sample  was  shipped  to Research  and  Productivity Council ('RPC') of Fredericton, New Brunswick to start bacterial inoculums for bioleach test work.

## MINING/MILLING OPERATIONS

## 6.3.1 FIRE TOWER ZONE

The Mount Pleasant Tungsten Mine was put into production in 1983 at a total construction cost of $150 million.

Mining started in the Fire Tower West orebody after two declines were completed between 1981 and 1982 (Billiton Canada Ltd., 1985a).  These declines provided access to the orebody at the north end of the Fire Tower West and Fire Tower South Zone.  The Service Ramp runs from  the  surface  to  the  955  level  (the  1,000 m  mine  level  equals  sea  level)  averaging  a 15% slope and was used for transportation of mine personnel, materials and waste haulage. The Conveyor Ramp is 940 m long, 625 m at an 18% slope and 315 m at a 25% slope and runs from the underground crusher on the 935 level to the surface portal.

According to Billiton Canada Ltd. (1985) mining records, the underground operations started in  December 1982.  The primary method employed at Mount Pleasant was transverse long hole  open  stoping  with  primary  and  secondary  extraction.    The  ore  extraction  was  done without backfill.    Some  of  the  stopes  were  large  and  in  excess  of  several  thousand  tonnes. The mine levels were laid out at 30 and 70 m intervals.  However, during the initial stages of production it was determined that shrinkage mining was essential to provide additional stope support  due  to  ground  movement  in  one  of  the  pillars.    Additionally,  vertical  slicing  was replaced by horizontal slicing using vertical crater retreat ('VCR') techniques.

The mine was designed to produce 650,000 tonnes of tungsten-molybdenum ore per year with a  manpower  level  of  77  underground  employees.    During  the  short  production  period (1983-85) the underground productivity averaged 50 tonnes per manshift.  In 1984, the total minesite  manpower  level  was  235  employees.    Prior  to  the  operation  shut  down,  the manpower level dropped to 155 employees and production was reduced to 325,000 tonnes per year.

Selling  and  shipment  of  the  tungsten  concentrate  began  in  December  1983.    The  tungsten concentrate was  sold exclusively to Billiton Metals and Ores International BV,  the Netherlands (Billiton, 1985a).  Long-term supply contracts were in place with European and

U.S. customers.  The concentrate was delivered in 250 kg drums or one-tonne bags.  Lots of 18-22 tonnes were transported in containers by truck/ship to Europe or by truck to the U.S.

However, the mine was plagued by set backs.  During construction of the mine, the tungsten price dropped to US$12.50/kg and dropped even further in subsequent years.  Severe capital cost overruns, from an original $89 million to over $150 million, in addition to metallurgical difficulties  made  for  a  bleak  outlook  for  the  property.    By  1984,  the  price  of  tungsten  had dropped further to US$8.40/kg.  In November of that year, the company decided to reduce output to 325,000 tonnes per year and manpower was reduced from 256 to 155 employees.

In July 1985, the mine was closed permanently due to poor metal prices and the resulting poor profitability  and  metallurgical  problems  after  less  than  2 years  of  production.    A  total  of 990,200 tonnes  of  'tungsten  ore'  was  milled  from  1983  to  1985  (see  Section  17,  Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserve Estimates).  Tungsten was the only metal recovered in the plant.  No attempts were made to run the molybdenum recovery circuits.

The main mine is currently flooded to the portal level of the access ramps.  Kvaerner Metals Davy Ltd. (1997) estimated that de-watering will take 24 weeks.

## 6.3.2 NORTH ZONE

The  North  Zone  was  never  been  mined  by  any  of  the  previous  operators.    The  proposed mining methods have been summarized below. As with all mineral deposits, mining methods are dictated by the deposit geology, size, shape and orientation.

Billiton proposed access to the North Zone would be via the over-900 m long drift from the Fire Tower West of a 1,200 m decline from surface starting a distance of about 600 m north of the mill (Billiton Canada Ltd., 1985).  They proposed that the Deep Tin Zone could be mined using  the  same  methods  used  at  the  Fire  Tower  Zone.    The  Contact  Crest  mineralization would  require  a  modified  slice  and  bench  or  sub-level  retreat  method.    The  more  steeply dipping Contact Flank mineralization might be amenable to blast-hole stoping or blast-hole shrinkage if it had a regular shape, or cut-and-fill if strike and dips were found to be erratic. The Endogranitic mineralization could be mined by a room and pillar layout using top-slice and bench methods or blast-hole retreat with remote mucking.

Piskahegan  proposed  using  sub-level  caving  ('SLC')  as  its  main  mining  method  for  the Endogranitic Zone and contact deposits (ADEX Mining Corp., 1995).  Some blasthole stoping would be employed on the Endogranitic Zone but blasthole could be the main mining method for the Deep Tin Zone because the mineralization was interpreted to be one mass.  SLC was proposed because it was considered a low cost mining method.  However, this technique has a high  dilution  factor  (21%)  especially  in  narrower  veins.    Blasthole  stoping  was  considered  a low-cost mining method and in the Deep Tin Zone less dilution (15%) was expected because the mineralization was in one mass.  VCR mining was also proposed where applicable.

Kvaerner Metals Davy Ltd. (1997) recommended a mixture of SLC and long hole stoping at a rate of 2,500 tonnes/day for the extraction of ore from the North Zone and Deep Tin Zone. SLC would be used for 90% of the deposits and long hole for the remainder.

## 6.3.3 MINE/MILL BUILDINGS AND EQUIPMENT

The principal buildings on the site are the Administration Building, Warehouse, 'A' Frame', Ore Storage Shed, Concentrator, Core Storage and Cold Storage buildings (ADEX Mining Inc.,  1995).    On  the  first  floor,  the  administration  building  accommodates  the  mine  and geological offices, change rooms and lamp room.  On the second floor, offices were reserved for management and for the human resources and accounting departments.  ADEX sold most of the milling equipment to raise money for property and title maintenance.

The ore bins contain an unknown amount of uncrushed ore and there are twenty-five 205 litre drums containing historic bulk-sample material from the Fire Tower Zone securely stored in the warehouse.

## 7.  GEOLOGICAL SETTING

## 7.1 REGIONAL GEOLOGY

The Mount Pleasant area has been mapped on a regional scale by Bailey et. al  (1877), Tupper (1959), Laughlin (1960), Clark (1972), Ruitenberg (1963), Van de Poll (1963), Harris (1964) and Tremblay (1965).  A regional geological map is presented in Figure 3.  Outcrop exposure on the property is around 10%.

The Mount Pleasant deposits are located in southern New Brunswick within the Appalachian Orogen  in  eastern  Canada.    These  deposits  occur  within  gently  dipping  Late  Devonian Piskahegan  Group  volcanic  and  sedimentary  rocks  that  are  the  remnants  of  a  large epicontinental caldera complex (Sinclair et al, 2005).

The  regional  geology  in  the  mine  area  is  dominated  by  the  Mount  Pleasant  Caldera,  the exposed part  measuring  approximately  13  by  17 km  (ADEX  Mining  Corp.,  1995).    Multiple layered granitic intrusive rocks and associated mineralization at Mount Pleasant were emplaced along  the  southwestern  margin  of  the  caldera  complex.  This  structure  occurs  within  the northern extension of the Appalachian geosynclinal belt and is situated on the southeast flank of New Brunswick's Central Basin (ADEX Mining Inc., 1995).

The Piskahegan Group rocks of the caldera are undeformed and were emplaced in an orogenic or post-collisional, pre- to syn-extensional setting following the Acadian Orogeny mountain building event, which occurred from Silurian to Middle Devonian time period (Sinclair et al., 2005;  Sinclair,  1994).    This  caldera  is  bounded  to  the  east  and  west  by  isoclinally  folded Ordovician  and  Silurian  turbiditic  greywacke  and  slate  of  the  Silurian  Waweig  (Charlotte Group) and Flume Formations and calcareous sandstone and to the south by the late-Silurian to Devonian diorites and granite rocks of the Saint George Batholith.  The northern portion of the  caldera  is  overlain  unconformably  by  Upper  Mississippian  to  Pennsylvanian  Hopewell Group  red  sandstone  and  conglomerate  and  in  turn  by  Pictou  Group  sandstone  and conglomerate (Gowdy, 1995).

Late Devonian volcanism and granitic emplacement were associated with deformation of the Acadian  Orogeny.    Pre-Acadian  Orogeny  tectonic  forces  formed  northwest  and  northeast

<!-- image -->

trending wrench faults controlling the emplacement of stocks northwest of the Saint George Batholith and subvolcanic intrusions within the Mount Pleasant caldera.

The  Saint  George  Batholith  is  a  northeast-trending  post-orogenic,  composite  batholith  that developed  and  was  emplaced  along  major  structures  at  the  junction  of  the  Avalon  and St. Croix terranes during Late Silurian to Late Devonian time (McLeod, 1990).  This batholith intrudes  rocks  ranging  in  age  from  Late  Precambrian  to  Early  Devonian.    Emplacement postdated  the  deformation  event  associated  with  the  Acadian  Orogeny  and  preceded  major northeast-trending and north- to northwest-trending faults that were active at the end of the Acadian Orogeny.

## 7.2 LOCAL GEOLOGY

The  best  geological  map  of  the  property  was  produced  by  Billiton  Exploration  Canada Limited in 1985.  Since then, the property has never been mapped in detail. The interpretation of the geology at Mount Pleasant in and around the deposits has been obtained from diamond drilling information.

Brunswick Tin Mines completed some reconnaissance geological mapping during the 1969, 1970 and 1971 field seasons around the area known as Little Mount Pleasant and the Sunday Lake  area  (Parrish  and  Tully,  1996).    In  1972,  additional  mapping  at  a  scale  of  1  inch  to 40 feet  was  completed  of  surface  outcrops,  trenches  and  benches.    There  was  also  some geology mapping of the 900, 750, 400 adits development.

Mount  Pleasant  represents  the  volcanic  remnants  with  both  vent  and  conduit  fillings  of  a mineral-rich  volcanic  eruptive  centre  located  along  the  southwest  margin  of  the  Mount Pleasant  Caldera  (Figure 4,  ADEX  Mining  Inc.,  1995).    This  eruptive  centre  has  a  marked topographic expression reaching 370 m above sea level, or 230 m above the valley floor.

At Mount Pleasant, the caldera is comprised of Piskahegan Group rocks of Late Devonian age consisting  of  three  ash  flow  layers  of  rhyolitic  pyroclastic  rocks  referred  to  as  the  QuartzFeldspar Porphyry that are separated by two discontinuous units of sedimentary breccia (up to 100 m  thick)  that  forms  the  western  boundary  of  the  caldera,  a  feldspar  porphyry  and metasedimentary  rocks  of  interbedded  red  conglomerate,  sandstone  and  shale  (Sinclair  et  al, 2005; Billiton Canada Ltd., 1985b).  These ash flow tuffs of the Piskahegan Group probably

<!-- image -->

originated from the numerous vents in the caldera.  All rocks within the caldera generally dip about  10  to  15°  to  the  northwest  except  along  the  margin  of  the  Mount  Pleasant  Caldera where they dip at 15 to 50° toward the centre of the caldera (Sinclair et at, 1988).

The caldera rocks have been intruded by a line of cupolas of granitic rocks with associated breccias (collectively named the 'Mount Pleasant Porphyry') that outcrop at the North Zone and Fire Tower Zone and an intermediate Saddle Zone that does not reach surface.  It should be noted that little information has been provided on the 'Little Mount Pleasant' cupola that occurs at depth to the south of the Fire Tower Zone.  At the Fire Tower and North Zones, crosscutting breccias and associated intrusive rocks form irregular, roughly vertical pipe-like complexes  that  were  centres  of  subvolcanic  intrusive  and  related  hydrothermal  activity (Sinclair,  1994).    The  intrusive  rocks  were  probably  emplaced  at  depths  of  1.0 km  or  less. These cupolas, comprised of dominantly brecciated and altered volcanic vent material host the  tungsten-molybdenum  and  tin-base  metal  mineralization  on  the  property.    These  clastsupported breccias are complex with extensive hydrothermal alteration and were most likely formed from multiple episodes of explosive brecciation related to magmatic fluid overpressures developed in the crystallizing, fluid-saturated granitic magma.

Three  distinct  intrusions  have  been  identified  underlying  the  volcanic  rocks  at  Mount Pleasant, designated Granite I, Granite II and Granite III, which underlie the North Zone and Saddle Zone.  Granite I and II appear to most closely correlate with the fine-grained granite and granite porphyry of the Fire Tower Zone, but they are separate intrusions.  Granite III and porphyritic granite appears to represent different parts of the same intrusive body (Sinclair, 1994).

Structurally,  the  Mount  Pleasant  volcanism  is  marginal  to  and  controlled  by  radial  and peripheral faulting associated with the Mount Pleasant Caldera (ADEX Mining Inc., 1995). Faulting  is  present  in  the  Mount  Pleasant  area  as  northwest-southeast-trending  breaks  that appear to post-date deposit formation and redistributed the mineralized zones and displaced some of the mineralization (Atkinson et al, 1981). A major fault structure known as the Fire Tower Fault has displaced  the  Fire  Tower  North  Zone  some  150 m  to  the  east  of  the  Fire Tower West Zone (Strathcona Mineral Services Limited, 1979).  The trace of this fault was intersected in the 400 decline where it dips 81° to the northeast (Parrish and Tully, 1976).

## GEOLOGY OF THE FIRE TOWER ZONE

The host rocks in the Fire Tower Zone consist of a complex suite of magmatic-hydrothermal breccias that crosscut volcanic and sedimentary rocks (Figure 5, Sinclair et al, 2005).  These breccias  form  an  oval-shaped  pipe  consisting  of  angular-shaped  clast-supported  breccias  to matrix-supported  breccias  containing  rounded  fragments.    The  fragments  are  mainly  of volcanic rocks.

This  pipe  is  underlain  by  the  oldest  fine-grained  granite  intrusive  in  the  Fire  Tower  Zone. Both  the  pipe  and  granite  are  crosscut  by  an  irregularly  distributed  younger-stage  granite porphyry.  A coarser-grained porphyritic granite underlies the Fire Tower Zone at depth and represent the youngest granite intrusion.

## 7.2.2 GEOLOGY OF THE NORTH ZONE AND SADDLE ZONE

The North Zone marks the site of an eruptive centre characterized by complex breccias and subvolcanic  intrusive  rocks  that  occupy  an  oval-shaped  vertical  pipe  about  250  by  300 m across  (Figures  4  and  5,  Sinclair  et  al,  2005).    The  hydrothermally-altered  breccia  is composed of fragments of quartz-feldspar porphyry, feldspar porphyry and granitic rocks that are intruded and underlain at depth by the Granite I, Granite II and Granite II intrusive rocks. These granites are similar mineralogically, chemically and texturally to the three phases in the Fire Tower Zone: fine-grained granite, granite porphyry and porphyritic granite, respectively. Therefore,  the  contact  relationships  between  these  granites  are  difficult  to  determine.    The unaltered granite consists of quartz, K-feldspar, plagioclase and chloritized biotite (Sinclair, 1994).  Fluorite is a common accessory mineral and topaz occurs locally.  A third mineralized zone, the Saddle Zone, has no associated breccias and the related granitic rocks are not exposed at surface.

Granite I is  the oldest intrusive phase in the North Zone and is extensively altered (for the most part) and brecciated (Sinclair et al, 2005).  It also occurs under the Fire Tower Zone in association  with  porphyry,  low-grade  tungsten-molybdenum  mineralization.    This  granite appears to have been emplaced at approximately the same time as the initial development of the breccia pipe and formation of the tungsten-molybdenum zones.

<!-- image -->

Granite  II is similar mineralogically to Granite I and  is altered through  pervasive sericitization and chloritization.  This granite occurs in the North Zone, the Saddle Zone and with the porphyry in the Fire Tower Zone (Billiton Canada Ltd., 1985a). Tin mineralization is generally associated with Granite II.

Granite II contains comb quartz layers consisting of parallel to sub-parallel layers in which quartz crystals are oriented roughly perpendicular to the plane of layering.  These layers are an example of Unidirectional Solidification Textures ('USTs') associated with fluid-saturated and/or undercooled magmas (Sinclair, 1994).  USTs, sometimes referred to as 'brainrock', are a distinctive feature restricted mainly to Granite IIB near the IIA contact area and have proved invaluable to deciphering the local mine geology (Gowdy, 1995; Billiton Canada Ltd., 1985a).  In the Saddle Zone, Granite II forms a cupola of granite composed of two plutonic phases,  the  upper  Granite  IIA  and  lower  Granite  IIB  (see  Figure 4  and  the  following paragraph).  Comb quartz layers typically occur near the upper contacts of both Granite IIA and Granite IIB.

Two  separate  phases  of  Granite  II  have  been  identified,  the  Granite  IIA  phase  (granular porphyritic zone) cut by a younger fine-grained granular phase called Granite IIB.  Granite IIA is located in the upper part of the breccia pipe.  Granite IIB occupies the well-defined protrusions or cupolas in the lower part of the pipe, its contact defined by the formation of comb quartz layers (see Figure 5).  Indium-bearing tin-base metal zones in the North Zone are associated primarily with the Granite IIB.  Granite IIB is underlain and cut by Granite III, the third  and  youngest  granite,  which  was  emplaced  under  relatively  quiescent  conditions  and does  not  contain  any  significant  mineralization.    The  contact  between  these  two  intrusive units  is  marked  by  chill  zones,  aplitic  layers  or,  in  some  cases,  by  zones  of  USTs,  either comb-quartz  layers  or  dendritic  unidirectional  feldspar  crystal  layers,  another  type  of  UST (Lac Minerals Limited, 1988).

Granite III is generally relatively fresh, massive and slightly coarser grained than Granites I and II.  It extends to the south and is most likely continuous with the porphyritic granite that underlies the Fire Tower Zone (see Figure 5).  To date, no significant 'mineral resource' has been  identified  within  this  unit  but  it  has  not  yet  been  fully  explored  (Akerley,  1996; Piskahegan Resources Limited, 1995; ADEX Mining Corp., 1995).

## Hornet Hill

Hornet Hill is located around 1.5 km west of the North Zone and is a pronounced topographic feature  peaking  at  180 m  above  sea  level  (see  Figure 4).    The  hill  is  outlined  as  a  distinct radiometric anomaly and is composed of argillaceous metasediments underlain by Mississippian chloritized, silicified and topaz-bearing porphyry which are intruded by a finegrained porphyritic granite at depth (Parrish and Tully, 1976; Billiton Canada Ltd., 1985b). Drilling has not intersected any significant fault structures.

## 8.  DEPOSIT TYPES

## 8.1 GENERAL

The mineral deposits of Mount Pleasant are unique as they are the largest known tin-tungstenbismuth occurrences in the Canadian Appalachian (Parrish and Tully, 1978).  Furthermore, they are prime examples of a combined porphyry-tungsten and porphyry-tin deposits hosted within  Devonian  age  volcanic  rocks  that  are  not  noted  for  such  mineral  deposits.    A description of the deposit types is provided below focussing on tungsten, molybdenum, tinbase metal porphyry deposits at Mount Pleasant, which have been the principal exploration target since the 1930s.

The  North  Zone  tin  deposits  have  marked  similarities  to  many  of  the  world  tin  porphyry deposits.    However,  at  the  time  of  the  discovery  of  the  tin-base  metal  mineralization  by Brunswick  Tin  Mines  in  1967,  it  was  difficult  to  establish  a  geological  model  for  the mineralization as similar deposits were not known in New Brunswick or elsewhere in Canada. Comparisons  were  made  with  hypothermal-type  orebodies,  those  of  Cornwall,  England,  or xenothermal-type Bolivian deposits (Kooiman, 2004).  It was determined that the tin-bearing lodes  within  the  North  Zone  had  characteristics  similar  to  some  of  the  Cornish  tin  lodes (Kooiman et al., 1986: Kvaerner Metals Davy Ltd., 1997).

Hosking (1985) concluded that the North Zone tin deposits were similar in a broad geological setting to Bolivian porphyry  deposits, excluding the very rich tin lodes, which  are characteristic  of  the  Bolivian  deposits.    He  explained  that  the  exo-  and  endo-tin  deposits associated  with  the  apices  of  granitoid  cusps  were  common  and  well-documented  with examples  occurring  at  Sadisdorf  (Germany)  and  Zinnwald  or  Cinovec  (Czechoslovakia), Queensland  and  New  South  Wales,  Eastern  Mongolia  and  elsewhere.    Furthermore,  he suggested that the apex of a granitoid cusp, which has been emplaced in quartz-porphyry at Zinnwald  may  broadly  reflect  what  was  presently  indicated  in  the  North  Zone  granite. Hosking (1985) cautioned that it would be misleading to forecast likely tonnages and grades for  the  North  Zone  by  considering  tonnages  and  grades  of  other  deposits  based  on  their similarities to the North Zone.

The  Contact  mineralization  within  the  North  Zone  has  been  compared  to  granite-related greisen tin deposits such as such as Cinovec, Krupka and Krasno in Czechoslovakia and the German  Democratic  Republic  (Billiton  Canada  Ltd.,  1985b).    Average  tin  contents  in  the strongly  greisenized  zones  are  of  the  order  of  0.1-0.3% Sn.    The  Sn:W  ratio  varies  from 1:1 (Krupka) to 5:1 (Krasno) and 10:1 (Cinovec).

## 8.2 PORPHYRY MOLYBDENUM-(±TUNGSTEN) DEPOSITS

Porphyry molybdenum (Mo) granite-related deposits demonstrating similar characteristics to the  Mount  Pleasant  porphyry-type  deposits  have  been  described  in  detail  below  (Sinclair, 1995).    Sinclair  modelled  his  discussion  based  mainly  on  descriptions  of  the  Climax  and Climax-type deposits in Colorado.  Porphyry Mo deposits have been a major source of world molybdenum production.  They form in rift zones in areas of thick cratonic crust, in collision zones (especially in association with tungsten vein-type deposits) and occur as high-level to subvolcanic  felsic  intrusive  centres  where  multiple  stages  of  intrusion  are  common.  Both tungsten and tin have been recovered from these deposits.

There are no Climax-type porphyry Mo deposits located in British Columbia or elsewhere in Canada.    In  the  United  States,  porphyry  Mo  deposits  include  Climax,  Henderson,  Mount Emmons  and  Silver  Creek  (Colorado)  and  Pine  Grove  (Utah).    Internationally,  deposits include Questa (New Mexico), Malmbjerg (Greenland) and Nordli (Norway).

Deposits  are  typically  shaped  like  an  inverted  cup  or  hemispherical  shell  and  are  typically large,  generally  measuring  hundreds  of  metres  across  and  tens  to  hundreds  of  metres  in vertical extent.

Mineralization occurs as stockworks of molybdenite-(±tungsten, tin)-bearing quartz veinlets and fractures in highly evolved felsic intrusive rocks and associated country rocks.  Deposits are  low  grade  but  large  and  often  amenable  to  bulk  mining  methods.    The  age  of  the mineralization is Paleozoic to Tertiary, but mainly Tertiary.  Mineralized country rocks may include  sedimentary,  metamorphic,  volcanic  and  older  intrusive  rocks.    Tuffs  or  other extrusive  volcanic  rocks  may  be  associated  with  deposits  related  to  subvolcanic  intrusions. The  economic-type  mineralogy,  mostly  molybdenite  with  smaller  amounts  of  wolframite, cassiterite, sphalerite and galena, is structurally controlled by the stockworks of crosscutting fractures  and  quartz  veins.    Disseminations  and  replacements  are  less  common.    Gangue

minerals  consist  of  quartz,  pyrite,  topaz,  fluorite  and  rhodochrosite.    Multiple  stages  of mineralization are commonly present and abundant quartz layers and other USTs characterize productive intrusions.

Potassic alteration (K-feldspar ±biotite) is directly associated with high-grade Mo (&gt;0.2% Mo).    Silicification  (quartz  and  magnetite)  can  occur  locally  in  the  lower  parts  of high-grade  molybdenum  zones.    Quartz-sericite-pyrite  alteration  may  extend  hundreds  of metres  vertically  above  the  orebodies.    Argillic  alteration  may  extend  hundreds  of  metres beyond  the quartz-sericite-pyrite alteration (both vertically and laterally). Propylitic alteration is widespread and may extend for several kilometres.

The genetic model for such deposits is magmatic-hydrothermal.  Large volumes of magmatic, highly saline aqueous fluids under pressure strip molybdenum and other ore metals from the magma.  Multiple stages of brecciation related to explosive fluid pressure release from upper parts  of  the  magma  chambers  resulting  in  deposition  of  ore  and  gangue  minerals  in crosscutting  fractures,  veinlets  and  breccias  in  the  outer  carapace  of  the  intrusions  and associated  country  rocks.    Interaction  of  the  magmatic-hydrothermal  fluids  with  meteoritic waters can result in late-stage alteration (a non ore-forming process).

Associated deposit types consist of silver-base metal veins, fluorspar deposits, some porphyry tungsten-molybdenum deposits such as Mount Pleasant and Logtung (Yukon). Geochemical signature elements may be anomalous concentrations of Mo, Sn, W, Rb, Mn, F and U in the wallrocks.  Stream sediment samples nearby may contain anomalous concentrations of Mo, Sn,  W,  F,  Cu,  Pb  and  Zn.    Geophysically,  the  related  intrusions  may  be  represented  as magnetic lows and radiometric surveys may be utilized to define anomalous U, Th or K in association with altered and mineralized zones.

## 8.3 PORPHYRY TIN-(±INDIUM) DEPOSITS

Porphyry  tin  deposits  have  been  described  in  detail  below  by  Sinclair  (1995b).    These deposits form along extension zones in cratons, particularly post-orogenic zones, underlain by thick  crust,  possibly  cut  by  shallow-dipping  subduction  zones.    In  addition  to  tin,  these deposits can also contain tungsten, silver and indium (as at Mount Pleasant).

In Canada, deposits have been found at Mount Pleasant and East Kemptville (Nova Scotia). When East Kemptville was in production it was the major producer of tin in North America. Deposits  discovered  outside  Canada  include  Catavi,  Chorolque  and  Cerro  Rico  stock (Bolivia), Ardlethan and Taronga (Australia), Kingan (Russia), Yinyan (China) and Altenberg (Germany).

Porphyry deposits are commonly related to intrusive rocks and associated breccias but may also include sedimentary, volcanic, igneous and metamorphic rocks.  Tuffs or other extrusive volcanic rocks may be associated with the deposits related to subvolcanic intrusions.  These deposits occur in high-level to subvolcanic felsic intrusive centres in cratons where multiple stages of intrusive rock may be present.

Deposits vary in shape from an inverted cone to roughly cylindrical to highly irregular.  They are  typically  large,  generally  hundreds  of  metres  across  and  tens  to  hundreds  of  metres  in vertical extent.

The age of mineralization is the same as the porphyry Mo deposits, Paleozoic to Tertiary.  Tin occurs  principally  in  cassiterite  with  other  ore  minerals  such  as  stannite,  chalcopyrite, sphalerite  and  galena.    Indium  can  also  occur  within  the  sphalerite  as  observed  at  Mount Pleasant.  Common gangue minerals consist of pyrite, arsenopyrite, löllingite, topaz, fluorite, tourmaline, muscovite, zinnwaldite and lepidolite.  Mineralization is structurally controlled in stockworks within crosscutting fractures and quartz veinlets or disseminated in hydrothermal breccia zones.  Mineralization is genetically related to felsic intrusions (i.e., granites), with ore  minerals  concentrated  in  fracture  stockworks,  hydrothermal  breccias  and  replacement zones.

Sericite-pyrite-tourmaline  alteration  is  pervasive  in  Bolivian  porphyry  tin  deposits  where sericitic alteration is bordered by weak propylitic alteration.  Greisen alteration, consisting of quartz-topaz-sericite,  commonly  occupies  the  central  zones  of  deposits  (i.e.,  Ardlethan, Yinyan).  These zones grade outward to quartz-sericite-chlorite alteration.

As with the porphyry Mo, tin deposits have a magmatic-hydrothermal origin with the same genetic  model  (discussed  above).    However,  in  the  case  of  tin  deposition,  the  mixing  of magmatic fluids with meteoric water may result in the deposition of some tin and other metals in late-stage veins.

In exploring for tin porphyry deposits the host rocks may be anomalously high in Sn, Ag, W, Cu, Zn, As, Pb, Rb, Li, F, and B close to the mineralized zones and in secondary dispersion halos in overburden.  Anomalous high concentrations of Sn, W, F, Cu, Pb and Zn have been found  in  stream  sediments.    Deposits  generally  occur  in  related  intrusions,  which  are geophysically represented as magnetic lows although the contact aureole may be a magnetic high if pyrrhotite or magnetite are present.  Anomalous U, Th or K can produce a radiometric high in response to the related intrusive rocks, alteration and mineralized zones.

## 9.  MINERALIZATION

## 9.1 GENERAL

A  number  of  well-documented  mineralized  zones  have  been  identified  at  Mount  Pleasant. These zones, from south to north, have been designated as the Fire Tower Zone, Scotia Zone, Saddle Zone and the North Zone.  A schematic cross-section of Mount Pleasant showing the locations of the zones is illustrated in Figure 5.  At this time, the main deposits of interest are located  within  the  Fire  Tower  Zone  and  North  Zone  located  approximately  1.0 km  apart. Each of the deposits occurs within 400 m from surface.

The  Fire  Tower  Zone  contains  predominantly  large  (low  grade)  tungsten-molybdenum deposits and was previously mined for tungsten.  Some small indium-bearing tin-base metal zones are also present.

Very  little information  is available regarding  the characteristics of the tungsten and molybdenum  mineralization  contained  within  the  Scotia  Zone,  which  is  located  in  the northern portion of the Fire Tower Zone.

The  North  Zone  contains  the  most  important  indium-bearing,  tin-base  metal  'resources' outlined  to  date  along  with  some  poorly  defined  low-grade  tungsten-molybdenum  bodies (ADEX Mining Corp., 1995).  The Saddle Zone, located between the Fire Tower Zone and the North Zone, contains mineralized zones with predominantly tin and some base metals.  No detailed  assessment  has  been  made  of  the  'mineral  resources'  in  this  area,  including  their potential for indium. (Sinclair et al, 2005).

## 9.2 FIRE TOWER ZONE

The Fire Tower Zone is a tungsten-molybdenum deposit that contains three distinct zones, which have been named:

- · Fire Tower North;
- · Fire Tower West; and,
- · Fire Tower South.

Younger indium-bearing, tin-base metal mineralization has been superimposed over portions of  the  tungsten-molybdenum  deposits.    The  mineralogical  characteristics  of  each  of  the different deposit types occurring within the Fire Tower Zone are described below.

WGM has prepared a Mineral Resource estimate for the Fire Tower West and Fire Tower North portions of the overall Fire Tower Zone, as described in Section 17 of the report.  For the purposes of the estimates these two portions are referred to collectively as the Fire Tower Zone.

## 9.2.1 FIRE TOWER ZONE TUNGSTEN-MOLYBDENUM DEPOSITS

Tungsten-molybdenum deposits in the Fire Tower Zone mainly occur in the lower part of the breccia pipe and the upper part of the underlying fine-grained granite, and to a lesser extent in associated volcanic rocks (Kooiman et al, 2005).  These low-grade porphyry-type deposits are characterized by extensive stockworks of mineralized fractures and quartz veinlets.  Higher grade zones occurring in areas of intense fracturing measure 200 to 300 m across and as much as 100 m in vertical extent.  The high-grade zones are surrounded by lower-grade zones are characterized  by  more  widely  spaced  fractures  that  extend  for  hundreds  of  metres  into  the surrounding rocks.  Remobilization of mineralization or reactivation of mineralizing fluids are seen as the causes of the higher-grade mineralization in more intensely altered and brecciated locations.

The  Fire  Tower  Fault  transects  the  Fire  Tower  Zone  and  has  been  intersected  in  the  400 exploration  decline  (see  Figure 5).    This  steeply-dipping  fault  displaces  Fire  Tower  North 150 m from Fire Tower West.  The Fire Tower North deposit is terminated to the east by a northerly trending fault.

Mineralization occurs as veinlets and disseminated grains in breccias mainly located within the  Mount  Pleasant  porphyry.    The  principal  'economic-type'  minerals  are  fine-grained wolframite and molybdenite, along with minor amounts of native bismuth and bismuthinite. The gangue minerals consist of cassiterite, arsenopyrite, löllingite, quartz, topaz and fluorite.

Intense greisen-type alteration (quartz-topaz-fluorite) is associated with higher-grade tungsten-molybdenum zones.  Lower-grade zones are surrounded by an alteration assemblage

of quartz+biotite+chlorite+fluorite. Chlorite-sericite propylitic alteration extends for hundreds of metres beyond the mineralized zones until grading into unaltered rock.

According to Kooiman et al. (2005), the tungsten-molybdenum deposits appear to be related to  the  emplacement  of  fine-grained  granite.    Multi-stage  mineralization  is  indicated  by crosscutting relationships between mineralized fractures and veinlets.  Sparse molybdenumbearing fractures in fine-grained granite appear to represent the final stage of mineralization associated  with  crystallization  of  this  granite.    Finally,  the  tungsten-molybdenum  deposits appear  to predate  crosscutting dykes  of  unmineralized  granite  porphyry  that  truncate mineralized stockwork zones.

## Fire Tower West Deposit

The Fire Tower West deposit lies within the Mount Pleasant porphyry near the contact with the quartz-feldspar porphyry ('QPF') and measures approximately 150 m long by 60 m wide by 150 m thick (ADEX Mining Inc., 1995).  Mineralization has invaded the QFP to a limited extent.    High-grade  mineralization  consists  of  irregular  blobs,  patches  and  disseminations, fracture  fillings  and  coatings.    This  deposit  is  generally  oval  shaped  in  cross-section  and extends  upwards  from  elevation  950 m  to  1,100 m  with  narrower  mineralized  shoots extending further above in some sections.  To the north, the zone narrows to around 20 m at the Fire Tower Fault.  The upper mining limit of this deposit was 200 to 250 m below the surface of Mount  Pleasant. A  total of 270 m  of underground decline and crosscut development has been completed in this deposit.  Diamond drilling to date indicates that the deposit does not appear to continue to depth.

## Fire Tower North Deposit

The Fire Tower North deposit is a near-vertically dipping deposit situated along the contact between the Mount Pleasant porphyry and the feldspar porphyry (ADEX Mining Inc., 1995). It exhibits an arcuate shape measuring around 15 m wide by 370 m long by 150 m thick.  A series  of  faults  striking  north-northwest  and  south-southwest  cuts  the  central  portion  of  the deposit.  This deposit is the continuation of Fire Tower West (displaced across the easterly trending  Fire  Tower  Fault).    In  total,  some  92 m  of  underground  decline  and  crosscut development has been completed in this deposit.  The upper mining limit of this deposit was 200 to 250 m below the surface of Mount Pleasant.  There is a pronounced tungsten zoning

with the highest grade values located in the core of the zone, in association with the highest grade molybdenum.  Bismuth grades are higher than those observed in Fire Tower West over the entire vertical range of the deposit.  Zinc concentrations are uniformly higher in the upper levels of the deposit.  Arsenic concentrations are also significantly higher in the Fire Tower North deposit than the Fire Tower West deposit.

## Fire Tower South Deposit

The Fire Tower South deposit is poorly defined and has been inferred from surface mapping and sampling (ADEX Mining Inc., 1995).  The mineralization of this deposit has not been specifically described in detail in previous geological reports.

## 9.2.2 FIRE TOWER ZONE INDIUM-BEARING TIN-BASE METAL DEPOSITS

The  characteristics  of  the  indium-bearing  tin-base  metal  deposits  hosted  within  the  Fire Tower Zone have been best described by Kooiman et al. (2005).  These deposits occur as irregular  veins  and  mineralized  breccias  that  are  irregularly  distributed  throughout  the  Fire Tower  Zone  and  are  associated  with  altered  and  mineralized  granite  porphyry  dykes. Throughout  the  Fire  Tower  Zone,  the  tin-base  metal  deposits  either  crosscut  or  truncate tungsten-molybdenum stockworks.  In general, veins range from 1 to 2 cm in width and up to several  metres  in  strike  length.    Occasionally,  larger  veins  up  to  10 m  in  width  and  100 m long can occur.  Veins pinch and swell along strike and contain abundant chlorite and fluorite and disseminated massive sulphides.  The Fire Tower Zone contains one tin lode, called the No. 7 tin lode.

Mineralized breccias are irregular bodies and occur as small vertical circular pipes up to 10 m wide  and  100 m  in  vertical  extent.    These  breccias  can  contain  fine-grained  sulphides  and cassiterite as well as chlorite and fluorite.

The  indium-bearing  tin-base  metal  veins  and  breccias  contain  the  principal  oxide  minerals cassiterite and wolframite. Sulphide mineralization consists mainly of sphalerite, chalcopyrite,  galena  and  arsenopyrite  and  minor  amounts  of  pyrite,  löllingite,  molybdenite, tennantite, native bismuth and bismuthinite.

The Scotia Zone, discovered during the 1995 drilling, is characterized as a multiple zone of sulphide  veins  and  replacement  bodies  hosted  by  Granite  IIA,  draped  over  the  contact  of Granite  III,  between  300 m  and  400 m  below  surface  below  and  adjacent  to  the  tungstenmolybdenum  Fire  Tower  North  deposit  (Akerley,  1996).    According  to  Akerley,  the geological continuity of this zone is uncertain but it appears to be open to the north and west while its greatest potential appears to be east.  The southern continuation of the tin sulphide mineralization is expected to occur 150 m west and within 150 m from surface.

## 9.4 SADDLE ZONE

Tin-base  metal  mineralization  of  the  Saddle  Zone  was  discovered  during  the  1988  surface drill  program  following  tin  zones  that  were  encountered  during  underground  development between the Fire Tower Zone and the North Zone, see Figure 5 (ADEX Mining Corp., 1995; Sinclair, 1994).  The geology of the Saddle Zone is structurally similar to the Contact Zone and  Endogranitic  Zone  and  the  sulphide  content  is  generally  low.    Tin  occurs  mainly  as cassiterite and as individual grains and this metal's distribution is irregular with preliminary exploration  grades  of  1.0% Sn  to  as  high  as  1.3% Sn  (over  a  drill  intersection  of  around 3.0 m) and about 30 ppm indium (ADEX Mining Corp., 1995).  Only small amounts of W, Mo and Bi are present.

The Saddle Zone contains evidence of at least four stages of alteration/mineralization related to the formation of the tin-base metal zones, which have been described in detail below by Sinclair (1994):

Stage 1 - pervasive sericitic and crosscutting weak fracture-controlled chloritic alteration of Granite II. There was no significant mineralization during this stage.

Stage 2 - superimposed later stage silicic and greisen-type alteration (quartz, topaz, minor tin).

Stage  3 -  massive  chlorite-biotite  within  Granite  IIA.  Most  of  the  tin  in  the  Saddle  Zone occurs  in  the  chlorite-biotite  zone.    This  zone  is  subhorizontal  (5-15 m  thick)  and  is  semiconformable  with  the  upper  contact  of  the  host  Granite  IIA.    It  is  massive,  fine-grained chlorite with variable amount of fluorite, iron-rich biotite and topaz (locally, minor almandine

garnet and magnetite).  This chlorite-biotite zone is intensely altered, sulphide content is low and, apart from tin, other metals are low.  Tin occurs mostly as cassiterite (and in sulphides such  as  stannite  and  kesterite)  as  individual  disseminated  grains  and  in  larger  fine-grained clusters.  The tin-base metal veins surrounding the massive chlorite-mica zone vary from one centimetre  to  several metres  wide,  are  typically  sulphide-rich  with  abundant  sphalerite, chalcopyrite and galena.  Fluorite and chlorite are also major constituents.

Stage 4 - late clay and related alteration with minor tin sulphides deposition.

According to Sinclair, there are also some tin-base metal veins in Granite IIB, peripheral to the chlorite-biotite zone in Granite IIA.  Only a few small, erratic tin-base metal zones are present in Granite III.

## 9.5 NORTH ZONE

The  North  Zone  is  often  polymetallic  with  tungsten,  molybdenum,  zinc,  copper  and  other metals accompanying the tin.  However, the zone is predominantly tin-bearing, containing six distinct  tin-lodes  described  as  leakages  from  deeper-seated  mineralization  located  within 100 m from surface (Gowdy, 1995).  Tin-lodes occur adjacent to dykes.

A number of more massive tin deposits occur at depth and have been designated as follows (Figure 6):

- · The Deep Tin Zone;
- · Contact  and contact Crest Deposits;
- · Contact Flank Deposit; and,
- · The Endogranitic Zone (Upper and Lower).

It  is  important  to  note  that  although  the  Deep  Tin  Zone actually occurs in the North Zone, some authors describe the deposits within the North Zone as 'the North Zone and Deep Tin Zone'.  In this instance, the North Zone includes the Contact, Crest and Flank deposits, the Endogranitic Zone and the tin-lodes.  The Deep Tin Zone is the shallowest of all the other tinbearing deposits in the North Zone with the exception of the tin-lodes.

<!-- image -->

The  larger  tin-base  metal  deposits  occur  at  depths  of  200  to  400 m,  along  the  contact  of Granite  I  or  within  Granite  II.    Contact  bodies  locally  flank  the  granitoid  cusp  and  its protuberances  and  also  the  crest  of  the  cusp  (Sinclair,  1994).    The  Deep  Tin  Zone  is  an irregularly-shaped body hosted by brecciated Granite I.

Host  rocks  are  often  brecciated  and  altered  to  a  fine-grained,  greisen-type  assemblage  of quartz, sericite, topaz and fluorite.

The  principal  mineralogy  of  the  deposits  consists  of  fine-  to  very  fine-grained  cassiterite, arsenopyrite,  löllingite,  sphalerite  and  chalcopyrite  with  lesser  amounts  of  stannite,  pyrite, marcasite,  galena,  wolframite,  molybdenite,  tennantite,  chalcocite,  bornite,  native  bismuth, bismuthinite  and  wittichenite.    Other  associated  minerals  include  abundant  fluorite  and chlorite (Kooiman et al, 2005).

Many of the North Zone deposits contain significant amounts of indium in association with elevated sphalerite (Sinclair et al, 2005).  Indium-bearing tin-base metal zones in the North Zone  appear  to  be  principally  associated  with  sphalerite  and  are  more  concentrated  in  the Deep Tin Zone.

The  tin  and  porphyry  tungsten-molybdenite  deposits  of  the  North  Zone  represent  two different periods of mineralization even though they overlap spatially. Tin mineralization in the North Zone is younger than the Fire Tower Zone and crosscuts the older molybdenumtungsten zones.  The tungsten and molybdenum zones at the North Zone roughly occupy the same vertical position as the same mineralization in the Fire Tower Zone.

## 9.5.1 NORTH ZONE TIN-BASE METAL-INDIUM DEPOSITS

## Contact, Crest, Flank and Endogranitic Deposits

The Contact, contact Crest and contact Flank deposits occur in breccias and other associated host rocks at the upper contact or along the flanks and in the adjacent troughs of the Granite IIB cupola whereas the Endogranitic Zone occurs within Granite II (see Figure 6).

In  each  of  these  deposits,  cassiterite  occurs  as  finely  disseminated  grains  and  as  fine-  to medium-sized grains in veins or veinlets and along fractures.  Associated minerals include

arsenopyrite,  löllingite,  sphalerite,  chalcopyrite,  pyrite  and  pyrrhotite.    Chlorite,  fluorite, quartz, topaz and sericite are the main alteration minerals (Sinclair, 1994).  The contact crest deposit is superimposed  on older porphyry tungsten-molybdenum  mineralization (see Figure 6).

The contact Crest deposit is situated below the Deep Tin Zone along the upper contact and sides  of  Granite  IIB  (see  Figure 6).    The  host  rock  is  mainly  Granite  IIA  and  breccia. Mineralization is similar to the Deep Tin Zone with respect to the principal economic-type minerals and their modes of occurrence.  Indium averages 45 g/t (Kooiman et al, 2005).

This deposit contains abundant quartz, chlorite, fluorite, topaz and occurs with disseminated to massive sulphide and oxide minerals (Lac Minerals Ltd., 1988).  Cassiterite occurs as finegrained crystals in chloritic zones mostly, in fluorite rich replacement veins, veinlets and in the breccia matrix.

The contact Flank deposit is located below the Deep Tin Zone along the upper contact and sides of Granite IIB (see Figure 6).  The host rock is mainly Granite IIA and Breccia.

Mineralization is similar to the Deep Tin Zone with respect to the principal economic-type minerals and their modes of occurrence.  Indium averages 45 g/t (Kooiman et al, 2005).

In 1988, drilling determined that the contact Flank deposit has a strike length of over 200 m, is 3 to 40 m wide and has a vertical extent of up to 70 m.  According to Lac Minerals Ltd. (1988), the best mineralization is accumulated in the area were the steeply-dipping Granite I/Granite II contact flattens considerably forming an embayment, which may have acted as a trap for the mineralization. Most of the cassiterite is concentrated in pods, veins and breccia matrix.  There is a higher percentage of coarser cassiterite, arsenopyrite and sphalerite in the contact Flank deposit than in the Endogranitic Zone.

In  1988,  the  Endogranitic  ('Endo')  was  thought  to  be  one  large  deposit  measuring  225 m from  northwest  to  southeast  with  a  vertical  extent,  in  the  central  part  of  the  zone,  of  over 200 m  (Lac  Minerals  Ltd.,  1988).    The  zone  was  between  3  and  45 m  thick,  flat  lying  to gently dipping in the southeast to steeply dipping in the central and northern part.  However, extensive drilling in the North Zone has since divided the Endogranitic Zone into the Upper Endogranitic  Zone  and  Lower  Endogranitic  Zone,  which  may  be  controlled  by  depth  of

crystallization  within  the  granitic  porphyry  body  (see  Figure 6).    Furthermore,  it  is  now apparent  that  the  zone  has  inconsistent  dips  locally,  dipping  steeper  at  around  61   in  the ο southwest to northeast direction (Redpath Mining Consultants Limited, 1995).  This zone is the  most  continuous  tin-base  metal  mineralized  body  in  the  North  Zone.    A  detailed description of the Endogranitic Zone has been summarized below from Kooiman et al (2005).

The Endogranitic deposit is the largest and deepest of the tin-base metal-indium deposits in the North Zone.  It is an irregularly shaped, subhorizontal to steeply dipping, roughly tabular deposit hosted almost entirely in Granite IIB.  It also extends locally into adjacent volcanic and sedimentary rocks.  Five stages of greisen-style alteration consist of pervasive sericitic alteration of the host rocks, crosscutting fracture-controlled chloritic alteration, quartz-topaz alteration, chlorite-biotite alteration and finally (last stage) clay alteration of mainly kaolinite. Significant tin and base metal mineralization is associated with the third and fourth stage of alteration where alteration envelopes are up to several centimetres in width.

Third-stage  mineralization  consists  of  cassiterite,  arsenopyrite,  and  fluorite,  and  minor amounts  of  sphalerite,  stannite,  chalcopyrite,  bismuthinite,  chalcocite,  pyrite,  covellite  and roquesite  occurring  in  veinlets,  along  hairline  fractures  and  as  disseminated  grains  in  the altered  wallrocks.    Mineralization  accompanying  the  fourth  stage  of  alteration  consists  of topaz,  coarse  fluorite  and  irregular  zones  of  disseminated  fine-grained  cassiterite.    Other minerals  present  in  minor  amounts  as  disseminated  grains  and  small  clusters  include arsenopyrite, löllingite, sphalerite, chalcopyrite, galena, native bismuth, bismuthinite, wolframite, molybdenite, pyrite, and magnetite.  This zone is primarily a tin deposit.  Indium content averages 45 g/t.

## Tin Lode Deposits

Six  distinct  tin  lodes  have  been  identified  in  the  North  Zone  in  association  with  granite porphyry  dykes,  with  hydrothermal  breccia  or  altered  feldspar  porphyry  (Kvaerner  Metals Davy  Ltd.,  1997).    ADEX  Mining  Corp.  (1995)  describes  these  lodes  as  leakages  from  a deeper-seated  mineralization  that  extend  from  surface  to  a  depth  of  around  100 m  (see Figure 6).

The shallow tin lodes contain very fine-grained cassiterite and lesser amounts of stannite and are associated with arsenopyrite, löllingite, sphalerite and chalcopyrite (Sinclair, 1994).  Less

abundant  sulphides  include molybdenite,  pyrite, marcasite, galena, bornite, tennantite, bismuthinite, wittichenite and roquesite.

Quartz,  fluorite,  topaz  and  chlorite  are  the  principal  alteration  minerals  in  association  with greisenized feldspar porphyry.

## North Zone Tungsten-Molybdenum Deposits

The  characteristics  of  the  North  Zone  tungsten-molybdenum  deposits  have  been  described below by Kooiman et al (2005), Kvaerner Metals Davy Ltd. (1997) and Parrish and Tully (1978).  They occur as discontinuous bodies that form a ring-shaped zone hosted mainly in the North Zone Granite I and breccias and to a lesser extent in underlying brecciated Granite I (granite porphyry dykes and feldspar porphyry, see Figure 6).

These deposits are similar to but smaller than those in the Fire Tower Zone, are less welldeveloped and are lower grade.  Tin content of these deposits reflect the superposition of the younger tin-base metal mineralization on the tungsten-molybdenum deposits.  Indium content is  low (typically 1 ppm In or less) in tungsten-molybdenum deposits not overprinted by the tin-base metal mineralization.

Wolframite, molybdenite, bismuth and bismuthinite are the principal economic-type minerals associated with host rocks, which are altered to a fine-grained assemblage of quartz, topaz, fluorite and sericite.

## 9.6 HORNET HILL

Hornet Hill is located around 1 km west of the North Zone and has been drill tested.  This hill is  underlain  by  fine-grained  porphyritic  granite  that  is  pervasively  chloritized  and  silicified and is similar in appearance to the granite porphyry of the North Zone.  The granite contains veins with minor amounts of cassiterite in association with sphalerite-pyrite-chlorite veining. It  is  the  similarity  in  geological  setting  and  its  close  proximity  to  the  North  Zone  that  has made Hornet Hill an interesting exploration target (Billiton Canada Ltd., 1985b).

## 9.7 URANIUM AND GOLD MINERALIZATION - MOUNT PLEASANT

## REGION

Since  1937,  exploration  work  in  the  Mount  Pleasant  region  has  focused  on  tungsten, molybdenum,  tin-indium  and  base  metal  mineralization.    However,  the  region  does  host several uranium and gold occurrences, some of which are described below (McLeod, 1990).

Exploration  for  fracture-controlled  uranium  occurrences  was  prevalent  in  the  region  from 1960 to the 1981.  Uranium exploration focused in the Utopia Granite near Lily Lake, near Trout Lake in the Mount Douglas Granite and around Sand Brook Mountain in the Mount Douglas and Magaguadavic granites.

Since 1985, gold exploration in the general Mount Pleasant area (not on the ADEX property), has  been  focused  in  and  near  the  contact  aureole  of  the  Saint  George  Batholith,  along  the northwest contact of the batholith in the South Oromocto Lake-Three Bridge Brook area and near the eastern contact of the batholith in the Nerepis area.

Gold occurs in quartz veins associated with arsenopyrite, pyrite, pyrrhotite, chalcopyrite and sphalerite along the northwestern contact.  At the Three Bridge Brook area, 100 m northwest of the Mount Douglas Granite contact, anomalous gold (values not defined) associated with silver, zinc and highly anomalous bismuth were discovered.  South of Three Bridge Brook, a massive  sulphide  vein  within  the  granite  contained  lead,  zinc,  silver  and  gold.    This  vein extended 1,500 m along strike in the granite parallel to the granite contact.  In the Nerepis area,  gold  and  base  metals  are  associated  with  interbedded  sericitic  and  locally  silicified metavolcanic and metasedimentary rocks of possible Cambrian age.

Numerous,  significant  exogranitic  gold  and/or  polymetallic  vein  deposits  are  found  in association with the South Oromocto Lake Intrusive Suite.  Heat generated by this suite also served to remobilize and concentrate gold and polymetallic deposits near granite-country rock contacts.

## 10.  EXPLORATION

In  early  December  1994,  discussions  begun  between  Piskahegan  and  ADEX  leading  to  an agreement  whereby  ADEX  purchased  all  the  shares  of  Piskahegan  on  June  21,  1995.    In January  1996,  the  name  'Piskahegan  Resources  Limited'  was  changed  to  ADEX  Minerals Corp.,  a  100% owned  subsidiary  of  ADEX.    ADEX  continued  Piskahegan's  work  with emphasis on locating small but high-grade sulphide-indium rich bodies for direct bioleaching to be processed at a rate of 500 tons per day (Kooiman, 2004).

According to Kooiman (2004), a well-mineralized breccia pipe was discovered on Fire Tower hill  while  bulldozing  a  road  towards  the  collar  of  drillhole  MPS  127.    It  measured  around 10 m in diameter and composite samples averaged 5.4% Zn, 1.8% Cu, 1.5% Sn and 0.03% In. This breccia pipe was intersected by drillhole MPS 127 from 8 to 15 m below surface.  The intersection assayed 4.48% Zn, 2.98% Cu and 2.5% Sn.  No indium assays are available for the intersection.

Gowdy (1995) visited the Mount Pleasant property in late March 1995, and held discussions with geologists at the mine, including the economics of the project, environmental permitting, mining and milling and the bioleach process and personnel and prepared a report for ADEX. He reviewed the status of the computer database with a representative of the Department of Natural Resources and Energy of New Brunswick.  An examination of the indium analytical data resulted in the following conclusions:

- · There was no correlation of indium with tin values;
- · Indium appeared to be higher when associated with zinc;
- · Indium  appeared  predominately  as  a  sulphide  and  will  report  to  a  sulphide  flotation circuit;
- · Indium, when tied up as an oxide, will more likely pass through the mill system entirely and go to the tailings;
- · 1-2% of the indium of the entire Mount Pleasant mine is estimated to be in an oxide form; and
- · More indium will be associated with oxides in the deeper tin zones (Endogranitic Zone and Contact deposits).

He also suggested that the sulphide concentrate pond could be used as a potential source of cash flow for future exploration and development work (see Section 17, Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve Estimates).  The state of the computerized database of all drillhole data and assays were also examined.  He concluded that most of the data were not in ideal condition and  that  further  clean-up  work  was  required.    Gowdy  also  reviewed  ADEX's  proposed exploration program of the Saddle Zone.

In  June  1995,  a  30-tonne  bulk  sample  was  collected  from  the  600  and  900  adit  dumps  for bioleach  metallurgical  testing  at  RPC.    In  August,  a  1.0-tonne  high-grade  sample  was collected from the 600 adit dump for additional bioleach testing.

During 1995, two site visits were made by senior management of the Indium Corporation of America to discuss progress on indium exploration and recovery programs (Kooiman, 2004). In the following years they made other visits to the property.

According  to  Kooiman  (2004),  officials  of  the  Malaysian  Smelting  Corp.  visited  Mount Pleasant in March 1996.  On April 25, 1996, a deal was announced that the Malaysians would fund  up  to  $2.0 million  for  a  feasibility  study  but  wanted  to  maximize  tin  output,  which required a throughput of 2,500 tonnes per day.

In  June  1996,  ADEX  retained  Kvaerner  to  prepare  a  feasibility  study  focusing  on  the prospects  of  mining  tin  and  indium  from  the  North  and  Deep  Tin  Zones  (see  Section  16, Mineral Processing and Metallurgical Testing).  A 3,231 m drill program was undertaken to assist in the calculation of a 'resource' estimate for the North Zone and especially the Deep Tin Zone (Kvaerner Metals Davy Ltd., 1997).  A 'probable resource' estimate was calculated giving a life-of-mine of only 4 years (see Section 17, Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve Estimates).  The Kvaerner study found that the net present value and the internal rate of return were negative (ADEX Mining Inc., 1995).

The  majority  of  all  the  drill  information  covering  surface  and  underground  holes  was computerized between 1995 and 1997 using GEMCOM software.  A few hundred additional diamond drill core sample pulps were selected in 1997 for indium analyses in the Deep Tin Zone.  'Reserve' calculations were carried out by ADEX on the Upper Deep Tin Zone and smaller bodies such as the near-surface # 4 tin lode.

By  March  1997,  it  became  evident  that  no  positive  feasibility  study  could  be  achieved. Kvaerner's feasibility study was not formally completed and was not paid for but a copy was turned over to ADEX.  In retrospect, the 2,500 tonne per day scenario may have been overambitious (Kooiman, 2004).

All geological work ceased by February 1998, and the property has essentially been dormant since.    According  to  Kooiman  (2004),  there  was  an  attempt  in  1999  by  a  small  group  of metallurgical  consultants  called  Mineral  Chemicals  Inc.  to  revive  the  500  tonne  per  day option of mining higher-grade bodies, however, nothing developed.

Mount Pleasant was in the news again after its tailing dam was breached by severe flooding in early March 1998.  Repairs to the dam were carried out immediately.

In  2001, ADEX supplied CANMET in Ottawa with an 800 kg sample made up of material from the Fire Tower Zone, 600 adit dump and material in storage in the 'A-Frame' building to  develop  a  new  indium  reference  standard  for  the  laboratory  (see  Section  16,  Mineral Processing and Metallurgical Testing).

Indium prices rose in 2004, resulting in renewed interest from other companies to enter into an  agreement  with  ADEX  to  acquire  the  property.    However,  no  financial  partners  were secured.

In  the  fall  of  2005,  ADEX  provided  WGM  with  a  four  page  document  summarizing  their thoughts  on  the  exploration  potential  at  Mount  Pleasant  (Kooiman,  2005).    A  copy  of  this document is located in Appendix 3.

Late in 2005, ADEX gathered grab samples from five of the barrels of Fire Tower Zone bulksample  material  mentioned  in  Section  6.3.3.    The  five  samples  were  subjected  to  multielement  ICP  analysis.    They  averaged  0.35% WO3,  0.26% MoS2,  similar  values  to  those reported for 'mineral resources' at mine closure.

In March 2006, 182 samples of unsplit drill core from four holes named B104, B114, B169 and  PRL95-02,  found  to  have  intersected  the  FTZ,  were  obtained  and  subjected  to  multielement ICP analysis. These results were then entered into the database used to prepare the FTZ  Mineral  Resource  estimate.    In  addition,  19  samples  of  pulps  saved  from  a  1995

sampling  program  of  the  bulk  sulphide  concentrate  test  material  left  over  from  the  MPT mining production were subjected to multi-element ICP analysis plus gold.  The re-analysis showed the material contained significantly anomalous Mo, Zn, Pb, Bi and As.  In addition the samples returned Au values from 30 - 723 ppb and Ag values from 12 - 46 ppm.  Two samples from these pulps plus two from the five samples of the Fire Tower Zone bulk sample material were also tested for PGEs plus Rhenium.  The results were not anomalous.

## 11.  DRILLING

## 11.1 GENERAL

Since 1955, at least a dozen drilling campaigns have been completed to explore and develop the  Mount  Pleasant  property.    Over  the  last  50 years,  1,330  drillholes  totalling  158,561 m have been drilled.  The breakdown of these numbers consists of 484 surface holes totalling 97,727 m and 846 underground holes totalling 60,833 m (Table 3).  These drill programs have led to the discovery of the Fire Tower Zone tungsten and North Zone tin deposits as well as exploring tin mineralization at Hornet Hill.  The last drill program was completed by ADEX in 1996.

Each of the drill programs has been described below.  The collar locations for the minesite drillholes  have  been  tied  into  a  mine  survey  grid.    Surface  drill  collar  locations  have  been plotted on Figure 7 showing their location relative to the mineralized deposits and previous mining infrastructure.  All sample lengths reported represent lengths measured down core and do not necessarily represent the true thickness of the mineralized zones as many of the zones appear  to  be  irregularly  shaped,  both  vertically  and  horizontally.    Underground  fan-style drillholes intersect the mineralised zones from different angles and directions giving rise to apparent widths instead of true width intersections.

During  each  of  the  previous  drill  programs,  the  operators  have  experienced  difficulty  in identifying the various rock types due to many of the rocks being strongly altered (chloritic and silicified) and brecciated (Gowdy, 1995).  However, re-examinations of the previous drill core  by  Piskahegan  and  ADEX  have  allowed  for  standardization  of  the  drillhole  geology classifications and identification of the different lithological units.

Most  holes  were  inclined  holes  up  to  1973  when  vertical  drilling  became  more  common place.    The  size  of  the  drill  core  prior  to  the  Sullivan  Mining  Group's  takeover  was  AX (Parrish and Tully, 1976).  From 1969 to 1972 Sullivan and BTM continued to use A core and AQ core.  As of June 1972, BTM started to use BQ as they found that the BQ holes did not deviate as much as AQ holes.  Underground drilling conducted in the 600, 750 and 900 adits was

completed with an air-powered BBU drills, producing A, E or XRT size core (Parrish and Tully,  1976).    In  1975,  two  Longyear  EHS  38  (electric)  drills  used  in  the  400  decline produced BQ core.

Since 1985, all surface holes have been drilled vertically starting with NQ-size core switching to  BQ  approximately  half  to  two-thirds  of  the  distance  downhole  (Gowdy,  1995).    All underground holes continued to be drilled BQ-size and they were rarely surveyed.  During the Lac-Billiton  Tin  Project,  down-hole  surveys  were  carried  out  occasionally  using  a  Pajari instrument mainly to check the deviation in the deeper holes.  All surface holes were drilled vertically and drillholes seldom deviated over 3° over the entire length of the drillhole.  Most underground holes were relatively short and Pajari tests were carried out sporadically.

Historically,  ten  surface  holes  were  intersected  by  underground  workings.    Surface  and underground drillhole cores are reported 99% sampled and assayed (Kvaerner Metals Davy Ltd, 1997).  Average sample length was 3.0 m.  Much of the core splitting was done with a Longyear new improved core splitter.  Drill reports seldom reveal the name of the company that did the drilling.

Since  the  mid-1980s,  there  has  been  good  ongoing  continuity  to  the  project  through  the utilization  of  standardized  log  sheets  and  having  the  same  personnel  running  the  drill programs and conducting the logging and sampling.

## 11.2 TIN BASE METAL DEPOSITS

Selco drilled four packsack holes for a total of 305 m to test a geochemical anomaly in 1955. None  of  the  holes  intersected  any  significant  metallic  mineralization.    In  1956,  Kennco optioned  the  property  and  drilled  ten  holes  totalling  191 m  but  results  were  disappointing. In 1960,  Kennco  drilled  another  24  holes  for  a  combined  total  of  1,463 m.    These  holes intersected tungsten, molybdenum and tin mineralization.

MPML completed 18,376 m of surface and 7,712 m of underground diamond drilling from 1959 to 1965 focusing predominantly on the Fire Tower Zone (see Table 3).  A number of the holes  were  drilled  to  test  IP  anomalies  thought  to  represent  tungsten-molybdenum-bismuth zones.  Drilling determined that these anomalies were related to the cap rock disseminated mineralization  surrounding  the  main  sulphide-bearing  zones.    Deep  drilling  near  the  Fire

Tower  Zone  encountered  many  mineralized  intersections  with  varying  amounts  of  tin, tungsten and molybdenum.

## 11.3 PORPHYRY TUNGSTEN-MOLYBDENUM-BISMUTH DEPOSITS

From 1969 to 1975, BTM drilled 225 surface holes in the Fire Tower Zone totalling 57,667 m and 330 (20,519 m) underground holes to delineate and sample the North Zone (750 Adit) and Deep  Tin  Zone  including  the  900  Adit  (see  Table  3).    Deeper  surface  and  underground diamond  drilling  helped  to  outline  a  'resource'  for  the  large  porphyry-type  tungstenmolybdenum-bismuth zones located in the Fire Tower Zone and delineate tin mineralization in the North Zone.

Hole MPS 17 intersected several sections containing massive chalcopyrite.  Hole MPS 39 was very well mineralized and brought attention to the tungsten, molybdenum and bismuth values (Parrish and Tully, 1976).  Significant molybdenum, tungsten and bismuth intersections were intersected  by  drillholes  MPS  66,  67,  and  68,  all  inclined  holes  in  the  Fire  Tower  Zone (Parrish and Tully, 1976).  Hole MPS-80 drill tested a strong IP anomaly intersecting 8.8 m of 0.29% Sn.

Drillhole  MPS  124  intersected  two  tin  zones  assaying  0.48% Sn  over  3.0 m  and  0.19% Sn over  3.4 m  at  depths  of  813 m  and  731 m  respectively  (Gowdy,  1995).    Hole  MPS  127 intersected  the  Fire  Tower  breccia  pipe  from  around  8  to  15 m  below  surface.    The intersection assayed 4.48% Zn, 2.98% Cu and 2.5% Sn.  No indium assays were available for the  intersection.    Drilling  to  test  a  moderately  strong  IP  anomaly  at  Little  Mount  Pleasant intersected some zinc mineralization (3.0 m of 2.5% Zn, MPS-134).

Two  inclined  holes  were  drilled  at  Hornet  Hill  targeting  a  bismuth  geochemical  anomaly (Billiton Canada Ltd., 1985b).  Holes MPS 173 and MPS 224 were drill to depths of 308 m and  304 m,  respectively.    Both  holes  intersected  fine-grained  chloritized  and  silicified porphyritic  granite  at  depth  and  veins  containing  minor  amounts  of  cassiterite  sphaleritepyrite-chlorite.    The  holes  returned  low  tungsten,  molybdenum  and  bismuth  values.    Hole MPS  173  intersected  a  cassiterite-bearing  chlorite  vein  assaying  0.89% Sn  over  3.0 m (Lac Minerals Ltd., 1988).

Three  closely-spaced  were  drilled  in  the  Deep  Tin  Zone  to  test  the  reliability  of  previous drillhole results.  Holes MPS 172, MPS 190 and MPS 197 demonstrated large variances, or nugget effect, observed within the tin-bearing mineralization (Parrish and Tully, 1976).

Hole A148, drilled in the Deep Tin Zone, ended in tin mineralization with an intersection of 2.61% Sn over a core length of 3.0 m (Gowdy, 1995).

From the period 1981 to 1985, a total of 14,478 m of underground diamond drilling to further delineate  the  tungsten-molybdenum  zones  was  completed  by  Billiton  and  BTM.    The 172 drillholes were numbered from B3 to B184 (see Table 3).

## 11.4 PORPHYRY TIN DEPOSITS

In 1985, Billiton completed 12 surface drillholes totalling 4,767 m to further delineate the tin mineralization in the Deep Tin Zone, contact Crest and Flank deposits, Endogranitic Zone and Saddle area.

The holes were numbered from E1 to E16 (see Table 3).  Drilling confirmed the presence of a large tin 'resource' although there was still uncertainty regarding the shape and attitude of the Endogranitic Zone mineralization (Billiton Canada Inc., 1985a).  Examples of representative drillhole intersections are given below in Table 4.  Hole E12 intersected 6.7% Sn over a core length of 5.2 m.

Up to the completion of the 1985 drill program, drilling of the North Zone had demonstrated that  there  is  a  high  percentage  of  very  wide  and  high-grade  tin  intersections  and  that mineralization  was  still  open-ended  (Hosking,  1985).    However,  drilling  had  still  not delineated the shape of the intersected bodies or determined the variability in mineralogy, or established the distribution pattern of the cassiterite within the bodies (Hosking, 1985).

In  1986,  the  Lac-Billiton  Tin  Project  joint  venture  completed  25,377 m  of  surface  and underground diamond drilling to delineate the zones of tin mineralization and to produce a feasibility  study  of  the  North  Zone.    A  total  of  164  underground  and  18  surface  holes  was completed to sample the various zones (see Table 3).

A total of 18,124 m of underground drilling was completed, which included 6 holes (holes C8-12, C19, 688.5 m) at the Deep Tin Zone, 7 holes (holes C1-4, 686.7 m) in the Saddle area and  151  holes  (holes  C13-18,  C20-C164,  16,749.0 m)  at  the  Crest,  Flank  deposits  and Endogranitic Zone (Lac Minerals Ltd., 1988).

The surface holes, numbered LNZ-1 to LNZ-18, were completed between 1987 and 1988 in the Saddle Zone and North Zone.  Hole LNZ-4 was drilled to further explore the Hornet Hill cupola located around 1 km west of the North Zone.

Three holes (LNZ-1 to LNZ-3) tested the Saddle area of the Fire Tower Zone for a total of 1,227.1 m (Lac Minerals Ltd., 1988).  Hole LNZ 4 was drilled to a depth of 251.5 m at Hornet Hill (Lac Minerals Ltd., 1988).  Hole LNZ-13 was drilled 700 m east of the North Zone and LNZ-14  was  drilled  900 m  north  of  LNZ-13  to  test  radiometric  anomalies.    Both  holes intersected  two  or  more  sections  (3.0  to  6.1 m  core  lengths)  containing  tin,  zinc  and  silver mineralization as veins and disseminations associated with either feldspar porphyry, porphyritic granite or siliceous QFP.  The best intersection was in hole LNZ-13 that returned 0.29% Sn, 6.49% Zn and 9.55 g Ag/t over a core length of 6.1 m (274.3-280.4 m).

Three deep vertical holes (LNZ 15, 16 and 17) were drilled for a total of 1,713.2 m in the Saddle Zone area between the tin-base metal bearing North Zone and the Fire Tower Zone. These holes were drilled to investigate the tin mineralization associated with Granite III, the youngest and deepest seated of the three granites occurring in the North Zone (Lac Minerals Ltd., 1988b).  All holes intersected Granite III. Only one hole, LNZ 16, intersected tin values in Granite II with 0.85% Sn and 0.23% WO3 over a core length of 0.6 m (Table 5).  Hole LNZ 15 interested the widest tin intersection in Granite II (0.33% Sn over 39.6 m) and the highest grade  intersection  (0.73% Sn  over  6.1 m).    Most  of  the  tin  deposits  in  the  North  Zone  are associated with Granite II (Lac Minerals Ltd., 1988b).

Novagold conducted a three-hole drilling program for a total of 1,702 m to test the Saddle Zone between November 1989 and February 1990.  Drillholes NMR89-1 to NMR89-3 were all vertical.  The first hole, NMR 89-1, intersected the highest tin value of 1.31% Sn over an intersection length of 16.06 m (Table 6).  According to Kooiman (2004), this hole intersected one of the highest tin values ever recorded on the property: 3.97% Sn over a core length of 5.09 m.

## 11.5 TIN-INDIUM-BASE METAL DEPOSITS

Piskahegan completed a five-hole 2,772 m surface drill program in the Fire Tower Zone in 1995  (see  Table  3).    The  holes  were  numbered  PRL95-1  to  PRL95-5  and  were  all  drilled vertically on claims 228004 and 338016.  The first hole was drilled in January 1995 with the remaining four holes drilled from April to May 1995.  The purpose of the drill program was to test for the presence of tin-indium-bearing Granite II in the footwall portion of the Fire Tower Fault  (Akerley,  1996).    The  holes  were  drilled  to  depths  between  424  and  613 m  and  the deepest  hole  ended  300 m  below  sea  level.    The  drill  geologist  was  G.  Kooiman,  Chief Geologist,  who  was  responsible  for  the  drill  program.    Drilling  was  completed  by  Lantech Drilling Services operating out of Dieppe, New Brunswick.

A broad new zone of polymetallic mineralization, called the Scotia Zone, was intersected by each of the five holes.  The program was successful in demonstrating that the Saddle Zone and Fire Tower North Zone were both underlain by the same tin-bearing granites, which most likely formed one continuous granite body (Kooiman, 2004).  Drilling intersected good tinindium-zinc-copper  values  although  indium  grades  were  generally  lower  than  in  the  North Zone.

In  1996,  ADEX  Mining  Corp.  drilled  eleven  diamond  drillholes  (AM96-1  to  AM96-11) ranging from 182.88 m to 379.48 m, totalling 3,231 m to confirm and upgrade 'resources' in the Deep Tin Zone, to furnish new data on indium and to provide material for metallurgical

testing  in  support  of  the  Kvaerner  Feasibility  Study  (Kooiman,  1997;  Kvaerner  Metals Davy Ltd., 1997).

Drilling was completed between July 25 th and October 1 st in the southern portion of the North Zone (all NQ size drill core).  With the exception of hole AM96-10, drilled at -86  (azimuth ο N77 E), all the remaining holes were drilled vertically.  A total of 323 samples was collected ο for assay.

All  eleven  holes  intersected  at  least  one  mineralized  interval  and  a  total  of  22  significant intervals  were  encountered  (Table  7),  (Kvaerner  Metals  Davy  Ltd.,  1997).    The  weighted average  of  the  tin  values  for  the  11  holes  was  0.64% Sn,  close  to  the  previous  average 'resource'  grade  of  0.60% Sn  (see  Section  17,  Mineral  Resources  and  Mineral  Reserve Estimates).    This  program  was  successful  as  it  identified  a  new  zone,  the  Upper  Deep  Tin Zone with high grade tin-indium-copper-zinc mineralization.  The drillhole data was plotted on site using GEMCOM software (Kooiman, 1997).

The  common  practice  at  Mount  Pleasant  for  core  logging  has  been  to  record  all  the information onto paper logging sheets.  However, all of the drillhole information covering the surface and underground drillholes were added to a computerized database between 1995 and 1997 using GEMCOM software.  According to Kvaerner Metals Davy Ltd. (1997), around 60% of the drillhole database was entered by employees of the New Brunswick Department of  Natural  Resources  and  ADEX  entered  the  remainder  of  the  data  using  their  personnel, including students.  An examination of the database by Gowdy (1985) determined that it was not in ideal condition with missing data and improper data entries.  He recommended that the data entries be rechecked.

In late 2005, ADEX supplied WGM with a copy of the computerized GEMCOM database for review.  This database contains all Mount Pleasant diamond drillhole data, including assay results,  for  review.    Each  database  for  the  North  Zone,  Saddle  Zone  and  Fire  Tower  Zone contains  four  tables,  the  'Header'  table,  the  'Survey'  table,  the  'Lithology'  table  and  the 'Assay' table (Kvaerner Metals Davy Ltd., 1997).  The Header file contains columns for the drillhole  number,  'East  (X)',  'North  (Y)',  'Elevation (Z)',  'Azimuth'  (not  magnetic  grid azimuth), 'Dip' and total 'Length' of hole and Remarks.  The survey table contains in hole or downhole survey data (azimuth- Mine Grid, Dip) with uphole dips indicated by a '+' and downhole by a '-'.  The data in the Lithology table lists 'From', 'To' and 'Rock Unit' as a numerical value (a lithological code, Table 8).

The assay table lists 'From', 'To' for molybdenite, tungsten oxide, tin, copper, lead, zinc, bismuth, arsenic, calcium, iron and indium.  There is a total of 49,913 assay records in the database as follows:

• North Zone: 23,997 records;

• Saddle Zone: 1,640 records; and

• Fire Tower Zone: 24,276 records.

Gold and silver columns have been added to the Assay table for samples collected from the Fire Tower and Saddle Zones.  Values below detection limit (&lt;0.01) or with no values are denoted  as  0.00  (Kvaerner  Metals  Davy  Ltd.,  1997).    The  North  Zone  also  contains  an additional two tables called 'Composite 1' and 'Composite 2'.  The Composite 1 contains: 'From', 'To', 'Interval', 'Thickness'.  The Composite 2 has not been calculated.  No codes representing mineralization were entered into the database.

During  the  course  of  the  WGM  study,  additional  historic  assay  data  have  been  found  in records  on  the  site  and  added  to  the  database.    The  database  has  been  reviewed  and crosschecked  with  drill  logs  and  assay  sheets  and  corrected  where  necessary.    WGM  has concluded that the historic Fire Tower Zone drillhole and assay database is reliable and that it is suitable for use in the preparation of an NI 43-101-compliant Mineral Resource estimate.

## 12.  SAMPLING METHOD AND APPROACH

Information  regarding  the  sampling  methodology  and  approach  was  obtained  through discussions  with  G.  Kooiman  during  the  Mount  Pleasant  field  visit  and  from  previous geological reports and papers provided by ADEX.

All assay results reported in this document have been obtained from previous ADEX reports and from reports from previous operators that have worked on the property.  The practice of reporting exploration results to the public has changed dramatically over the last decade.  In the  past,  it  was  largely  up  to  the  company  as  to  what  results  they  wished  to  report  to  the public.  For example, an acceptable practice was to only report the best assay results.  Many did  not  choose  to  disclose  their  sampling  techniques,  the  name  of  the  laboratory  to  which samples  were  dispatched  or  include  copies  of  the  original  assay  report  certificates  in  their final report.  The best records have been kept since BTM's arrival on the property in 1969 to present.  The authors have no reason or evidence to question the validity of the data presented in  the  historical  reports.    It  is  the  authors'  opinion  that  all  sampling  methods  disclosed conform to generally accepted Canadian mining industry practice.

Since  the  early  1980s,  there  has  been  good  ongoing  continuity  to  the  project  through  the utilization of standardized log sheets, having the same personnel running the drill programs and conducting the logging and sampling.  For example, Mr. Kooiman has been associated with the project for some 25 years, working as a geologist for Billiton, LAC, Novagold and Piskahegan and now as a geological consultant for ADEX.

The  various  methods  and  approaches  have  been  summarized  below  with  reference  to  drill core logging and sampling, a critical component of the data-gathering exercise required for Mineral Resource estimates for this property.

## Brunswick Tin Mines

According  to  Parrish  and  Tully  (1976),  samples  were  taken  at  15 cm  to  4.6 m  (15 foot) lengths.  Later all samples were taken at 3.1 m (10 foot) lengths.  All cores were split in half usually using a Longyear core splitter with the splitter being brushed clean between sample splits.  One half of core was retained in the core box and then the box was placed in racks

outside for storage.  Each split core sample was put in a canvas sample bag with the sample number labelled outside the bag and sample tag placed inside it.

For  BTM drill  programs  (and  all  programs  by  LAC,  etc.),  if  additional  core  sampling  was required  then  the  core  was  quartered  where  possible  or  alternately,  15 cm  representative samples were retained for each 1.5 m of core (Kvaerner Metals Davy Ltd, 1997).

## Lac Minerals Ltd.

During the Lac-Billiton Tin Project, LAC (the operator) logged all drill core (Lac Mineral Ltd.,  1988).    After  logging,  the  core  was  sampled  using  standard  3.1 m  (10  foot)  intervals. Sampling  was  not  a  function  of  the  geology  with  only  a  limited  number  of  non-standard length samples taken. Cores were split into equal halves using a Longyear core splitter.  One half of each sample was retained as reference material.  None of the core logging was done using computerized software programs (i.e., Log II) as recommended by Gowdy (1985).

## Novagold Resources Inc., Piskahegan, ADEX

The  drill  core  was  logged  by  the  same  persons  in  the  core  shack  building  located  on  the Mount Pleasant minesite.  Samples were taken at regular intervals (usually 3.1 m) to cover sections  of  core  with  visible  mineralization.    A  binocular  microscope  was  used  by  the geologist to assist in making visual estimates of tin, tungsten oxide and molybdenite and to examine the fine-grained nature of the mineralization

Core with abundant sphalerite was always sampled (Kvaerner Metals Davy Ltd, 1997).  The core  was  initially  viewed  under  ultraviolet  light  in  search  of  scheelite  (none  found). Therefore, fluorescence was restricted to aid in the identification of minerals such as fluorite and certain  sphalerites  (Gowdy,  1995).    Samples  for  splitting  were  marked  using  a  lumber crayon (the sample beginning and end points).  Samples were split using a manual Longyear splitter under the supervision of the project geologist, although some splits were done with a rock saw.  Half the core was retained for future reference.  Split core samples were placed in a numbered plastic bag, the sample tag placed in the bag and the bag sealed.  No assay tags were  left  in  the  core  boxes  to  indicate  the  location  of  the  sample  interval  (other  than  old lumber crayon markings, when visible).  The samples were then dispatched to the laboratory for analyses (see Sample Preparation, Analyses and Security, Section 13).

Once logging and sampling were finished, the open core boxes were then placed, outside, in steel core racks or cross stacked on the ground for long-term storage.

Assay results were not entered onto the hard copy drill log sheets.  Copies of the drill logs and assay certificates and sheets were kept in separate hard cover binders.  None of the drill logs appear to have reported core recovery percentages.  The sample interval is clearly recorded on the drill logs, however, assay results are seldom entered onto the drill logs.

## 13. SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND SECURITY

## 13.1 GENERAL

Information  regarding  sample  preparation,  analyses  and  security  was  obtained  through discussions  held  with  Trevor  Boyd  and  G.  Kooiman  and  information  provided  from geological reports provided by ADEX.  It is the authors' opinion that the sample preparation, security  and  analytical  procedures  used  conformed  to  generally  accepted  Canadian  mining industry practice.

The drill core was split in the core shack building on the minesite under the supervision of the project geologist.  This building was and is locked and a security fence surrounds the minesite buildings.  Security was and is maintained on the site 24 hours, 7 days per week.  All drill core from the previous drill programs is stored within the confines of the minesite.

All coarse rejects and pulps remain in storage in the large core shack warehouse located onsite.  The rejects have been labelled and are stacked on wooden pallets.  The Mount Pleasant Tungsten Mine (1985) 'Mothball' report provided an inventory list of the stored rejects at the time of closure, however, this list has not since been updated.

The various methods and approaches of preparing and analyzing the samples are summarized below  (by  company).    Information  regarding  the  metallurgical  work  related  to  feasibility studies can be found in Section 16, Mineral Processing and Metallurgical Testing.

## 13.2 MOUNT PLEASANT MINES LIMITED

In 1960, MPML analyzed its drill core for tin, copper, zinc, lead, molybdenum and tungsten. The following year, MPML set up a geochemical laboratory (location unknown) and carried out  soil  and  bedrock  surveys  for  tin,  copper,  lead,  molybdenum  and  zinc  (Parish  and Tully, 1976).

## SULLIVAN MINING GROUP AND BRUNSWICK TIN MINES

In 1971, a Philips PW 1212 XRF was set up in St. Stephen, New Brunswick, by BTM and all drill core and other materials were assayed for molybdenum, tungsten, bismuth, tin, copper, zinc, lead and arsenic (Parrish and Tully, 1976).  They also analyzed for calcium (for fluorite) and  some  silver  (Kvaerner  Metals  Davy  Ltd.,  1997).    It  should  be  noted  that  BTM  had problems with tin assays in the 1960s to late 1970s.  The assaying procedure conducted by Sullivan and BTM have been described below (Kvaerner Metals Davy Ltd., 1997).

All assaying was performed by XRF.  Approximately one third of the sample was placed in a cup  holder  for  analysis.    Assaying  of  a  reference  standard,  plus  three  unknowns,  for  eight elements, took approximately 24 minutes.  The pulps were retained after analysis and stored in the assay office by drillhole number.

High values (range unspecified) were re-assayed.  The re-assay was performed on a briquette or  pellet  made  from  2.0 g  of  pulp.    Boric  acid  was  added  as  a  binder  along  with  2.0 g  of barium dioxide to make a uniformly dense matrix.  Weight measurements were made using a Mettler H10W Balance.  The uncompressed sample was then placed in a Spex 8000-11 Mixer Mill  for  homogenization.    The  pellet  was  made  by  compressing  at  30,000  psi  in  a  Dietart Briquetting Press for 25 seconds.  The finished pellet was then X-Rayed.  The analysis was done under vacuum, taking around 1 minute per assay to complete.  After analysis, pellets were stored for four months and then discarded (Kvaerner Metals Davy Ltd., 1997).

## 13.4 BRUNSWICK TIN MINES

According to Parrish and Tully (1979), all split core samples were crushed on-site using a Woodstock  'O'  Jaw  Crusher  and  Riffle  splitter  to  provide  a  representative  sample.  The remaining  half  of  the  sample  was  then  placed  back  in  the  canvas  sample  bag  and  labelled 'coarse  reject'  and  placed  in  storage.    The  remainder  of  the  sample  was  pulverized  and ground to -50 mesh size and placed on a 45 cm (18 inch) square piece of Kraft Paper and rolled and mixed to achieve complete homogeneity.  Using only a ½ inch spatula, the crusher man removed rows and columns of the mounded sample until only one half of the sample remained, which was then placed into a Canneco (kraft) envelope.  The remaining half was poured into a second envelope and labelled with the sample number.  The pulps were then sent to the assay office (at St. Stephen?) for additional shatter box grinding and assaying.

All assaying at BTM was performed by XRF using a Philips PW 1212 unit.  Powders were used to determine the concentrations for molybdenum, tungsten, bismuth, tin, copper, lead, zinc and arsenic.  Re-assays were performed, not on the powder, but on a briquette or pellet made  from  2.0 g  of  powder  with  2.0 g  of  boric  acid  to  act  as  a  binder  and  2 g  of  barium dioxide.  All weight measurements were made using a Mettler H10W Balance.  Pellets were made using a Dietart Briquetting Press.  Remaining pulps were stored in the assay office by drillhole and footage.

The method of collecting bulk samples, sludge sampling, composite sampling is detailed in Parrish and Tully (1976), pages 61-63.

## 13.5 MOUNT PLEASANT TUNGSTEN MINE

The sample preparation and assay procedures have been described below (Kvaerner Metals Davy Ltd., 1997).

Samples for assay were placed into sample bags and sent to the crushing room.  The core was crushed to ¼ inch mesh in a Woodstock 'O' Jaw Crusher and passed repeatedly through a Fischer-Jones Sample Riffle box (4-942C) until the sub-sample filled two-thirds of a 250 ml cup.  This sample was first roll crushed to -2 mm size material.  The coarse rejects were then placed in sample bags in the sample storage building.

The ¼ inch sample was then pulverized in a BICO UA1 Pulverizer to -50 mesh size material and the pulverized sample was rolled on paper to achieve complete homogeneity.  One half of the sample was sent to the mine assay office. The remaining pulp was placed in storage.

Care was taken to avoid contamination during each stage of sample preparation in the crusher room  at  the  mine.    The  equipment  was  brushed  clean  and  blown  out  with  compressed  air between samples.

In the assay office, the samples were listed by hole and length and the identifying assay-run number  was  added  to  the  list.    Two  tablespoons  of  sample  were  removed  for  further pulverizing in a Spex 8510 Shatter box (a Bleuler Rotary Mill was used for several years).  A half  teaspoon  of  common  detergent  was  added  to  the  sample  to  prevent  sticking  and

pulverized for 2.5 minutes to -300 mesh size material.  The new pulp was sent to the assay laboratory with the remaining coarse pulp returned to permanent storage at the minesite.  The stored pulps provided material for monthly check samples, which were sent to three external laboratories.

## 13.6 LAC-BILLITON TIN PROJECT

At the start of the project assaying was routinely carried out on site using well established XRF methods.  Assistance for calibration was obtained from Lakefield Research of Lakefield Ontario.    Later  LAC  sold  all  the  on-site  crushing  equipment  and  samples  were  shipped  to XRAL Laboratories ('XRAL') in Saint John for crushing and pulverizing.  Pulps were then shipped to XRAL in Toronto for analysis.

During the course of the Lac-Billiton Tin Project, each of the drill core samples was analyzed on site for tin, tungsten, molybdenum, arsenic, bismuth, copper, lead, zinc and iron by XRF using 'SB' as the internal standard (Lac Minerals Ltd., 1988).  Samples were also analysed for  calcium.    Molybdenum  and  tungsten  were  assayed  as  molybdenite  and  tungsten  oxide. Molybdenum  and  tungsten  form  the  older  holes  were  recalculated  as  molybdenite  and tungsten oxide (Kvaerner Metals Davy Ltd., 1997).  Major, minor and trace element analyses were performed on fresh granite samples by the Geological Survey of Canada and Carleton University.    Coarse  rejects  and  sample  pulps  were  stored  on  site  along  with  the  diamond drill core.

Indium analyses were completed by XRAL  or  Lakefield using Inductively-Coupled Plasma/Mass  Spectrometry  ('ICP/MS')  as  it  appeared  to  be  the  most  reliable  method available (Gowdy, 1995).

## 13.7 NOVAGOLD RESOURCES INC.

From 1991 to 1992, 200 samples from the North Zone were analyzed for indium by Atomic Absorption  ('AA')  and  XRF  by  Novagold  initially  and  completed  by  the  New  Brunswick Department  of  Natural  Resources  and  Energy  (Kvaerner  Metals  Davy  Ltd.,  1997).    The Geological  Survey  of  Canada  also  analyzed  100  samples  for  indium  from  the  Fire  Tower Zone; these were analyzed at XRAL by ICP/MS.

## PISKEHEGAN RESOURCES LIMITED

Analytical values for indium and bismuth were developed from studies completed by the New Brunswick  Department  of  Natural  Resources  and  Energy  in  1991  and  from  a  core  reevaluation study completed by Piskahegan in 1994 (ADEX Mining Corp, 1995).

In  December  1993,  Piskahegan  analyzed  2,000  samples  for  indium  by  XRF,  ICP/MS  and Induced-Coupled-Plasma Spectroscopy ('ICPES').  These analyses were done at Lakefield, using  XRF  and  ICPES,  and  at  XRAL  using  ICPES  and  ICP/MS  (Kvaerner  Metals  Davy Ltd., 1997).

In  1994,  the  New  Brunswick  Department  of  Natural  Resources  and  Energy  compiled  the indium data in table format and analyzed another 250 samples from the Deep Tin Zone at XRAL using ICP/MS (Kvaerner Metals Davy Ltd., 1997).

All  analytical  work  for  the  1995  drill  program  was  completed  by  XRAL  using  the  ICP analytical  method for tungsten (WO3), molybdenum (MoS2), copper, lead, zinc and arsenic (Akerley,  1996).    ICP/MS  was  used  to  determine  indium,  tin  and  bismuth.    The  analytical results were appended at the back of the ADEX drill report.

## 13.9 ADEX

The methods of preparing and analyzing the drill core for the 1996 drill program are outlined in the drill report prepared by Kooiman (1997).

A total of 323 samples covering some 949 m of core was transported to the SGS Minerals Services ('SGS') sample preparation facilities in Saint John, New Brunswick.  Each sample represented  a  3.0 m  (10 foot)  split  of  NQ  core  weighing  around  8 kg.    The  samples  was crushed to 95% passing 1 mm for holes AM96-01 to -03 and 50% passing 1 mm for holes AM96-04 to -11.  A 300 g sub-sample was then pulverized to -200 mesh (Kvaerner Metals Davy Ltd.,  1997).    The  pulps  were  transported  to  XRAL  (Toronto)  and  were  analyzed  for copper,  zinc,  lead,  arsenic,  tungsten  (WO3)  and  molybdenum  by  ICP;  a  0.5  to  1.0 g  subsample of the pass 200 mesh pulverized material was required for the ICP method (Kvaerner Metals Davy Ltd., 1997).  Tin, bismuth and indium were analyzed by ICP/MS.  Three batches

of  check samples were submitted to one or two other laboratories.  All coarse rejects were collected in Saint John and pulps were returned to the minesite.

Thirty-six pulps that were analyzed by XRAL were returned to the minesite and were split into three parts.  One part was kept on site, the other two parts were sent to Lakefield and to the  GSC  laboratory  in  Ottawa  respectively,  for  check  assays.    Lakefield  was  requested  to analyze  for  tungsten  (WO3),  molybdenum  (MoS2),  copper,  tin,  zinc,  lead,  arsenic,  bismuth and  indium  by  XRF.    The  GSC  laboratory  offered  bismuth,  copper,  indium,  molybdenum, lead, tin and zinc by ICP/MS. Acceptable to good agreement was obtained for most elements. Additional repeat check assaying followed (a second batch of 46 samples and a third batch of 32 samples) with samples being sent to Lakefield for tin analysis by XRF.

It  was  decided  to  accept  XRAL's  indium  assays  and  low  grade  tin  values.    The  XRF technique by Lakefield was considered to be the more accurate for samples with higher tin contents  (&gt;0.2% Sn).    According  to  G.  Kooiman,  the  best  analytical  technique  for  indium determination is ICP/MS at XRAL.

Some  2.4 tonnes  of  material  from  this  drill  program  was  used  to  prepare  a  30-tonne  bulk sample that was shipped to Lakefield Research in 1997 for a pilot plant test.

The bulk of all the indium analyses have been done at XRAL by ICP and ICP/MS (Kvaerner Metals Davy Ltd., 1997).  However, Lakefield did complete some indium analyses by mostly ICPES (some by XRF).  ADEX used a CANMET Canadian Certified Reference standard, which  was  submitted  with  the  sample  pulps  with  similar  numbering  series  as  a  check procedure for indium analyses.

Indium  can  be  a  difficult element  to detect. Kvaerner  determined  that  for  indium &gt;350 ppm, XRAL values are higher than those of Lakefield.  For Lakefield, indium values &lt;50 ppm were always higher then the values obtained by XRAL.  According to Kvaerner, this problem is persistent and is not restricted to Mount Pleasant.

At the completion of the Kvaerner feasibility study, 84.6% of the Deep Tin Zone samples and 65.3% of the North Zone samples had been analyzed for indium.  More specifically, 15.4% of the Deep Tin Zone and 34.7% of the North Zone samples within the 0.2% Sn cutoff grade still did not have indium analyses (Kvaerner Metals Davy Ltd., 1997).

According  to  Kvaerner,  in  their  'resource'  calculation  they  estimated  the  missing  indium values  by  using  multiple  regressions  based  on  existing  indium  versus  tin,  copper  and  zinc values.    For  example,  in  the  North  Zone,  every  second  cross  section  is  well  analysed  for indium.  The regression for the missing indium values on the intermediate cross section was based  upon  the  existing  values  on  the  adjacent  cross  sections  plus  whatever  values  were available on the section to be estimated.  If the value was negative, then the value was set to 'zero' in the 'resource' estimate.

## 13.10 2005 WGM GRAB SAMPLING (ROCKS AND CORE)

All fourteen samples collected by WGM were sent to SGS, Toronto, formerly XRAL.  This laboratory is ISO/IEC 17025 accredited. With each batch of 48 samples or less, SGS inserts a method blank and a standard (reference material or in-house standard) analyzed for control of accuracy.  With each batch of 12 samples or less, there is a duplicate analyzed for control of precision.

At SGS, the entire sample is jaw-crushed and then 250 grams are pulverized to 85% passing 75 microns in a Cr-steel shatter box (Preparation Code PRP89).

Base  metal  and  trace  element  geochemistry  was  determined  by  ICP,  Aqua  Regia  (code ICP12B) and included Sn, W, Mo, Bi, Ag, Cu, Ni, Zn, Pb and As.  Analytical certificates are appended  (see  Appendix  4).    Samples  whose  concentrations  exceeded  10,000 ppm (1.0%) were re-analyzed using sodium peroxide fusion with an ICP finish.  Results are reported as % Cu, % Zn, % Pb, % Sn and % As.

A 30 g sample of the pulverized material was fire assayed for Au only (code FAI303) with an ICP  finish.    Silver  was  determined  using  multi-acid  digestion  with  an  Atomic  Absorption ('AAS') finish (method AAS40E).

Sn, W, Mo, In and Bi were also analyzed by sodium peroxide fusion and then run by ICP (method ICP90A, total digestion).  The upper limit of this method was 5%.  The final results for  W  and  Sn  increased  significantly  when  using  the  total  digestion  method  (ICP90A)  as compared  with  the  lower  values  obtained  using  the  partial  digestion  ICP12B  method. However, the results remained relatively the same for Mo and Bi between the two analytical

techniques.    At  WGM's  request,  SGS  calculated  the  values  for  Mo  and  W  as  molybdenite (MoS2) and tungsten oxide (WO3); values are presented in Appendix 4.

Indium  concentrations  were  also  determined  by  multi-acid  digestion  with  ICP/MS  finish (method  IC40M).    These  values  did  not  increase  significantly  when  comparing  the  results with the ICP90A method.

For the March 2006 sampling program, samples were sent to SGS.  The additional samples obtained  from  the  core  intersecting  the  Fire  Tower  Zone  and  saved  pulps  from  the  bulk sulphide material were analysed by ICP (method ICP90A) plus Au (method FAI303) where requested.  The four samples chosen for PGEs plus Rhenium analysis were tested by method code FAM363 (FAS and NiS collection plus ICPMS scan).

## 14.  DATA CORROBORATION

The  authors  conducted  a  field  visit  of  the  Mount  Pleasant  property  from  November  8  to 10, 2005 to review data, the condition of surface installations and visit some outcrop areas in part  to  confirm  the  presence  of  mineralization.    Paul  Dunbar  spent  two  days  with  Gustaaf Kooiman reviewing  all  the  historical  exploration  and  development  work  completed  on  the property,  reviewing  the  ADEX  files  and  touring  the  Fire  Tower  Zone  and  North  Zone  to examine mineralized showings.  One day was spent examining and sampling the drill core from  the  past  diamond  drill  programs.    The  authors  visited  the  'A-Frame'  building  and observed the leftover material still in storage from the previous bulk sampling programs on the Endogranitic Zone and contact Crest deposit.  Andrew Hara spent time touring the mine building and site and reviewing the ADEX files.

Approximately  90% of  the  core  collected  from  previous  drill  programs  is  stored  at  the minesite.    The  majority  of  the  drill  core  boxes  are  stored  outside  in  steel  racks  or  crossstacked on the ground.  The boxes are well tagged with hole numbers, although some of the tags have fallen off.  A complete inventory list of the drill core and coarse rejects in storage can be found the Mount Pleasant Tungsten Mine (1985) mine closure ('Mothball') report. This inventory list has not since been updated.  The pulps and coarse rejects (and some drill core) are currently stored under lock and key in the core shack warehouse.

A global positioning system instrument (GPS, Garmin 12XL) was used to record the locations of  the  two  field  samples  and  several  drill  collar  casings  (NAD83,  Zone  19T).    Digital photographs were taken to document the field visit and sampling activities.

A total of 14 samples, 2 grab samples from the field and 12 samples of drill core, was taken to determine  their precious  and  base  metal  concentrations  and  confirm  the  presence  of mineralization.  The field sample locations are plotted on Figure 7.  Samples were dispatched to  SGS  Minerals  Laboratory  in  Toronto  for  analysis.    WGM  assay  results  are  tabulated  in Table 9 and are accompanied by historic assays for the same drill core intervals.  The assay certificates can be found in Appendix 4.  Spot checks comparing previous assay reports with the drill logs and the GEMCOM database were undertaken to check for accuracy.

Six  drill  sites  were  visited  and  the  collars  locations  verified  using  a  GPS  instrument.    The collar  locations  and  inclinations  were  verified  for  drillholes  E1,  E9,  MPS  151,  MPS  127, PRL95-1 and PRL95-1.  Most of the holes were clearly labelled with the hole number with casings still in place and capped.

One composite grab sample (MP-1) was taken of a tin lode zone in outcrop.  The gossan zone measured  0.5  to  2.0 m  in  width.    The  sample  returned  1.28% Zn,  1.17% Sn,  1.25% As, 3.0 g Ag/t  and  58 ppm In.    The  North  Zone  600  adit  and  Fire  Tower  Zone  900  adit  were located and visited.  The 900 adit, used to explore the No. 7 tin lode, was cemented shut with cinder  blocks  and  backfilled.    Grab  sample  MP-2  was  collected  from  the  900  adit  tailings. The sample contained sphalerite, fluorite and abundant galena hosted in Granite II (quartzfeldspar  porphyry).    Sample  MP-2  returned  41.3% Zn,  8.65% Pb,  2.60% Cu,  1.58% Sn, 111.0 g Ag/t and 339 ppm In, confirming the presence of the observed mineralization.  Mine survey station P7 was also located in the field.

## Drill Core Examination

On  November  10,  2005,  Paul  Dunbar,  assisted  by  G.  Kooiman,  examined  and  sampled portions of the drill core from the BTM (1A-69), Mount Pleasant Tungsten Mine (B24, B29, B99), Lac-Billiton Tin Project (C13, C35, C-95, LNZ-17, E1), Piskahegan (PRL 95-2) and ADEX (AM96-10) drill programs (Table 10).  Spot checks were made to cross-check sample intervals in the core boxes, core logging and verification that mineralization was present.  All information  compared  reasonably  well  with  the  author's  observations.    WGM  collected 12 grab  samples  of  the  mineralized  core,  numbered  MPC-1  to  MPC-12  (see  Table 2). Overall,  the  assay  results  compare  well  with  the  original  assays  obtained  over  the  same intervals  by  previous  operators  and  confirm  the  presence  of  tungsten,  molybdenum,  tin, indium,  bismuth  and  silver  mineralization  (see  Table  9).    No  significant  gold  assays  were obtained from any of the samples (highest was 239 ppb Au, MPC-2).  Sample MPC-3 from the Endogranitic Zone contained the highest value for tin (9.2% Sn) as well as 1,050 ppm In, higher  values  than  those  obtained  Lac-Billiton  in  1986.    The  highest  indium  value  of 1,570 ppm (0.16% In) with 13.7% Zn, 0.49% Sn and 0.15% MoS2, was obtained from sample MPC-9 collected from the No. 1 tin lode (North Zone).

## Kvaerner Metals Davy Ltd. Feasibility Study

Kvaerner conducted its own independent review comparing check assays with those reported from  the  historical  drill  programs  (North  Zone  and  Deep  Tin  Zone  samples  only).    They reviewed  all  the  available  check  assay  data  and  data  on  standards  and  concluded  that, although correlations were generally good (a statistical correlation of better than 0.99), the lack  of  precision  between  laboratories  is  partly  due  to  comparing  different  analytical techniques between laboratories.

The analyses of four composite samples for tin, tungsten oxide and arsenic by Lakefield from the  Billiton  drilling  program  were  15.20% lower  than  the  corresponding  Billiton  assays. These  differences  were  refereed  with  15  check  assays  sent  to  Carnon  Consolidated  Ltd., Cornwall (U.K.), Billiton, Arnhem, The Netherlands and Berstrom &amp; Bakka (South Africa). Lakefield results were established as correct.

A total of 36 checks on XRAL pulps for ADEX holes AM96-01 to -05 for bismuth, copper, indium, molybdenite, lead, tin and zinc was sent to Lakefield and the GSC for re-assaying. XRAL and the GSC analyzed all  elements  by  ICP/MS  whereas  Lakefield  analyzed  tin  by XRF, indium by ICPES and other elements by ICP.  According to Kvaerner Metals Davy Ltd., (1997), there was a problem with tin assays above 0.5%, which may have been related to the analytical method used.  It was determined that ICP/MS was good for samples containing low tin  concentrations.    Furthermore,  all  three  laboratories  were  in  agreement  at  the  lower concentrations.    XRAL  and  the  GSC  both  recommended  ICPES  for  samples  containing Sn&gt;0.5%.    With  the  exception  of  Sn,  assay  results  for  bismuth,  copper,  zinc  and  indium compared closely.

Forty-six  pulps  from  drillholes  AM96-06  to  -09  were  sent  to  Lakefield  for  tin  and  indium with one MP1A standard inserted.  It was determined that the Lakefield indium results were 13.4% lower than the standard.  Therefore, it was determined that only indium results from XRAL would be used by ADEX in their 'resource' estimates.

## 16.  MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING

## 16.1 TIN BASE METAL DEPOSITS

Mount Pleasant Mines Limited conducted metallurgical testing of drill cores between 1960 and  1965.    In  May  1963,  a  100-ton  bulk  sample  was  collected  from  the  North  Zone  for testing.  The sample was sent to Ottawa where the firm of Behre Dolbear conducted 'reserve' studies.  Bulk samples were also sent to Europe in 1964 (Kooiman, 2004).  In 1964, Bechtel prepared a feasibility and development study based mostly on the North Zone results and, in that same year, R. Hewlett of Colorado also prepared a computerized 'reserve' study.

## 16.2 PORPHYRY TUNGSTEN-MOLYBDENUM-BISMUTH DEPOSITS

In 1972 to 1973, BTM collected an 815-ton bulk sample from the North Zone 750 adit that was dispatched for metallurgical test work at an undisclosed laboratory (Parrish and Tully, 1976).  The next year, BTM drove the 400 adit (a 2.75 m by 5.5 m decline) into the highergrade  part  of  the  Fire  Tower  West  Zone  to  delineate  and  to  obtain  a  bulk  sample  of  the higher-grade  mineralization.    In  1976,  BTM  completed  its  metallurgical  studies  and  a feasibility  study  for  a  tungsten  mine  at  Mount  Pleasant  based  on  the  'reserves'  in  the  Fire Tower Zone.

## 16.2.1 STRATHCONA 1979 FEASIBILITY STUDY FOR BILLITON CANADA LTD.

## Metallurgical Test Work

Strathcona Mineral Services Limited was contracted by Billiton Canada Ltd. to complete a feasibility study that was completed in 1979 (Strathcona Mineral Services Limited, 1979).  As part of this study, metallurgical test work was conducted to identify the deposit mineralogy and  determine  what  applicable  process  would  maximize  mineral  recoveries.    Gravity, magnetic  and  flotation  processes  were  evaluated  as  well  as  combinations  of  these  three processes.    One  major  problem  that  was  identified  in  the  recovery  of  tungsten  was  the intergrowth of ferberite (FeWO4) with other minerals, which affected the ease of liberation of tungsten.    It  was  also  determined  that  the  magnetic  concentration  process  resulted  in  the

production of a low-grade tungsten concentrate assaying 2-4% WO3 containing a very high percentage of chlorite gangue and this was dismissed as a viable recovery process.

It  should  be  noted  that  chlorite  is  the  only  associated  mineral  that  could  create  problems during the grinding process.  According to Hosking (1985), chlorite is commonly associated with cassiterite and it is not readily released by grinding because it is flexible but not elastic. Therefore,  chlorite/cassiterite  composite  grains  may  be  lost  during  tabling  in  the  mill  and during magnetic separation as such composite grains may report with the magnetic fractions.

Two pilot plant programs were carried out in 1975, one to evaluate the gravity process at an Ottawa plant and one at the Nigadoo pilot plant to evaluate the flotation process.  As for the gravity testing, a 96-hour continuous test run was completed at the rate of approximately one half tonne per hour during which consistent metallurgy was obtained.

## The Nigadoo Bulk Sample Pilot Plant Test

As part of the feasibility study conducted by Strathcona Mineral Services Limited for Billiton in  1979,  a  10,000  tonne  bulk  sample  from  the  Fire  Tower  West  deposit  was  mined  from underground  (7,000 tonnes  from  the  Fire  Tower  West;  1,000 tonnes  from  the  Fire  Tower North; 2000 tonnes of stockpiled material).  The sample was shipped to Sullivan's Nigadoo mill in northern New Brunswick and was treated at a maximum rate of 150 tonnes per day in a  continuous mill test to evaluate the recovery of wolframite and molybdenite by flotation. This work included hydrometallurgical test work, Acid Bake Testing and nitric and aqua regia leach testing.  It was determined that both tungsten and molybdenum concentrate produced in the  flotation  phase  required  further  treatment  to  remove  impurities  by  hydrometallurgical processes in order to produce a marketable concentrate and that further test work was required before designing a full-scale commercial plant (Strathcona Mineral Services Limited, 1979).

This  work  further  demonstrated  that  final  tungsten  concentrates  grading  70% WO3 and containing less  than  0.05% arsenic,  and  final  molybdenum concentrates grading 85% MoS2 and containing less than 0.02% lead, copper and zinc, less than 0.05% arsenic and less than 0.1% bismuth  could  be  consistently  obtained  via  the  nitric  and  aqua  regia  leach  routes respectively.

At Nigadoo, considerable effort was spent determining the most suitable method for assaying for the primary metals of interest, particularly for tungsten.  The most successful method was identified  as  the  hydrochloric  acid  leach  method.    Copper,  lead,  zinc,  bismuth,  iron,  and molybdenum assays were completed with atomic absorption methods.

## 16.2.2 OPERATION OF THE MOUNT PLEASANT TUNGSTEN MINE

The  Mount  Pleasant  Tungsten  Mine  operated  for  less  than  two years  from  1983-85.    The mineral processing of the Fire Tower Zone deposits has been summarized below from Billiton Canada  Ltd.  (1985a).    Metallurgical  testing  by  Billiton  of  the  North  Zone  deposits  is summarized below from Billiton Canada Ltd. (1985b).

## Fire Tower Zone

The  concentrator  at  Mount  Pleasant  was  designed  to  process  650,000 tonnes  per year  and produce  2,000-2,500 tonnes  per year  of  70% WO3  tungsten  concentrate  (through  tungsten magnetic separation) and 700-1,000 tonnes per year of 85% MoS2 molybdenum concentrate (through molybdenum leaching steps), depending on the head grade.

The  tungsten  recoveries  estimated  in  the  Feasibility  Study  proved  to  be  optimistic.    The average tungsten recovery in 1984 was 51% due to losses of very fine grained wolframite. Subsequent  metallurgical  improvement  work  helped  to  increase  the  tungsten  recovery  to around 60%.

The principal minerals comprising the Fire Tower Zone deposits are quartz (70%), fluorite, topaz,  chlorite,  mica-clays,  feldspars  and  opaques.    The  opaque  minerals  included  about 0.5% Wolframite,  0.2% molybdenite,  0.03-1.0% arsenic  minerals  and  smaller  quantities  of copper, zinc, lead, bismuth, tin, silver and indium minerals.  The wolframite occurs as ironrich ferberite with a liberation size ranging from 50 to 200 microns.

Arsenic found in both arsenopyrite (FeAsS) and löllingite (FeAs2) was identified as the most deleterious contaminant .

The comminution circuit consisted of underground primary crushing followed by screening out of pebbles for the grinding circuit.  Screened undersize was crushed in a tertiary crusher

to provide mill feed.  A secondary crusher was used to crush oversize pebbles.  Autogenous grinding  was  chosen  because  the  testwork  demonstrated  iron  interference  with  wolframite flotation by steel grinding media.  The milled product size was 80%-75 microns.  The milled product then passed to a bulk sulphide flotation section where most of the sulphide minerals, including  molybdenite  and  arsenopyrite  were  floated  off.    The  circuit  tailings  contained around  97% Wolframite,  which  passed  to  the  tungsten  recovery  section.    The  tungsten recovery  started  with  the  rejection  of  slimes  using  three  stages  of  hydrocyclones  in  series. Approximately 90% of the wolframite was recovered to the underflows, which passed on to the next stage, which was the wolframite flotation circuit.

The  flotation  concentrate,  containing  about  30% WO3  and  20% arsenic,  was  leached  in sulphuric  acid  to  deactivate  or  eliminate  magnetic  iron  minerals,  and  then  after  filtration, passed to a high-gradient magnetic separation using a Sala machine.  The principal separation of wolframite from arsenic minerals was achieved through roughing and two cleaning stages to yield a 68-70% WO3 concentrate with arsenic levels of less than 1%.

Tungsten magnetic concentrate was then leached in ferric sulphate to further reduce arsenic impurity levels and then dewatered and packed in 250 kilogram drums or 1 tonne bags for shipment.

Molybdenite  was  to  be  recovered  from  the  bulk  sulphide  concentrate  (mentioned  earlier) using flotation with multiple cleaning stages.  The flotation circuit was designed to be capable of  producing  concentrate  grades  of  up  to  85% MoS2  at  60% recoveries.    This  concentrate required  leaching  to  reduce  impurity  levels.    The  leaching  circuit  consisted  of  preliminary heat  treatment  to  modify  particle  surfaces  to  reduce  foaming  in  the  subsequent  aqua  regia leach.  It was only partially commissioned due to low molybdenum prices.  The leach circuit incorporated  a  unit  for  the  removal  of  nitrous  fumes  from  the  waste  products.    Leached concentrate was then to be filtered, dried and bagged.

The  molybdenum  flotation  tailings contained enrichments of several metal sulphides including  copper,  lead,  zinc,  bismuth,  silver  and  indium . Bench-scale  flotation  testwork indicated that there is a potential to remove zinc and bismuth as a by-product of the tailings. Cassiterite was found to also occur in the Fire Tower Zone material but not in large enough quantities to evoke interest at that time.

The plant was equipped with an effluent treatment section, which received the various tailings streams.    Fluoride  and  heavy  metal  ions  were  removed  in  a  series  of  agitator  tanks  before being  discharged  by  gravity  to  the  nearby  tailings  pond.    At  that  time,  all  regulatory requirements with respect to effluent were achieved by this system.  The tailings water was decanted into the natural drainage system.  The tailings dam height was designed to support 20 years of mill production capacity.

Much  of  the  tungsten  loss  from  the  various  parts  of  the  circuit  was  associated  with  the generation of ultra-fines in the grinding circuit.  It was concluded that if iron could be proved to not interfere with the wolframite flotation process, all or parts of the grinding circuit could be replaced by steel media milling elements to reduce the generation of ultra-fines.  A test in this regard was never undertaken to prove or disprove this conclusion.

It was also concluded that a combination of gravity concentration for coarse wolframite and flotation for fine wolframite, after preliminary sulphide flotation in each case, might provide enhanced recovery, particularly if preceded by a rod/ball milling circuit (Billiton, 1985a).

Metallurgical and analytical laboratories established at the site handled  metallurgical testwork, environmental checking, concentrate quality and geological sampling.

## North Zone

Initial studies by Lakefield Research for Billiton indicated that approximately 70% of the tin was recoverable from the North Zone deposits.  At that time, no work had been undertaken to establish  the  recovery  level  of  the  other  metals  such  as  tungsten,  molybdenum,  zinc  and copper.

In  1985,  a  Phase  I  metallurgical  test  program  was  conducted  by  Lakefield  on  composite samples collected from the Contact and Upper/Lower Endogranitic Zones.  Cassiterite was found  to  be  the  main  tin  mineral,  accounting  for  more  than  95% of  the  tin.    A  sulphide mineral  (mawsonite)  accounted  for  the  remainder.    Cassiterite  usually  occurs  as  granular aggregate with gangue minerals averaging greater than 100 micron in diameter.

As far as liberation was concerned, heavy liquid studies on Contact Zone material indicated good  liberation  as  measured  by  tin  in  the  2.95  (specific  gravity)  floats  from  1  mm  size

particles.    Upper  Endogranitic  mineralization  showed  similar  results.    Samples  down  to 100 microns  from  the  Lower  Endogranitic  mineralization  had  poor  liberation.    Arsenic minerals  were  well  liberated  from  all  three  zones  at  relatively  coarse  sizes.    The  other sulphides did not perform as well.

Sulphide flotation tests using amyl xanthate collector and MIBC frother showed that 90% of the arsenic and over 80% of the total sulphides could be recovered to a rougher concentrate at a  grind  of  80% passing  220 microns,  with  a  loss  of  only  5% of  the  tin.    Finer  grains  gave slightly improved sulphide recoveries and lower tin losses.

Tin flotation after desliming had a recovery of 77% of the tin to a rougher concentrate and 45% to  a  third  cleaner  concentrate  at  a  grade  of  34% tin  using  styrene  phosphoric  acid collector at a grind of 80%-72 microns.  Most of the tin remaining in the tailing was in the +53 micron fractions.

Gravity concentration gave a recovery to rougher concentrate of 95%, a recovery to cleaner concentrate of 69% and a grade of 29% tin.  Topaz was identified as a diluent to the gravity concentrates  that  needed  to  be  removed.    Scouting  magnetic  separation  testwork  using  a Frantz Magnetic Separator on the 100-150 micron size fraction showed that over 60% of the tin reported to the magnetic fraction.

Both,  flotation  and  gravity  concentration  appeared  to  reach  a  limiting  concentrate  grade  of around 30% tin but gravity gave a better recovery on the -53 micron material.  According to Billiton Canada Ltd. (1985a), an appropriate flowsheet appeared to be a fairly coarse grind (80%-220 microns)  followed  by  sulphide  flotation,  size  separation  at  around  50 microns, gravity concentration of the +50 micron fraction, to give a concentrate of around 30% tin at an overall recovery of about 70%.

## 16.3 PORPHYRY TIN DEPOSITS

## 16.3.1 BULK SAMPLING PROGRAMS: LAC-BILLITON TIN PROJECT

Bulk samples were collected from the North Zone's Endogranitic Zone and the contact Crest deposit during October-November 1986 through underground development work to produce a feasibility  study  (Lac  Minerals  Ltd.,  1988).    Sampling  was  conducted  for  evaluation  of

horizontal  holes  through  the  zones  and  metallurgical  testing.    Representative  samples  were collected  using  an  on-site  sampling  plant  for  shipment  to  Lakefield  for  assaying.    All remaining material was stored in the 'A-Frame' on-site where it remains today.  The source of information provided below is from Lac Minerals Ltd. (1988).

## Endogranitic Zone Bulk Sample

A bulk sample drift (Section 2A), also called the '2A Bulk Sample Drift', was pre-drilled to define the limits of the deposit prior to underground development.  Two holes were drilled horizontally from the 950 exploration drift through the Endogranite Zone from the hanging wall to footwall.  Hole C82 was collared 1.14 m northwest of hole C81.  The core was logged, spit and assayed.  The 2A bulk sample drift, measuring 3.5 x 4.0 m (cross section) advanced at  3.0  to  3.4 m  rounds  (11  rounds  in  total).    Each  round  of  muck  was  processed  as  an individual bulk sample.  Each face in the ore was mapped, chip sampled and photographed. Bulk  comparisons  were  very  good.    Hole  C81  averaged  0.71% Sn  and  hole  C82  averaged 0.73% Sn.  The bulk sample averaged 0.72% Sn (Kvaerner Metals Davy Ltd., 1997).

## Contact Crest Zone Bulk Sample

The  sample  site  was  located  at  the  east  side  of  the  North  Zone  Access  Decline  between 13,630 N and 13,650 N.  It was pre-drilled by hole C13, which was logged and sampled.  The procedure  for  collecting  the  Crest  deposit  bulk  sample  was  the  same  as  that  of  the Endogranite Zone (described below).  A total of 2,582 tonnes of material was collected.

## Bulk Sample Processing and Results

Each bulk sample from the two zones was trucked to surface, crushed to minus 5/8' and run through a three-stage sample tower.  A total of 1,728 tonnes of Endogranite Zone material grading  0.79% Sn  was  processed  and  195.8 tonnes  grading  0.83% Sn  was  shipped  to Lakefield.  The crest bulk sample totalled 854 tonnes grading 1.0% Sn.  A total of 84.6 tonnes grading 1.08% Sn was shipped to Lakefield.

A comparison of the tin and arsenic values for the total bulk sample, the shipped sample and the  average  of  the  calculated  heads  at  Lakefield  is  given  in  Table  11.    Results  for  the Endogranite Zone bulk sample compared very well.  The discrepancies with the Crest deposit

may have resulted from incomplete blending of the two high-grade and two low-grade rounds taken  underground.    A  total  of  20 tonnes  of  the  shipped  Crest  sample,  not  used  for metallurgical tested, remained in storage at Lakefield at the end of the project.

There was a poor correlation of assay results between individual core lengths from drillholes and the corresponding blasted rounds.  This correlation illustrates the erratic distribution of tin mineralization within the Endogranite Zone and Crest deposit.  However, there was a better correlation  between  assays  of  complete  intersections  by  drillholes  and  bulk  sample  results leading to the conclusion that the drillhole grades were acceptable for use in estimating North Zone 'ore reserves'.

## 16.3.2 J.S. REDPATH MINING CONSULTANTS METALLURGICAL TESTING/FLOWSHEET

In 1987, J.S. Redpath Mining Consultants Limited of North Bay, Ontario, prepared a threevolume report on ore handling alternatives for tin ore from the North Zone.  Metallurgical test work results from Lakefield indicated promising recoveries.  After completing a substantial amount of bench-scale test work, a two-month period of pilot plant testing on bulk samples of the two main types of mineralization (Endogranitic and Contact) was carried out at Lakefield from January to March 1987.  This led to the development of a flowsheet, which used many of  the  process  features  found  in  the  successful  Wheal Jane operation in Cornwall, U.K.  A metallurgical  balance  indicated  an  overall  recovery  of  64% of  the  tin  into  a  concentrate grading 36.9% Sn, combining gravity and flotation concentrates (Kooiman, 2004).

## COMINCO ENGINEERING SERVICES LTD. METALLURGICAL TESTWORK/FLOWSHEET

In 1989, Novagold Resources Inc. contracted Cominco Engineering Services Ltd. to conduct metallurgical  work  on  the  tin  ore  from  the  North  Zone  to  investigate  its  potential  as  a polymetallic mineral deposit and develop a new flowsheet utilizing a flotation plant bioleach process described below by ADEX Mining Corp. (1995).  As part of this study, 30 tonnes of material were shipped to Lakefield for metallurgical testwork (Kooiman, 2004).

## Flotation Plant

Cominco developed a new flowsheet in 1991.  The circuit consists of a rod mill followed by a ball  mill  in  closed  circuit  with  cyclones.    A  Falcon  Concentrator  (a  high  intensity  gravity separator  using  centrifugal  force)  was  included  to  treat  the  cyclone  overflow.    Magnetic separators are necessary to remove grinding steel and other magnetic constituents, which will destroy the effectiveness of the Styrene Phosphoric Acid ('SPA') used as the tin collector.  The non-magnetic flow is conditioned in preparation for sulphide flotation.  The sulphide rougher concentrate is retreated in a cleaner column.  The column concentrate becomes the feed for the bioleach process. The rougher tails are conditioned with sulphuric acid and SPA before feeding the tin rougher cells.  The rougher concentrate is cleaned in two stages of column cells.  The rougher tails feed a bank of scavenger cells. The scavenger concentrate is combined with the first cleaner tails for desliming prior to returning to the roughers.

Cominco concluded that flotation plants were simpler to operate than gravity plants and that a flotation plant was easier to monitor and control than a gravity plant.

The initial bench tests on the Mount Pleasant material yielded a concentrate grading 43% tin at 80% recovery.

Cominco also noted that column cells had been successfully used to upgrade tin concentrate at both the Wheal Jane Mine and at the East Kemptville Tin Mine.  At both mines, concentrate grades had been improved by 6-11%.

For cash flow purposes, Cominco used a tin grade of 50% at a recovery of 80%.  The flotation circuit was also successful in reducing the arsenic in the tin concentrate to less than 0.4%.  The

information  from  the  bench  tests  was  sent  to  smelters  for  concentrate  acceptability  and  for calculation of penalties.  The smelter charges were used in the cash flows.

Cominco designed  a  flotation  plant  in  1991.    Detailed  capital  and  operating  costs  were  also developed for a 1,500 tonne per day ('tpd') mill. These costs were increased by inflation and scaled up to give a capital and operating cost estimate for a 2,000 tonne per day mill.  The plant was designed using as much of the infrastructure and equipment remaining from the tungsten plant  as  was  possible.    The  costs  for  additional  required  purchases  were  based  on  all  new equipment.  There was an opportunity for significant cost savings by purchasing used equipment from  the  East  Kemptville  Tin  Mine.    Much  of  the  equipment  from  Mount  Pleasant  was purchased for the East Kemptville Tin Mine when the Mount Pleasant Tungsten Mine closed.

## Bioleach Process

Initially, work  concentrated  on  utilizing  pressure  leach  technology  to  treat  the  sulphide concentrate from the tin circuit.  After a preliminary economic analysis, it was found that the pressure leach technology was too expensive to recover the sulphide metals.  In August 1994, a sample  of the sulphide concentrate was  provided  to the Research  and  Productivity Council ('RPC') in New Brunswick to determine if the concentrate was amenable to a bioleach process.  The bacterial strain used was taken from water at one of the waste dumps at Mount Pleasant and cultured.  The natural bacteria at Mount Pleasant had already mutated to live on the Mount Pleasant mineralization.  The main target for the bioleach process was the indium.  In the 120  days  of  the  agitated  leach  test,  80% of  the  indium  was  solubilized.    Zinc,  copper  and bismuth were also solubilized at about the same level.  Bismuth was to be studied in further tests to determine if more metal could be extracted.  It was concluded that potential operating costs for  bioleach  were about 20% of the costs of pressure leach.  Mount Pleasant Mine would be expected to produce between 10 to 30 tonnes of sulphide concentrate per day depending on the type of mineralization processed.

Piskahegan planned to use a combination of metal cementation and Solvent Extraction ('SX') to recover the metals from solution.  Their plan was to produce an 80% indium cement (zinc powder as a cementing agent), a bismuth cement (lead powder as a cementing agent), a copper cement (scrap iron as a cementing agent) and zinc metal with a small electrowinning cell.

## WGM-SUPERVISED FEASIBILITY STUDY

In 1990, a feasibility study was initiated and supervised by WGM with involvement of Davy Canada Inc (Davy Canada Inc., 1990).  A Study Report proposed construction of a 1,500 tpd tin concentrator at the Mount Pleasant property.  The design basis and flowsheet for the plant were developed based on testwork, which was completed by Lakefield.

The tin concentration facility was designed to provide a low-grade tin concentrate to feed an on-site chlorination plant, provided by others. The concentration facility included underground  crushing  and  conveying  and  consisted  of  surface  storage  and  crushing,  dense medium  separation,  coarse  and  fine  gravity  concentration,  fine-tin  flotation,  concentrate regrinding, sulphide flotation and concentrate thickening and filtration.  The total estimated capital cost of the concentrator was $20.67 million.

At approximately the same time as the WGM study was underway, Novagold commissioned a mineralogical study of 40 core samples from the various deposit areas in the North Zone.  The study was carried out by H.W. Fander of Central Mineralogical Services of Australia.  Fander was  recommended  by  East  Kemptville  Tin  Mine  management  and  was  credited  with pinpointing  the  cause  of  large  amounts  of  fines  produced  during  concentration  (large cassiterite  crystals  are  micro-fractured  and  stressed  and  fall  readily  apart  into  fines  during processing).  According to Kooiman (2004), the Fander report, completed in May 1990, was probably the best mineralogical report carried out on tin mineralization at Mount Pleasant.

## 16.4 TIN-INDIUM BASE METAL DEPOSITS

In 1991 and 1992, 600 samples of mineralized and unmineralized rocks from the Fire Tower West  Zone  were  analyzed  for  indium.    Until  then,  only  around  50  indium  assays  were available.

In  early  1993,  due  diligence  work  was  carried  out  by  WGM  and  samples  were  shipped  to Lakefield  and  Cominco  (Kooiman,  2004).    A  bismuth-bearing  concentrate  was  shipped  to SIDECH, a bismuth smelter and refiner near Brussels, Belgium.

That  same year,  Piskehegan  continued  to  develop  the  metallurgical  processes  including  a bioleach process for the treatment of tin-sulphides from the North and Deep Tin Zones and prepared a new pre-feasibility study (ADEX Mining Inc., 1995).

Piskahegan  collected  over  2,000  samples  of  previously  drilled  core  and  analyzed  them  for indium (Kooiman, 2004).  The samples were mostly diamond drill core rejects and pulps from the North Zone.  In addition, pulps from underground chip samples collected in the sixties and seventies from the 600, 750 and 900 adit workings were also analyzed.  Over 80 samples from the  deeper  underground  development  in  the  North  Zone  were  added  to  complete  the investigation.

The investigation confirmed the widespread occurrence of indium, in particular, in the tinzinc-copper rich deposits.  The average indium content from 2,376 samples was 112.6 ppm (Table 12).  The highest recorded indium value was 8,690 ppm.  One in every eleven samples yielded  over  300 ppm  In. Most  of  the  high  values,  those  exceeding  1,000 ppm  In,  were collected from the southern part of the Deep Tin Zone and the Fire Tower North Zone.

In September 1994, D.M. Fraser Services Ltd. prepared a report for Piskahegan reviewing the feasibility  of  producing  tin,  indium,  base  metals  and  rare  earth  metals  from  the  Mount Pleasant  deposits  utilizing  all  work  conducted  on  the  property  since  1987.    A  financial analysis was prepared based on the North Zone (including the Deep Tin Zone) and utilizing tin flotation and pressure leach circuits for sulphide minerals followed by solvent extraction (D.M. Fraser Services Ltd., 1994).

In January 1995, a 100-kg sample was shipped to RPC to start bacterial inoculums leaching for bioleach test work.

## 16.5 METALLURGICAL PROCESSING AND TESTING BY ADEX

In  June  1995,  work  started  to  prepare  a  30-tonne  sample  for  a  bioleach  test  heap  at  RPC (Kooiman,  2004).    High-grade  material  with  zinc  and  zinc-copper  mineralization  was collected  from  the  dumps  of  the  600  adit  and,  to  a  lesser  extent,  from  the  900  adit.    The sample  was  shipped  to  RPC  at  the  end  of  July  1995.    It  assayed  4.93% Zn,  0.75% Cu, 0.91% Sn and 0.019% In.

During  mid-August,  a  1.0-tonne  high-grade  ore  sample  was  collected  from  the  600  adit dumps and shipped to RPC for direct bioleaching tests (Kooiman, 2004).  The sample assayed 6.54% Zn, 6.26% Cu, 2.64% Sn, 7.98% As, 0.40% Bi and 0.097% In.

In the fall of 1995, the technical program was redesigned, shifting from heap leach technology to the operation of a continuous stirred tank reactor ('CSTR') system. Initially, at RPC and later on at the minesite (Kooiman, 2004).  The feed for this work was again collected from the 600 adit dump, as a 5-tonne sample, grading 11.06% Zn, 1.38% Cu, 3.64% As and 0.131% In. The sample was shipped to the Technical University of Nova Scotia ('TUNS') in Halifax for processing  by  flotation.    The  flotation  concentrates  were  shipped  back  to  RPC  and  Mount Pleasant by the end of 1995.

## 16.5.1 KVAERNER 1996/97 FEASIBILITY STUDY - NORTH ZONE

On June 25, 1996, ADEX awarded the preparation of a feasibility study to Kvaerner, formerly Davy International Canada Ltd. The study was to be used as the basis for arranging project financing to re-establish a mining and processing operation at Mount Pleasant. The study was nearing  completion  when  the  mining  markets  suffered  a  significant  setback  in  1997  in  the aftermath of the Bre-X scandal.

The scope of the study included the audit and verification of ADEX's 'reserve' estimates of the North Zone and Deep Tin Zone to support a production rate of 2,000 tpd, an operating schedule of 7 d/wk and the recovery of tin, indium, copper, zinc and bismuth.  During the course of the study the production rate was increased to 2,500 tpd, by using economies of scale, in an attempt to improve the project economics.

Several samples were shipped to Lakefield in 1996 and in January 1997 (Kooiman, 2004).  A 60-kg sample was shipped to Lakefield in August 1996 and processed in September for the evaluation  of  new  collectors  in  the  tin  flotation  circuit.    The  sample  assayed  0.78% Sn, 0.081% Cu, 0.38% Zn, 0.62% As and 0.002% In.  A second, 1-tonne sample, was shipped in October and was used for bench scale flotation work at Lakefield in November.  This sample assayed 0.79% Sn, 0.18% Cu, 0.67% Zn, 0.73% As and 0.007% In.

In the fall of 1996, a 30-tonne bulk sample was collected by ADEX for metallurgical testing and  pilot  plant  testing  at  Lakefield  in  support  of  the  feasibility  study.    The  sample  was  to represent  the  average  composition  of  the  total  North  Zone  and  much  attention  was  paid  to how it was collected (Kooiman, 2004).  Approximately two thirds of the sample consisted of material  originally  collected  by  LAC  from  the  Endogranitic  and  Contact  Zones  (Table 13). The  remaining  one  third  of  the  sample  came  from  underground  development  samples, underground core drilling rejects, surface diamond drill core rejects and 2.4 tonnes of rejects and split core from the 1996 surface drilling programs.

The bulk sample left Mount Pleasant on January 8, 1997 and portions of this material were used for a continuous pilot plant test at Lakefield to meet the following objectives (Kooiman, 2004):

- · To  achieve  a  tin  recovery  of  greater  than  80% and  a  concentrate  grade  greater  than 40% tin and less than 0.5% arsenic; and
- · To maximize the recovery of indium into a sulphide concentrate suitable for treatment by bacterial leach technology.

The Lakefield sample assayed 0.79% Sn, 0.67% Zn and 70 ppm In.

Good results were obtained in sulphide flotation and in the recovery of coarse tin (Kooiman, 2004).    Poor  results  were  obtained  in  the  flotation  of  fine  tin  and  further  laboratory development  work  was  recommended  on  fine-tin  flotation,  however,  the  program  was curtailed at that point.

A few hundred additional diamond drill pulps were selected in 1997 for indium analysis for the Deep Tin Zone area.  'Reserve' calculations were then carried out on the Upper Deep Tin Zone and smaller bodies such as the near-surface No. 4 tin lode.

## Kvaerner Study Recommendations and Conclusions

A  mixture  of  sublevel  caving  and  long  hole  stoping  was  recommended  for  an  efficient extraction of ore. The proposed mine design included access by inclined ramps, ore transport by truck to an underground crusher and then by belt conveyor to surface.

The ore would be processed at three processing plants for which the study prepared general arrangements and flowsheets.

The existing mill building was to be modified to process run-of-mine ore to produce a zincindium flotation concentrate as bioleach feed and a tin concentrate for smelting.

The study concluded the following:

- · A  new  bioleach  plant  would  utilize  a  bacteria  oxidation  process  to  separate  the  base metals into an oxidized sulphate solution;
- · A new hydromet plant would produce indium, zinc and copper in a series of reduction, precipitation and solvent extraction stages;
- · The  existing  surface  facilities  at  the  Mount  Pleasant  property  would  be  re-used  to  the greatest extent possible;
- · The  estimated  capital  costs  of  bringing  the  property  into  operation  were  $102 million based on mid-1997 costs;
- · The operating costs were estimated at $44.34/t of ore, which was broken down into a mine operating cost of $19.40/t and a process operating cost of $24.94/t;
- · Financial analyses were conducted on two cases: a 'mineable resource' of 3.6 million tonnes and an 8 million tonnes 'resource'. For both cases the net present value ('NPV') and the internal rate of return ('IIR') were negative and the break-even tin price was above US$3/0.45 kg; and
- · The  study  proposed  an  alternative  and  in  WGM's  opinion  more  attractive  scenario, whereby  the  facility would  produce  a  tin concentrate and  an indium-copper-zinc concentrate.  Kvaerner's  preliminary  financial  analysis,  based  on  1997  costs,  showed  a NPV of $62 million (at a discount rate of zero) and an IRR of 13.3%.

In  the  fall  of  2001,  a  request  was  made  by  CANMET  in  Ottawa  for  ADEX  to  supply  its mineral science laboratories with mineralized material for the manufacture of a new Mount Pleasant  standard  (Kooiman,  2004).    CANMET had almost depleted its supply of MP 1-A standard, which was made in the early eighties using No. 7 tin lode mineralization taken from the 900 adit dumps.  The MP 1-A standard, with a recommended indium value of 0.033% In ±10 ppm,  has  been  widely  used  during  indium  assaying  campaigns  at  Mount  Pleasant. Standard MP1-A replaced the first standard made from Mount Pleasant ores, MP-1 (1978) with  recommended  values  of  15.90% Zn,  2.43% Sn,  2.09% Cu,  1.88% Pb,  0.014% Mo, 0.069% In, 0.024% Bi, 0.77% As and 57.9 g Ag/t.

According to Kooiman (2004), an 800-kg sample was shipped to CANMET  in December 2001.  It contained material from the 900 adit dump (125 kg), the breccia pipe of the  Fire  Tower  Zone  (300 kg),  the  600  adit  dump  (325 kg)  and  tungsten-molybdenumbismuth mineralization from the 'A-frame' (50 kg).  Some of the material collected from the 600 adit dump is rich in chalcopyrite, fluorite and characterized by cm-sized radial aggregates of black tourmaline.  This material originated from the 310 East drift of the 600 adit where muck  samples  were  taken  in  1965  averaged  5.58% Cu,  1.47% Zn  and  0.84% Sn.    A few tonnes of this material are present in the core shack, stored in 45-gallon drums.

The  Mineral  Resource  estimates  were  prepared  and  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the provisions of NI 43-101 guidelines and the CIM standards.

For the purposes of this report, the relevant definitions for the CIM Standards are as follows:

- A Mineral  Resource is  a  concentration  or  occurrence  of  diamonds,  natural  solid inorganic  material,  or  natural  solid  fossilized  organic  material  including  base  and precious metals, coal, and industrial minerals in or on the Earth's crust in such form and  quantity  and  of  such  a  grade  or  quality  that  it  has  reasonable  prospects  for economic  extraction.  The  location,  quantity,  grade,  geological  characteristics  and continuity of a Mineral Resource are known, estimated or interpreted from specific geological evidence and knowledge.

An 'Inferred  Mineral  Resource' is  that  part  of  a  Mineral  Resource  for  which quantity and grade or quality can be estimated on the basis of geological evidence and limited  sampling  and  reasonably  assumed,  but  not  verified,  geological  and  grade continuity.  The  estimate  is  based  on  limited  information  and  sampling  gathered through  appropriate  techniques  from  locations  such  as  outcrops,  trenches,  pits, workings and drillholes.

- An 'Indicated  Mineral  Resource' is  that  part  of  a  Mineral  Resource  for  which quantity,  grade  or  quality,  densities,  shape  and  physical  characteristics,  can  be estimated with a level of confidence sufficient to allow the appropriate application of technical and economic parameters, to support mine planning and evaluation of the economic  viability  of  the  deposit.  The  estimate  is  based  on  detailed  and  reliable exploration  and  testing  information  gathered  through  appropriate  techniques  from locations  such  as  outcrops,  trenches,  pits,  workings  and  drillholes  that  are  spaced closely enough for geological and grade continuity to be reasonably assumed.
- A 'Measured  Mineral  Resource' is  that  part  of  a  Mineral  Resource  for  which quantity,  grade  or  quality,  densities,  shape,  and  physical  characteristics  are  so  well established  that  they  can  be  estimated  with  confidence  sufficient  to  allow  the appropriate application of technical and economic parameters, to support production planning  and  evaluation  of  the  economic  viability  of  the  deposit.  The  estimate  is based on detailed and reliable exploration, sampling and testing information gathered through  appropriate  techniques  from  locations  such  as  outcrops,  trenches,  pits, workings  and  drillholes  that  are  spaced  closely  enough  to  confirm  both  geological and grade continuity.

## 17.2 GENERAL MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATION PROCEDURES

The Mineral Resource estimate procedures consisted of:

- · Database compilation and verification;
- · Development of 3-D wireframe models within major lithological units, using the suite of geochemical assays available for each drillhole sample interval; and
- · Generation  of  block  models  for  Mineral  Resource  estimates  for  the  Fire  Tower  Zone, using a geostatistical approach applying ordinary Kriging and carrying out comparative estimations  using  Inverse  Distance  Squared  ('ID ')  and  Nearest  Neighbour  ('NN') 2 methods.

## 17.3 DATABASE

## 17.3.1 GENERAL

Data used to generate the Mineral Resource estimates originated from a Gemcom Software International  Inc. ('Gemcom  or  GEMS')  Project  converted  from  an  older  version  of Gemcom software.  This GEMS project was created by ADEX in 1997.  The GEMS Project contained three separate drillhole databases pertaining to three Mount Pleasant zones, namely

the Fire Tower Zone, the Saddle Zone and the North Zone (not to be confused with the North Zone portion of the Fire Tower Zone).  WGM has not validated the data for the North Zone and Saddle Zone workspaces as they were not part of this study.

The  Fire Tower  Zone  drillhole  database  consisted  of 676  collar locations (in Mine Coordinates), geological codes, and 24,544 assay intervals with multi-element values (% of MoS2, WO3, Sn, Cu, Zn, Pb, Bi, As, Ca, Fe and In (ppm)). The data were provided in digital form on a CD.

Additional  information,  including  copies  of  the  geological  logs,  mine  workings,  historical 'mineral  resource'  estimates  and  geological  interpretations  were  supplied  as  paper  copies. Occasionally, Excel  spreadsheets  or faxes containing  additional data (e.g., geological information  or  assays)  from  the  site  were  either  e-mailed  or  hand  delivered  to  WGM  by ADEX.

Twenty-five  east-west  cross  sections  (with  spacing  varying  between  12  and  31 m),  18 north-south  cross  sections  (with  25 m  spacing)  and  15  radial  cross  sections  (approximately 10 m spacing) were generated by WGM to coincide with the historical sections interpreted by ADEX.

## 17.3.2 DATA VALIDATION

Upon receipt of the data, WGM performed the following validation steps:

- 9 Checking for location and elevation discrepancies  by comparing collar coordinates with the copies of the original drill logs received from the site;
- 9 Checking minimum and maximum values for each quality value field and confirming/modifying those outside of expected ranges;
- 9 Checking  for inconsistency in lithological unit terminology and/or gaps in the lithological code; and
- 9 Checking for gaps, overlaps and out of sequence intervals for both assays and lithology tables.

The Assay table contained several errors, i.e., 'composite length greater than hole length', 'out  of  sequence  interval'  or  'negative  value  interval',  which  were  easily  corrected.    The

- 'zero  length  interval'  errors  indicated  drillholes  with  no  assay  values.    For  four  drillholes

with  no  assays  and  located  in  the  main  mineralized  zone,  WGM  requested  additional sampling and the resulting new assay data was added to the database.  Within the Lithology table,  a  few  of  the  drillholes  have  missing  intervals.    These  were  corrected  using  drill  logs provided  by  ADEX.    After  the  corrections  were  completed,  the  database  was  in  relatively good order and no errors were identified that would have a significant impact on the Mineral Resource estimate.

## 17.3.3 DATABASE MANAGEMENT

The drillhole  data  were  stored  in  a  GEMS  multi-tabled  workspace  specifically  designed  to manage  collar  and  interval  data.    Other  data,  like  surface  contours  or  cross  sectional geological  interpretations  were  stored  in  multi-tabled  polyline  workspaces.    The  project database also stored section and level plan definitions, 3-D surfaces and solids, and the block models, such that all data pertaining to the project are stored within the same project database.

## 17.4 GEOLOGICAL MODELLING PROCEDURES

## 17.4.1 GENERAL

In general, the modelling procedures were as follows:

- · Geological interpretation and digitizing of lithological outlines;
- · 3-D surface (TIN) and solid/wireframe creation;
- · Database manipulation and compositing;
- · Statistical analysis and variography;
- · Block grade estimation; and
- · Classification and reporting of Mineral Resources.

## 17.4.2 GEOLOGICAL INTERPRETATION AND DIGITIZING

## Section Definitions

Vertical sections were defined for the Fire Tower West and North zones, and were oriented to coincide with original ADEX vertical sections.  It should be noted that the original east-west ('E-W') sections had a spacing that varied from section to section, from less than 10 m to 31 m.  This irregularity in spacing of original sections was maintained to ensure consistency

and alignment with historical drilling.  The north-south (long) sections were defined with a standard  25 m  separation.    In  the  Fire  Tower  North  Zone,  additional  radial  sections  were created to best fit the orientation of underground holes.

In  total,  25  north-looking  vertical  (cross)  sections,  18  west-looking  vertical  (long)  sections and 15 radial sections were defined for the Fire Tower West and Fire Tower North Zones. Figure 8 shows the drillhole plan (collars only) and the section locations.

## Geological Interpretation of the Fire Tower Zone

The boundaries of the mineralized body were interpreted manually by Mr. Boyd on 58 drill section plots ranging spatially from less than 10 m to 31 m apart orientated E-W, north-south ('N-S')  and  radial  with  reference  to  the  mine  grid  coordinates.   Geological  interpretation identified at least three main W-Mo mineralized units named Fire Tower Breccia ('FT-BX'), Granite I ('GR1') and Quartz Feldspar Porphyry ('QFP'), however, these units were found to be not consistently mineralized and the mineralization commonly cut across geological units and structural boundaries.  The wide variety and inconsistency of the geological units hosting potentially  economic  mineralization  meant  that  boundaries  were  defined  based  solely  on %WO3 and %MoS2 values that were plotted on the cross sections.  Boundaries were drawn halfway between drill holes, and if no holes existed to limit the mineralization outlines, the boundaries were extended to a maximum of 20 m away from the nearest hole.  In general, extensions of the boundaries were made consistent with the trends defined by joining known cutoff boundaries.  A minimum width of three metres was used for defining the zones.

For some holes, the database contained assay values for Sn, Zn, Cu, As, Bi, Pb, Ca, Fe, Au, Ag and In.  A fourth mineralized unit named Granite II ('GR2') was found to host important Sn-In-base metal mineralization.  However, these elements and this mineralized unit were not incorporated  into  the  Mineral  Resource  estimate  because  they  possess  vastly  different processing  and  recovery  challenges,  and  thus  must  be  assessed  economically  as  separate mineralized bodies.  Such an assessment is beyond the scope of this report.  In places, this mineralization was found to be adjacent to, and even to overlap, the W-Mo mineralized body.

## Cutoff Grade

Mineralized  zones  were  originally  defined  as  an  upper  tungsten  zone  based  on  a  cutoff  of 0.15% WO3,  and  a  separate smaller lower molybdenum  zone  based  on  a  cutoff of

<!-- image -->

0.20% MoS2.  As the building of the model progressed, this concept was changed to a single cutoff for zone definition, i.e., a 0.3% WO3 equivalent ('Eq'), in which WO3 Eq = %WO3 + 1.5 x %MoS2.   The WO3 Eq cutoff was chosen because of the close geological and spatial relationship between the elements, and its formula was based on the average previous 10-year ratio of the price of Mo to W, consistent with the premise of a mine life for the Fire Tower Zone of +10 years.  The use of the WO3 Eq cutoff resulted in the modeling of a significantly more coherent, integrated and potentially mineable mineralized body.

The value of the Fire Tower Zone W-Mo mineralization at the WO3 Eq cutoff is US$27/tonne (C$30) at a chosen tungsten price of US$90/MTU (US$9.0/kg WO3) based upon the mine life of +10 years and the previous ten year price relationship between W and Mo.  This assumed metal  price/Eq  grade  cutoff  is  a  reasonable  one  for  the  purposes  of  preparing  a  Mineral Resource estimate, particularly considering that the assumed prices are far below early June 2006 prices, which are approximately US$18/kg WO3 and US$25/lb for MoS2.

## Digitizing Geological Interpretations and Solid/3-D Wireframe Creation

The  original  manually  drawn  cross  sectional  interpretations  of  the  mineralization  were digitized into a GEMS polyline workspace.  Each polyline was assigned an appropriate rock type and stored with its section definition (Figure 9).  Three types of polylines were created, each representing separate zones: WO3 Zone, MoS2 Zone and WO3 Eq Zone.  Special care was taken to ensure that the digitized lines were 'snapped' to drillhole intervals.  This step allows for the creation of a true 3-D wireframe that honours the 3-D position of the drillhole interval.  This is important because some drillholes were substantially offset from the cross section midpoint.

In total, 13 sections in the Fire Tower West Zone and 15 sections in the Fire Tower North Zone  have  digitized  sectional  polylines.    Digitized  sectional  interpretations  of  geological polylines  and  drillhole  information  were  plotted  for  verification  and  potential  changes.    A number of the longitudinal sections with the polygons projected from the cross sections was also plotted to ensure correlation between sections.  All changes were digitally updated and stored in the GEMS polyline workspace.

The geological polylines digitized on the vertical sections were joined using special polylines (tie  lines)  in  order  to  produce  separate  3-D  solids/wireframes  for  each  zone,  so  individual

<!-- image -->

volumes and tonnages could be reported.  In total, five geological wireframes were created; WO3 Zone, MoS2 Zone and WO3 Eq Zone in the Fire Tower West area, and WO3 Zone and WO3 Eq Zone in the Fire Tower North area.  Only the WO3 Eq zones were utilized in the block model generation.

## Digitizing Mine Workings and Stopes and 3-D Wireframe Creation

WGM also digitized outlines of the mine workings and mined-out stopes based on the most up-to-date  level  plans  and  vertical  sections  provided  by  ADEX.    The  lines  were  initially digitized using AutoCAD software and then exported as a DXF file for each level plan.  The DXF files were imported into a GEMS polyline workspace created specifically for the mine workings and stopes for 3-D wireframe/solid generation (Figure 10).  In total, polylines for seven level plans and five stopes were produced.

All the workings polylines were 'extruded' into solids in GEMS using a 4 m corridor width (height of the cross-cuts and drifts) as control for defining the third dimension of each solid. This methodology represents a simple approach for generating solids, and it is sufficient at this  level  of  study  to  define  this  type  of  geometric  shape.    WGM  did  not  produce  3-D wireframes of the ramps joining the mine levels.

Solids  representing  mine  stopes  were  created  in  a  similar  manner  to  the  geological  solids using  polylines  and  tie  lines. Polylines  digitized  from  the  level  plan  outlines  were incorporated for solid generation and the cross sections served as vertical limits for the stopes. Because of limited  information  regarding  the  actual  shape  of  the  stopes,  the  created  solids provide only an approximate volume of the mined material.

## Topographic Surface Creation

A  topographic  surface  or  triangulated  irregular  network  ('TIN')  was  created  using  collar elevations of the holes drilled from surface for the entire Mount Pleasant Project.  Altogether, the generation of the topographic surface incorporated 448 drillhole collars.

## 17.5 DATABASE PREPARATION, STATISTICAL ANALYSIS AND COMPOSITING

## 17.5.1 BACK-CODING OF ROCK CODE FIELD

The 3-D solids that represented the interpreted mineralized zones were used to back-code a rock code field into the drillhole workspace.  Each interval in the assay table was assigned a new rock code value based on the rock type solid that the interval midpoint fell within.  Only the two WO3 Eq geological solids, Fire Tower West and Fire Tower North, were back-coded and considered for the Mineral Resource estimate.

## 17.5.2 DRILLHOLE DATA CONVERSION

The GEMS software drillhole data were converted into a format compatible with software developed  by Geostat  Systems  International  Inc. ('Geostat')  for  statistical/geostatistical analysis  and  block  modelling.    Although  the  database  contained  multiple  elements  assayed (MoS2, WO3, Sn, Cu, Zn, Pb, Bi, As, Ca, Fe), for the purpose of this study, only MoS2 and WO3 have been investigated.

Table 15 presents basic statistics of the drillhole data, regardless of their position with respect to  the  mineralized  envelope  and  Figure  11  shows  the  3-D  drillhole  distribution  in  the  Fire Tower Zone.

TABLE 15 BASIC STATISTICS OF DRILLHOLE SAMPLES

## 17.5.3 PREPARATION OF ASSAY COMPOSITES

In order to carry out the variography and Mineral Resource block modelling, a set of equal length  composites  of  2.5 m  was  generated  from  the  raw  drillhole  intervals.    Table  16 summarizes the statistics of the composites inside the mineralized envelope above 0.01% WO3 and 0.01% MoS2 for the West and North zones.

TABLE 16 BASIC STATISTICS OF 2.5 m COMPOSITES

| Sector   | Element   | Number   |   Minimum   (%) |   Maximum   (%) |   Average   (%) | C.O.V.   |
|----------|-----------|----------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|----------|
| West     | MoS2      | 3,680    |            0.01 |            2.48 |            0.21 | 61.5%    |
| West     | WO3       | 3,683    |            0.01 |            4.3  |            0.34 | 82.2%    |
| North    | MoS2      | 1,698    |            0.01 |            1.18 |            0.2  | 69.5%    |
| North    | WO3       | 1,690    |            0.01 |            4.04 |            0.38 | 87.1%    |

The statistical distributions of both MoS2 and WO3 show lognormal distributions (Figures 12 to 15) and both zones also exhibit similar behaviour.  Considering the nature of the elements and their statistical distributions, WGM is of the opinion that it is not necessary to cap highgrade values for MoS2 or WO3.

## 17.6

Variograms were computed to characterize the spatial continuity of the mineralization in both the North and West zones.  Table 17 presents the variogram models.

It was noted that the MoS2 is more continuous than the WO3.  Also, the West Zone presents longer ranges than the North Zone (for MoS2 only).  This could be due to the horseshoe shape of the Fire Tower North Zone. Figures 16 to 19 presents the variogram graphs for each zone.

Note : Some variograms above are modelled with the Exponential equation.  In this case, the ranges presented are approximately one third of the zone of influence.  In contrast, for the Spherical model, the ranges are equal to the zone of influence.

## 17.7 MINERAL RESOURCE BLOCK MODELLING

The  Mineral  Resources  have  been  estimated  with  the  Kriging  geostatistical  estimation technique.  For comparison and cross checking purposes, Inverse Distance Squared ('ID ') 2 and Nearest Neighbour ('NNB') methods have also been used.

## 17.7.1 BLOCK MODEL GRID PARAMETERS

The Mineral Resources have been estimated in a grid of regular blocks.  The block model grid covers both the West Zone and North Zone and is shown in Table 18.

## BLOCK MODEL GRID PARAMETERS

| Direction   | Origin   | Size   | Minimum (index)   | Maximum (index)   |
|-------------|----------|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| East-West   | 15,400E  | 5 m    | 15,400E (1)       | 15,875E (96)      |

| Vertical    | 900Z     | 5 m    | 900Z (1)          | 1,250Z (71)       |

## 17.7.2 GRADE INTERPOLATION

## Kriging

The  principal  Mineral  Resource  estimate  model  is  derived  from  Kriging.    The  variograms modelled and summarized in the previous section of this report were used to estimate each zone separately.

Search ellipsoid:

75 m in the East-West direction 50 m in the North-South direction 50 m in the Vertical direction

Maximum number of composites used to estimate a block: 15

Minimum number of composites used to estimate a block: 1

Maximum number of composites coming from a single hole: 4

Octant search strategy was used with a maximum of 4 composites per octant.

## Inverse Distance Squared

This  estimation  technique  was  used  to  provide  ADEX  with  a  comparison  to  the  primary method of Kriging.  In this case, both the West and North zones were interpolated with the following search parameters:

Search ellipse: 50 m sphere

Maximum number of composites used to estimate a block: 15

Minimum number of composites used to estimate a block: 1

Maximum number of composites coming from a single hole: 4

Octant search strategy was used with a maximum of 4 composites per octant.

## Nearest Neighbour

This technique was used to provide ADEX with an additional comparison to Kriging.  In this case, both the West and North zones were interpolated with the following search parameters:

Search ellipse: 50 m sphere

Maximum number of composites used to estimate a block: 1 Minimum number of composites used to estimate a block: 1

## 17.8 MINERAL RESOURCE CLASSIFICATION AND TABULATION

## 17.8.1 KRIGED MODEL

The Mineral Resources are compiled by simple addition of the Kriged model blocks and by averaging  the  corresponding  grade  values.    In  order  to  study  the  behaviour  of  the  Mineral Resources  with  respect  to  a  given  cutoff,  WGM  has  generated  the  Mineral  Resources  at various cutoff levels (Table 19).  The cutoffs were chosen to produce a grade-tonnage curve. For this exercise, 11 cutoffs, from 0% to 1.0% WO3 Eq (in increments of 0.1%) were used. However,  to  define  the  Mineral  Resources  for  this  report,  WGM  has  used  a  cutoff  of 0.3% WO3 Eq.

The specific gravity used to derive tonnes from the block volumes is constant at 2.65.  This value was provided by ADEX and is based on historic measurements.  WGM has accepted this specific gravity as reasonable for this type of mineralization.

WGM has  classified  the  Fire  Tower  Mineral  Resource  estimate  as  Inferred.    Until  more verification work has been completed by ADEX, i.e., twinning of old drillholes and further validation  of  the  database  with  a  more  rigorous  check  sampling  program,  the  Mineral Resources can only be considered as Inferred.

## 17.8.2 COMPARISON METHODS TO KRIGED MODEL

For  comparison  purposes,  ID   and  NNB  grade  estimation  methods  were  used.    The  ID 2 2 method is a distance-weighted interpolation class of methods, similar to Kriging, where the

grade of a block is interpolated from several composites within a defined distance range of that block.  ID  uses the inverse of the distance squared between a composite and the block as 2 the weighting factor.

The second comparative method used was NNB.  In this technique, the grade of a block is estimated  by  assigning  only  the  grade  of  the  nearest  composite  to  the  block.    In  a  2-D situation, this would be equivalent to a polygonal estimation.  In a 3-D spatial environment, it is similar to a polyhedral estimation.  Note that with this method, there is no interpolation of grades.

Figure 20 presents the grade-tonnage curves of the Kriged model together with the ID  and 2 NNB models  for  comparison.    The  superimposition  of  the  three  methods  allows  for  easy comparisons at different cutoffs and an evaluation of their differences.  It must be noted that the Kriged model forms the basis for the estimated Inferred Mineral Resources of this report.

WGM has elected to use the Kriged model since the continuity of the grades can be modelled from the variograms.  Kriging and ID  both estimate the grades using a distance weighted 2 interpolation  method.    Kriging  uses  the  variograms,  whereas  ID   uses  the  inverse  of  the 2 distance squared, to assign weights in the interpolation function.  The ID  is purely empirical 2 and it is not supported by the in-situ grade continuity patterns.  Kriging takes advantage of the in-situ continuity through the use of the variograms, hence, the Kriged model should reflect reality more closely than ID methods.

The  Nearest  Neighbour  method  is  the  three-dimensional  version  of  the  2D  polygonal estimation  method.    It  represents  an  extreme  case  of  minimum  dilution  and  maximum selectivity.  It is likely to underestimate tonnage and overestimate grade above a given cutoff, but is a good check on other methods.

## HISTORIC MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATES

Note:  This  Section  of  the  report  contains  descriptions  of  several  historic  'mineral resource' and 'mineral reserve' estimates.  All of these historic estimates were prepared  prior  to  the  implementation  of  NI 43-101.    WGM  has  neither  audited  these estimates nor made any attempt to classify them according to NI 43-101 standards or the  Council  of  Canadian  Institute  of  Mining,  Metallurgy  and  Petroleum  definitions ('CIM Standards') .    They are presented because ADEX and WGM consider them to be relevant  and  of  historic  significance.      These  estimates  should  not  be  relied on.    In addition,  WGM  has  used  the  words  'orebody'  and  'orebodies,'  commonly  used  to describe mineralized bodies at the time.  The use of these words does not imply that the mineralized bodies described can be economically exploited.

## 17.9.1 NORTH ZONE TIN-INDIUM 'RESOURCES'

A significant tin and indium historical 'resource' was also outlined at Mount Pleasant.  The 'resource' is hosted within what is referred to as the North Zone and the Deep Tin Zone.  In this  case,  the  North  Zone  refers  to  the  Contact  Crest/Flank  and  the  Upper  and  Lower Endogranitic deposits.

The first undiluted 'ore reserves' for the North Zone were estimated in December 1963 by MPML with 'proven ore' of 115,000 (short) tons with a grade of 0.61% Sn and 2.24% Zn (Behre Dolbear &amp; Company, 1963).  The definition for 'proven' is provided in Appendix 1A.

In 1973, Brunswick Tin Mines delineated a 'reserve' in the Deep Tin Zone of 2.14 million tonnes and grades of 0.028% Mo, 0.061% W, 0.064% Bi, 0.045% Sn, 0.12% Cu, 0.80% Zn,  0.04% Pb,  0.27% As  and  4% fluorite  (Billiton  Canada  Ltd.,  1985a).    The  tin grades  were  cut  to  2% to  compensate  for  erratic  highs.    Uncut  tin  grades  were  just  over 0.60% Sn (see Table 18).  The density used for the calculation of ore in the contact Crest was 2.75 g/cm  (Billiton, 1985a). 3

Billiton calculated a new 'resource' for the North Zone in 1985, subdividing the North Zone into  five  distinct  forms  of  mineralization,  the  Contact  Crest  and  Flank,  Upper  and  Lower Endogranitic  and  Deep  Tin  Zone.    In  each  case,  BTM  assumed  that  the  Endogranitic mineralization  was  flat-lying  and  that  each  of  their  1985  vertical  drillhole  intersections

represented 'true widths'.  The 'resource' estimates are given in Table 20 and the grades are 'uncut'.  A total 'resource' for the North Zone was estimated at 6,792,670 tonnes at a grade of  0.80% Sn.    The  orebodies  were  blocked  into  'proven,  probable  and  possible  reserve' classifications using 'resource' category definitions given in Appendix 1B.

According to Lac Minerals (1988), each orebody was defined by a 0.2% Sn cutoff grade, a minimum width of 3.0 m and geological continuity.  The tonnage and grade estimations were calculated using the sectional method assuming that each section represents width halfway to the next section.  Orebodies were sliced at 25 m spaced levels on the SW-NE drill sections. The area of each orebody between levels was determined on each section by planimetering. The area was then multiplied by 25 m, the area of influence of each section and by the SG of 2.75,  resulting  in  the  tonnage.    The  grade  for  each  block  was  calculated  by  averaging  the number of assay results occurring within the block.

In 1996, ADEX defined a 'resource' by diamond drilling and outlined a 'probable undiluted resource' of 4,849,000 tonnes grading 0.695% Sn and 87 ppm In (ADEX Mining Corp., 1995).    This  'resource'  estimate  was  calculated  utilizing  GEMCOM  software  using PCXPLOR  and  GEOMODEL  on  a  polygonal  and  sectional  basis.    Block  areas  were planimetered and volumes and tonnages calculated using a 25 m influence and a density of 2.75 tonnes/m  and 0.2% Sn cutoff (Kvaerner Metals Davy Ltd., 1997).  ADEX's 'resource' 3 estimate was audited by Kvaerner Metals Davy Ltd., (1997) as part of the feasibility study.

Kvaerner  suggested  that  the  'probable  resource'  classification  should  be  regarded  as  an 'inferred'  or  'possible  resource'  due  to  the  widely-spaced  surface  drillholes  used  in  the estimation and the complex mineral occurrence.

Kvaerner estimated an audited 'probable resource' of 3,645,429 tonnes with an average grade of  0.801% Sn,  107.15 ppm In,  0.114% WO3,  0.055% MoS2,  0.187% Cu,  0.063% Pb  and 0.869% Zn from the ADEX total 'resource' (Table 21), (Kvaerner Metals Davy Ltd., 1997). At a planned mining rate of 2,500 tonnes/day the projected mine life would be four years.

## TIN-INDIUM 'RESOURCES', KVAERNER STUDY (1997)

| Deposit       | Total  (tonnes)   |   Sn  (%) |   In  (ppm) |   WO3  (%) |   MoS2  (%) |   Cu  (%) |   Pb  (%) |   Zn  (%) |
|---------------|-------------------|-----------|-------------|------------|-------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| North Zone    | 1,877,260         |     0.859 |       30.31 |      0.156 |       0.065 |     0.139 |     0.07  |     0.357 |

0.2% Sn cutoff; Mo% is 60% of MoS2;  Specific Gravity = 2.75

Kvaerner further determined that the total 'mineable resource' consisted of 3,718,338 tonnes with a grade of 0.662% Sn, 85.72 ppm In, 0.091% WO3, 0.044% MoS2, 0.150% Cu, 0.050% Pb, 0.089% Bi and 0.695% Zn using a recovery factor of 85%, a dilution factor of 20% and a cutoff grade of 0.1% Sn.  However, the Kvaerner Feasibility Study showed that the tin  and  indium  'resource'  was  uneconomic  at  that  time.    Kvaerner  made  the  following recommendations and conclusions regarding the geology and future 'resource' estimates:

- 1. All  geological  testwork  performed  to  date  needs  to  be  fully  re-evaluated  with  3D modelling  of  the  existing  testwork  to  improve  the  understanding  of  the  patterns  of mineralization to better predict the most profitable areas for exploration;
- 2. Exploration for additional 'resources' has been limited and restricted to surface drilling since underground workings are flooded;
- 3. The deposits are complicated and only partially understood;
- 4. Missing indium assay information is required for samples not previously assayed for this element;
- 5. Additional drill testwork is required to upgrade and enlarge the 'resources' in the Deep Tin Zone, North Zone and Saddle Zone (i.e., 10,000 m of underground drilling to firm up 'resource' boundaries for the Deep Tin Zone); and

- 6. De-watering  of  the  underground  workings  would  be  required  to  enable  underground testwork to be carried out and to enable mine production to begin.

## 17.9.2 TIN BASE METAL LODE DEPOSITS

The near surface tin-base metal deposits at Mount Pleasant are generally small, in the 15,000 to  25,000 tonne  range.    'Reserves'  in  the  No.  7  tin  lode  in  the  Fire  Tower  Zone  were estimated to be 15,000 tonnes grading 0.5% Sn, 5.6% Zn, 1.2% Pb and 0.7% Cu (Sinclair, 1994).

In the North Zone, Tin Lodes No. 1 to 3 were estimated to contain around 50,000 tonnes of zinc-tin mineralization with unknown indium content (Kvaerner Metals Davy Ltd., 1997).  As for the tin lode No. 4, also located in the North Zone, in 1973 BTM calculated a 'reserve' of 640,000 tons grading 0.239% Sn and 0.964% Zn (Parrish, 1973).  This 'reserve' estimate was determined using diamond drillholes information within 15 m (50 feet) of each other.

In  1992,  ADEX  Minerals  Corp.  calculated  an  updated  'indicated  and  inferred  resource' (classifications not defined) for the Lode No. 4 based on a 60 ppm In cut off (Martin, 1997). 'Indicated' was estimated at 43,010 tonnes grading 0.486 % Sn, 0.191 % Cu, 2.043% Zn and 197.503 ppm In.  'Inferred' was estimated at 58,202 tonnes grading 0.337% Sn, 0.180% Cu, 2.824% Zn and 182.097 ppm In.  ADEX used a higher cutoff than BTM and thus ended up with a lower estimated 'resource'.

## 17.9.3 SULPHIDE CONCENTRATE POND

Gowdy (1995) proposed that potential early cash flow could be obtained from processing the tailings  materials  remaining  in  the  sulphide  concentrate  pond.    During  the  operation  of  the mine,  the  Billiton's  flotation  circuit  scalped  off  the  sulphides  in  the  ore  prior  to  further processing  of  the  tungsten.    The  sulphide  concentrate  was  disposed  of  in  a  separate  pond. According  to  Gowdy  (1995),  the  pond  contains  approximately  17,500 tonnes  of  sulphide material grading at 0.5% WO3, 8.0% MoS2, 18.0% As, 4.0% Bi, 2.0% Cu, 7.0% Zn, 0.5% Sn and 274.29 g In/t (8.0 opt).

This estimate was prepared by the Billiton Mount Pleasant Mill personnel based on what was discharged  to  the  pond  and  was  regarded  by  Gowdy  to  fairly  reflect  the  actual  grade  and tonnage.

Tin in the pond is not considered to be recoverable.  The sulphide material is buried under waste rock, sand and a liner and has been hydroseeded.  The layer of concentrate occupies 5,000 m  and is approximately 1.0 m thick. 3

This  material  may  have  some  value  for  metallurgical  testwork  as  it  could  be  similar  in character to the MoS2-rich tails from a future WO3-recovery circuit that would next go to an MoS2 recovery circuit.  Further study should be made to determine if this is the case.

## 18.  OTHER RELEVANT DATA AND INFORMATION

## 18.1 ENVIRONMENT

The Province of New Brunswick currently holds a $2.0 million mortgage on the buildings as security to cover the costs of building removal and contouring (ADEX Mining Corp., 1995). In  addition,  ADEX  has  a  $0.5 million  security  bond  posted  with  the  New  Brunswick government for mine reclamation.  According to ADEX Mining Corp. (1995), this bond was also supposed to cover the cost of water treatment of the mine in perpetuity.

All known previous environmental studies that have been completed at Mount Pleasant have been  outlined  below  as  well  as  environmental  requirements  to  resume  mining  operations. Also included are the details surrounding the Ministerial Order issued by the New Brunswick Department  of  the  Environment  revoking  the  minesite's  'Approval  to  Operate'  permit (allowing water treatment, discharge and monitoring) and the steps ADEX is taking to have this order revoked.

## 18.2 PREVIOUS ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES

In  1979,  Strathcona  conducted  a  Feasibility  Study  on  behalf  of  Billiton  and  provided  a summary of the environmental description of the project area including:

- · Flora and Fauna - vegetation, wildlife, fish survey, benthic survey; and
- · A detailed outline of environmental requirements.

In  1995,  ADEX summarized the environmental and permitting requirements that would be necessary in consideration of any future plans to bring Mount Pleasant back into production. These  procedures,  which  were  documented  in  an  ADEX  report  in  1995  are  summarized below.  They include requirements once operations restart.

An  Approval to Construct Permit must be obtained from the Department  of the Environment ('DOE')  before  any  construction  program  can  commence.    To  obtain  such Approval, the property must be registered for an Environmental Impact Assessment ('EIA').

When it is registered, an EIA Registration Document must be prepared and submitted.  The EIA Registration  Document  must  contain  a  Reclamation  Plan,  an  Effluent  Control  Plan  and  a Feasibility Study.  In addition, security will be required in an amount to cover the costs of the reclamation as spelled out in the EIA Registration Document.  When the new security is posted, the mortgage on the buildings will be cancelled.

Given that the property has already been in production and assuming a good EIA Registration Document is prepared, there is a good chance that the property could be screened out of the full EIA  process,  in  which  case  the  Approval  to  Construct  could  be  obtained  in  as  few  as  two months after submission of the EIA Registration Document.  To go through the full EIA process could take as long as 24 months.

Following start-up of operations, all effluent must be monitored and sampled to ensure that all controls  are  operating  at  or  better  than  limits  stated  in  the  EIA  Registration  Document.    If effluent  levels  are  within  limits,  the  Department  of  the  Environment  will  issue  an  Operating Permit.    A  Mining  Lease  must  be  obtained  from  the  DNRE.    DNRE  and  DOE  work  on  the Approval  to  Construct  and  the  Mining  Lease  simultaneously  and  the  Mining  Lease  will  be approved at about the same time as the Approval to Construct.

In 1996, Washburn &amp; Gillis Associates was contacted by ADEX to review the environmental permitting  requirements  that  would  be  required  for  redevelopment  of  the  Mount  Pleasant Mine.  The requirements were outlined as follows (Washburn &amp; Gillis Associates, 1996):

- · Registration of the project under the Environmental Impact Assessment Regulation of the New  Brunswick  'Clean  Environment  Act'  addressing all potential environmental concerns;
- · Preparation of a Feasibility Study and Reclamation Plan to obtain a Mining Lease under the Mining Act, Chapter M-14.1, Section 68.  A Mining Lease is usually issued within three months of the submission of the study and plan;
- · Obtaining  a  Construction  Permit  under  Regulation  82-126  of  the  'Clean  Environment Act'.  This permit is required prior to beginning any construction activities at the site and can typically be obtained within approximately six week of submitting an application;
- · Obtaining  an  'Operating  Permit'  under  the  requirements  of  the  Mining  Act,  Chapter M-14.1, Section 77.  This permit, issued by the New Brunswick Department of Natural

Resources &amp; Energy is required prior to the start-up of commercial production operations and  usually  take  around  three  months  to  obtain.    ADEX  requires  an  'Approval  to Operate'  to  permit  the  operation  of  a  mine  water  treatment  plant  and  to  approve  a discharge of treated mine water (as mentioned in Section 18.1) to Hatch Brook;

- · A  'Certificate  of  Approval'  issued  in  accordance  with  the  Water  Quality  Regulations under  the  'Clean  Environment  Act'  granting  approval  to  operate  a  source  of  potential water contaminants; and
- · An Application for Approval to the New Brunswick Department of Environment for any program involving the dewatering of the Mount Pleasant Mine.

Other permits and approvals required for operation of the on-site facilities would include:

- · Approval to Construct and Operate a storage facility for explosives;
- · Approval to Construct and Operate a Sewage Disposal Facility; and
- · Approval under the Federal Metal and Mining Effluent Regulation.

## 18.3 MINISTERIAL ORDER

On  April  27,  1999,  a  'Ministerial  Order  (99-004)'  was  issued  by  the  New  Brunswick Minister of the Environment stating that they had reason to believe that contaminants from the  mining  operation  and  the  mine  had  been  released  into  the  environment  contrary  to Subsection  5.3(1)  of  the  Clean  Environment  Act.    A  copy  of  this  order  is  appended  as Appendix 2.

In late 2004, ADEX  entered  into discussions with New  Brunswick  Department  of Environment to have the Ministerial Order lifted.  A procedure was outlined by the Standing Committee on Mining and the Environment ('SCME') to lift the order and replace it with an 'Approval to Operate' permitting the discharge of water from the flooded mine workings subject to the following main conditions:

- 1. Upon  receipt  of  a  letter  from  the  new  Chairman  of  the  Board  of  ADEX  Mining, committing  in  writing  to  provide  to  the  SCME,  a  'Tailings  Dam  &amp;  Spillway  Safety Study' done in accordance with the Canadian Dam Association's Dam Safety Guidelines; and

- 2. The Study is to be done by a consultant with expertise in the area of dam safety studies and be acceptable to the SCME.  The Study would be completed by May 31, 2005 and would also include cost estimates for any deficiencies identified in the Study.

According to the correspondence, any approval would likely include a reduced monitoring frequency schedule, which would be determined at the time of issuance.

Early  in  2006,  ADEX  engaged Jacques  Whitford  Limited , well  known  environmental consultants,  to  carry  out  the  above-noted  tailings  dam  study  and  paid  for  it  in  advance. SCME acknowledged this progress in complying with SCME requirements.

The  dam  study,  although  somewhat  behind  schedule,  is  almost  complete  and  SCME  has indicated to ADEX that it is now willing to lift the Ministerial Order and issue an Approval to Operate  with  the  payment  of  a  $30,000  permit  fee.    ADEX  is  presently  re-establishing  a sampling  and  testing  procedure  for  the  mine  discharge  and  tailings  pond  waters,  which  it plans  to  use  for  demonstrating  a  record  of  good  compliance  in  water  monitoring  before making the 'official' request to lift the order and pay the permit fee.

## 19.  INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS

## 19.1 GENERAL

The  Mount  Pleasant  Mine  contains  several  polymetallic  deposits  with  historic  'resource estimates' of tungsten, molybdenum, tin and indium, which occur with other minor metals such as bismuth, zinc and copper.  The property has undergone considerable exploration and development  since  its  discovery  in  1937.    Work  has  included  stream  and  soil  sampling surveys,  surface  and  underground  drilling,  IP,  seismic,  SP,  magnetic,  gravity,  EM  and radiation surveys, stripping, trenching and sampling, some surface geological mapping, two major feasibility studies (Strathcona, Kvaerner), bulk sampling, metallurgical testing, underground development work and mining.

The  property  has  never  been  systematically  mapped  to  produce  a  comprehensive  geology map.  Companies have cited reasons for not mapping the property such as the difficulty of mapping individual rock units due to their similarly close mineralogy, geochemisty and widespread alteration and poor outcrop exposure.  Therefore, previous mapping has relied entirely on  drill  data  and  underground  mapping  and  sampling  programs  to  provide  a  detailed geological interpretation of the deposits at Mount Pleasant.

Exploration  and  development  work  has  been  concentrated  on  two  areas,  which  have  been designated the Fire Tower Zone and the North Zone.  Deposits occur mainly in hydrothermal breccias and fine grained granite and to a lesser extent in associated volcanic and sedimentary country rocks.

The 'historic resources,' mining methods, metallurgical testing and metal recoveries are well documented.    To  date,  a  total  of  1,330  surface  and  underground  drillholes  have  produced some  159,000 m  of  drill  core  for  sampling  leading  to  the  underground  development  and opening  of  the  Mount  Pleasant  Tungsten  Mine.    The  drill  information  also  provided  an excellent  understanding  of  the  geology  of  the  deposits  at  Mount  Pleasant.    Tungstenmolybdenum deposits at Mount Pleasant were determined to be large and of low grade.

The mine produced tungsten ore concentrate from the Fire Tower Zone from 1983 to 1985 when operations ceased after only 23 months of production due to metallurgical problems and

a significant decline in the price of tungsten.  No other metals such as molybdenum, tin or indium  were  produced.    Initial  production  was  at  a  rate  of  650,000  tpy  with  reduced production to 324,000 tpy before the mine closed.  Upon the closure of the mine, the site was placed  on  care  and  maintenance.    In  1996,  Kvaerner  was  engaged  by  ADEX  to  produce  a feasibility  study  of  the  North  Zone  tin-indium  deposits,  including  the  Deep  Tin  Zone. However,  declining  tin  prices  and  increasing  costs  rendered  the  project  uneconomic.    The tungsten-molybdenum deposits have not been re-evaluated since closure.

The following porphyry-type deposits have been identified at Mount Pleasant:

## Fire Tower Zone :

- · Fire Tower North (tungsten-molybdenum-bismuth deposit);
- · Fire Tower West (tungsten-molybdenum-bismuth deposit);
- · Fire Tower South (tungsten-molybdenum-bismuth deposit);
- - one continuous body with the Fire Tower West;
- · Tin-base metal deposits; and
- · No. 7 tin lode.

## Scotia Zone :

- · Tin-base metal deposit associated with Fire Tower North (silver, copper, zinc).

## Saddle Zone:

- · Tin-base metal deposit (silver, copper, zinc, lead).

## North Zone :

- · Upper  and  Lower  Endogranitic  Zone  (tin,  indium,  silver,  copper  zinc,  tungsten, molybdenum, bismuth);
- · Contact deposit (tin, indium);
- · Flank deposit (tin, indium, copper, tungsten, molybdenum); and
- · Contact Crest deposit (tin, zinc, silver).

## Deep Tin Zone:

- · Upper (tin, indium, zinc, copper, silver);
- · Lower (tin+arsenopyrite);
- · Tin lodes (No's 1 to 6) - leakage to surface; and
- · Tungsten-molybdenum-bismuth deposit in Granite I.

The distribution of tin mineralization within the Saddle Zone has been reported to be irregular requiring  additional  surface  and  underground  drilling  before  a  proper  Mineral  Resource estimate can be prepared for this zone (Gowdy, 1995).

Kvaerner has pointed out that the North Zone deposits are complicated and are still not fully understood.  Their 'resource' was estimated from a series of scattered deposits, which require further definition by drilling.  It is still uncertain at this stage as to whether the Endogranitic Zone deposits consist of two individual layers (Upper and Lower) or whether they consist of a number of rather steeply-dipping shoots.  In addition, the Deep Tin Zone is less well defined and appears to consist of less continuous pockets of mineralization and will require at least 5,000 m of additional underground drilling to enable a Mineral Resource estimate (Kvaerner Metals Davy Ltd., 1997).  Kvaerner also points out that the North Zone is open to the east, requiring more drilling to further define the North Zone deposits.  The Endogranitic Zone and Crest deposits have potential to be extended to the north.

The similar geological setting and close proximity to the North Zone makes Hornet Hill an interesting exploration target.  Hornet Hill is a buried granite intrusion and was only explored by three diamond drillholes.  BTM hole MPS 173 intersected a cassiterite-bearing chlorite vein, which assayed 0.89% Sn over a core length of 3.0 m. In 1972, an EM survey completed by BTM defined a strong conductor that was traced for some 250 m on the north side of Hornet Hill.    WGM  is  uncertain  if  the  source  of  this  EM  conductor  was  ever  determined.    IP surveying may prove invaluable in exploring for mineralization deep within the Hornet Hill structure (below 250 m from surface).

WGM, as part of its due diligence, collected two field samples of mineralized rock (grabs) and twelve split core samples from 11 drillholes covering five of the previous drill programs by  BTM,  Mount  Pleasant  Tungsten  Mine,  the  Lac-Billiton  Tin  Project,  Piskahegan  and ADEX.  The assay results between WGM and those obtained by the previous operators were in good agreement.  The results all verify that significant tungsten, molybdenum, bismuth, tin, indium, silver, zinc and copper are present at Mount Pleasant.  This sampling also confirmed that none of the zones or deposits contains any significant gold.  WGM is of the opinion that historic assay results are reliable and suitable for use in the preparation of Mineral Resource estimates  and  has  prepared  such  an  estimate  for  the  Fire  Tower  Zone  as  documented  in Section 17 above.

The WGM analytical work at SGS also determined the following:

- · Analytical  method ICP12B is best for the initial determination of concentrations of the base metal and trace element geochemistry;

- · The best method for determining the total concentration of W and Sn is through total acid digestion (SGS method ICP90A).  This method had no affect in increasing recoveries of Mo or Bi (as compared with SGS method ICP12B;
- · Indium determination using SGS method ICP90A is the least expensive with values only slightly  smaller  than  those  obtained  by  method  IC40M  at  an  additional  cost.  Indium occurs in association with sphalerite (ZnS), with is higher in the North Zone deposits; and
- · Although ICP/MS has been the recommended analytical method for indium analyses, SGS does not want to run samples with high expected concentrations due to the possibility of contaminating their equipment.

At  this  time,  ADEX  does  not  have  an  'Approval  to  Operate,'  covering  the  treatment, discharge  and  monitoring  of  water  nor  does  it  have  an  'Operating  Permit'  allowing  it  to undertake  mining  activities  in  the  event  that  the  company  wishes  to  resume  mining operations.    The  Approval  to  Operate  was  revoked  by  a  Ministerial  Order  in  1999. Reclamation  work,  testing  and  reporting  are  still  required  under  the  order.    ADEX  has outlined and agreed to a procedure with the Province of New Brunswick to have this order lifted  and  a  tailings  dam  study  is  nearing  completion.    WGM  did  not  conduct  a  review  to determine what other permits are still in place.  The Standing Committee on Mining and the Environment has verified that Mount Pleasant needs to register under EIA.  The EIA will be required if ADEX ever applies for a mining lease under plans to go back into production.

## 19.2 MINE FACILITIES AND INFRASTRUCTURE

The  Mount  Pleasant  surface  facilities  are  in  remarkably  good  shape.    The  ore  storage, conveyor  galleries,  mill,  flotation,  warehousing  and  office  buildings  in  most  cases  would require only a modest amount of effort and capital to bring them back to useable condition. The existing mill-flotation building appears to be in a very good shape. Retrofitting of this building or conversion to new processing requirements might provide substantial savings to the  project  as  opposed  to  erecting  a  new  facility.    There  is,  however,  no  useful  processing equipment left in the building.

The underground mine was stripped of all the infrastructure installations and is flooded up to the top of conveyor incline and adit-access portals. The Fire Tower Zone, which was the core of  the  previous  underground  operation,  contains  an  inventory  of  800,000 tonnes  of  broken

tungsten-molybdenum  material  in  stopes.  The  broken  material  grade  is  approximately 0.39% WO3 and 0.19% MoS2.

Almost all of the major mill and mine equipment was sold in the past in order to cover costs associated with care and maintenance of the site.

## 19.3 KVAERNER FEASIBILITY STUDY, NORTH ZONE DEPOSITS

## 19.3.1 GENERAL

WGM reviewed the Kvaerner study and a number of documents and information related to the  project.  Other  feasibility  studies,  conducted  prior  to  the  Kvaerner  study,  were  also reviewed for comparison and relevance with the project.  The list of studies and documents is shown in References.

The Kvaerner study addresses the scope of the project reasonably well, in particular  when taking  into  account  the  limited  metallurgical  test  work  done  by  the  owners  prior  to  the commencement  of  the  study.    During  the  course  of  the  study,  Kvaerner,  through  others, conducted a number of additional metallurgical tests in order to increase the confidence level with regard to the bioleaching and hydrometallurgical processes. The results of the additional tests in combination with the previous test results obtained by the owners, helped in designing of the above processes and their flowsheets.

With regard to the bioleach and indium recovery process, the study concluded that there are still  unresolved  and  outstanding  issues  associated  with  handling  potential  hazards,  such  as arsine gas and waste streams and they must be quantified. Means of handling such hazards must be devised and engineered. The study also suggested that it would take up to six months of pilot plant work to complete the design and environmental permitting.

## 19.3.2 MINING

The mining aspects were well addressed and supported with detailed estimates with regard to the productivities and costs in 1996. WGM agrees with the selection of mining methods for exploiting the deposits. The same applies to the mine layout, design and equipment selection.

The  2,500  tonnes/day  of  tin-indium  ore  production  target  selected  by  the  Kvaerner  team, although aggressive, appears to be achievable.

The  ventilation  considerations  and  design  adequately  addressed  the  production  and  safety requirements for the proposed mining operation.

The ore transport from mining areas by use of LHDs and trucks to the underground crusher and then to surface via a belt conveyor appears to be the right choice and economically justified.

The  mine  dewatering  and  services  reestablishment  plan adequately  addressed  ground conditioning  needs  as  well  as  time  and  resources  needed  for  the  accomplishment  of  the dewatering tasks.

The  targeted  productivities  for  the  mining  operation  are  in  line  with  current  productivities achieved  in  other  Canadian  mines.  On  the  other  hand,  the  manpower  levels  appear  to  be somehow conservative. Similar mining operations would use slightly lower manpower levels.

In  summary,  the  Kvaerner  Feasibility  Study  incorporated  in  a  practical  way  the  relevant information and existing underground mine development with regard to its proposed mining scenario.

## 19.3.3 PROCESSING

WGM is of the opinion that the processing aspects were addressed approximately with respect to  the  metallurgical  test  work  results  achieved  before  and  during  the  study,  and  previous operational  experience  gathered  at  the  Mount  Pleasant  operation.  The  milling  and  flotation layout and the flowsheets were designed to utilize conventional and proven technologies and equipment and as such do not pose any significant operational or performance risks.  In fact, the authors indicated that there potential exists for some incremental process improvements and WGM agrees with this statement. This could result in potential savings and improve the economics of the project provided further detailed engineering follows.

The general design and layouts of the bioleach and hydromet plants are based on small-scale test  results  utilizing  certain  types  of  Mount  Pleasant  mineralization.  The  Mount  Pleasant

mineralization is complex and as such would require larger-scale testing before making any final commitment with regard to the proposed layouts and designs.

The Kvaerner study concluded that the bioleach and hydromet processes were too expensive to  operate  and  proposed  to  assess  a  potential  to  install  a  tin-indium  operation  utilizing  a conventional  milling  process  to  produce  two  types  of  concentrates.  WGM  agrees  with  this conclusion based on the results of the overview evaluations of the three scenarios regarded for mining of the Mount Pleasant deposits.

## 19.3.4 FEASIBILITY STUDY CAPITAL COSTS ESTIMATES

WGM reviewed the capital cost estimates for the project in light of the proposed processes and mining methods and size of production. The Kvaerner study capital cost estimates are supported  with  basic  calculations  of  labour,  materials,  energy  and  other  components  of construction elements needed for re-establishing operations at Mount Pleasant. In most cases the Kvaerner estimates were supported with quotes obtained from the potential suppliers of new  or  used  equipment  to  be  used  at  the  operation.  In  WGM's  opinion,  the  other  cost components of the study were estimated within a reasonable cost range with respect to the scope of the project.

WGM adjusted the Kvaerner estimated costs to reflect the current levels using an order of magnitude  approach.  For  consistency,  WGM  used  a  compounded  3%/year  inflation  rate multiplication  factor  against  the  study  capital  and  operating  cost  estimates,  except  for  the mining  costs,  in  order  to  arrive  with  costs  reflecting  the  current  market  conditions.  After adjustments were made the factored cost estimates were compared with the current equipment prices and labour costs and they appear to be in balance.

The  underground  mine  capital  costs  were  adjusted  by  comparison  with  similar  projects currently in the development stage elsewhere in Canada and to a certain degree by using a factoring method.

WGM cautions readers  that  its  study  of  the  Kvaerner  costs  was  merely  to  determine  their relative accuracy not to provide an opinion as to whether the Kvaerner study can be used in a future economic study of the operation.  Since there is no Mineral Resource defined at Mount Pleasant, no discussion of economics is possible at this time.

## 19.3.5 FEASIBILITY STUDY OPERATING COST ESTIMATES

WGM reviewed Kvaerner's operating cost estimates and concludes that they were performed according to accepted industry standards.

WGM believes  that  there  is  potential  to  lower  some  of  the  adjusted  and  estimated  costs through further project optimization, which requires a higher level of study effort.

## 19.3.6 WGM CONCLUSIONS REGARDING THE KVAERNER STUDY

The Kvaerner study appears to address the scope of the project reasonably well.

The  Kvaerner  study  capital  cost  estimates  were  supported  with  quotes  obtained  from  the potential suppliers of new or used equipment to be used at the operation. These costs need an item-by-item detailed update to adjust them to current levels. WGM used broad general costs adjustments for the purpose of evaluation of different mining scenarios.

WGM agrees  with  the  selection  of  mining  methods  for  exploiting  the  deposits.  The  same applies to the mine layout, design and equipment selection.

The milling and flotation layout and the flowsheets were designed to utilize conventional and proven technologies  and  equipment  and  as  such  do  not  pose  any  significant  operational  or performance risks.

The bioleach process has been piloted at the minesite and the process technology for metals recovery has been tested at a bench scale.

The Kvaerner's study concluded that the bioleach and hydromet processes were too expensive to  operate  and  proposed  to  assess  a  potential  to  install  a  tin-indium  operation  utilizing  a conventional  milling  process  to  produce  two  types  of  concentrates.  WGM  agrees  with  this conclusion based on the results of high-level evaluations of the three scenarios for mining of the  Mount Pleasant deposits. These evaluations are of preliminary nature and require more detailed work to firm up the results of the assessment.

WGM  conducted  order-of-magnitude  evaluations  based  on  three  mining  scenarios  using historic 'resource' estimates.  These scenarios included the following alternatives:

- · The base case scenario, utilizing bioleach and hydromet technology to process tin-indium mineralization;
- · Conventional processing of tin-indium mineralization to produce two types of concentrates; and
- · Conventional processing of tungsten-molybdenum mineralization.

The best short-term scenario appears to be developing the tungsten-molybdenum mineralization of the Fire Tower Zone.

In the case of the tin-indium scenario, utilizing conventional processing to produce two types of concentrates, two key aspects need to be investigated. The first one is finding a suitable customer  for  the  indium-zinc-copper  concentrate  and  the  second  one  is  negotiation  of  an adequate and acceptable indium price realization agreement between ADEX and a potential customer.

## 19.4 ANALYSIS

Re-establishing Mount Pleasant as a tungsten-molybdenum operation would be far easier than developing  a  new  operation  based  on  mining  and  processing  tin-indium  ore.  The  tungsten mine is already developed, with a substantial amount of inventory of broken mineralization, and  only  needs  to  be  dewatered  and  reequipped.  The  processing  of  tungsten,  although  not economic during the short period of operation in the 1980s, provided a valuable experience, which can be utilized in the design and construction of a new and improved processing plant.

The  tin-indium  scenario  utilizing  bioleach  and  hydromet  processes  would  be  far  more expensive and requires running of a pilot plant.  Additionally, it would take a much longer time  to  develop  and  construct  the  facility,  and  operating  costs  would  be  higher  than  the conventional milling and flotation scenario.

WGM concludes  that  further  advanced  studies  should  be  carried  out  to  determine  if  the newly-established Mineral Resources of the Fire Tower Zone can be converted into Mineral Reserves.

## 20.  RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on its review of the Kvaerner Feasibility Study, in light of currently improved metal prices environment,  and  the  presence  of  an  NI 43-101-compliant  WO3-MoS2  Mineral Resource at the Fire Tower Zone, WGM concludes that the Mount Pleasant property is one of merit.  It is recommended that ADEX carry out a small diamond drilling program to gather mineralized  material  from  the  zone  and  subject  it  to  metallurgical  testwork  designed  to develop a preliminary tungsten-molybdenum flowsheet.  A Scoping Study of re-establishing production from the zone should be carried out in conjunction with this testwork.

There  should  also  be  a  review  of  the  historic  North  Zone  drillhole  and  assay  database  to determine what additional drilling would be required to enable the preparation of a Mineral Resource  estimate  for  the  deposit.    In  addition,  there  should  be  compilation  and  mapping carried out to determine  the  near-surface  potential, as several North  Zone  drillholes intersected as yet poorly defined near-surface tin-indium mineralization.  As progress is made regarding  tin-indium  potential,  the  Kvaerner  study  could  to  be  used,  to  some  degree,  as  a basis to produce a new Feasibility Study.

As Kvaerner points out, the North Zone (Sn, In) deposits are complicated and are still not fully understood.  The historic 'resource' outlined in the Kvaerner study was estimated from a series of scattered deposits, which require further definition drilling.  The Deep Tin Zone is the  least  defined  of  the  deposits  and  appears  to  consist  of  less  contiguous  pockets  of mineralization  (Kvaerner  Metal  Davy  Ltd.,  1997).    According  to  Kvaerner,  future  surface drilling  of  the  North  Zone  will  require  closely  spaced  holes,  no  more  than  50 m  apart.    A better evaluation of the mineralized zones can be done by underground drilling (i.e., the Deep Tin Zone).  However, this would involve dewatering the underground workings, which would be costly and take approximately 6-7 months to complete.  Therefore, in the short term, any future  drilling  with  the  intention  of  exploring  or  upgrading  the  North  Zone  to  prepare  a NI 43-101-compliant Mineral Resource estimate will need to be done from surface.

The proposed work plan and budget at Mount Pleasant as prepared by WGM in collaboration with  ADEX  amounts  to  $1,100,000.    It  is  designed  as  follows  and  further  documented  in Table 22.

- · Additional  Sampling  and  analysis  of  unsplit  core  from  1995  drilling  by  Piskahagen Resources in which descriptions in drill logs suggest potential for expanding the size of Fire Tower North Zone;
- · Complete the tailings dam study and carry out other required permitting and environmental monitoring activities required to remove Ministerial Order;
- · Drill four HQ (6.35 cm diameter) drillholes of approximately 400 m each.  These holes will serve a dual purpose, 1) to obtain approximately 600 kg of representative Fire Tower Zone mineralized material for bench scale metallurgical testwork, and 2) to provide more geological and grade information to incorporate into the existing drillhole database;
- · Carry out bench-scale metallurgical testwork to develop a preliminary flowsheet for the recovery of both WO3 and MoS2 in the form of concentrates;
- · Carry out a Scoping Study to evaluate the feasibility of resuming tungsten-molybdenum mining operations from the Fire Tower Zone at Mount Pleasant;
- · Compilation,  mapping  and  trenching  (if  warranted)  to  evaluate  near-surface  tin-indium potential above the North Zone (#4 lode, #7 lode, 600 Adit, FTZ Breccia Pipe) including bench scale metallurgical testwork;
- · Compilation of previous exploration and development data with respect to the origin and status  of  surface  stockpiles  on  the  property  and  near-surface  tin-indium  mineralized material with the possibility of conducting follow-up bulk sampling and testing;
- · Since many historic samples were not assayed for indium, it is proposed that additional sampling of historic rejects and pulps and quarter splitting and sampling of historic core be carried out to facilitate the evaluation of the overall indium potential of the property;.
- · Quantitative  section  (deep  penetration)  IP  surveying  to  determine  if  the  tungstenmolybdenum mineralization is continuous between the Fire Tower Zone and Saddle Zone, and to explore for deeper mineralization beneath Granite II (explore for stacked porphyry deposits at depth under Mount Pleasant).  Also, to explore for additional mineralization at Hornet Hill.  IP surveying may also be useful in conjunction with the evaluation of nearsurface tin-indium potential; and

- · An internal quality assurance/quality control program for analytical work should be set up and  analytical  methods  standardized  with  duplicate  check  assays  done  at  a  second  ISO certified  laboratory.    With  regard  to  the  North  Zone,  Kvaerner  determined  that  far  less than 10% of the pre-1996 drill samples were rechecked.

WGM recommends that further in the future, ADEX consider carrying additional exploration programs on the property.  To date, there has been no significant effort put into the search for gold  mineralization  on  the  property.    Much  of  the  gold  exploration  in  southern  New Brunswick has focused on the Clarence Stream area, some 10 km west of Mount Pleasant, where Freewest  Resources continues  to  expand  a  near-surface  gold  'resource'  (Northern Miner, 2005).  In November 2005, a gold-bearing quartz boulder was discovered by a New Brunswick Department of Natural Resources geologist that assayed 1,320 g Au/t in the Harry Brook area 90 km east of Mount Pleasant.  This discovery started a claim staking rush in the area.  In light of current high gold prices and recent discoveries of gold in the region, WGM recommends that ADEX review the gold potential of the property.

The  property  should  also  be  mapped  in  detail  and  sampled  in  search  of  other  mineralized targets.

Most of the exploration work has been concentrated on the Fire Tower Zone and North Zone (including the Deep Tin Zone).  ADEX believes that the Granite II is continuous between the Fire Tower Zone and the North Zone where limited drilling has taken place and that a number of tin mineralized cupolas may exist along that trend.  Therefore, additional exploration work to identify drill targets along this trend may be warranted.

## APPENDIX 3: ADEX SUMMARY OF EXPLORATION POTENTIAL

## EXPLORATION POTENTIAL AT MOUNT PLEASANT

## Reference: Kooiman (2005) - ADEX Consultant

## W-Mo-Bi Mineralization

## Fire Tower Zone

Large  zones  of  W-Mo-Bi  mineralization  occur  in  the  Fire  Tower  Zone.    The  mineralized bodies in the Fire Tower Zone are known as the Fire Tower West, Fire Tower South and Fire Tower North.  All three zones formed a single body at one stage before the Fire Tower West and South were separated from the Fire Tower North by a large fault, the Fire Tower Fault. The  Fire  Tower  West  is,  in  places,  separated  from  the  Fire  Tower  South  (the  name  is misleading  because  the  zone  actually  occurs  mostly  east  of  the  Fire  Tower  West)  by  the intrusion  of  a  large  body  of  younger  granite  porphyry.    There  is  no  potential  for  large additional  'resources'  although  underground  diamond  drilling  remains  incomplete  in  the south of the Fire Tower West and the east of the Fire Tower North.  Small tonnages could be added in these zones.

## North Zone

The W-Mo-Bi mineralization in the North Zone occurs in four ill-defined zones, known as the X,Y,W and Z zones.  These zones have been explored only by surface drilling.  Underground definition drilling could lead to additional 'resources'.  Metal grades in the 'North Zone' are generally lower than in the Fire Tower Zone.

## Sn-In Base Metal Mineralization

Sn-In base metal deposits are associated with the intrusion of small, steep-sided Granite II bodies.    A  large  underground  exploration  program  conducted  in  1985-1987  and  several surface drilling programs in subsequent years led to the recognition of four separate, younger Granite II bodies:  Granite IIa and Granite IIb.  The four bodies or cupolas are: The North Zone,  the  'South  Cupola'  of  the  North  Zone,  the  Saddle  Zone  and  the  Fire  Tower  North Zone.  Sn-In base metal mineralization may occur within the Granite IIb phase (endogranitic mineralization)  or  at  the  contact  of  Granite  IIa/IIb  as  contact  flank  or  contact  crest mineralization.    In  the  'South  Cupola'  of  the  North  Zone,  mineralization  may  occur  away from the contact, hosted by Granite IIa such as parts of the Upper Deep Tin Zone.

## Targets for Additional 'Resources' of Sn-In Base Metal Mineralization

Additional  'resources'  of  Sn-In-  base  metal  mineralization  may  be  found  in  and  around known cupolas or could exist associated with presently unknown granite bodies.

The following targets have been identified:

## Target 1 - West, East, and South of the South Cupola of the North Zone

Sn-In- base metal mineralization on the north side of the 'South Cupola' was discovered in 1972 and given the name Deep Tin Zone.  This body was re-drilled in 1996 (11 holes, AM961 to AM96-11).

Reinterpretation  of  earlier  surface  drilling  results  and  underground  mapping  and  sampling during 1986 in the North Zone access decline show that mineralization occurs on all sides of the South Cupola, over a vertical distance of about 200m.

Surface  hole  MPS  195,  a  vertical  hole,  straddles  the  southern  Granite  IIa/IIb  contact.    It assayed 0.16% Sn, 1.56% Zn and 121 ppm In over 192m.  Mineralization occurs also to the west of the South Cupola.

Surface  hole  MPS  162  intersected  a  well-mineralized  chlorite-fluorite  replacement  vein assaying 6.31% Sn, 0.80% Cu, 9.69% Zn and 0.06% In over 3m at the 1,100m elevation.

Mineralization east of the 'South Cupola' is found in the North Zone access decline and in several  surface  holes.    Selected  underground  samples  indicate  that  over  a  length  of  70m (13410 N to 13480N) the decline straddles the east side of the cupola.  The mineralization is mostly  as  Sn-Cu-As  in  chlorite-fluorite  veins  and  replacements.    Samples  yielded  up  to 13.49% Sn, 4.92% Cu and 7.81% As.  Indium values are generally low, at 0.01% In, which is to be expected as the mineralization at this elevation (around 975m) is low in sphalerite, the main indium carrier.

Several surface holes intersected Sn-In-Base metal mineralization above the decline.

MPS  170  intersected  a  high-grade  Sn-Cu  replacement  vein  at  the  1005m  level  assaying 6.78% Sn and 2.06% Cu over 7m.  This mineralization is similar to that of the North Zone Access Decline.

At  higher  elevations,  intersections  are  characterized  by  higher  zinc  values.    MPS  165 intersected  9.15% Zn,  0.82% Cu,  0.28% Sn  and  1660 ppm In  over  3m,  at  the  1040  level. MPS 147 intersected 9.54% Zn, 0.28% Cu, 0.28% Sn and 371 ppm In over 9.1m at the 1065 level.

## Target 2 - Area East of the North Zone Access Decline (East of 15500 E)

The area east of the North Zone Access Decline has been less explored than the area west of the decline.  It also includes the No. 5 lode area where shallow surface holes (e.g., DDH 117, DDH 141, etc.) intersected narrow (3-5m wide) mineralization zones high in Sn, Cu, Zn and As.  No indium assays are available for these holes.

Vertical hole E 16 (drilled in 1985) was drilled in the No. 5 lode area.  The hole intersected dykes and larger bodies of Granite II.  The area could be part of the South Cupola or could be underlain by a separate cupola.

## Target 3 - Area Between North Zone and Saddle Zone

No deep drilling was carried out over a distance of about 400m between the North Zone and the northern most drilled hole in the Saddle Zone (hole NMR 90-1).

This is a large area, a prime target area for extensions of existing zones or an area of unknown cupolas.

## Target 4 - Area Between North Zone and Surface Hole LNZ 13

There is no deep drilling information available for the area between the North Zone and hole LNZ  13,  covering  a  distance  of  500-700m.    LNZ  13  intersected  quartz-feldspar  porphyry (QFP)  intruded  by  Granite  III;  no  Granite  II  was  intersected.    However,  QFP  hosted replacements,  high  in  Zn  with  some  Sn  and  In  (max.  79 ppm over  6.1m)  may  indicate  the presence of Granite II in this area.

## Target 5 - Area Between Saddle Zone and the Fire Tower North Zone

No deep drilling was carried out between the southern most hole in the  Saddle Zone, NMR 90-2 and a cluster of five holes drilled in the Fire Tower North Zone, PRL 95-1 to 95-5.  The distance is approximately 300-350m.  There is potential for additional 'resources' of both the Saddle  Zone  and/or  the  Fire  Tower  North  Zone  or  mineralization  between  the  two  zones could be continuous.
