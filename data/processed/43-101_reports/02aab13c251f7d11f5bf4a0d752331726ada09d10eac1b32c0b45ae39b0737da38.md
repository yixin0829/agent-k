## Cautionary Statement

This  Preliminary  Assessment  is  preliminary  in  nature.    It  includes  inferred  mineral resources  that  are  considered  too  speculative  geologically  to  have  the  economic considerations  applied  to  them  that  would  enable  them  to  be  categorized  as  mineral reserves, and there is no certainty that the preliminary assessment will be realized.

## Executive Summary

## Introduction

The assets of Liberty Mines Inc ('Liberty') include the Hart nickel project ('Hart'). Considerable  recent  drilling  activity  has  occurred  over  this  property  to  delineate significant Kambalda-style nickel sulphides mineralization.

Liberty  engaged  SRK  Consulting  (Canada)  Inc.  ('SRK')  in  the  spring  of  2009  to prepare  a  Preliminary  Economic  Assessment  (Scoping  Study)  for  the  Hart  nickel project and compile a technical report. This technical report was prepared following the guidelines of the Canadian Securities Administrators National Instrument 43-101 and Form 43-101F1, and in conformity with generally accepted CIM 'Estimation of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves Best Practice Guidelines.'

This  current  Independent  Technical  Report  describes  the  status  of  all  aspects  of  the project and presents the Life-of Mine Plan.

## Property Description and Agreements

The Hart project consists of twenty-one contiguous unpatented mining claims held by Liberty  Mines  Inc.    The  claims  cover  approximately  992  hectares,  and  are  in  the process of being legally surveyed.  The property was acquired from Canadian Arrow Mines ('Canadian Arrow') by way of an option agreement. Liberty satisfied the option agreement and earned 100 percent ownership on January 18, 2008.

SRK visited the Hart project on January 14, 2008 and again in September 2009.

## Location, Access and Physiography

The Hart project is located approximately twenty-six kilometres southeast of the city of Timmins, Ontario. The property is accessed from the city of Timmins by a series of gravel roads. The access roads are used in all seasons, and are winter safe.

The Hart deposit is located in an area that is relatively flat with poor drainage. The topography  is  generally  flat  with  a  few  local  rock  outcrops  and  ranges  in  elevation from 290 to 330 metres above sea level. This area of northeast Ontario is characterized by climate typical of northern boreal forest areas, with extended periods of sub-zero temperatures  in  the  winter  months  from  November  through  to  March.  Moderate temperatures prevail during the summer months with temperatures in the range of ten to thirty degrees Celsius accompanied by moderate precipitation.

The Hart project surface area is large enough to accommodate all future mining related infrastructures.  It  is  located  in  close  proximity  to  other  Liberty  assets  including  the active Redstone and McWatters Mines.

## History

Minor trenching was completed by L.N. Hart on surface iron formation exposures in the period 1960 to 1964. Between 1964 and 1969, Norlex Mines Ltd. completed 1,854 metres  of  drilling  in  thirteen  holes  on  the  property.    Eight  of  the  Norlex  drill  holes intersected  the  nickel  mineralization.  Paramaque  Mines  Ltd.  drilled  1,950  metres  of

core  in six diamond  drill  holes  in  1968  and  1969  that  intersected  the  nickel mineralization. McWatters Gold Mines Limited acquired the property from Paramaque in 1969 and completed 2,440 metres of drilling in eight holes.

Starfire  Minerals  Inc  ('Starfire')  drilled  a  total  of  six  very  shallow  holes  in  the immediate area of the surface nickel showing in 2002. Canadian Arrow acquired the property in 2004 and drilled five drill holes, totalling 306 metres. Liberty optioned the property in 2006 and subsequently drilled 104 core boreholes (31,277 metres) in 2007 and 2008.

On January 18, 2008 Liberty met all obligations to Canadian Arrow Mines as set out under the option agreement, so that now Liberty owns 100 percent of the Hart property with no subsidiary involved.

## Geology and Mineralization

The Hart nickel deposit is hosted by ultramafic rocks that form part of, or intrude, the Tisdale assemblage that flank the Shaw Dome and form part of the Abitibi Greenstone Belt. To date five nickel-copper platinum group metals deposits have been discovered in  the  Shaw  Dome  (including  the  Hart  deposit)  and  numerous  showings  have  been identified.    These  five  deposits  occur  in  komatiitic  rocks  found  within  the  Deloro assemblage near the base of the Tisdale assemblage.

Five main rock types have been identified from Hart diamond drill core and surface mapping: footwall intermediate to felsic volcanics, banded iron formation, ultramafic flows, felsic dikes, and mafic dikes. The Hart deposit sulphide zone can be subdivided in three distinct zones: an upper zone of nickel-enriched banded iron formation, a basal lower zone consisting of massive to semi-massive sulphides and an interstitial zone of disseminated sulphides.

The  komatiitic  rocks,  which  host  the  nickel  mineralization  are  serpentinized  and locally altered to talc, chlorite and carbonate. The main sulphide zone that comprises the  majority  of  the  mineral  resource  consists  of  komatiite-hosted  massive  to  semimassive  sulphides  lying  conformably  on  dacitic  pyroclastic  flows    Typical  sulphide concentrations range from sixty to eighty percent pyrrhotite and ten to thirty percent pentlandite. Other sulphide minerals include minor pyrite and chalcopyrite.

## Mineral Resource Estimation

The mineral resources presented herein are reported in accordance with the Canadian Securities  Administrators'  National  Instrument  43-101  and  have  been  estimated  in conformity  with  generally  accepted  CIM  'Estimation  of  Mineral  Resource  and Mineral Reserves Best Practices' guidelines.

The database used for resource estimation includes drilling data collected during three exploration  programs  conducted  during  the  period  2005  to  2008.  The  total  database comprises 115 boreholes and five surface trenches.

Three  3D  wireframes  (iron  formation,  massive  sulphide  and  disseminated  sulphide) were constructed from the drilling information and a 0.3 percent nickel threshold to constrain grade estimation. The massive and disseminated sulphide wireframes were sub-divided in to two sub-domains (lower and upper).

Assay  intervals  in  each  wireframe  were  composited  to  1.0  metre  and  extracted  for statistical  analyses  and  grade  interpolation.  After  review  of  probability  plots,  nickel and copper composites were capped at 4.86 and 0.33 percent, respectively.

Isatis software was used to model traditional experimental variograms from the capped composites for the various mineralization domains for nickel and copper in all three principle  directions.  A  single  spherical  structure  variogram  was  fitted  for  each direction coinciding with geological features of the nickel mineralization. A Datamine sub-block  routine  was  used  to  fill  the  mineralization  wireframes  with  un-rotated blocks. Parent block size was set at 2.5 by 2.5 by 2.5 metres in the easting, northing and elevation directions respectively. An average specific gravity was assigned to each domain based on 231 pycnometry measurements obtained from the various sulphide mineralization types.

Block grades were estimated using inverse distance squared estimator because it was found  to  appropriately  reflect  general  grade  trends.  Block  grade  estimation  was completed in a single pass using the search ellipse ranges defined by variography.

Mineral resources were classified on the basis of variography and the confidence in geological interpretation.  An Indicated Mineral Resource classification was assigned to  blocks  within  the  primary  variography  range  from  sample  points.  An  Inferred Mineral  Resource  classification  was  assigned  to  blocks  within  twice  the  primary variography range from informing data.

Mineral  resources  for  the  Hart  deposit  have  been  estimated  according  to  the  'CIM Standards on Mineral Resources and Reserves: Definitions and Guidelines' (December, 2005) by Glen Cole, P.Geo an independent Qualified Person as defined by NI43-101. The Mineral Resources for the Hart nickel deposit are reported at a single cut-off  of  0.46  percent  nickel,  that  is  considered  by  Liberty  management  to  be achievable  by  a  future  underground  mine,  considering  the  nature  of  the  nickel mineralization, its geometry and the projected underground extraction scenario. This cut-off is primarily based on current mining experience at the comparable McWatters and Redstone Mines. The Mineral Resource Statement for the Hart nickel project is presented in   Table i.

## Exploration and Drilling

The relevant exploration drilling information considered for resource estimation was collected during three exploration programs conducted during the period 2005 to 2008. The total database comprises 115 boreholes and five surface trenches.

The drilling database includes eleven core boreholes drilled by Starfire and Canadian Arrow as well as 104 NQ calibre core boreholes drilled by Bradley Bros using industry best practices.

## Sampling Method, Approach and Analyses

Liberty used industry best practices to sample, handle and assay core samples collected on  the  Hart  project.  Core  samples  were  collected  from  half  core  split  mechanically lengthwise. Sampling intervals honour geological boundaries.

Liberty  submitted  their  core  samples  to  the  accredited  ALS-Chemex  laboratory  for preparation  in  Timmins  and  assaying  in  the  North  Vancouver,  British  Columbia laboratory. Each sample was assayed for nickel and copper by aqua regia digestion and atomic absorption spectrometry and occasionally for gold, platinum and palladium by conventional ICP-AES.

Liberty  implemented  adequate  analytical  quality  control  measures  to  monitor  the reliability of assay results delivered by the primary laboratory. This includes the use of quality control samples and blanks, and check assaying at umpire laboratories.

## Data Verifications

SRK visited the Hart project on January 18, 2008 during active drilling. SRK inspected active and recent drilling sites, and reviewed with Liberty personnel field and drilling procedures.  Drill  core  from  five  recent  boreholes  was  examined  to  ascertain  the geological setting of the nickel mineralization and to verify logging information.

SRK reviewed the analytical quality control data produced by Liberty and summarized these  data  on  a  bias  chart  to  ascertain  the  reliability  of  assay  data  delivered  by  the primary laboratory.

SRK  collected  seven  core  samples  replicating  the  original  sampling  intervals  for independent verification. The verification samples were specifically collected to attest to the existence of nickel and copper mineralization on the Hart property.

In the opinion of SRK, exploration data collected by Liberty generally meet 'industry best practices' and are sufficiently reliable for the purpose of resource estimation.

## Mineral Processing and Metallurgical Testing

Liberty operates the Redstone Mill located at the Redstone mine and approximately 6 kilometres by road from the Hart project. This 2,000 tonne per day capacity mill has been specifically built to process nickel sulphide ore with a high MgO content.

The mill uses conventional floatation and a laser induced plasma spectrometer online analyzer to measure the magnesium and nickel contents of the ground ore entering the flotation  circuit.  During  the  third  and  fourth  quarter  of  2009,  the  mill  achieved  an average  nickel  recovery  of  ninety  five  percent  with  a  monthly  throughput  between

4,000  and  10,000  tonnes.  Mill  feed  head  grade  varied  between  0.8  and  2.2  percent nickel.

## Mine Plan

The Hart Potentially Mineable Tonnage averages 1.29 percent nickel over 1.7 million tonnes that will benefit from a selective low cost mining method.  The tabular deposit strikes SSE at an average dip angle of seventy-five degrees to a depth of 570 metres below surface

On surface, the deposit area is characterized by poorly drained  overburden ranging from zero to 11 metres thickness.

Open at depth and along strike the known resource has a 220 metre strike length with average thickness of three metres near surface and 11 metres at depth.   The deposit averages 3,000 tonnes per vertical metre.

From diamond drill information  it  appears  that  the  footwall  contacts  are  sharp  with massive mineralization against volcanic rock while the hangingwall is gradational with a transition into a low grade disseminated sulphide zone.

This  study  assumes  the  rock  mass  characterization  at  the  nearby  Redstone  and McWatters  Nickel  Mines  are  representative  of  what  may  be  experienced  at  Hart. Rock mass quality at the site is therefore assumed to be poor to fair which suggests a non-entry stoping method be employed to recover the resource.

An l owner-operated underground mine (with contractor support) is planned with ramp access (4m x 4m).    Material handling options weighed the pros and cons of trucks against a monorail system for development and production needs at the mine.     The monorail system was  selected due to its proven economics  and performance characteristics as well as its flexibility to expand if the mine expands.   Listed in order of importance are the prime criterions which support the monorail as the recommended material handling method  as compared  to diesel trucks: smaller development excavations  are  required;  lower  operating  costs;  no  additional  ventilation;  reduced mine air heating requirements, higher reliability, automatable.

After  consideration  of  several  mining  methods,  (including  open  pit,  cut  &amp;  fill  and longhole retreat) Alimak mining was selected as most appropriate.

Alimak  raise  mining  was  selected  based  primarily  on  economic  consideration  of methods,  the  geometry  of  mineralization,  nickel  grade  and  assumed  geotechnical characteristics.  Alimak raise mining over 100 metre vertical intervals can provide the Hart property with high recovery, minimum dilution, optimum productivity and safety. The planned mining method also employs pastefill in a primary and secondary stoping sequence that is easily expanded if the resource expands.

SRK estimates  a  mine  life  of  4.5  years  (38  months  in  production)  with  an  average mining rate of 45,000 tonnes per month.

A 3-D model was constructed to plan the underground mine and estimate life-of-mine development requirements.     Expectations  are  that  a  total  of  8,500  metres  of  lateral development  and  560  metres  of  raise  development  will  be  required  over  the  life  of mine.

Hart  Mine  will  be  accessed  by  a  4  x  4m  ramp,  4m  x  3m  levels  and  3m  x  3m drawpoints.  Raises for fresh air are planned at 3m x 3m from surface to the bottom of the designed mine, with exhaust exiting through the main access ramp.

All  underground  broken  rock  will  be  mucked  by  LHDs  and  hauled  to  remuck  bays located  on  the  levels.    Monorail  operators  will  use  smaller  LHD's  to  self  load  the monorail cars for transport to surface.   Upon arrival at surface the monorail cars will be tippled into bins.   Highway haulage trucks will then drive under the bins and load with plant feed for delivery to the Redstone mill 6 kilometres away or short haul 200 meters to surface waste storage.

Mine  contractors  will  perform  the  following  functions  at  Hart;  ramp  development, Alimak raise development, production drilling  and  blasting.      Liberty  crews  will  be used to develop all working levels (40m L, 90m L, 190m L, 290m L, 390m L, 490m L and 570m L) as well as perform all mine service, rock handling and paste backfilling functions.

SRK prepared  an  underground  production  schedule  with  an  average  ore  production rate of 1,500tpd over a mine life of 38 months.  LoM plant feed totals 1,729kt at an average grade of 1.29% Ni.

## Environmental

Liberty intends to conduct environmental studies and obtain the necessary permits to be  able  to  conduct  mining  operations  for  Hart.    Liberty  has  initiated  the  permitting process for Hart.

The  Hart  project  will  benefit  from  the  environmental  programs  and  plans  already developed by Liberty at its other mining operations that can be amended to address the Hart project.  These plans include 'Spill Prevention and Emergency Response'.

Mine dewatering effects need to be studied but Liberty does not expect to adversely impact any other water users, surface water features, or sensitive areas.

Harts main rock types, assumed to be similar to those at the nearby McWatters Mine, are expected to show that, on aggregate, they are unlikely to be acid generating.

Liberty will need to prepare a closure plan in compliance with Mine Development and Closure under Part VII of the Mining Act and Ontario Regulation 240/00.

## Project Risks and Opportunities

## Risks

The most significant project risk is  the  economic  viability  of  the  Hart  project  if  the nickel price or exchange rate experience significant and prolonged negative variances from the values used in the economic assessment.

The underground geotechnical conditions at Hart have been assumed to be similar to the neighbouring mines operated by Liberty.  There is a risk that future geotechnical assessment based on underground development exposures will lead to less favourable estimates of stope dimensioning and external dilution, resulting in a negative impact on project economics.

## Opportunities

SRK believes that there is a strong potential to increase the Inferred Resources at Hart particularly by drilling the depth extensions of the sulphide zones. It is most likely that additional  infill  drilling  will  upgrade  the  current  Inferred  mineral  resources  to  an Indicated classification.

The project is most sensitive to the nickel price and any increase in the nickel price will have a positive effect on the project cashflow.

## Conclusion and Recommendations

The Hart nickel property shows potentially mineable tonnage which can be extracted using proven mining methods, productivities and costs.

Of the total estimated tonnage, 77% is based on indicated resources and 23% is based on inferred resources.

SRK  recommends  Liberty  move  towards  preparation  of  a  Prefeasibility  Study  to confirm and/or optimise the findings within this Scoping Study.

The  indicative  pre-tax  economic  results  of  this  scoping  study  indicate  the  project, based on the cost and revenue estimates contained in the report, is positive using an 8% discount  factor,  an  exchange  rate  of  $CAN  1.00  =  $US  0.90  and  a  US$7.00/lb nickel value. Also, SRK recommends:

- · Increasing the drill density at depths between 450 to 600 metres below surface;
- · Undertake  structural  investigations  to  improve  the  quality  of  the  3D  geological model;
- · Continue to model the intrusive dikes and also attempt to identify portions of the disseminated sulphide and ironstone hosted zones exhibiting higher nickel grades;
- · Update the resource model once the geological model has been updated.
- · Continue the permitting process and supporting studies including characterization of ARD potential of rock types, and geochemical characterization of tailings and site discharge water;
- · Basic  engineering  for  application  of the monorail  technology  needs  to  be undertaken;
- · A  pastefill  consultant  be  tasked  to  confirm  the  suitability  of  creating  a  quality pastefill for use at Hart and to perform basic engineering, costing and scheduling for a pastefill plant and distribution system;
- · Geotechnical investigation and assessment should be conducted to verify planned stoping dimensions and  external dilution estimates:

## 1 Introduction

## 1.1 Background

The assets of Liberty Mines Inc ('Liberty') include a 100 percent interest in the  Hart  Nickel  Resource  ('Hart'),  located  about  27  kilometres  southeast  of Timmins, Ontario, Canada in Langmuir Township about six kilometres east of the Redstone Mine.

Hart  is  a  multi-million  pound  intermediate  nickel  grade  discovery  at  the advanced exploration stage that has excellent potential.

Considerable recent drilling activity has occurred over this property between 2005 and 2008, which has delineated significant Kambalda-style nickel-copper massive sulphides preserved locally in palaeo-topographic depressions.

Liberty approached SRK Consulting (Canada) Inc. ('SRK') in January 2008 to commission  an  initial  mineral  resource  estimate  for  the  Hart  nickel  project. During  the  ensuing  months  SRK  and  Liberty  worked  together  to  compile  a validated  database  and  model  the  geology  of  the  deposit  to  be  used  for resource estimation.   A mineral resource statement was issued to Liberty on June 22, 2008.   It formed the basis for a press release issued by Liberty on June 23, 2008 to disclose publically the initial  mineral  resource  estimate  for the Hart nickel project.

In  early  2009  Liberty  approached  SRK  to  develop  a  Preliminary  Economic Assessment of that resource.

Economic analyses includes forecast mine production rates that contain capital costs to develop and sustain the mining operation as well as operating costs, and projected cash flows.

This  PEA  was  prepared  following  the  guidelines  of  the  Canadian  Securities Administrators  National  Instrument  43-101  and  Form  43-101F1,  and  in conformity  with  generally  accepted  CIM  'Estimation  of  Mineral  Resources and Mineral Reserves Best Practice Guidelines'.

## 1.2 Scope of work

For  the  Hart  project,  the  technical  report  will  be  a  Preliminary  Economic Assessment that will include the mine development and production plan, and an estimate of mineable tonnage that will include Inferred mineral resources. No changes are needed to the resource block model - the existing model will be used.

The report will benefit from SRK's previous involvement in previous resource work  done  to  date.    Besides  site  meeting  and  discussions  with  Liberty personnel SRK will prepare a capital cost estimate as a basis for the Hart site infrastructure and mine services. SRK will model the facilities after the other Liberty mines and draw on Liberty's cost information as much as possible.

If a cost estimate is needed for special containment of 'iron formation' waste rock,  SRK  will  solicit  help  on  a  factored  estimate  from  the  SRK  our  Geoenvironmental Group in Vancouver.

## 1.3 Basis of the work

This  report  is  based  on  information  provided  to  SRK  by  Liberty  as  well  as information collected during the site visit.

## 1.6 Site Visit

In  compliance  with  NI  43-101  guidelines,  each  of  the  qualified  persons responsible for this report visited the Hart site.

Mr. Glen Cole visited the Hart site on January 14, 2008 accompanied by Mr. Randall.

The visits main purpose was to conduct geological investigations, validations and  inspections  of  available  diamond  drill  core  from  the  Liberty  drilling programs.    Validation  samples  of  split  core  were  taken  by  SRK.  SRK  also visited active drilling sites. The nickel mineralization does not outcrop.

Mr.  MacKenzie  visited  the  Hart  site  in  October  2009  accompanied  by  Mr. Bridson. The  purpose  of  their visit was  to confirm  the sites location, topography and accessibility.

Mr. Ken Reipas visited the Hart site and the Redstone mill site on June 10 -11, 2009.

SRK  was  given  full  access  to  all  relevant  data  and  held  discussions  with Liberty exploration personnel to obtain information on the current exploration work,  understand  field  procedures  used  to  collect,  record,  store  and  analyze exploration data.

## 2 Reliance on other Experts and Declaration

The technical work referenced in this report is the combined result of technical inputs from Liberty as well as SRK technical staff. SRK's opinion contained herein  is  based  on  information  provided  to  SRK  by  Liberty  throughout  the course  of  SRK's  investigations,  which  in  turn  reflect  various  technical  and economic conditions at the time of writing.  Given the nature of the mining business environment, these conditions can change significantly over relatively short periods of time. Consequently actual results may be significantly more or less favourable.

A  small  portion  of  the  project  database  (five  drill  holes)  originates  from exploration  programs  and  sampling  activities  in  2005.    These  data  cannot always  be  adequately  verified  and  a  reliance  on  the  integrity  of  such  data received from Liberty exists.

This report includes technical information, which requires subsequent calculations to derive sub-totals, totals and weighted averages. Such calculations inherently involve a degree of rounding and consequently introduce a margin of error.  Where these occur, SRK does not consider them to be material.

SRK is not an insider, associate or an affiliate of Liberty, and neither SRK nor any affiliate has acted as advisor to Liberty or its affiliates in connection with this project.  The results of the technical review by SRK are not dependent on any prior agreements concerning the conclusions to be reached, nor are there any undisclosed understandings concerning any future business dealings. SRK has not performed an independent verification of land title and tenure as summarized in Section 3 of this report. SRK did not verify the legality of any underlying  agreement(s)  that  may  exist  concerning  the  licenses  or  other agreement(s) between third parties but have relied on the client's solicitor(s) to have  conducted  the  proper  legal  due  diligence.  SRK  verified  the  tenure information  on  the  Ministry  of  Northern  Development  and  Mines  Mining

Claims Information System as of the effective date of this technical report.

The  qualified  persons  preparing  this  technical  report  are  not  experts  in  the assessment  of  potential  environmental  liabilities  associated  Hart  project.  As such,  no  verification  was  conducted  by  SRK  and  no  opinion  is  expressed regarding the environmental aspect of this exploration project.

The  Hart  nickel  project  is  an  undeveloped  exploration  property.  Minimal surface disturbances have arisen from the surface exploration work completed by  Liberty.  These  include,  line  cutting,  ground  geophysical  surveying  and surface  diamond  drilling.  The  exploration  work  was  completed  within  the government authorizations.

SRK was informed by Liberty that there are no known litigations potentially affecting the Hart Property.

## 3 Property Description and Location

## 3.1 Introduction

The general location  of  the  Hart  Project  is  shown  in  Figure  1.    It  is  located approximately  twenty-seven  kilometres  southeast  of  the  city  of  Timmins, Ontario.  The property is within the boundaries of the city of Timmins and is centered at approximately UTM (NAD83 Z17) coordinates 5,350,230 mN and 493,900  mE.    The  property  is  located  in  Eldorado  Township,  within  the Porcupine Mining Division, and is accessed from the city of Timmins/South Porcupine by a series of all-weather gravel roads.  A detailed location map of the Hart Project in relation to the City of Timmins is shown in Figure 3.

Figure 1: Location of the Hart Project in Central Ontario, Canada.

## 3.2 Land Tenure

The Hart Property consists of twenty-one contiguous unpatented mining claims held by Liberty Mines Inc. and located in Langmuir and Eldorado Townships of  the  Porcupine  Mining  Division.    These  claims  total  approximately  992 hectares, and are in the process of being legally surveyed. The details of these

claims  are  listed  in  Appendix  A.  A  Plan  showing  the  Hart  Project  mining claims is shown in Figure 2.

SRK  verified  the  ownership  status  of  these  tenements  on  the  Ministry  of Northern Development and Mines Mining Claims Information System. As of the  effective  date  of  this  technical  report,  all  mining  claims  are  valid  with expiry dates ranging from May 28, 2010 to July 18, 2013 (see Appendix A).

The  mineral  resources  reported  herein  are  all  located  on  claims  number 1248466, 1248465 and 1247593 (Figure 2).

## 3.3 Underlying agreements

On July  17,  2006  Liberty  optioned  the  Hart  property  from  Canadian  Arrow Mines.    At  this  time  the  property  consisted  of  claims  1243281,  1243282, 1243283,  1247591,  1247592,  1247593,  1247594,  1248465,  1248466,  and 1248467 (the remaining claims were staked by Liberty). On January 18, 2008 Liberty  met  all  obligations  to  Canadian  Arrow  Mines  as  set  out  under  the option agreement, so that now Liberty owns 100 percent of the Hart property with no subsidiary involved.

## 4 Accessibility, Climate, Local Resources, Infrastructure and Physiography

The Hart Property is proximal to the city of Timmins, Ontario, which has a population  of  48,000.  The  population  consists  of  a  skilled  workforce  with considerable experience and history in mining  and mineral processing. Infrastructure is adequate to supply potential power and services for developing local resources, as well as mineral exploration activities.

The property is accessed from the city of Timmins by a series of gravel roads. Approximately twenty-six kilometres southeast of Timmins, a road branches east to the Hart property. Approximately three kilometres east along this road the deposit location is reached. The access roads are used in all seasons, and are winter safe.

The Hart deposit is located in an area that is relatively flat with poor drainage. The deposit location is generally low-lying with a few local rock outcrops and ranges in elevation from 290 to 330 metres above sea level.

No waters flow through the site. The site naturally drains to the south into the Forks  River.    The  property  lies  entirely  within  the  Night  Hawk  Lake  subwatershed. The Forks River drains north-easterly into the Night Hawk River which flows north-easterly into Night Hawk Lake. Night Hawk Lake in turn drains  to  the  Frederickhouse  River.  The  Frederickhouse  River  drains  to  the Abitibi  River  (north  of  Cochrane)  then  to  Moose  River,  which  ultimately discharges into James Bay.

The  terrestrial  vegetation  is  a  combination  of  typical  black  spruce-lowland areas  and  slightly  higher  ground  with  soft  wood  forest  (Figure  4).  This vegetation  type  tends  to  represent  a  forest  to  wetland  transition  zone,  and  is characterized  by  poplar,  pine,  black  spruce,  bog  rosemary,  pale  laurel,  and sphagnum.

Wildlife  communities  around  the  Hart  deposit  are  typical  of  other  poorly drained  northern  boreal  forest  areas.  The  majority  of  the  several  species present  are  small  mammals  and  songbirds  that  are  common  and  widely distributed.  Other  species  include  ungulates,  furbearers  and  raptors.  Moose populations in the area are low to moderate. Furbearers in the vicinity include beaver, marten, mink, muskrat, fox, lynx and black bear. Other animal types include the snowshoe hare, fisher and wolf.

The climate is typical of northern boreal forest areas, with extended periods of sub zero temperatures in the winter months of November through to March. Moderate temperatures prevail during the summer months with temperatures in the range of ten to thirty degrees Celsius accompanied by moderate precipitation. Experience indicates that most preliminary exploration activities can be executed in the summer months.

The  Hart  Project  surface  area  is  large  enough  to  accommodate  all  future mining related infrastructures. The Hart Project is located in close proximity to other Liberty owned infrastructures, including the operational Redstone Mine as  well  as  to  the  McWatters  Project,  which  currently  in  at  an  early  stage  of development.

## 5 History

The exploration history of the Hart property has been summarized by Brereton (2004), from which the following compilation has been extracted.

Minor trenching was completed by L.N. Hart on the surface iron formation exposures in the period 1960 to 1964. It is probable that the first indications of nickel were recorded at that time.  In the period 1964 to 1968, Norlex Mines Ltd. carried out ground EM and magnetic surveys and completed 1,854 metres of drilling in thirteen holes on the property.  Eight of the Norlex drill holes intersected nickel mineralization and are summarized in Table 1.

Paramaque Mines Ltd. subsequently acquired the property and drilled 1,950 metres of core in six diamond drill holes in the period 1968 to 1969.  These holes were also successful in intersecting nickel mineralization and are summarized in Table 2.

McWatters Gold Mines Limited acquired the property from Paramaque in 1969 and completed 2,440 metres of drilling in eight holes. The results of this work are missing from assessment files in the Timmins MNDM office, which may suggest that this drilling did not intersect mineralization. No evidence of this drilling has been found on site.

Tontine Mining Limited purchased McWatters Gold Mines Limited in 1969 and apparently completed a feasibility study on the economics of the Hart deposit (this work is only referenced in a report by Timmins Nickel Inc with no information available on this study).  Timmins Nickel Inc purchased the Hart property in 1989 and completed airborne magnetic and EM surveys over the area.  This initial program was followed by ground magnetics and IP over the mineralized portion of the ultramafic. Timmins Nickel never carried out a drill program on the Hart Project.

Starfire Minerals Inc drilled a total of six very shallow holes in the immediate area of the surface showing in 2002. The holes were also extremely closely spaced and therefore tested the same portion of the nickel mineralization, referred to in this report as the IF Zone.  These holes are considered in the present mineral resource estimate, but are deemed of limited value to the overall definition of the ore body.  Low values were reported.

Canadian Arrow Mines acquired the property in 2004 through their subsidiary Legendary Ore Mining Company.  Canadian Arrow Mines conducted ground geophysics over the property and completed diamond drill program comprising of five drill holes, totalling 306 metres.

Since 2005, Liberty has drilled a total of 104 drillholes with an average length of 301 metres. A limited amount of surface trenching was also undertaken.

## 6 Geological Setting

## 6.1 Introduction

The geology section of this report focuses on the description of the property geology, exploration work completed to date, database development, quality assurance/quality controls ('QA/QC'), geological modeling, and resource estimation.

## 6.2 Regional Geological setting

The Hart deposit is hosted by ultramafic rocks that form part of, or intrude, the Tisdale assemblage that flank the Shaw Dome and form part of the Abitibi greenstone belt (AGB).  The Abitibi greenstone belt is one of the youngest parts of the Achaean Superior Province forming what is considered one of the largest and best-preserved belts of its kind in the world.  The Abitibi belt developed between 2.8 to 2.6 Ga (Jackson and Fyon, 1991) and has been subdivided in 9 lithotectonic assemblages (Ayer et al., 2002; Sproule et al., 2002).

The relationships between these assemblages are ambiguous and may represent a superposition of allochththonous terranes (each terrane having been formed in a different tectonic environment), or a tectonically complex and structurally deformed single autochthonous terrane formed along a convergent margin, or a combination of both these.  Even though the AGB has been subdivided into 9 distinct lithotectonic assemblages, only four of these are generally accepted to contain komatiitic rocks and therefore considered prospective for ultramafichosted Ni-Cu-(PGE) sulphide deposits.  These four assemblages have distinct and well defined ages as well as spatial distribution (Figure 5): the Pacaud assemblage (2750-2735 Ma), the Stoughton-Roquemaure assemblage (27232720 Ma), the Kidd-Munro assemblage (2719-2711 Ma), and the Tisdale assemblage (2710-2703 Ma).  These four assemblages differ considerably in the physical volcanology and geochemistry of the komatiitic flows.  It is important to note that the latter two of these assemblages contain larger volumes of high magnesium, Al-undepleted komatiites (&gt; five percent), while the Tisdale assemblage contains more andesitic rocks and sulphide facies iron formations (Sproule et al., 2003).

The Shaw Dome is a major anticline centred approximately 20 km southeast of Timmins, Ontario (Muir, 1979; Green and Naldrett, 1981; Figure 5). The anticlinal structure may be a result of regional folding that affected rocks north of the Shaw Dome or, more probably, due to the diapiric action of a large granitic body which partially outcrops in the central south-east portion of the dome.  Volcanic rocks associated with the Shaw Dome have been associated with the Deloro assemblage (2730 to 2725 Ma: Ayer et al., 1999) and younger Tisdale assemblage.  Pyke (1982) further sub-divided these assemblages into three volcanic formations: lower, middle, and upper volcanic formations.  The lower formation of the Deloro assemblage is not exposed in the Shaw Dome, while the middle formation occupies the central part of the Dome north of the

Redstone mine.  The upper volcanic formation of the Deloro was described by Pyke (1982) to contain a relative abundance of sulphide facies iron formations and a predominance of intermediate to felsic volcanic rocks of dacitic to andesitic composition.  Pyke (1982) does not mention the presence of extrusive komatiitic rocks in this assemblage having mapped all of the ultramafic rocks contained within this supracrustal package as intrusive in nature (Pyke, 1970, 1975).  Pyke (1982) does, however, add that 'there is some intercalation of the komatiites (of the Tisdale assemblage) with the Deloro Group volcanic rocks'.  Since, both intrusive and extrusive ultramafic rocks have been identified  within the Deloro volcanic package (Hall &amp; Houle, 2003; Houle et al., 2004; Houle &amp; Guillmette, 2005) outlined by Pyke (1982). Therefore, either the assumption that the Deloro assemblage is devoid of komatiitic flows needs to be revised or the disconformity that delineates the contact between Deloro and Tisdale rocks modified.

Stone &amp; Stone (2000) divided the komatiitic rocks into two horizons making no reference to stratigraphy: the lower komatiitic horizon (LKH) and the upper komatiitic horizon (UKH).  The UKH consists of extrusive komattitic rocks intercalated with calc-alkalic volcanic rocks and sulphide facies iron formations, while the LKH consists of komatiitic rocks that intrude the underlying felsic to intermediate volcanic flows and interbedded iron formations.  The rocks that form the LKH are mostly dunites, whelrlites, pyroxenites, and gabbros that intruded sometime between 2,725 Ma and 2,707 Ma (Stone &amp; Stone, 2000 and references therein).  The UKH rocks are cumulate, spinifex textured and aphyric komatiites that extruded sometime before 2,703 Ma (Corfu et al., 1989).  The UKH komatiitic intrusions are interpreted to represent part of the feeder system that resulted in the eruption of channelized komatiitic flows that are, at least initially, cogenetic and form what is now a large dyke-sill-lava complex.  Observations and interpretations by Stone &amp; Stone (2000) are supported by later mapping of Adams, Shaw, Langmuir, and Carman Twps by Houle et al. (2004) and Houle &amp; Guillmette (2005).

To date five Ni-Cu-(PGE) deposits have been discovered in the Shaw Dome (Redstone, Hart, McWatters, Langmuir #1, Langmuir #2), and numerous showings have been identified (Galata, etc).  These five deposits occur in komatiitic rocks found within the Deloro assemblage near the base of the Tisdale assemblage.

## 6.3 Property Geology

Five main rock types have been identified from diamond drill core and surface mapping:  footwall  intermediate  to  felsic  volcanics,  banded  iron  formation (BIF), mineralized ultramafic flows, felsic dykes, and mafic dykes. A surface geology  map  based  on  outcrop  mapping  and  diamond  drilling  is  shown  in Figure 7.  Based on whole rock data the volcanic rocks range in composition from  andesite  to  dacite,  classified  using  a  total  alkalis  versus  silica  (TAS) diagram. They often exhibit pyroclastic textures, including blocks, bombs and lapilli.    The  ultramafic  rocks  are  of  komatiitic  composition  plotting  near  the 100 percent Mg apex on the Jensen cation plot (Jensen, 1976).  The dykes are syeno-diorites and gabbros respectively (also using a TAS diagram).

The ultramafic flows, known as komatiites, lie conformably on the banded iron formation which, in turn, overlies the dacitic, pyroclastic volcanic flows.  In localized areas the banded iron formation has been thermally eroded so that the komatiitic flows are in direct contact with the felsic volcanic rocks, forming palaeotopographic embayments.  During this process, and as a direct result of the  sulphur  contamination,  nickel-sulphide  precipitation  occurred  within  the still active ultramafic flows, accumulating due to gravitational settling in many

of  these  localized  embayments.    Subsequent  regional  tectonic  events  have uplifted the package so that it now dips SSE at an average angle of seventyfive  degrees  from  horizontal.    Little  subsequent  structural  modification  has been detected in core samples, unlike the nearby Redstone deposit which has been subjected to considerable post mineralization stress.

The  process  of  sulphide  assimilation  by  the  komatiitic  flow  has  been  well recorded in the Hart deposit.  In addition to the classical  magmatic sulphide assemblage a contaminated iron formation (IF Zone) occurs near surface.  This geological  unit  bears  more  visual  resemblance  to  the  barren  banded  iron formations that flank it, including predominant  quartzitic and graphitic bedding  planes,  but  contain  significant  nickel  mineralization.    Values  range from  anomalous  to  over  two  percent  Ni.    This  area  is  interpreted  as  in  situ evidence  of  sulphide  assimilation,  showing  that  the  sulphur  source  and depositional  environments  can  occur  in  very  close  proximity.    This  IF  Zone also  occurs  in  a  stratigraphically  higher  region  than  the  magmatic  sulphides, re-enforcing the model.

The komatiitic rocks, which host the mineralization are serpentinized and locally altered to talc, chlorite and carbonate. Spinifex textures are common, occurring at distinct stratigraphic horizons, serving as a tentative marker horizon. The contained sulphide minerals in decreasing abundance are pyrrhotite, pentlandite, minor pyrite and chalcopyrite, occurring predominantly as massive to semi-massive sulphides at the base of the komatiitic flow.  The total sulphide abundance decreases with increasing distance from the basal contact, in keeping with the classical model involving sulphide settling in an active magmatic environment.  As result, the deposit exhibits the full range of concentrations from one to 100 percent sulphides

Figure 7: Simplified surface geological map of the Hart Project.

## 7 Deposit Types

The distribution of magmatic Ni-Cu-PGE sulphide deposits in Canada, with a resource size greater than 100,000 tonnes is shown in Figure 8.

Considerable research by various writers over the years indicates that komatiite  hosted  nickel  deposits  in  the  Timmins  area  are  similar  to  the Achaean age nickel deposits of the Kambalda and Windarra areas in Western Australia.

In the AGB four of the assemblages contain komatiites. Komatiite-associated Ni-Cu-(PGE) deposits have only been identified within the Kidd- Munro and Tisdale (including Hart) assemblages. This is consistent with the interpretation that komatiite associated Ni-Cu-(PGE) deposits form within lava channels of channelized sheet flows, but not within sheet flows or lava lobes.

Tisdale assemblage ultramafic volcanic rocks with high MgO contents (up to thirty-two percent) are defined as aluminium undepleted komatiites ('AUK'). Individual flows are usually less than 100 metres thick and typically occur at or near the base of ultramafic sequences. The flow units can be recognised by the presence of chilled contacts, the distribution of spinifex textures, marked compositional or mineralogical changes at unit boundaries and the presence of ultramafic  breccia  or  sulphidic  sediments  at  contacts.    Intrusive  counterparts have also been recognized in the Tisdale assemblage.

The following three paragraphs are largely based on Lesher &amp; Keays (2002), parts of which are paraphrased.

Komatiite-hosted Ni-Cu-PGE deposits are one of several lithological associations  within  the  broader  group  of  magmatic  Ni-Cu-PGE  deposits. Mineralization occurs in both extrusive and intrusive settings and experimental studies  indicate  that  komatiitic  magmas/lavas  were  emplaced  at  very  high temperatures.    Deposits  of  this  association  are  mined  primarily  for  their  Ni contents,  but  they  contain  economically-significant  amounts  of  Cu,  Co,  and PGE.

Komatiite-associated  nickel  sulphide  deposits  are  part  of  a  continuum  of lithotectonic  associations  in  the  family  of  magmatic  Ni-Cu-PGE  deposits, which  contains  a  variety  of  mineralization  types  (Table  3  from  Lesher  &amp; Keays, 2002).

The distribution of magmatic Ni-Cu-PGE sulphide deposits in Canada, with a resource size greater than 100,000 tonnes is shown in Figure 8.

Considerable research by various writers over the years indicates that komatiite  hosted  nickel  deposits  in  the  Timmins  area  are  similar  to  the Achaean age nickel deposits of the Kambalda and Windarra areas in Western Australia.

In the AGB four of the assemblages contain komatiites. Komatiite-associated Ni-Cu-(PGE) deposits have only been identified within the Kidd- Munro and Tisdale (including Hart) assemblages. This is consistent with the interpretation that komatiite associated Ni-Cu-(PGE) deposits form within lava channels of channelized sheet flows, but not within sheet flows or lava lobes.

Most of the deposits in the Shaw Dome are Type I (stratiform basal), including Liberty's  Redstone  and  Hart  deposits.  Type  Ib  (magmatic  footwall  vein) mineralization is a minor mineralization type associated with Type I deposits, but is an important ore type in other associations (e.g., Cu-PPGE-rich footwall veins at Sudbury). Types IIa (blebby disseminated) and IIc (cloudy disseminated) are common minor mineralization types associated with Types I and  IIb. Type  III  (stratiform  'reef') mineralization  is  a more  recentlyrecognized  primary  mineralization  type  in  this  association  and  is  normally subeconomic,  but  is an important ore type in other associations (e.g., Bushveld,  Stillwater).  Type  IVa  (Ni-enriched  metasediment)  mineralization occurs  in  many  deposits  where  Type  I  ores  are  intimately  associated  with sulphidic  metasedimentary  rocks,  as  is  the  case  with  the  Hart  deposit.  Type IVb (hydrothermal vein) mineralization is a relatively minor, but genetically important secondary ore type. Type V (offset) mineralization is associated with almost all Type I deposits and is common both at Redstone and Hart deposits.

The genesis of the Shaw Dome and the Australian deposits is attributed to the combined effect of lava channels (or channelized sheet flows) and intrusives, which  provides the heat and metal sources and sulphide bearing iron formations  in  the  footwall  that,  provide  an  external  sulphur  source.  Thermal erosion of the underlying rocks by the komatiite flows is considered to be the dominant mechanism for adding sulphur to the magma and to the creating a depositional 'trough' for sulphide minerals. Type II mineralization characteristically contains disseminated sulphide mineralization within channelized flows resulting in large tonnage low grade deposits. Characteristics  of  this  deposit  type  which  should  be  used  in  exploration methodologies include:

- · Geological mapping of komatiite flow units;
- · Presence of sulphidic footwall rocks;
- · Lithogeochemical surveys can detect AUK komatiites;
- · Airborne and ground electromagnetic surveys will detect the location of massive sulphide mineralization, whereas magnetic surveys should detect phyrrotite rich sulphide mineralization.

## 8 Mineralization

The Hart deposit mineralized zone can be subdivided in three distinct zones: an upper zone of Ni-enriched banded iron formation (IF Zone), a basal, lower zone  consisting  of  massive  to  semi-massive  sulphides  (Figure  10),  and  a stratigraphically  overlying  zone  of  disseminated  sulphides.    The  IF  Zone consists primarily of altered metasediments including quartzite, graphite, and abundant pyrite and troilite.  Overlying ultramafic rocks have enriched the iron sulphides with nickel.  This zone is well bedded and primarily sedimentary.

The main zone that comprises the majority of the mineral resource consists of komatiite-hosted  massive  to  semi-massive  sulphides  lying  conformably  on dacitic  pyroclastic  flows.    The  sulphide  assemblage  consists  of  pyrrhotite, pentlandite, and minor pyrite and chalcopyrite. Typical sulphide concentrations range in the sixty to eighty percent pyrrhotite and ten to thirty percent  pentlandite.    The  pentlandite  occurs  intergrown  with  pyrrhotite  as irregular grains that are generally relatively coarse grained.  Microphotographs of  thin  sections  taken  from  this  zone  are  shown  in  Figure  11  and  Figure  12. The massive zone is overlain by disseminated sulphides of varying sulphide modal abundance, ranging from under one percent to twenty-five percent.  The sulphide minerals are similar to those of the massive zone, with the exception of minor amounts of millerite also identified in thin section.  Silicate minerals have been completely serpentized and/or carbonatized.

## 9 Exploration

## 9.1 Historical

A review of the historical exploration activities on the Hart Property has been presented in Section 5 of this report.

## 9.2 Exploration Work by Liberty

Since 2005, Liberty has drilled a total of 104 NQ size diamond drillholes with an  average  length  of  301  metres.  A  total  of  five  surface  trenches  were  also undertaken.

## 9.3 Future Exploration Work

The komatiitic flow that hosts the Hart ore zone continues at depth and has a strike  length  of  several  kilometres.    Future  exploration  will  focus  on  drill testing the depth extension from surface and/or underground drill bays in the event  of  mining.    At  depth  a  gabbroic  dyke  is  known  to  cross-cut  the mineralization.  The nature of the ore body below this dyke is unknown and warrants further exploration.

The Hart Property is shown on a regional aeromagnetic image of the area (in relation to Liberty's regional claim outline) is shown in Figure 13.The entire strike  length  of  the  komatiitic  flow  package  is  prospective  as  the  geological setting has been shown to be fertile.  It is recommended that the strike length be evaluated and drill tested. Of particular importance is the identification of nickel  enriched  metasediments  in  the  immediate  vicinity  of  the  magmatic sulphides, such that future exploration should be well aware of this relationship.  There are numerous instances throughout the Shaw Dome of iron formations in contact with komatiitic flows that may exhibit a similar signature upon closer inspection.

## 10  Drilling

## 10.1  Introduction

During the period 1964 to 2002, a number of exploration companies undertook various phases of drilling activities in the vicinity of the Hart property. Poor records exist of the diamond drilling during this period, and the results have not been used in the present study.  The block model used in this study was based on drilling conducted by Starfire Minerals Inc., Canadian Arrow Mines, and Liberty Mines Inc.  Total drilling amounted to 32,054 metres of diamond drill core.  Details of this drilling are tabulated in Table 4.

Table 4:  Summary of drilling data available for the Hart Project

| Company           | Period   | Type       |   No. Holes | Total Metres   |   Drilling Details Average Metres |

| Canadian Arrow    | 2005     | Surface DD |           5 | 306            |                              61   |

Diamond drilling conducted by Starfire Minerals consists of six, short angled holes.    Original  drill  logs  and  assay  certificates  from  Swastika  Laboratories, Kirkland  Lake,  ON  (Canada),  were  found.    Surface  plan  maps  showing drillhole  locations  were  also  located,  which  aided  in  reconstructing  drillhole locations.    Casings  were  inconsistently  left  in  the  ground  enabling  Liberty Mines to survey a few of the holes, adding confidence to the data.  The drill core pertaining to this phase of drilling has not been examined by Liberty staff or SRK, and therefore has not been independently verified.

Diamond drilling conducted by Canadian Arrow Mines consists of five angled holes.    Original  drill  logs  and  assay  certificates  from  Swastika  Laboratories, Kirkland Lake, ON were examined.  Drillhole collars were all identified and surveyed. Drill core from this phase of drilling is stored at the Redstone Mine site, where Liberty staff was able to corroborate geological and analytical data satisfactorily.

## 10.2  Drilling by Liberty (post 2005)

All drilling by Liberty was conducted from surface.  A total of 104 HQ-size core boreholes with an average length of 301 metres were completed on the site  (31,277  metres).    The  core  is  stored  at  the  Redstone  Mine  site  and  is available for review.

The drilling contractor for the entire program was Bradley Bros of Timmins. The boreholes are labelled by a clear alphanumeric code. The drill core was not  routinely  photographed,  although  representative  core  intersections  were photographed.

Drill collars were surveyed by a land surveyor, with the original collar azimuth and  plunge  setup  determined  by  compass  and/or  cut  grid  lines.  Downhole surveying was routinely conducted at twenty-five metre intervals with an EZ

Shot Reflex instrument. Casing is used for one hole per set-up for all surface drill locations, with  collar pickets installed with  clear labels indicating location, borehole names, azimuth, and dip.  Core orientation is achieved with the  EzyMark  system.    Core  recovery  and  rock  quality  determination  were routinely collected.

## 10.3  Drilling Pattern and Density

The  plan  position  and  a  typical  section  showing  the  typical  drilling  pattern conducted at Hart are illustrated in Figure 15 and Figure 16.

Starfire  Minerals  and  Canadian  Arrow  Mines  drilled  eleven  surface  holes targeting  near  surface  mineralization.    The  maximum  depth  below  surface achieved was approximately eighty metres, although drilling typically targeted depths less than sixty metres below surface.  Drilling was conducted on a very tight pattern with one, two, or three drill holes per setup.  These two phases of diamond  drilling intersected what  has been  identified as the IF Zone, corresponding to Type IVa nickel mineralization (Lesher &amp; Keays, 2002).  The main zone was not intersected by this drilling.

Liberty drilled 104 core boreholes from surface. These holes were all drilled grid  north,  with  dips  angles  ranging  from  seventy-nine  to  forty-five  degrees. Two to three boreholes  were  typically  drilled  from  each  setup.  Drilling  was designed to achieve a drill spacing of between twenty to thirty metres for the upper part of the deposit (above 250 metres below surface), and forty-five to seventy  metres  below  250  metres.    The  varying  drill  spacing  was  to  ensure higher confidence in areas to be mined first, while also allowing an acceptable confidence  in  the  delineation  of  the  lower  zone  (Figure  16).    Intersection widths in the lower zone are also larger, contributing to a sparser drill density.

It is the opinion of SRK that the drilling strategy and pattern have produced an adequate drill density to support resource estimation.

## 11  Sampling Approach and Methodology

## 11.1  Introduction

Data reviewed as part of in this study and used for geological modelling and resource  estimation  represent  an  aggregated  data  collected  during  various phases of exploration drilling from 2005 to 2008.  Exploration field procedures implemented  by exploration staff for the 2005 drilling is unavailable. However, the historical portion of the total data set is relatively minor (only five drill holes) and does not have a material impact on the reported mineral resources.

SRK  was  able  to  review  core  handling,  logging  or  sampling  procedures implemented by Liberty. All drill core is transported to the secure Redstone core  yard,  near  the  main  office,  where  it  is  logged.  Core  is  marked  for sampling and mechanically split lengthwise for assaying. Half of the split core is submitted for sample preparation and analyses (and sometimes for specific gravity), whereas the other half remains stored in the original core boxes. Drill core logging and sampling information are recorded into DH logger (Century Systems) format, with adequate detail on lithology and mineralization. Assay results  for  nickel  (percent),  copper  (percent),  gold  (gpt),  platinum  (gpt)  and palladium (gpt) are recorded adjacent to lithology descriptions. SRK notes that gold,  platinum  and  palladium  have  not  been  routinely  sampled.  An  extract from the drill log for H-08-99 from 527.1 metres to 569 metres is provided in Figure 17.

## 11.2  Sampling protocols

Summary statistics  for  sample  lengths  for  the  total  Liberty  drilling  sampled intervals within mineralized solids at Hart is shown in Table 5. It is noted that the mean sample length for the Liberty drilling sampling within the modelled mineralized  solids  is  0.96  metres.  During  2007  -2008,  Liberty  sampled  all mineralized  core  intercepts,  including  a  footwall  sample  below  the  massive sulphide  basal contact as well as continuous  sampling  over  all  visibly mineralized sulphides in the overlaying disseminated sulphide zone. Records of  sampling  protocols  for  2005  (and  prior  to  that)  sampling  programs  are unavailable. Only sample records from 2005 to 2008 were used for resource estimation.

A  histogram  illustrating the sampling  intervals  within  all the modelled mineralized solids at the Hart project is shown in Figure 18. It can be noted that about ninety percent of sample intervals are 1.0 metre in length or less.

## 12  Sample Preparation, Analysis and Security

## 12.1  Sample Preparation and Analyses

Information regarding the historical sample preparation, analyses and procedures  is  not  available  to  SRK.  However,  they  represent  a  very  small portion  of  the  total  assay  data  and  are  not  considered  to  have  a  significant impact  on  the  overall  database.  Summarized  information  regarding  Liberty sample preparation and analyses is documented here.

The primary laboratory used by Liberty for drill core analyses is the accredited ALS Chemex Laboratory. Samples submitted for assaying were prepared at the Timmins sample preparation facility and subsequent analyses were performed at  the  ALS  Chemex  North  Vancouver  laboratory.  Total  turn-around  time  is reported to be about four weeks.

ALS Chemex North Vancouver laboratory is accredited to ISO 9001 by QMI and ISO 17025 by the Standards Council of Canada for a number of specific test  procedures,  including  fire  assay  for  gold  with  atomic  absorption  and gravimetric finish, multi-element inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy  ('ICP-AES')  and  atomic  absorption  assays  for  silver,  copper, lead  and  zinc.  ALS  Chemex  laboratories  also  participate  in  a  number  of international  proficiency  tests,  such  as  those  managed  by  CANMET  and Geostats.  At  ALS  Chemex,  core  samples  were  prepared  using  industry standard preparation procedures.

After  reception,  samples  were  organized  into  batches  and  weighed  (method code LOG-22). Samples were then crushed to seventy percent passing below two  millimetre  mesh  screen  (CRU-31).  A  sub-sample  of  up  to  1,500  grams was  prepared  using  a  riffle  slipper  (SPL-21)  and  pulverized  to  eighty-five percent passing below seventy-five microns (PUL-31).

Generally analyses are conducted for only nickel and copper, with analyses for platinum,  palladium  and  gold  conducted  only  by  request.  The  assay  method used  for  base  metals  is  aqua  regia  digestion  followed  by  fusion  and  AAS (analytical  code  AA46).  Analyses  for  precious  metals  are  reported  from  an aqua  regia  leach  and  using  conventional  inductively  coupled  plasma  optical emission spectroscopy ('ICP-AES') analyses (analytical code ME-ICP41).

Analytical results are communicated by ALS Chemex to Liberty electronically with  data  directly  updated  to  the  Century  Systems  database.  Certificates  of Analyses  are  received  for  all  assay  data  and  visually  checked  against  the original digital data. The original pulps are stored for ninety days subsequent to the submission of the Certificates of Analyses, thereafter they are returned to site on request for storage.

## 12.2  Quality Assurance and Quality Control Program

Quality control measures are typically set in place to ensure the reliability and trustworthiness of exploration data. This includes written field procedures and independent verifications of aspects such as drilling, surveying, sampling and assaying, data management and database integrity. Appropriate documentation of quality control measures and analysis of quality control data are an integral component of  a  comprehensive  quality  assurance  program  and  an  important safeguard of project data.

Aspects  of  the  quality  control  measures  implemented  by  Liberty  have  been reviewed  by  SRK.  It  is  SRK's  opinion  that  recent  quality  control  measures implemented  and  documented  by  Liberty,  generally meet  industry best practices.  Analytical  quality  control  measures  typically  involve  internal  and external laboratory measures  implemented  to  monitor  the  precision  and accuracy  of  the  sampling,  preparation  and  assaying  process.  They  are  also important to prevent and monitor the voluntary or inadvertent contamination of samples. Assay  certificates and  Quality Assurance  and  Quality  Control Reports  from  ALS  Chemex  were  made  available  to  SRK,  who  noted  that internal and external laboratory control measures were in place.

In addition to the quality assurance measures taken by ALS Chemex, a series of external analytical quality control measures were implemented by Liberty. This includes the use of sample blanks and quality control samples inserted at approximately every ten to twenty samples (usually about two per batch).

Certified blank samples are used by Liberty. These blanks have recently also been verified by Liberty, by sending ten blank samples to the SGS Laboratory at Lakefield. Nickel and copper assay results for the 'blank' samples are shown in  Figure  19.    A  slight  variance  is  noted  in  a  limited  number  of  samples available.

Three  commercial  certified  reference  material  samples  (LBE-1,  LBE-2,  and LBE-3) were used by Liberty. Reference samples LBE-1 and 2 were produced from  Redstone  Mine  material,  whereas  LBE-3  was  produced  from  material from  the  Montcalm  Mine  near  Timmins.  Assay  results  for  the  certified reference  material  samples  are  summarized  in  Figure  20.  The  recommended values for the copper and nickel reference materials are as follows:

Ni %

## 12.3  Specific gravity database

Specific gravity measurements were collected during the Liberty core drilling program in 2007 and 2008. No reliable specific gravity data exist for the 2005 drilling program.

A total of 643 specific gravity determinations are available for the Hart project. Two hundred and thirty one determinations were made from within the nickelcopper sulphide mineralization considered for resource estimation.. All specific  gravity  measurements  were  made  by  ALS  Chemex  from  core  pulp samples,  using  a  pycnometer  (Method  Code  OA-GRA08b).  The  statistics  of this  dataset  is  summarized  in  Table  6.  This  table  differentiates  between  the three sulphide mineralization types (iron formation, massive and disseminated). The mean specific gravity for each type was used to estimate tonnages.

Table 6: Summary of specific gravity data available for the Hart project (by sulphide mineralization type)

A general positive relationship exists between specific gravity and nickel grade (Figure 21).

## 13  Data Verifications

## 13.1  Introduction

The  mineral  resource  model  presented  herein  was  prepared  by  SRK  from exploration data provided by Liberty and a geological interpretation provided by Mr. Will Randall, P. Geo, a former employee of Liberty. As required under National Instrument 43-101, and Form 43-101F1, SRK has verified the quality and reliability of the all data and geological interpretations provided by Liberty and considered for resource estimation.

After review by SRK, the geological model provided by Liberty was found to be reasonable and appropriate for resource estimation.

It is good practice for exploration staff to implement field procedures designed to  verify  the  collection  of  exploration  data  and  to  minimize  the  potential  for inadvertent data entry errors. SRK was unable to comment on the procedures adopted  prior  to  2007.  SRK  was  however  able  to  review  the  procedures adopted  by  Liberty  exploration  staff  since  2007,  during  which  most  of  the exploration data for the Hart project was collected (see Table 4).

## 13.2  Control Sampling Assay Protocols

Control  sampling  procedures  applied  by  Liberty  at  Hart  include  techniques such as the following:

- · Insertion  of  routine  blank  samples  to  check  for  possible  sample contamination during the preparation and assaying process;
- · Application of appropriate grade certified control samples (standards);
- · Replicate  analysis  on  a  second  split  of  the  pulverized  sample  at  the laboratory;
- · Duplicate analyses of selected samples;
- · Sieve tests to verify the grinding on the pulp required for assaying;
- · Validation  of  the  assay  results  in  the  database  compared  with  the original assay certificates;
- · The Century Systems database system  used by Liberty is  more  than just  a  database;  it  is  a  management  tool  that  combines  borehole logging  and  assay  data  in  a  way  that  integrates  seamlessly  with Datamine Studio. Century Systems has built-in data verification tools, generating data input error and quality control reports for management action.

## 13.3  SRK Independent Verifications

During the site visit, SRK was able to verify many of the surface drill collar positions and review most of the exploration protocols and procedures used by Liberty  exploration  staff.  SRK  found  that  these  protocols  and  procedures generally meet industry 'best practices'. In addition SRK inspected core from five  drill  holes  drilled  by  Liberty  in  2008.  Generally  logging  in  the  digital database compares well to what SRK observed in the drill core.

Assay  results were compared  to actual core intersections and a good correlation between sulphide mineralization and higher grades was observed.

SRK also collected seven core samples for independent verification analyses. Care  was  taken  to  replicate  sampled  intervals  for  various  types  of  sulphide mineralization  (low  and  high  grade  nickel  mineralization).  The  verification samples  were  specifically  collected  to  attest  to  the  existence  of  nickel  and copper mineralization on the Hart property.

The  SRK  samples  were  submitted  to  SGS  Laboratories  in  Toronto  for independent analyses using a 'near total' four acid digestion followed by ICPAES (analytical code ICP90Q). Liberty used and aqua regia digestion followed by  atomic  absorption  finish.  The  comparative  results  are  summarized  in Table 7 and graphically in Figure 22. SRK regard the variance in nickel and copper  grades  in  Table 7  to  be  acceptable  and  typical  for  deposits  of  this nature.

The  verification  study  showed  that  although  average  assays  are  similar,  for higher  nickel  grades  SGS  results  tend  to  be  higher,  whereas  at  lower  nickel grades  ALS  Chemex  yield  marginally  higher  results.  These  variations  are however not considered significant.

In  the  opinion  of  SRK,  the  analytical  results  delivered  by  ALS-Chemex  are sufficiently reliable for the purpose of resource estimation.

Table 7: Comparative analyses for SRK check assay verification.

## 14  Adjacent Properties

Liberty owns a large portion of the surrounding claims, including three of the four known deposits of the Shaw Dome.  Hart is located in the central portion of Langmuir Township (Figure 6).  The Redstone nickel deposit is located to the west in neighbouring Eldorado Twp and is the westernmost deposit known to  date.  The  Redstone  Mine  is  currently  in  production  and  is  equipped  with concentrating facilities on site.  Going eastward, located between McWatters and Redstone, is the Hart nickel deposit, which lies entirely within Liberty's claim package.  Langmuir #2, to the north, is shared with Inspiration Mining Corp, who owns part of the claims containing the mineralized zone.  Langmuir #1  is  the  fourth  deposit,  and  lies  within  a  claim  group  whose  mining  rights belong to Inspiration Mining Corp.

Liberty  owns  the  Redstone  deposit  that  contains  a  reported  Measured  and Indicated  mineral  resource  of  418,931  tonnes  at  an  average  grade  of  2.32 percent  nickel  (SRK,  2007).    This  resource  estimate  only  reflects  the  nickel mineralization  contained  to  a  depth  of  508  metres,  where  current  mining activities  are  taking  place.    The  neighbouring  Liberty-owned  McWatters deposit host an Indicated Mineral Resource of 714,870 tonnes at 0.94 percent nickel  and  an  Inferred  Mineral  Resource  of  13,829  tonnes  at  3.39  percent nickel (Liberty Mines Inc, 2008) McWatters is currently in the pre-production mining stages.  In addition to the known deposits in the area there are many other  prospects,  including  the  Galata  showing  and  the  mineralized  intervals delineated by Golden Chalice Resources on the Langmuir Property to the east of the Hart Deposit.

Both  Langmuir  #1  and  Langmuir  #2  are  past  producing  mines  with  total reported production of 111,502 tonnes with an average grade of 1.74 percent nickel,  and  1,133,750  tonnes  with  an  average  grade  of  1.50  percent  nickel respectively (undated Ministry of Northern Development and Mines Resident Geologist Report ).

All nickel deposits of the Shaw Dome are hosted by ultramafic rocks, which have  generally  been  interpreted as extrusive komatiitic flows, with  the exception of McWatters.  The latter deposit may be hosted by an ultramafic dyke that cross-cuts an iron formation.

## 15  Mineral Processing, Mineralogy and Mineral Testing

It  is  envisioned  by  Liberty  that  the  sulphide  mineralization  from  the  Hart property could be processed at the Redstone Mill, located at the Redstone mine site approximately twenty-five kilometres southeast of Timmins, Ontario. This modern nickel concentrator was commissioned in July 2007 with a designed capacity  of  2,000  tonnes  per  day  of  nickel  sulphide  ore  with  a  high  MgO content.

Liberty has initiated test work  (open  cycle  test at different grades  on representative  core  samples)  on  Hart  sulphide  mineralization  to  assess  the compatibility  of  the  sulphide  mineralization  with  the  Redstone  mill  process. The test work, which was done internally, as well as completed mineralogical petrographic reports, is under review by an independent qualified person. At the time this report has been prepared, results of this review had not yet been received.

## 16  Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve Estimates

## 16.1  Introduction

The Hart nickel deposit has an historical resource of 770,000 tonnes grading 0.9  percent  nickel  (Ministry  of  Northern  Development  and  Mines  Resident Geologist  Report,  1999).The  details  of  how  this  historical  resource  estimate was  derived  are  uncertain.  This  historical  mineral  resource  estimate  was prepared prior to the adoption of NI43-101 and should not be relied upon.

SRK prepared a mineral resource estimate for the Hart project in accordance with  NI  43-101  guidelines  in  June  2008..  There  has  been  no  additional resource data generated since that estimate. This section describes the resource estimation process followed by SRK in June 2008.

This section summarizes the data, methodology and parameters used by SRK to  estimate  the  mineral  resources  for  the  Hart  deposit.  The  mineral  resource estimates  considers  all  Canadian  Arrow  and  Liberty  drilling  data  acquired during the period 2005 to 2008. The limited drilling data collected prior to this period was not considered.

All resource estimation work was completed by Glen Cole, P.Geo from data received from William Randall, P.Geo from Liberty. The resource estimation and accompanying  technical report was reviewed by Dr Jean-Francois Couture, P.Geo of SRK.

The  mineral  resources  presented  herein  are  reported  in  accordance  with  the Canadian  Securities  Administrators'  National  Instrument  43-101  and  have been  estimated  in  conformity  with  generally  accepted  CIM  'Estimation  of Mineral  Resource  and  Mineral  Reserves  Best  Practices'  guidelines.  Mineral resources  are  not  mineral  reserves  and  do  not  have  demonstrated  economic viability. There is no guarantee that all or any part of the mineral resource will be converted into mineral reserve.

Datamine  Studio  Version  3  was  used  to  construct  the  geological  solids. Datamine Studio Version 2.1 was used to build composites, the block model, to run the grade interpolation and to estimate and tabulate mineral resources. Isatis Version 5.1.7 was used to undertake geostatistical analyses of the dataset and to generate variograms for nickel and copper.

## 16.2  Database validation

Data used for resource estimation were validated as discussed in Section 13. The database records provided to SRK by Liberty were audited against digital log sheets, sections and plans. Database records reflect original data. Lithology codes applied are the standardized codes used by Liberty exploration staff on all  Liberty Projects in the Shaw Dome being based on reasonable geological criteria  suitable  for  the  local  variances  within  this  type  of  deposit.  These lithology codes facilitated the geological modelling process.

The Excel and Datamine format database provided to SRK was checked for any  missing  data,  overlapping  intervals  and  for  duplicated  data  inputs.  The assay database comprises of two data types viz. drill data as well as limited surface trench data.

## 16.3  Resource Estimation

## 16.3.1 Database

The  database  used  for  resource  estimation  includes  exploration  drilling  data collected during three exploration programs conducted during the period 2005 to  2008.  The  Liberty  drilling  database  is  summarized  in  Table  4.  The  total database comprises 3,209 sample records from 115 drill holes and five surface trenches.

The Hart  borehole  database  contains  validated  information  about  drill  collar location,  assay  results  for  nickel  and  copper,  lithology  and  surveying  for  all Liberty  and  Canadian  Arrow  drill  holes.  Additional  information  available  in the database includes structural, rock quality determination, core recovery and specific gravity data. SRK is of the opinion however that the Hart dataset is adequate in detail, size and quality for resource modelling and grade estimation for this style of sulphide mineralization.

## 16.4  Solid Body Modelling

Nickel  (and  copper)  grades  are  spatially  related  to  three  kinds  of  sulphide mineralization.  The  highest  and  most  continuous  nickel  mineralization  is associated with the basal massive sulphide mineralization horizon. Disseminated sulphides overlay the massive sulphide  mineralization forming discontinuous  bodies  with  highly  variable  nickel  grades.  Locally,  nickel sulphide also occurs in an iron formation..

Resource estimation was constrained to three 3D wireframes interpreted from the drilling data:

Iron formation hosted mineralization;

Massive sulphide  mineralization,  subdivided  into  'upper'  and  a  'lower'  subdomains;

Disseminated  sulphide  mineralization,  generated  using  a  0.3  percent  nickel threshold. Also divided into 'upper' and a 'lower' sub-domains.

The  distinction  between  'upper'  and  'lower'  sub-domains  is  defined  by  an inferred structural break in the sulphide mineralization at an average depth of between 200 to 230 metres below surface. A simplified section and an oblique view illustrating all the relevant wireframes constructed to constrain resource estimation are shown in Figure 24 and Figure 25.

Figure 24: Simplified vertical section (looking east) of the Hart modelled solids (mineralization solids in red)

<!-- image -->

A topographic surface has been modelled from surveyed data by Liberty. Drill collars fit well to this topography surface. A bedrock surface, which is usually less  than  five  metres  below  surface,  has  also  been  modelled.  All  resource wireframes were cut against the bedrock surface.

A felsic intrusion cross cuts the modelled ore domains and has been modelled from  drillhole  data.      The  volume  of  this  intrusion  was  removed  from  the resource volumes.

It is recognized that this geological model is a simplification of the reality at Hart. The model should be seen as a starting point upon which to attach more detail as this becomes available. It is particularly important that the structural geology aspects be investigated during future drilling programs to improve the understanding of the geometry of the sulphide mineralization.

Figure 25: Oblique view of the modelled mineralization solids at Hart in relation to informing drillhole data (looking northeast)

<!-- image -->

No  weathered surfaces have been modelled, as all drilled material is considered fresh by all available logging detail and by site inspection of the Liberty core by SRK.

## 16.5  Compositing

Composite files  were  created  using  uncapped  values  starting  at  the  drillhole collar position and defined within each sulphide mineralization type.

An  optimum  composite  length  of  one  metre  was  chosen  for  the  input  data within  the  modelled  mineralized  solids.  Composites  were  extracted  to  a workspace  for  statistical  analyses  and  grade  interpolation.  The  core  sample interval lengths are summarized in Figure 26. A value of zero was assigned to unsampled  intervals.  The  mean  sample  length  is  0.96  metre  (mode  =  one metre) with a maximum of eleven metres.

Figure 26: Histogram of all sampled intervals within all mineralized solids

<!-- image -->

After  excluding  all  data  within  modelled  dykes,  composited  datasets  were generated  for  the  modelled  sulphide  sub-domains.  There  are  seventy-seven composites in the iron formation sub-domain, 109 in the Upper Massive, 163 in the Lower Massive sub-domain and 251 and 297 composites in the Upper and Lower Disseminated sub-domains, respectively.

## 16.6  Statistics

Basic  statistics  for  nickel  and  copper  composites  within  the  sulphide  subdomains are presented in Table 8. This table compares composited metal grades with the original assay data and capped composite. The statistical signature of each of the three sub-domains is substantially different, justifying the decision to separate each sub-domain for geostatistical analyses.

Table 8: Descriptive Statistics (original, composited and capped) for composited Ni% and Cu% data from the five modelled geostatistical domains

Nickel and copper data are highly skewed with a dominance of lower values, within  the  disseminated  sulphide  and  ironstone  hosted  domains.  A  more uniform  grade  distribution  occurs  in  the  massive  sulphide  domains.  Copper values are however uniformly low in all mineralized domains.

## 16.7  Grade Capping

Based on careful examination of the combined composited nickel and copper datasets  for  all  data  within  the  all  the  modelled  mineralized  zones  and  by consideration of the respective probability plots (Figure 27), nickel and copper composites were capped at 4.86 and 0.33 percent, respectively. Capping only impacts the lower and upper massive sulphide sub-domains

## 16.8  Variography

Isatis software version 5.1.7 was used to generate all variograms. Traditional experimental variograms were modelled from the capped composited datasets for the  various  mineralization  domains  (two  massive  sulphides  and  two disseminated sulphides and one iron formation domain) for nickel and copper for all three principle directions.

A total  of  thirty  variograms  were  then  fitted,  yielding  the  directional  ranges listed in Table 9. Based on the highly irregular variograms obtained from the Hart dataset, it was decided not to use kriging as a grade estimation technique, but rather to use an inverse distance square algorithm.

A  single spherical structure variogram  (including a nugget  effect) was constructed and fitted for each direction (strike = N090, dip direction = N180 and normal to the reference plane) and inputted into the Datamine for grade estimation. These directions coincide with local modelled geological orientations,  yielding  optimal  variograms.  Slightly  different  search  ellipses (ranges)  were  used  for  nickel  and  copper  in  the  disseminated  sulphide  subdomains to reflect their different geological imprints compared to the massive sulphide sub-domains. Variograms for all sub-domains were modelled with the reference  plane  inclined  at  negative  sixty  degrees  in  the  dip  direction  to conform to geological modelling.

## 16.9  Block Model and Grade Estimation

Criteria  used  in  the  selection  of  block  size  includes  the  borehole  spacing, composite assay length, a consideration of potential mining unit sizes as well as the geometry of the modelled mineralized zones. The block size was set at 2.5 metres by 2.5 metres by 2.5 metres in the easting, northing and elevation directions respectively. The parameters of the Datamine block model constructed by SRK are presented in Table 10.

A  three  split  Datamine  sub-block  routine  was  applied  during  block  model construction  (with  a  minimum  block  size  of  0.31  by  0.31  by  0.31  metre)  to ensure that the modelled mineralized zones are adequately filled.

Block grade estimation was completed in a single pass using the search ellipse ranges defined by variography as outlined in the previous section. In addition, the  minimum  and  maximum  numbers  of  samples  used  for  grade  estimation were set at two and twenty respectively.

The block  models  were  coded  to  differentiate  between  resource  classes  (see Section 16.5 below). Specific gravity values appropriate to the mineralization code were added to the model (as per Section 12.3). The block models were cut to only include modelled ore below the bedrock surface and the volumes occupied by felsic intrusions were excluded from tonnage estimation

## 16.10  Model Validation

Global and local grade estimates were checked for appropriateness. Original nickel  and  copper  drilled  grades  were  compared  with  block  grades  on  a section-by-section  basis.  Grade  estimation  by  inverse  distance  squared  was found to appropriately reflect general grade trends and appropriately correspond to proximal borehole grades. Other verification checks were also conducted to validate the integrity of the block model (including QQ plots and statistical reconciliations with the informing composited dataset).

## 16.11  Mineral Resource Classification

Mineral resources have been estimated in conformity with generally accepted CIM 'Estimation of Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserves Best Practices'

Guidelines.  Mineral  resources  are  not  mineral  reserves  and  do  not  have demonstrated economic viability.

SRK  is  not  aware  of  any  known  environmental,  permitting,  legal,  title, taxation, socio-economic, marketing or other relevant issues that could potentially affect this estimate of mineral resources. Mineral reserves can only be  estimated  based  on  the  results  of  an  economic  evaluation  as  part  of  a preliminary feasibility study or a feasibility study. As such no mineral reserves have  been  estimated  by  SRK  as  part  of  the  present  assignment.  There  is  no certainty  that  all  or  any  part  of  the  mineral  resource  will  be  converted  into mineral reserve.

Mineral resources for  the  Hart  deposit  have  been  classified  according  to  the 'CIM  Standards on Mineral Resources and Reserves: Definitions and Guidelines' (December, 2005) by Glen Cole, P. Geo an appropriate independent Qualified Person as defined by NI43-101.

Mineral resource classification is based on variography and on the confidence of  geological  interpretation  and  modelling.  Both  are  directly  related  to  the current drill spacing.

An Indicated  Mineral  Resource  classification  was  assigned  to  blocks  within the primary variography distance from sample points (as per Table 9).

An  Inferred  Mineral  Resource  classification  was  assigned  to  blocks  within twice the primary variography range from informing data.

## 16.12  Mineral Resource Statement

The Mineral Resources for the Hart nickel deposit are reported at a single cutoff of 0.46 percent nickel, that is considered by SRK and Liberty management to be achievable by a future underground mine, considering the nature of the nickel  mineralization,  its  geometry  and  the  projected  underground  extraction scenario.. This cut-off is primarily based on current mining experience at the comparable Redstone Mine.

The  Mineral  Resources  statement  for  the  Hart  nickel  project  is  presented  in Table 11. The numbers have been rounded to reflect the relative accuracy of the  estimates.  Tonnage  and  metal  grades  are  sensitive  to  the  cut-off  grade. Grade tonnage curves are presented in Figure 28. Other sensitivity tables are presented in Appendix C.

## 17  Additional Requirements for Technical Reports on Development Properties and Production Properties

## 17.1  Mine Development History and Current Status

## 17.1.1 Terms of Reference

Liberty  Mines  retained  SRK  Consulting  (Canada)  Inc.  (SRK)  to  provide  a Scoping  Study  for  the  Hart  deposit.    SRK  utilized  the  January  1,  2010 geological model as a basis for scoping study mine design.

## 17.1.2 Hart Property Current Status

Other  than  exploration  activity  as  discussed  in  Section  9  of  this  report,  no clearing or mining work has been commenced  at the Hart Property. Application  for  a  mining  lease  has  been  submitted  and  permitting  is  in progress.

## 17.2  Mine Geotechnical

Geotechnical  assumptions  have  been  made  based  on  expectations  of  similar characteristics  evidenced  at  McWatters  and  Redstone  nickel  mines  situated within 3 and 6 kilometres either side of the Hart property.

Mineralization RQD of 50 and UCS of 70 MPa have been assumed with host material characteristics slightly higher at 55 and 80 respectively.  Weakening structures  including  faults  have  been  considered  as  potentially  integral  to underground development and/or stope production scenarios.

## 17.3  Planned Mining Methods and Layout

## 17.3.1 Mining Context

The Hart deposit averages 1.38 percent nickel over 1.87 million tonnes (Table 11)  and  will  benefit  from  a  selective  low  cost  mining  method.    The  tabular deposit strikes SSE at an average dip angle of seventy-five degrees to a depth of 570 metres below surface

The deposit has a 220 metre strike length and average thickness ranging from 3 metres  near  surface  to  11  metres  at  depth.      The  deposit  has  an  average  of 3,000 tonnes per vertical metre.

From diamond drill information it appears that the footwall contacts are sharp with  massive  ore  against  volcanic  rock  while  the  hangingwall  is  gradational with a transition into a low grade disseminated sulphide zone.

On  surface, the deposit area is characterized by poorly drained with overburden ranging from zero to 11 metres thickness.

A conventional owner-operated, ramp accessed, underground mine is proposed.    After consideration of several mining methods, (including open pit,  cut  &amp;  fill  and  longhole  retreat)  Alimak  mining  was  selected  as  the  most appropriate method.

## 17.3.2 Selected Mining Method

The mining method selected for use at the Hart property was selected based primarily  on  the  geometry  of  mineralization,  nickel  grade  and  geotechnical characteristics.

Initial  methods  considered  included  open  pit  near  surface,  cut  &amp;  fill  and longhole methods with and without backfill.   Open pit mining was considered because  the  resource  comes  very  close  to  surface  but  this  option  was discounted because of the high stripping ratio required.

Cut &amp; Fill was discounted even though this method provided high selectivity. Conceptual  work  showed  excessive  development  requirements  and  poor productivities from higher elevation stopes would present a lower cash flow. Further, actual shrinkage work at Hart's sister mine Redstone, indicated that a non-entry mining method was desirable to improve safety considerations.

Vertical longhole methods were discounted since they were not as selective, created  larger  dilution  issues  and  required  an  increase  in  the  mine  lateral development cost due to the 30 metre  limit on drilling sublevel spacing.

Alimak raise mining over 100 metre level intervals was identified as the best method  to  provide  the  Hart  property  with  optimum  productivity,  safety  and economics.

The addition of pastefill in primary stopes allowed for complete extraction of mineral and improved Net Present Values (NPV).

## 17.3.3 Alimak Raise Mining Description

Raise mining is a "longhole" method of bulk mining tabular and narrow vein deposits. The main mining access is gained by driving a raise up dip along the centre of the stope hangingwall. The production drill holes are oriented along strike tipped slightly down from horizontal.

The advantages of this mining method include:

Less  Development  -  The  bulk  of  the  waste  development  required  is  the  ore zone access and the raise climber nests. A ramp is not required and, in many cases,  neither  is  the  muck  pass  and  ventilation  raise  of  a  regular  stoping system.  The change in geometry and improvement in ground support allows stope heights in the order of 75 to 150 metres.

AM - PB- GC  - kr - ab

The  sub-horizontal  production  drillhole direction allows the use of the undercut as a slot into which the ore can initially expand.

Faster  Access  to  Undeveloped  Mining  zones  -  Once  the  climber  nests  are established, raises are driven in the vein immediately contributing to production.

Better  Ground  Control  -  Cables  can  be  installed  in  the  raise  hangingwall, where they will do the most good. The stopes can also be mined in a shrinkage fashion, with host wall rock supported by the broken ore.

Less Dilution - The production drill sits in the middle of its work, cutting the drilled length in half. This improves drill accuracy which, in conjunction with the better ground control, reduces dilution.

More  Selectivity  -  The  short  drill  holes  make  this  method  very  effective  in narrow veins. The geology is exposed down the entire dip length of the stope on  both  sides  of  the  raise.  The  vein  contacts  can  be  both  extrapolated  from across  the  raise  and  interpolated  between  raises.  Stopes  can  be  as  little  as  1 metre thick.

Faster  Overall  Extraction  -  After  development  and  production  drilling  are concluded  production  of  broken  material  is  rapid  since  the  cycle  simply involves load, blast and muck.   Added advantages include fewer drill setups, surveys, fill fences, and backfill arrangements.

## 17.3.4 Alimak Raise Mining Methodology

(See references - Manrock)

The  raise  climber  mining  method  ( Error!  Reference  source  not  found. )  is comprised of the following:

Lateral Development

Bottom  Sill:  Access  and  haulage  drifts  are  driven  from  the  ramp  on  the hanging or footwall of the mining zone. The drifts are sized to accommodate the LHD's or trucks as may be required.

Drawpoints  and  climber  nests  are  always  in  the  hangingwall.  The  climbers require nests about 3 metres in width, 2.7 metres in height and 12 metres in length. The nest will be slashed out of the drawpoint backs if development is from the hangingwall side.

Top  Sill  Access:  These  drifts  are  also  driven  from  the  ramp  or  existing development  but,  unless  there  is  another  lift,  they  often  need  only  be  large enough for the movement of supplies.

## Raises

Raise Development: Raises must be driven big enough that a 2.4 metre drill can be rotated within the raise, or about 2.7 x 2.7 metres horizontally.

Raise  Rehabilitation:  After  the  raise  is  driven  it  often  must  be  rehabilitated, subject to ground conditions, for the safety of production crews.

Hangingwall  Support:  Hart  ground  is  considered  to  require  that  the  stope hangingwall be supported with resin-grouted cable bolts only in the raise. This

is very cost effective as the raise is centred in the stope, which concentrates the support where it is needed most.

<!-- image -->

## Production

Drilling:  Drill  holes  extend  13  metres  to  just  less  than  half  way  to  the  next raise and are oriented slightly down from horizontal. The down dip helps the toes break to the stope wall. Hole diameter at Hart has been specified as 50mm to avoid hangingwall / footwall damage in narrow veins.

Loading &amp; Blasting: The holes are most often mechanically loaded with either ANFO or an emulsion explosive. The blasts are timed to slash down, with the footwall holes often the last to fire. It is safest to take a few rings per blast, so that miss-holes or other blasting problems are accessible for correction.

Mucking  Swell:  Some  blasted  material  is  left  in  the  stope  while  blasting  to provide confinement. The broken rock often compacts slightly, resulting in an effective swell of about one third its unbroken volume.

Final  Mucking:  Once  the  stope  is  completely  blasted  the  stope  is  mucked empty.

## Backfill

A  fill  fence  is  established  at  the  bottom  drawpoint.      Pastefill  distribution piping is extended into the top sill access.   Pastefill is poured into the stope until  the  bottom  drawpoint  behind  the  barricade  is  flooded  and  a  plug  is formed.   Once the pastefill plug has formed (1 to 3 days) the remainder of the stope  is  filled  with  paste.      Mining  can  commence  in  adjacent  stopes  once sufficient  cure  is  achieved  in  the  paste  (7  to  28  days).      Multiple  mining activities can occur on the same level simultaneously.

## 17.3.5 Plant Feed and Waste Handling

Once the surface portal is completed a -18% decline (ramp) will be developed down to the lowest level of the mine.    The 4 x 4 metre ramp will be located in the hangingwall of the deposit to facilitate the Alimak mining technique.    For the first  150 metres of development the 5.3 m3 (6yd3) LHD's will transport the waste directly to surface storage.   Thereafter remucks will be established at 150 metre intervals so development faces can be cleared to the remucks by LHD's in a maximum of 3.5 hours.

As the ramp advances at 150 metre intervals contractors will install monorail track  and  electrics  on  the  ramp  back  so  that  the  monorail  can  be  used  for broken rock removal (Figure 31).

Figure 31: Typical Section in Ramp Showing Monorail Supported From back

<!-- image -->

During development broken rock from remuck bays will be loaded by 3.1 m3 LHD  (4yd3)  into  8.3  tonne  monorail  cars.      The  operators  of  the  electric monorail train will self load his train as shown in Figure 32.    Operators will have a wireless remote that allows them to position the train as required for loading.

Figure 32: Train Loading Sequence

<!-- image -->

Figure 33: Toggle Loadout above COB and Truck Load-In

<!-- image -->

The broken rock will then be trammed to surface and toggle dumped into a coarse rock bin  as shown in Figure 33.

Highway  haulage  trucks  will  load  from  the  overhead  bin  and  transport  the material to respective storage or processing areas.   The distance from Hart to the Redstone mill is 6 kilometres by road.    Waste storage is conceived to be within 500 metres of the Hart portal.

Once in production blasted material will be pulled from drawpoints by LHD's, and  trammed  a  maximum  of  150  metres  to  the  level  remucks  for  monorail loading and transport.   A monorail train and operator arriving at the remuck will load 25 tonnes into the train using the 3.1 m3 LHD (4yd3).   Relocation of

AM - PB- GC  - kr - ab

the train will be done by the operator without having to leave the LHD.   A wireless control allows the operator to raise and lower cars as well as relocate the train within the confines of the loading station.

Loading  arrangements  can  be  seen  in  the  typical  level  drawings  shown  in section 17.5.3 Stope Access.

Underground crushing is not a requirement as Alimak mining will provide fine fragmentation suitable for material handling concerns.

All  of  the  development  waste  rock  will  be  trucked  to  surface  for  permanent storage at the planned waste storage area.

Life of mine ('LoM') planned development and production quantities are:

- · 360 kt of development waste rock;
- · 1,729 kt of plant feed mineralization including development sources.

## 17.4  Estimate of Potentially Mineable Tonnes

Cautionary  Note:  This  Preliminary  Assessment  is  preliminary  in  nature.    It includes inferred mineral resources that are considered too speculative geologically to have the economic considerations applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves, and there is no certainty that the preliminary assessment will be realized.

## 17.4.1 Methodology

The following methodology was used for estimating Harts potentially mineable tonnage:

- · SRK's resource block model was updated;
- · An NSR model was created based on terms provided by Liberty that are based on an existing nickel concentrate sales agreement;
- · Site operating costs were estimated;
- · Cut off grades were calculated for the selected mining method;
- · Using  the  resource  block  model  and  the  cut  off  grades,  underground mineable shapes were created in 3D;
- · The  resource  block  model  was  used  to  tabulate  the  in-situ  tonnes  and nickel grades for each mining shape (stope);
- · Using an Excel spreadsheet, factors were applied for dilution and mining recovery,  and  stope  results  were  assessed  in  terms  of  nickel  grade  and dilution amounts;
- · This process was conducted iteratively as required, to optimize the planned stopes;
- · A 3D model of the Hart deposit was created showing underground ramp access  to  all  planned  mining  areas.    Life-of-mine  ('LoM')  development requirements were tabulated;

- · A  LoM  development  and  production  schedule  was  generated  for  the potentially minable tonnage. An economic exercise was performed on the entire  schedule.  The  material  in  the  LoM  schedule  is  based  on  resource classifications of indicated and inferred.

Figure 34 demonstrates the methodology and decision path taken to estimate the Hart potentially mineable tonnage.

## 17.4.2 Net Smelter Return

SRK prepared an NSR model using terms supplied by Liberty which are based on  a  current  nickel  concentrate  sales  agreement  with  Xstrata  Nickel.    Other inputs  to  the  NSR  model  included  process  metallurgical  recovery,  a  nickel price of US$15,430 per tonne (US$7.00 per pound), and a currency exchange rate of $1.00 Cdn = $0.90 US.   Table 12 shows the key input parameters to the NSR calculation.

## 17.4.3 Cut Off Grade

Mine operating costs were estimated from first principals based on actual unit costs for labour and consumables provided by Liberty.  Also, a budget quote was  obtained  from  a  mine  contractor  to  support  and  verify  costing  for  the Alimak mining method.

These costs  were  applied  along  with  first  principal  mining  development  and stoping performance calculations to estimate the unit mining costs.  Estimated and  actual  unit  costs  for  processing,  surface  truck  haulage  and  general  and administration,  based  on  Liberty's  ongoing  area  operations,  were  added  to obtain the estimated site cost.

The NSR model was then used to calculate in-situ nickel grade cut-off values to  be  used  in  delineation  of  the  mining  shapes.    Table  13  shows  the  cut  off grade calculation.

## 17.4.4 Practical Mining Shapes (Stope Design)

Stope outlines targeting above cut off resources were designed using AMINE software.    The  outlines  were  based  on  practical  mining  shapes  and  thus incorporated  limited  amounts  of  internal  dilution.    Planned  dilution  material nickel grade was estimated directly from the block resource model as part of the mining shape volume.

The in-situ resources in the mining shapes were selected using a cut-off grade of 0.46% Ni for Alimak mining.

A minimum mining width of 1.5 metres was observed for the Alimak stopes designs.      Smaller  widths  approached  an  economic  limit  and  were  not considered further at this time.

The  in-situ  tonnes  and  grades  inside  the  mining  shapes  were  tabulated  and factors  accounting  for  estimated  mining  losses  and  external  dilution  were applied.

This  design  process  was  conducted  iteratively  as  required,  to  optimize  the planned stopes.

## 17.4.5 Estimated External Dilution

External  dilution  estimates  included  wall  dilution  and  backfill  dilution.  The dilution applied was determined from the engineered stope mine designs and estimated according to stope width and mining method.

Wall  dilution  material  nickel  grade  was  estimated  by  the  mining  engineer, using the engineered stope mine designs.  The nickel grade applied to the wall dilution  tonnage  ranges  from  zero  to  0.30%  Ni  based  on  the  mining  method and gradational nature of the Ni mineralization at the deposit boundary.

Wall dilution is the waste that falls off the walls of the stope outside the stope mining line and is removed in the course of mining. Wall dilution will vary from mining level to mining level and is directly related to wall rock stability, mining method used, ground support and wall opening exposure. Wall dilution at Hart was determined by mining method and wall exposure.

Backfill dilution is the backfill material which spalls or fails from the primary stopes into the secondary stopes.   To minimise the effect of wall dilution and increase confidence of geotechnical stability, pastefill has been selected as the fill  of  choice  and  zero  backfill  dilution  has  been  assessed  for  the  purpose  of this study.

Table 14 shows the total estimated dilution in the Hart Alimak raise mine plan:

## Table 14: Dilution

12.08%

4.72%

Fill Dilution

Total Dilution

16.80%

## 17.4.6 Stope Mining Losses

A mining loss factor for each stope was based on the planned mining method and extraction method.

Mining losses vary depending on the mining method used and are based on historical  mine  site  data  or  in-house  estimates.    Factors  that  affect  mining losses are blasting techniques and any blast failures, oversized material, LHD mucking procedures, mining equipment selectivity and excessive dilution.

## 17.4.7 Economic Parameters

Mining  and  other  site  costs  were  assigned  to  each  planned  mining  shape  to check the economics.  These costs are shown below in Table 15.

Cautionary  Note:  This  Preliminary  Assessment  is  preliminary  in  nature.    It includes inferred mineral resources that are considered too speculative geologically to have the economic considerations applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves, and there is no certainty that the preliminary assessment will be realized.

The independent potentially mineable resource estimate, prepared by SRK, is reported  in  accordance  with  Canadian  Securities  Administrator's  National Instrument  43-101  and  conforms  to  generally  accepted  Canadian  Institute  of Mining ('CIM') 'Estimation of Mineable Resources guidelines.

The potential mineable tonnage estimate was prepared by Mr. Philip Bridson, P.  Eng.,  Sr.  Associate  Mining  Engineer,  SRK  Consulting  (Canada)  Inc.  By

virtue  of  his  background  and  professional  experience,  Mr.  Bridson  is  an independent 'Qualified Person' as defined by National Instrument 43-101.

The  in-situ  mineral  resources  included  into  the  potential  mineable  tonnage estimate  are  based  on  a  cut-off  grade  of  0.46%  Ni  for  the  Alimak  mining method.    A  Ni  price  of  US$15,430  per  tonne  (US$7.00  per  pound)  and  an exchange  rate  of  $1.00  Cdn  =  $0.90  US  were  used  in  the  cut-off  grade calculation.

Details of the potentially mineable tonnage are shown in Table 17.

Of the total estimated tonnage, 77% is based on indicated resources and 23% is based on inferred resources.

## 17.4.9 Production Rate

Hart's  average  production  rate  of  1,500  tpd  varies  over  the  Life  of  Mine ('LoM') depending on stope production and backfill cycles. (Table 18)

The Alimak mining will ramp up from an average of 800 tonnes per day (tpd) in the first half of 2011 to an annual rate of 1,650 tpd by the second half of 2012.  Production is shown as peaking in the first half of 2014 at 1,900 tpd but expectations are that this peak will be smoothed by pushing some production into late 2014 when mining production is complete.

Total production is scheduled for 1,729,100 tonnes at 1.29% Ni.

## 17.5  Underground Mine Model

The Hart deposit mining model is shown in Figure 35.  The model was created using AMINE  software. The figure shows ramp development in the hangingwall  of  the  deposit  with  remucks  every  150  metres.      Levels  are separated by a nominal 100 meters and connected by ventilation raises.

Figure 35: 3D View of Resource and Development Plan

<!-- image -->

## 17.5.1 General Description

The  resource  is  tabular  from  surface  to  570  m  Level  and  is  inclined  at  75 degrees, with a nominal strike length of about 220 metres.   Resource thickness ranges from an average of 3 metres at 40m Level then thickening to an average of 11 meters at 570m Level.

SRK's conceptual mine design includes seven levels for the mine namely 40m, 90m, 190m, 290m, 390m, 490m, and 570m Levels.   Level names imply the vertical depth below surface, and mine plans are shown in a local mining grid not UTM.

A  crown  pillar  will  be  left  between  surface  and  40m  Level  as  the  resource appears to thin out quickly and disappear before reaching surface.

All  levels  have  been  designed  as  4m  x  3m  excavations  with  drawpoints modeled at 3m x 3m to facilitate mucking by LHDs.

## 17.5.2 Mine Access

The mine will be accessed via a surface portal (4m x 4m) leading to a -18% decline positioned in the hangingwall of the orebody.   (Figure 31) The decline flattens to 5% every 150 metres to facilitate remucks and flattens to 5% again whenever level accesses are required.

All decline development  is planned at 4m  x  4m  to  allow access by conventional development and production equipment.   Monorail transport will be used in the ramp and entrances to levels to facilitate the movement of men material and blasted rock.   A cross section of the ramp shows the monorail supported from the back.    The monorail is proven and capable of tramming in declines as steep at 24% at a velocity of 1.5 metres per second and in the case of Hart mine a velocity of 2.0 m/s in the -18% decline when going up and 3.5 m/s when coming down.

The  total  planned  length  for  the  ramp  is  4,425  meters.    From  a  surface elevation of 0 meters the ramp provides continuous access down to the lowest mining level at an elevation of 570 meters.

Figure 36: Typical Ramp Cross Section showing Tramming Monorail

The mine's second exit will be through the 3m x 3m fresh air raise ('FAR'). The FAR/Escape Raise will be equipped from 570m Level through to surface with a timber manway installed by a contractor.

## 17.5.3 Stoping Access

Alimak stopes will be accessed via 3m x 3m x-cuts at the base of each stoping panel.   These x-cuts will each have Alimak nests recessed into the backs to allow unimpeded development of the raises while LHD's muck any swell from beneath the raises.   These x-cuts will be driven off of the hangingwall access levels (4m x 3m) each of which contains:

Sumps

Lunchroom/Refuge stations;

Explosive and cap magazines;

Remucks;

Level Storages;

Electrical X-cuts;

Ventilation FAR access and secondary escape ways;

Portable fuel stations and;

Latrines.

Level plans for Hart mine are shown in Figure 38 through Figure 44.

## 17.5.4 Ventilation Raises

Conventional  Alimak  techniques  will  be  used  to  drive  Fresh  Air  Raises ('FAR')  between  levels  starting  with  a  connection  from  40m  Level  and surface.   This particular leg of the ventilation raise will need a grouted collar prepared on surface to receive the FAR.   Contractors have been included in the cost to drive each raise and outfit each with a manway as a second egress from the mine.

FAR excavation dimensions have been planned at 3m x 3m to facilitate 98.6 m3/sec (209,000 cfm) of air into the mine (Table 19).

Three  250  Hp  fans  will  be  required  to  provide  the  basic  air  reticulation portrayed in the above figure.   The first of the 250 Hp fans will be mounted on surface  forcing  air  from  a  heating  plenum  underground  via  the  near  vertical FAR  system.      Two  of  the  250  Hp  fans  will  be  installed  in  bulkheads  on mucking levels to provide series air flow.   Fifteen smaller fans ranging in size from  10  Hp  to  50  Hp  and  flexible  steel  tubing  have  been  considered  in  the design  to  provide  alternate  air  flows  to  development  faces  or  working  areas otherwise not in the direct path of the fresh air.

Ventilation x-cuts have been planned on each level to receive and redirect air either down to the next level or through a bulkhead to the working level.

Bulkheads  and  ventilation  doors  have  been  included  in  the  design  so  that operators can control and/or regulate air as required.

The surface ventilation raise collar and raises have been offset a safe distance from the influence of any mining.

## 17.5.5 Life of Mine Development Requirements

Life  of  mine  development  requirements  are  detailed  below  in  Table  20. Development dimensions are planned at 4m x 4m for the main decline and 4m x  3m  for  working  levels.      Drawpoints  have  been  designed  at  3m  x  3m dimensions.

## 17.6  Development and Production Schedule

## 17.6.1 Introduction

## Underground

Underground  development  is  categorized  as  'capital  waste  development'  or 'operating waste development' or 'operating mineralized development'.

Capital  waste  development  is  defined  as  development  required  to  maintain infrastructure including: development  of  the  ramp,  level  accesses,  FAR accesses, remuck bays, electric sub stations, sumps and the FAR itself.  Total lateral  capital  waste  development  is  7,950  meters  plus  560  meters  of  raise. Total capital waste tonnage is 333,160 tonnes.

Of  the  7,950  metres  of  capital  lateral  development  4,530  meters  will  be developed and outfitted for access by the monorail system.

Operating waste development is defined as development required to maintain stope operations including: development  of  stope accesses and loading stations.  Total  lateral  operating  waste  development  is  1,080  meters.  Total operating waste tonnage is 27,410 tonnes.

Operating mineralized development is defined as any development required in the deposit. This includes the over cut and under x-cut for the Alimak stopes as

well  as  the  Alimak  raises  when  in  the  deposit.    Total  operating  mineralized development is 4,910 meters. Total operating mineralized tonnage is 141,380 tonnes.  The LoM Capital and Operating Lateral Waste Development schedule is summarized by half years in Table 22 below.

Alimak raising and blasthole stopes will have production drilling and blasting performed  by  contractor  personnel  and  equipment.      Mucking  and  lateral development  will  be  carried  out  by  Liberty  personnel.  Stope  mucking  was scheduled at 1,500 tonnes per day but varies allowing for production ramp-up and some peaks in later years as production stopes become more available.   In any case the total planned mining rate does not exceed 1,900 tonnes per day due  to  stope  blast  availability.      The  LoM  development  and  production schedules are summarised by half years in Table 21, Table 22, Table 23 and Table 24

## 17.6.2 Contractor Involvement

All  ramp  development  at  Hart  will  be  carried  out  by  contractors.      Liberty personnel  will  develop  all  capital  and  operating  excavations  associated  with level and deposit accesses.

Contractors will be tasked to drive raises for fresh air as well as raises in the deposit to facilitate stope production.

Contractors  will  participate  in  production  activities  in  that  they  will  do  the production drilling and blasting in the Alimak stopes.  Liberty personnel will muck the blasted material from the Alimak stopes as well as execute all other rock handling tasks including operation of the monorails.

## 17.7  Manpower, Equipment and Services

## 17.7.1 Mine Manpower

The maximum number of mine and mill personnel excluding mine contractors is  estimated  at  112  employees  as  listed  in  Table  25.    Administration  and technical  service  personnel  (10  persons)  vary  regarding  time  allotted  to  the Hart mine.   Residual time for these persons has been allocated to Liberty's adjacent projects namely Redstone and McWatters.

The mine will operate seven days a week with two 10.5 hour shifts per day working a four days on and four days off schedule.  Liberty will be responsible for  all  level  development  and  rock  transport.      Contractors  will  be  used  to develop  the  main  ramp,  drive  the  FAR  system  and  execute  raising  and production drilling and blasting.

Management  and  technical  staff  will  work  a  Monday  to  Friday  dayshift schedule.

The development miners shown in Table 25 include the manpower requirements for both capital and operating development (two Liberty crews per shift).   Table 25 also states the average percentage of time that personnel are accountable to Hart instead of Liberty's other two projects.

The mill operates twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week with a staff of twenty-eight employees. An Operations Superintendent assumes the responsibility for four mill shifters and all activities concerning mill processes.

Figure  45  shows  the  Hart  LoM  manpower  build-up  of  staff  and  hourly employees.    Manpower  levels  peak  at  of  112  persons  in  the  3rd  quarter  of 2012.   Development requirements begin to decreases thereafter and manpower continues to decrease until the end of mine life in the 4th quarter of 2014.

## 17.7.2 Mining Equipment

Mining  equipment  was  selected for its compatibility with stoping and development requirements in terms of productivity, physical size and maneuverability.    The  production  and  development  schedules  are  not  fully optimized and, therefore, the equipment fleet may require some modification during  further  studies.    The  following  table  shows  the  main  equipment operation assumptions used in equipment productivity analysis.

The operating assumptions selected were based on experience and are within industry  norms.    Fleet  sizes  for  major  equipment  units  such  as  face  jumbos, explosives loading equipment, LHDs and trucks were estimated on scheduled quantities  of  work  and  productivities.    Service  equipment  without  specific productivity  factors  (scissor  lifts,  forklifts,  man  carriers,  etc)  were  given  a general  utilization  based  on  experience.    For  example,  it  was  estimated  that one ground control crew of two men will require a full shift to bolt and prepare two headings for drilling.  The Telehandler used for this task will therefore be fully utilized for the ground support role.

Table 26: Mobile Equipment Assumptions

| Element                                |   Assumption | Unit         |
|----------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Loose Waste Material Density:          |         2.1  | tonnes/m3    |
| Box/bucket Fill Factor:                |        90    | %            |
| Utilization of effective working time: |        80    | %            |
| Availability during production shifts: |        90    | %            |
| Operating efficiency:                  |        90    | %            |
| Shift duration:                        |        10.5  | Hours        |
| Travel time, lunch, inspections, etc:  |         1    | Hours        |
| Production shifts per day:             |         2    | Shifts       |
| Working days per month:                |        30    | Days         |
| Net Utilization                        |         6.89 | hours/shift  |
| Max. travel speed                      |         6    | km/hr        |
| Jumbo productivity                     |         2    | rounds/shift |
| Monorail or Truck loading time         |        10    | Minutes      |
| Monorail or Truck dump time            |         1    | Minute       |

The largest variable in defining the equipment requirements for the project was the monorail haulage distance for the blasted rock.  The haul distance from a level in the upper part of the mine will be hundreds or thousands of metres less than the haul from a lower stope.  To account for this situation the mine was divided  by  levels  (7)  and  the  average  haul  distance  for  each  level  was calculated.  Annual weighted average haul distances were then compiled and the  appropriate  monorail  productivity  was  assigned  for  tramming  in  that production year.  The monorail productivities used are represented in Table 26 and Figure 46.   Figure 47 compares productivity for a single 40t

Figure 46: 25t Monorail Productivity on 18% Grade

<!-- image -->

The chart shows that a monorail train with 25 tonne capabilities on an 18% grade and working 2 shifts per day can produce 1,160 tonnes per day from the center of the orebody.   Hart will  be using two trains and should both trains be mucking from the lowest level (570m Level) then only 1,400 tonnes per day can be produced.   It is useful to consider that the monorail trains are modular and  another  ore-car  could  be  added  to  supplement  tonnage  requirements  if required.

The reader  will  be  interested  in  a  comparison  with  conventional  trucks  so  a chart has been provided that highlights productivity differences.

Trade-offs between  trucks and the monorail show  the monorail to be recommended.    While  the  monorail  train  adds  capital  cost  the  operating savings significantly increase the project cash flow and NPV. Significant cost items affected by the monorail include:

- · Smaller excavation, saves capex
- · Lower energy cost, electric vs diesel
- · Can go deeper
- · Lower maintenance cost
- · Reduced labour - if train runs with no operator?
- · Lower ventilation and heating costs

Table 27 lists all the equipment purchase and rebuild requirements for the Hart project.   Equipment already owned and potentially usable for Hart comes from Liberty's McWatters mine.

All  minor  repairs  to  equipment  when  underground  will  be  conducted  on  the levels  while  all  major  repairs  will  be  conducted  in  the  surface  maintenance shop or contracted out to an independent shop in the community of Timmins.

One  mechanical  pickup  and  one  electrical  pickup  have  been  assigned  to maintenance  from  the  pickup  fleet  so  that  small  parts,  consumables  or  tools can be brought by the tradesmen to the respective workplace.

Hart  Alimak  production  drilling  productivity  estimate  is  shown  in  Table  28. This function will be performed by a drilling contractor.

Table 28: Production Drilling Productivity

| Shifts per day                     | 2     |        |
|------------------------------------|-------|--------|
| Meters per ring                    | 30    | M      |
| Rings per blast                    | 8     | Rings  |
| Meters per blast                   | 240   | m      |
| Tonnes per blast                   | 2,000 | tonnes |
| Tonnes per meter                   | 8.33  | tonnes |
| Effective drilling time  per shift | 6.89  | hrs    |
| Drilling time per hole             | 0.33  | hrs    |
| Holes drilled per shift            | 21    | holes  |
| Average hole length                | 10    | m      |
| Hole diameter                      | 50.8  | mm     |
| Meters drilled per shift           | 210   | m      |

Calculations indicate that the mean fragment size or blasted rock will be 5.3cm with 99% passing 45cm.  Any oversize will be either mud-blasted or discarded as  waste  at  the  end  of  shift.    Where  available  a  dead  end  drift  will  be designated as a blasting chamber but if none is available then the oversize will be blasted near the stope drawpoint.

## 17.7.3 Surface Haulage

The broken rock will be trammed to surface by monorail and toggle dumped (Figure 48) into a plant feed bin  or waste bin.   Highway haulage trucks (33 tonne tri-axial) will load from the appropriate bin and transport the waste or plant  feed  material  to  respective  storage  or  processing  areas.      The  distance from Hart to the Redstone mill is 6 kilometres by road for feed delivery direct to the mill and waste storage is planned to be within 500 metres of the Hart portal.

## 17.7.4 Grade Control

Samples will be collected daily from each stope drawpoint and/or development face and assayed in the Liberty laboratory located at Liberty's Redstone site.

The  assay  results  will  be  used  to  support  monthly  reconciliations  that  will include:

- · Predicted grade (mine plan block model grade) vs sampled grade;
- · Predicted grade (mine plan block model grade) vs mill headgrade.

Significant  and  consistent  variances  highlighted  in  the  reconciliation  studies will be followed up and resolved.

## 17.7.5 Backfill

Backfill  will  be  comprised  of  paste  tailings  fill.      The  mill  will  generate sufficient tails in its deep thickener allowing a fines portion to be scalped and later screened or filtered for use to produce a high quality paste.   Tails filter cake will be delivered to the paste plant by ready mix trucks under contract to the mine.

Pastefill  will  be  generated  at  the  plant  at  productivities  of  1,200  tpd  and delivered  by  pipeline  to  the  appropriate  stopes  (Table  29).      This  study  has detailed  the  costs  of  a  suitable  plant,  mill  modifications,  and  underground distribution system requirements including associated instrumentation.

Table 29: Annual Paste Backfill Requirement by Level

| Level      | 2011   | 2012    | 2013    | 2014    | Total   |
|------------|--------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| 90m Level  | 46,300 |         |         |         | 46,300  |
| 190m Level | 37,700 | 58,800  |         |         | 96,500  |
| 290m Level |        | 141,200 |         |         | 141,200 |
| 390m Level |        | 63,000  | 101,400 |         | 164,400 |
| 490m Level |        |         | 146,400 | 20,800  | 167,200 |
| 570m Level |        |         |         | 113,400 | 113,400 |
| Total      | 84,000 | 263,000 | 247,800 | 134,200 | 729,000 |

The  transport  of  paste  tailings  to  the  underground  workings  will  be  in  a pipeline  via  the  FAR.      This  routing  will  provide  the  shortest  access  to  the initial  stoping  areas  and  will  assist  in  keeping  the  pipeline  at  a  temperature above freezing.    The use of ventilation raises significantly reduces the length of backfill pipe and provides easy stope access.

The cement content of the paste fill will be determined upon final tailings size distribution and recipe calculations however, an assumption of 3% cement has been used in the cost estimate. The main purpose of the backfill is to support primary  stopes  so  that  secondary  stopes  can  be  recovered  without  excessive spans of hangingwall being unsupported.

## 17.7.6 Dewatering

Sumps will be established at each level entrance (40m, 90m, 190m and 290m, 390m, 490m and 570m).   Pumps will be sized for the potential maximum (25 year  storm  event)  mine  inflow  of  approximately  2,000  cubic  meters  per  day (300gpm)  based  on  expectations  of  similar  hydrology  to  Redstone  and McWatters mines.  Submersible pumps will be positioned on the clear water side of the sumps ensuring that the majority of fines are captured in the bottom of  the  sumps.    Pumps  will  lift  the  clear  water  up  the  ramp  to  surface  to  the surface water treatment ponds.

Sumps  will  be  designed  to  allow  LHD  access  for  cleaning  as  required,  and slimes will be allowed to drain before mixing with the plant feed supply.

## 17.7.7 Electrical Power Distribution

Power for the underground mine will be used by dewatering pumps, auxiliary ventilation  fans,  the  face  jumbo  and  production  drills  and  monorail  trains. Monorail trains (2) will each draw 120 kW of power when going up-ramp or when  running  on  the  level.      When  going  down-ramp  the  monorails  will generate approximately 90% of 120kW back into the system.   When the trains are  not  moving,  (includes  loading  or  dumping)  they  will  draw  no  load  from mine power.

The main electrical substation for the mine will be located at the surface plant area. Electricity for the mine will be carried via a 4160V overhead line to the portal area where it will be connected to the underground distribution system. Primary power underground will be supplied to local underground substations where  it  will  be  transformed  to  600V  for  use  by  ventilation  fans,  jumbos, pumps, monorail, etc.

Electrical cable reticulation in the mine will be carried down the ramp to the first  ventilation  raise  and  then  down  the  raises  to  reduce  the  length  of  cable required.    Every  20  metres  of  ventilation  raise  equals  approximately  150 meters of decline so the cost saving of installing the cable in the ventilation raises will be significant.

Small portable power centres will be located at each working cross cut/ramp intersection and will have sockets for ventilation fans, jumbos and pumps.  The power centre will be located just inside the ventilation cross cut where it will be protected from mobile equipment damage.

On  surface  power  will  be  used  to  operate  the  main  fresh  air  fan  and  air compressors.

## 17.7.8 Equipment Maintenance

The existing  surface  maintenance  shop  for  rubber  tired  mobile  equipment  is located at McWatters Mine, 3 kilometres from Hart.  That shop is equipped to meet foreseeable maintenance requirements for conventional equipment ranging from LHD's to personnel carriers.

A  monorail  service  bay  is  located  at  Hart  in  the  combined  office  and warehouse maintenance building.

The Hart mine layout allows access to all levels using the monorail.   In the event a mobile piece of equipment needs servicing that cannot be accommodated  underground  then  that  piece  will  be  slung  and  brought  to surface  by  the  monorail  and  carried  by  flatbed  to  the  McWatters  shop. Equipment  lifts  are  standard  practice for mine  monorails  and  their  lift capabilities exceed 27 tonnes so even the largest LHD will be a practical and quick lift exercise for the train.   All underground mobile equipment will be fitted with engineered lugs for monorail transport purposes.

Monorail trains download diagnostics every time they cycle to surface.  If a train  part  is  identified  as  worn  then  the  train  will  continue  past  the  surface

dump area into the warehouse/train maintenance bay for servicing.   Electric monorail trains are similar to mine hoists in reliability.  If a train does require a tow  to  surface  another  train  can  attach  and  pull  that  damaged  unit  to  the surface maintenance shop.

Minor  equipment  repairs  will  be  performed  underground  on  levels  or  near mine workings as required.   Service vehicles have been included in the capital estimate  for  mechanics  and  electricians.    Regular  preventative  maintenance will be performed underground or at the surface shops depending on severity of maintenance.

## 17.7.9 Materials and Supplies Handling

Areas have been designated in the mine plan to store all consumable materials. Explosives and cap magazines will be established and commissioned underground.  Materials will be transported by monorail to the working levels and distributed on the level by teleremote forklifts.   While the plan includes 5 individual jeeps for supervision and/or operations use the men and materials will more often be transported by monorail from the surface loading dock to and between any underground level.   Planning indicates that enough capacity exists in the train schedule to tram supplies and men during dayshift and rock and men during nightshift.   The monorail train can be quickly reconfigured (minutes) to handle men or materials.  Figure 49 shows a man and rock car arrangement on the same train.

## 17.8  Hart Mine Site Infrastructure

The Hart mine is a satellite site of the Liberty Redstone and McWatters Mines. As  such  it  requires  only  a  portion  of  what  a  stand-alone  operation  would require in terms of infrastructure.

As shown in Figure 50, infrastructure on site is planned to consist of a 1,200 tonne per day pastefill plant centrally located on surface above the deposit, and a distance of 200 metres from the mine portal.   Adjacent to the pastefill plant (Figure 50) is the Fresh Air Raise collar and heating plenum.  The FAR has been located to accommodate the pastefill distribution pipeline to underground.

Directly across from the mine portal site infrastructure (Figure 51) includes:

- · Train loadout/Truck loading
- · Mechanical maintenance shops (for monorail train);
- · Office complex, ;
- · Site warehouse;
- · Fuel depot
- · Security gate, ;
- · Compressor building;
- · Parking lots;
- · Lay-down yard areas
- · 5 Megawatt Transformer station
- · Settling and treatment ponds.

## 17.9  Environmental Considerations

## 17.9.1 Environmental Studies

Application  for  a  mining  lease  at  Hart  has  been  made  and  permitting  is  in progress.      The  Redstone  mill  complex  and  tailings  areas  have  already  been approved  for  environmental  permitting.      The  mill  is  in  operation  currently processing McWatters and Redstone ore.

## 17.9.2 Environmental Liabilities

Underground mining operations will be accessed by a ramp extending from a portal at surface. Bulk mining with Alimak mining methods will be utilized. All plant feed will be brought to surface using an electric monorail where it will be  loaded  into  highway  trucks  and  hauled  to  the  Redstone  nickel concentrator at the Redstone mine site.  The development waste rock will be trucked to surface and stockpiled for various future applications throughout the site.

Liberty  has  prepared  a  Spill  Prevention  and  Contingency  Plan  for  use  at McWatters and Redstone mines.   This same plan will be extended to apply to Hart mine.

The  purpose  of  this  plan  is  to  help  prevent  or  reduce  the  risk  of  spills  of pollutants and prevent, eliminate or ameliorate any adverse effects that result or may result.  This is achieved through detailed information and guidance on actions  important  for  the  prevention  of  spills  and  procedures  to  detect  and respond  to  them  when  they  occur.    The  structure  of  the  plan  is  designed  in accordance  with  the  requirements  of  Ontario  Regulation  224/07  -  Spill Prevention and Contingency Plans.

Wastes  generated  or  created  on  site  at  Hart  will  be  stored  in  approved containers.  All waste oil will be pumped into and stored in a 1,100 litre (250 gallon) steel tank located beside the McWatters maintenance shop.  All other wastes (contaminated soil, oil filters and waste chemicals) from Hart will be stored in 200 litre (45 gallon) waste material drums to be removed from site by a certified waste hauler and disposer.

Waste  ammonium  nitrate  from  explosives  at  Hart  (contaminated  or  noncontaminated) will be stored in waste ammonium nitrate bins where it will be picked up by Nordex Explosives Ltd. and transported to their site for disposal.

## 17.9.3 Emergency Response Plan

An Emergency Response Plan ('ERP') has been developed for McWatters and Redstone  mines.    That  plan  will  be  extended  to  include  Hart  mine  as appropriate. The plan was developed to identify potential worst-case emergency situations and responses, to outline the responsibilities of employees  during  these  emergencies  and  to  ensure  that  all  requirements  of applicable laws are met.

- E1 - Emergency Level 1 corresponds to elevated contaminant concentrations within the footprint of the mine water settling pond.  Contaminant elevations consist  of  any  level  exceeding  the  regulated  monthly  average  threshold  for each  contaminant  (i.e.  -  copper,  nickel,  arsenic,  zinc,  lead,  total  suspended solids, ammonia and radium 226).
- E2 - Emergency Level 2 corresponds to elevated contaminant concentrations within the footprint of the mine water treatment pond.  Contaminant elevations consist  of  any  level  exceeding  the  regulated  monthly  average  threshold  for each  contaminant  (i.e.  -  copper,  nickel,  arsenic,  zinc,  lead,  total  suspended solids, ammonia and radium 226).
- E3 - Emergency Level 3 corresponds to elevated contaminant concentrations from  the  treatment  pond  discharge  weir.    Contaminant  elevations  consist  of any level exceeding the regulated monthly  average threshold for each contaminant (i.e.  -  copper,  nickel,  arsenic,  zinc,  lead,  total  suspended  solids, ammonia and radium 226).

Sampling is undertaken daily at the settling pond at McWatters and Redstone. If any  results exceed  the thresholds, various actions are taken by  the environmental staff to contain the water in one or all of the noted areas.  For example,  a  level  E3  emergency  requires  the  installation  of  stop  logs  in  the treatment  pond  discharge  channel  to  contain  the  water  within  the  treatment pond.  If it is apparent that the ponds will fill to their maximum water heights before the concentration is reduced, the mine water system will have to be shut

down.  This will effectively halt the mining activities until problem has been rectified.

## 17.9.4 Acid Rock Drainage

Acid rock drainage at Hart is expected to be similar to that found at McWatters Mine.   Four main rock types can be identified at the McWatters site: footwall intermediate volcanics, mineralized ultramafic flows, felsic dykes, and mafic dykes. Each  rock  type  was  sampled  according  to  the  Guidelines  and Recommended  Methods  for  the  Prediction  of  Metal  Leaching  ('ML')  and Acid Rock Drainage ('ARD') at Mine sites in British Columbia.  The samples were then sent to the ALS CHEMEX lab in Vancouver for analysis of total sulphur, paste pH, and Acid Base Accounting ('ABA').

Testing revealed that the rock types to be extracted  during mining show pH values  that  are  non-acid  generating,  both  from  ABA  and  Shake  Flask  tests. Neutralizing Potential Ratio ('NPR') values and sulphide-S percentages also show that, on aggregate, these rocks are unlikely to be acid generating as they average  NPR&gt;&gt;4  and  sulphide-S  %&lt;0.3.    The  few  samples  of  andesitic composition with NPR&lt;4 and sulphide-S %&gt;0.3 yielded an average pH of 9, indicating that they are unlikely to have a negative impact on the overall ML and ARD potential of the rock type.

## 17.9.5 Environmental Permits

Hart  has  or  is  making  application  for  the  following  permits  for  the  Hart project.

Certificate of Approval  for  Industrial Sewage  Works  from  the  Ontario Ministry  of  the  Environment  for  the  collection,  transmission,  treatment  and disposal of sewage from Hart mine.

Permit to Take Water Number to dewater and use water.

Certificate  of  Approval  for  Air  for  the  operation  of  the  site  with  respect  to fugitive  emissions  from  the  mine  portal  that  discharges  the  return  air  in  the mine handling mineralization  and  waste;  a  surface  plant  feed  storage  pile;  a surface  waste  rock  pile;  and  haul  road.  In  addition,  the  permit  will  request approval for use of a propane fired mine heater having a maximum heat input of 15,360,000 kilojoules per hour used to heat intake fresh air, exhausting into the  atmosphere;    propane  fired  heating  equipment  having  a  total  maximum heat  input  of  1,688,000  kilojoules  per  hour  exhausting  into  the  atmosphere; maintenance welding exhausting into the atmosphere;  one (1) standby diesel generator  set  having  a  rating  of  1100  kilowatts,  to  provide  power  during emergency situations, exhausting into the atmosphere; and  fuel storage tanks used to refuel on site vehicles, exhausting into the atmosphere.

## 17.9.6 Environmental Monitoring

Liberty  has  developed  and  implemented  environmental  monitoring  programs to address its regulatory obligations under the Ontario Environmental Protection Act for McWatters and Redstone mines including the Metal Mining

Effluent Regulations ('MMER') of the Fisheries Act.   These programs will also be developed for the Hart project.

The  program  currently  consists  at  the  other  two  sites,  of  twice  monthly monitoring  of  receiving  water  quality  upstream  of  the  discharge  points, downstream  of  the  discharge  points  and  any  tributary  mixing  zones  and locations.

Periodic  (typically  once  every  three  years)  sampling  of  sediment  chemistry (metals, TOC, moisture content) and of benthic invertebrates at these locations is also performed.

Effluent  monitoring  is  conducted  as  per  MMER  regulations  at  maximum specified frequency for the duration of mine life (i.e., pH, TSS, and deleterious substances  weekly;  acute  toxicity  monthly;  chronic  toxicity  twice  yearly; effluent characterization four times per year).

Hart will be treated the same as Redstone or McWatters where waste water is pumped from underground and/or open pit workings to water treatment plants. In  conjunction  with  settlement  and  treatment  ponds,  the  water  is  treated  to below regulatory limits and discharged.  Monitoring is done at the treatment ponds and discharge weir.

Domestic  sewage  generated  from  the  mine  dry  and  underground  will  be directed to a septic system on site.  The dry is equipped with a potable water system  fed  from  a  well.    It  is  equipped  with  softening,  sulphur  and  UV systems.  Domestic water is monitored for E. coli and coliform bacteria.

Fugitive emissions from haul roads and rock piles are monitored and treated with water as necessary to control dust.

To  date  at  Redstone  and  McWatters  Mines,  there  have  been  no  values exceeding  any  MISA/MMER  threshold.  There  were  some  values  above  the amount of water allowed to be dewatered from the underground mine during the spring and summer of 2009 due to a very rainy season and the encounter of a  fault  structure  while  extending  the  ramp.    An  application  for  an  amended Permit to Take Water and an amended Certificate of Approval for Industrial Sewage Works are in progress which have a higher maximum dewatering and discharge limits to allow for atypical situations.

## 17.9.7 Redstone Nickel Concentrator and Tailings Ponds

The Redstone mill can process up to 2,000 tonnes per day of altered komatiite nickel bearing feed.  Tailings are pumped from the mill to the tailings basin.

The plant feed from Hart mine would be milled at the Redstone mill. As such, the tailings produced would be kept at the Redstone tailings pond.  A 12 metre diameter  (40  foot)  deep  cone  paste  thickener  in  the  mill  is  capable  of producing a paste consisting of 60% solids for discharge into the tailings basin or into ready-mix trucks for return to Hart's proposed pastefill plant.

Fresh  water  will  be  pumped  from  the  Redstone  River  to  the  Redstone  Mine and to the mill. The Redstone Mine utilizes the water for drilling, washing of stopes  and  general  cleaning.  The  mill  uses  the  water  for  general  purposes

within the crushing and grinding circuits. Recycled water is pumped into the mill process via the recycle pond.

The  water  is  utilized  for  process  water  requirements  (e.g.  chemical  mixing, ball mill feed, pump glands etc.) thus minimizing the use of river water.

## 17.9.8 Closure Plan

The Hart closure plan is currently under study in house. by Liberty.

## 17.10  Life of Mine Plan

## 17.10.1 Concentrator Feed Schedule

The  concentrator  feed  schedule  for  Hart  was  developed  at  1,500  tonnes  per day, commencing in November 2011 when plant capacity becomes available as the McWatters project processing is scheduled to be completed.  Plant feed from  the  Hart  mine  will  begin  about  6  months  earlier,  and  excess  mine production will be stockpiled in an area set aside for this purpose in front of the Redstone concentrator.  The stockpile is expected to reach a maximum size of approximately 285,000 tonnes in Q2 of 2014.

The  concentrator  feed  schedule  for  Hart's  potential  mineable  resource  is shown in Table 31.

SRK considers that the operating cost estimates and technical economic results presented for Hart are suitable to support a scoping level study.  The historical Redstone mill operating achievements have been incorporated into the estimate.

## Mine Operating Cost

Mine operating costs were estimated based on first principles since there is no production cost history at Hart to use as a basis of estimate.  Labour unit rates were provided by Liberty.  Equipment operating costs were based on industry cost  guide  publications.  The  underground  Alimak  mining  costs  include  a contractor's quote for raising, drilling and blasting.

## General and Administration Operating Cost

Hart's general and administration cost estimate for a year at full production is shown in Table 36.  The estimate, prepared by Liberty and reviewed by SRK, is based on actual and projected costs.  LoM average site G&amp;A cost per tonne attributed  to  Hart  is  estimated  at  $8.32  per  tonne  milled.    The  LoM  average G&amp;A unit cost is higher than indicated by the table due to periods of lower production during ramp up.

## 17.10.4 LoM Plan Economic Results

A life of mine pre-tax cash flow model was developed for the Hart Scoping Study.

The average mine production rate is approximately 1,500 tonnes per day which matches the planned concentrator feed rate of 1,500 tonnes per day.

The following assumptions were used in the analysis:

Ni Price

$7.00 US

Exchange Rate

$1.00 Cdn = $0.90 US

Discount Rate

8%

The results of the LoM analysis are shown in Table 38 and Table 39.

## Taxes

SRK does not provide expert advice on taxation matters.

The  results  of  tax  calculations  are  based  on  the  information  provided  by Liberty and documentation publicly available.

The Hart Scoping Study would be subject to income and/or revenue taxes as follows;

Ontario mining tax:  10%;

Ontario income tax:  10%;

Ontario capital tax:  0%;

Federal capital tax: 0%;

Federal income tax:  15%.

No taxes or other levies were considered in the economic assessment for the current Scoping Study.

## Markets

Liberty ships its nickel in concentrate exclusively to Xstrata Nickel's smelter in Sudbury, Ontario.

## 17.10.5 Sensitivity Analyses

This section presents the results of sensitivity analyses performed on changes to the following financial inputs:

- · Ni Price;
- · Cdn/US Exchange Rate;
- · Ni Grade;
- · Production Tonnes;
- · Operating Costs;
- · Capital Costs.

Figure 52 and Figure 53 show the cash flow and NPV sensitivity results for the LoM. The base case indicative results for the LoM yield a pre-tax cash flow of $87.752M Cdn and NPV at 8% of $55.5M Cdn.

The impact  on  both  pre-tax  cash  flow  and  NPV  is  greatest  in  the  following order:

- · Cdn/US exchange rate;
- · Ni Price;
- · Ni Grade;
- · Production Tonnes;
- · Operating Cost;
- · Capital Cost.

Figure 54 shows the impact of the Ni price (US$) in $0.50 increments on the LoM pre-tax cash flow and pre-tax NPV. The break even Ni price for the Hart project is US$4.95 per pound.

## 17.11  Project Risks and Opportunities

## 17.11.1 Project Risks

## Project Economics

Experience over the past decade confirms that the metal markets are subject to wide  fluctuations  in  metal  demands  and  prices  which  result  in  ensuing fluctuations in labour, equipment and consumable costs.

SRK  estimates  a  pre-tax,  break  even  nickel  price  of  US$4.95  per  pound (exchange rate 0.90) for the project.  There is a risk to the economic viability of  the  project  should  the  nickel  price  drop  to  lower  levels  then  this  over  an extended period.  It may be possible to partially mitigate this risk through long term agreements/contracts for supplies, energy and labour, or through a long term concentrate sales agreement.

## Underground Mining

Potential Loss of Planned Tonnage

With Alimak mining techniques over 100m level spacing there is a potential of changing  thickness  in  the  mining  zone  resulting  in  production  delay  and/or tonnage loss caused by blast failure or 'bridging' of the blasted material.

When  very  narrow  (less  than  2  m)  thicknesses  are  encountered  carefully engineered  stoping  plans  (including  resuing  techniques)  may  be  required  to recover the vein without increasing dilution.

When miss-holes occur in Alimak Raise mining the miners must re-access the area and reload (or in the worst case remotely re-drill and reload) the round. Production  delays  and/or  tonnage  loss  could  be  caused  if  miss-holes  or bootlegs impede a clear break to the stope lines.   This risk can be mitigated by instituting a quality control program on drilling and blasting activities. Bridging  of  blasted  material  in  narrow  regions  of  the  stope  can  occur  and remain  undetected  if  the  toes  of  the  blast  holes  remain  unbroken.      Again quality control of drilling and blasting is imperative.

## External Dilution

There  is  always  a  risk  that  the  Alimak  mining  method  dilution  assumptions could be greater than estimated.

## Stope Design

Risk exists as a geotechnical study has not been completed at Hart.   The study once completed may indicate more support requirements or smaller panel sizes than have been assumed in this report.

## 17.11.2 Opportunities

## Exploration Potential

The ultramafic body that hosts the Hart nickel mineralized zone continues at depth  and  trends  SSE  over  hundreds  of  metres.    There  is  potential  for extensions  to  the  deposit  and  for  further  discoveries  of  economic  nickel mineralization.  The nickel grade potential at depth appears to be very good compared to the average grade of the currently defined deposit.

The  potential  delineation  of  additional  economic  sub-parallel  mineralization would increase the overall tonnes per vertical meter with a positive impact on mining economics.

## Underground Mining

The Alimak mining method has a degree of flexibility and selectivity.  It can respond  to  changes  in  the  outline  of  the  deposit  identified  by  information gained  during  mine  development  and  raise  access.    If  low  grade  zones  are encountered, they can be resued by altering the blasting parameters to create coarser fragmentation likely to be identified and sorted at the drawpoints.

The  method  lends  itself  to  significant  level  spacing  opportunities  where deposit thickness is sufficient to exploit.   For example at the former HBMS Namew Lake Mine level intervals occasionally reached more than 200 metres in deposit thicknesses exceeding 8 meters.   Potential exists to eliminate 490m Level where deposit thicknesses are 8 metres or more depending on confidence in the method gained in higher regions of the mine.

Hart\_PEA\_3CL008.007\_GC\_AM\_KR\_ab\_201032010Rev4,

Should  future  exploration  results  allow  mining  deeper,  the  monorail  system specified in the study will be well suited to support the deep mining.

## Nickel Price

Over  the  past  five  years  nickel  prices  have  fluctuated  between  $3  and  $23 dollars per pound.   Economic forces that drove these fluctuations can largely be  attributed  to  rapid  growth  in  China.      With  growth  expectations  in  that country  expected  to  meet  or  exceed  8%  for  the  next  few  years  and  with postponement of many large capital nickel projects it is possible that the study nickel  price  of  US$7.00  per  pound  could  be  exceeded  during  the  life  of  the project.

## 18  Interpretation and Conclusions

## Geology and Mineral Resources

An  appreciation  of  the  geological  controls  determining  the  distribution  of nickel mineralization at the Hart Deposit and the continuity of particularly the basal higher grade massive sulphide type mineralization has been gained from appropriately spaced drilling and from operational and exploration experience gained by Liberty on similar deposits in the Shaw Dome.

The  current  drill  density  has  allowed  the  massive  sulphide  deposit  to  be extrapolated  and  modelled  confidently  down  to  approximately  450  metres below surface. Our understanding of the nickel grade distribution within the lower grade structurally - controlled disseminated type mineralization in the hanging wall has been limited by the discontinuous nature of mineralization and  by  a  limited  understanding  of  the  structural  elements  that  influence  its continuity. The structurally distorted and variable grade iron formation zone is seen  as  a  lower  priority  target,  despite  its  shallow  location.  The  massive sulphide horizon is the primary target for underground mining.

Although exploration history at Hart dates back to the period 1960 to 1964, only  verified  data  acquired  in  the  period  2005  to  2008  has  been  applied  for resource estimation purposes. This high quality dataset has facilitated resource modelling  and  estimation  in  this  study.  The  exploration  methodologies  and protocols  practiced  by  Liberty  exploration  staff  conform  to  industry  'best practices'. Liberty management has applied a quality management system that compares well to industry standard. Sampling protocols, drilling  procedures, database  management  and  overall  quality  assurance  and  quality  control  are areas  that  have  receive  priority.  The  implementation  of  industry  standard database management systems and 3D modelling software packages on Liberty have contributed considerably to the high exploration standards.

The geology model and classified resource estimate reflect current knowledge of  the  Hart  mineralization  continuity  and  associated  grade  trends.  Modelled resources  are  classified  as  Indicated  or  Inferred.  An  opportunity  exists  to upgrade the resources in  the  deeper  portion  of  the  deposit  (&gt;450  metres)  by increasing the drilling density as well as by increasing our understanding of the structural framework upon which the Hart deposit is based. Such an improved structurally based resource body will not only lead to upgraded resources but also to reduced risk in future mining decisions based on this model.

Although this first NI43-101 compliant resource estimate for Hart is the largest nickel  resource  identified  to  date  at  the  Shaw  Dome,  it  should  serve  as  a starting point, which should be continually updated and enhanced as additional data  and  interpretations  become  available.  The  close  proximity  of  the  Hart Deposit to other existing Liberty mining and processing infrastructure should favourably impact future mining feasibility studies.

## Mining

- · SRK concludes that Alimak Raise mining with 100m spaced sublevels and paste backfill is the preferred method for mining the Hart resource;
- · An Alimak Raise stoping  method  with  pastefill,  employing  primary  and secondary stopes is expected to remain stable as the mine goes deeper due to the use of quality pastefill;
- · Based  on  the  mine  records  at  Liberty's  sister  mines  (Redstone  and McWatters) , mine water inflow is assumed to average roughly 100 litres per hour and have maximum flows of 200 lph;
- · Underground ramp access with monorail trains is the recommended option over  diesel  truck  haulage.      The  mine  will  benefit  more  from  the  train system as the mine gets deeper;
- · The monorail system provides an opportunity if the mine production rate is ever increased as it doesn't have the same ventilation or interference issues as diesel trucks;
- · SRK estimates  a  mine  life  of  4.5  years  (38  months  production)  with  an average mining production rate of 45,000 tonnes per month;
- · No  underground  primary  crushing  is  required,  as  stope  fragmentation designs  will  commutate  the  mineralization  sufficiently  for  handling  by train underground and by trucks on surface.

## Mineral Processing

- · Liberty's existing Redstone nickel concentrator will efficiently handle Hart feed although a maximum stockpile of approximately 285 kt will build up, with milling continuing after mining eases;
- · Planned  metallurgical  recovery  of  nickel  ranges  from  85  percent  to  95 percent based on historical milling results and the planned mill nickel head grade;
- · Indications are that the Hart mineralization will produce a saleable nickel concentrate  with  a  grade  of  approximately  15  percent  nickel  similar  to Redstone and McWatters mines;
- · The  existing,  permitted  tailings management  facility  adjacent  to  the Redstone  mill  has  sufficient  capacity  for  tailings  generated  over  the  Hart planned life-of-mine.

## Environmental

- · Liberty  has  prepared  a  Spill  Prevention  and  Contingency  Plan  to  help prevent or reduce the risk of spills of pollutants and prevent, eliminate or ameliorate  any  adverse  effects  that may  result  at its Redstone  and McWatters operations.   It is Liberty's intent to extend this plan to Hart;
- · Hart  will  inherit Liberty's  Emergency  Response  Plan  ('ERP')  from Redstone and McWatters Mine.  The plan  identifies potential worst-case emergency  situations  and  responses,  to  outline  the  responsibilities  of

employees  during  these  possible  emergencies  and  to  ensure  that  all requirements of applicable laws are met;

- · Rock types at site are similar to Redstone and McWatters rock.   Those rocks were sampled and subjected to analysis of total sulphur, paste pH, and Acid Base Accounting ('ABA').  Testing revealed that the rock types to be extracted during mining show  pH  values that are non-acid generating, both from ABA and Shake Flask tests.  Neutralizing Potential Ratio  ('NPR')  values  and  sulphide-S  percentages  also  show  that,  on aggregate, these rocks are unlikely to be acid generating;
- · Liberty has initiated the application process for the necessary permits to be able to conduct mining operations at the Hart project site;
- · Liberty intends to develop environmental monitoring programs to address its regulatory obligations under the Ontario Environmental Protection Act for the project and the Metal Mining Effluent Regulations ('MMER') of the Fisheries Act;
- · Liberty is currently investigating a closure plan in compliance with Mine Development and Closure under Part VII of the Mining Act and Ontario Regulation 240/00, including the Mine Rehabilitation Code of Ontario as set  out  in  Schedule  1  of  Ontario  Regulation  240/00.      This  study  has assigned an amount of $350K to address the closure at a scoping level.

## Potential Mineable Tonnage

- · SRK estimates Hart's Potentially Mineable Tonnage at 1,729,100 tonnes with an average grade of 1.29 percent Ni.  A nickel price of US$15,430 per tonne (US$7.00 per pound) and an exchange rate of $1.00 Cdn = $0.90 US was used in the estimation;
- · The  in-situ Mineral  Resources  included  into  the  Mineable  Tonnage estimate  are  based  on  a  cut-off  grade  of  0.46  percent  Ni  for  the  Alimak Raise mining method.

## Project Economics

- · The Hart scoping study demonstrates a viable concept at the study nickel price of US$7.00 per pound;
- · LoM net NSR revenue based on plant  feed  of  1,729,100  tonnes  at  1.29 percent Ni is estimated at $246 million;
- · Mine site unit operating costs are estimated at $53.77 per tonne milled;
- · The  estimated  unit  cost  for  processing  at  1500  tpd  is  $14.81  per  tonne milled;
- · The LoM average general and administration operating cost is estimated at $8.32 per tonne milled;
- · Surface truck haulage costs to the Redstone mill are estimated at $1.07 per tonne milled;
- · LoM operating costs are estimated at $93.0 million;
- · Total project capital requirements are estimated at $65.3 million;

- · Undiscounted  pre-tax  LoM  indicative  cash  flow  is  estimated  at  $87.8 million;
- · The indicative project Pre-Tax NPV at an 8 percent discount rate is $55.6 million;
- · The indicative project pre-tax IRR is estimated at 50 percent.

## Project Risks and Opportunities

- · The most significant project risk is to the economic viability of the Hart project  should  the  nickel  price  or  exchange  rate  experience  significant negative variances from the values used in the economic assessment.
- · The  most  significant  project  opportunity  is  the  conversion  of  Inferred Mineral Resources  to the Indicated classification through additional exploration.

## 19  Recommendations

## Resource Development

Significant  nickel  mineralization  has  been  identified  by  Liberty  on  the  Hart project. Confidence in estimating mineral resources at Hart is determined by various factors, including the following:

- · An appreciation of the variables associated with komatiite-associated Ni(Cu) deposits;
- · An understanding of the 3D structural geological framework within which the nickel sulphide mineralization resides;
- · The drilling density;
- · Quality control procedures used to collect exploration data.

SRK believes that there is a strong potential to increase the Inferred Resources at  Hart  particularly  by  drilling  the  depth  extensions  of  the  sulphide  zones. Additional infill drilling is warranted to upgrade the Inferred mineral resources to an Indicated classification.

SRK recommends that Liberty consider the following for its future exploration work at Hart:

- · Increase  the  drill  density  at  depths  between  450  to  600  metres  below surface; (Estimated at $675k from surface and $500k from underground)
- · Undertake  structural  investigations  to  improve  the  understanding  of  the distribution of the sulphide mineralization improve the quality of the 3D geological model;
- · Continue  to  model  the  intrusive  dikes  that  occur  in  proximity  to  the sulphide zones of mineralization;
- · Attempt  to  identify  portions  of  the  disseminated  sulphide  and  ironstone hosted zones exhibiting higher nickel grades;
- · Update the resource model once the geological model has been updated;

## Mining

- · SRK  recommends  further  work  to  support  a  Prefeasibility  Study  to confirm and/or optimize the findings within this Scoping Study. ($250k) SRK  further  recommends  that  future  work  should  be  done  in  stages, investigating areas of risk as early as possible in the overall work program;
- · A pastefill consultant should be commissioned to confirm the suitability of creating a quality pastefill for use at Hart. ($60k);
- · As part of the prefeasibility study, a pastefill consultant should be tasked to perform basic engineering, costing and scheduling for a pastefill plant and distribution system. ($100k);

AM - PB- GC  - kr - ab

- · Geotechnical  investigations  should  be  conducted  to  establish  rock  mass strength ratings and to provide recommendations on stope design, ground support and dilution estimation. ($50k);
- · Hydrogeological  studies  should  be  performed  to  confirm  the  potential inflow issues associated with the mining plan. ($50k);
- · A  monorail  system  is  recommended  to  access  and  service  the  mining. (costs are included in the capital estimate);
- · Basic engineering for application of the monorail technology needs to be undertaken to support the recommended prefeasibility study. ($100k)  This cost has already been included in this study capital section;
- · The  mine  plans  presented  in  this  report  are  not  for  construction,  and further studies and detailed engineering would be required before implementation at the Hart site;

## Environmental

- · Continue the permitting process and initiate supporting studies including any further characterization of ARD  potential of rock types, and geochemical characterization of tailings and site discharge water.
