## 1 SUMMARY

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Roscoe Postle Associates Inc. (RPA) was retained by NioBay Metals Inc. (NioBay) to prepare an  independent  Technical  Report  on  the  James  Bay  Niobium  Project  (the  Project  or  the Property), located in Cochrane District, northeastern Ontario, Canada.  The purpose of this report is  to  support the disclosure of an initial  Mineral  Resource estimate.  This Technical Report conforms to NI 43-101 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects.  RPA visited the Property on September 27, 2017.

As of the effective date of this report, the Project consists of a single mining lease covering an area of approximately 2,585 ha located in 1:50,000 scale NTS map sheet 42I/15 (Meengan Creek).  The Project is located approximately 40 km south of town of Moosonee, Ontario, and is accessible by helicopter during the summer and by winter road in the winter.

NioBay is a Montreal-based company formed in January 1954 (as Exploration Minière du Nord Inc. and known more recently as MDN Inc. (MDN)) and is a reporting issuer in British Columbia, Alberta, Ontario,  and Quebec.  The common shares of NioBay trade on the TSX Venture Exchange and the company is under the jurisdiction of the Autorité des marchés financiers du Québec.

On June 7, 2016, MDN announced that it had entered into an agreement with Barrick Gold Corporation, James Bay Columbium Ltd., and Goldcorp Inc. (collectively the Vendors) whereby it could earn a 100% interest in the Property by making a cash payment and issuing common shares, subject to a 2% net smelter return (NSR) royalty, with MDN having the right to buy out half the royalty.  The Vendors retained the right to buy back a 51% interest should one or more deposits  containing  at  least  2  million  ounces  of  gold  or  gold  equivalent,  in  aggregate,  be established.  The buy back right does not apply to the niobium content of the Property.  On June 28, 2016, MDN announced that it had closed the previously announced transaction.  On September 2, 2016, MDN announced a name change to NioBay Metals Inc.

Since acquiring the Property, NioBay has completed a re-logging program of historical core, check sampling and preliminary  metallurgical  testwork  on  a  composite  sample  taken  from historical drill core.

The current Mineral Resource estimate prepared by RPA is summarized in Table 1-1.  The Mineral Resources conform to Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (CIM) Definition Standards for Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves dated May 10, 2014 (CIM (2014)  definitions).    Note  that  the  estimate  is  reported  in  short  tons.    RPA  has  excluded approximately 7.1 million tons averaging 0.52% Nb2O5 situated in a 150 ft thick crown pillar.

TABLE 1-1   MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATE AS OF NOVEMBER 8, 2017 NioBay Metals Inc. - James Bay Niobium Project

| Classification   |   Tonnage  (M st) |   Grade  (%Nb2O5) |   Contained Nb2O5  (M lb) |
|------------------|-------------------|-------------------|---------------------------|
| Indicated        |              25.5 |              0.53 |                       271 |
| Inferred         |              25.3 |              0.51 |                       259 |

## Notes:

- 1. CIM (2014) definitions were followed for Mineral Resources.
- 2. Mineral  Resources  are  reported  at  a  cut-off  grade  of  0.3%  Nb2O5  based  on  an  underground  mining operating cost of C$70/t and a metallurgical recovery of 70%.
- 3. Mineral  Resources  are  estimated  using  a  long-term  niobium  price  of  US$40  per  kg  and  a  US$/C$ exchange rate of 1:1.2.
- 4. A tonnage factor of 12.2 ft³/ton (2.93 g/cm³) was used.
- 5. A minimum mining width of approximately 25 ft was used to build the resource wireframes.
- 6. Resources situated in a 150 ft thick crown pillar have been excluded.

RPA  is  not  aware  of  any  environmental,  permitting,  legal,  title,  taxation,  socio-economic, marketing, political, or other relevant factors that could materially affect the Mineral Resource estimate.

## CONCLUSIONS

The James Bay Niobium Project is hosted by the Argor Carbonatite Complex which occurs within the northern portion of the Kapuskasing Structural Zone (KSZ).  The KSZ crosscuts an east-trending fabric within the Archean rocks of the Superior Province and is sub-parallel to the Trans-Superior Tectonic Zone (TSTZ).  Numerous alkalic and carbonatite intrusions occur along and within the KSZ.

Pyrochlore and, to a lesser extent, columbite, are the economic minerals of interest and are hosted predominantly by the sovite phase of the carbonatite.

Extensive work during the mid to late 1960s resulted in a historical Mineral Resource estimate and  feasibility  study.    The  Property  has  been  dormant  since  1972.    Re-sampling  of  the historical  diamond  drill  core  by  NioBay  has  confirmed  that,  despite  some  variation  at  the individual sample level, the overall grade over wide intervals is similar to historical values.

Preliminary testwork on a composite sample consisting of core from 12 historical drill holes included gravity, flotation, QEMSCAN mineralogy, and heavy liquid separation tests.  Although preliminary and subject to verification, the results proved encouraging.  Additional testwork on fresh material is recommended.

Historical diamond drilling has outlined mineralization with three-dimensional continuity, and size and grades that can potentially be extracted economically.

Mineral Resources were estimated and classified by RPA following CIM (2014) definitions.  At a cut-off grade of 0.3% Nb2O5, Indicated Mineral Resources are estimated to total 25.5 million tons  grading  0.53%  Nb2O5  containing  approximately  271  million  pounds  of  niobium  oxide. Inferred  Mineral  Resources  are  estimated  to  total  25.3  million  tons  grading  0.51  Nb2O5 containing 259 million pounds of niobium oxide.

RPA is  of  the  opinion  that  there  is  excellent  exploration  potential  to  increase  the  Mineral Resource at depth with more diamond drilling.

The Ontario Ministry of Northern Development and Mines (MNDM) has identified Moose Cree First Nation (MCFN) as the only Aboriginal community that must be consulted for the Project. Despite a number of requests, the leadership of MCFN has to this day refused to open a dialogue with NioBay and to discuss their concerns associated with the exploration program and the Project.  The MNDM is taking steps to organize a meeting with representatives of the MCFN to address any concerns they may have about the proposed drilling campaign.  NioBay will continue to hold discussions with the local community members and government officials and will maintain its efforts to engage with the MCFN leadership.

## RECOMMENDATIONS

RPA  is  of  the  opinion  that  the  James  Bay  Niobium  Project  hosts  a  significant  niobium mineralized  system,  there  is  good  potential  to  increase  the  resource  base,  and  additional exploration and technical studies are warranted.

RPA has reviewed and concurs with NioBay's proposed exploration programs and budgets. Phase  I  of  the  recommended  work  program  will  include  4,000  m  of  drilling  focussed  on upgrading  portions  of  the  Inferred  Resources  to  Indicated  Resources  and  extending  the Mineral Resources at depth, as well as environmental, engineering, and metallurgical studies required to support a Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA) in 2018.

Details of the recommended Phase I program can be found in Table 1-2.

## TECHNICAL SUMMARY

## PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION

The  Project  is  located  in  northeastern  Ontario,  approximately  40  km  south  of  the  town  of Moosonee.  Access to the Property is by helicopter year-round and bush roads from Moosonee during the winter months  It is centred at approximately Latitude 50°50'69' N and Longitude 80°40'48' W within 1:50,000 scale NTS map sheet 42I/15 (Meengan Creek).

## LAND TENURE

The Project consists of a single mining lease covering an area of 2,585.148 ha. The lease includes  both  mining  and  surface  rights.  It  was  issued  on  March  1,  2008  and  expires  on February 28, 2018 and is renewable.

## EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE

There is no permanent infrastructure on the Property except for the historical underground excavations which consist of a 133 ft (40.54 m) shaft and a 100 ft (30.5 m) crosscut.

## HISTORY

From  April  to  June  1965,  Canadian  Aero  Mineral  Surveys  Limited  (Canadian  Aero)  was contracted to fly a combined magnetic-electromagnetic (EM)-radiometric survey over an area including  the  licences  of  occupation  held  by  Consolidated  Morrison  Explorations  Limited (Consolidated Morrison), Argor Explorations Limited (Argor Explorations), and Goldray Mines Limited (Goldray).  A total of approximately 3,059 ln-km were flown at an azimuth of N045°W and at a nominal flight line spacing of approximately 400 m.  A total of 46 anomalous zones consisting of clusters of individual anomalies of various intensities and magnetic correlation were detected, including three high priority areas.

From  June  to  August  1965,  as  a  follow-up  to  the  airborne  survey,  a  helicopter-supported geological mapping program was carried out by Argor Explorations on behalf of the concession holders  to  establish  the  regional  geological  controls  and  investigate  the  cause  of  specific magnetic anomalies.

From June to October 1965, Huntec Limited (Huntec) was contracted to complete ground geophysical  surveys  over  several  airborne  geophysical  anomalies.    Geophysical  surveys consisted of vertical loop electromagnetic (VLEM), horizontal loop electromagnetic (HLEM), magnetic, and refraction seismics.  A total of 27 anomalies or anomaly complexes identified

<!-- image -->

by these surveys were selected for diamond drill testing from 1965 to May 1969.  In total, 49 holes totalling 32,041 ft (9,765.6 m) were drilled.  A number of conductors were defined, two of which (the Alpha A and Gamma targets on the Consolidated Morrison concession) were recommended for drilling.  Additional geophysical surveying was recommended for several other targets prior to defining drill targets.

One of the magnetic anomalies, the Alpha-B, was found to be caused by a niobium-bearing carbonatite complex.  In 1966, 18 holes were drilled and niobium mineralization was traced over a strike length of 7,800 ft (2,377 m).  An additional 67 holes were drilled in 1967, bringing the number of holes drilled to 85 for a total of 47,625 ft (14,514 m) in outlining the deposit to a maximum  depth  of  900  ft  (274.3  m).    Niobium  mineralization  was  encountered  between sections 8+00S and 40+00N but the mineralized carbonatite remained open to the north.

Fifteen soil test holes were drilled during this period to investigate the stability of the glacial overburden and Paleozoic sedimentary cover, which together average approximately 100 ft (30.5 m) over the Precambrian basement.

In 1968, a test shaft was sunk in the central part of the mineralized body and a 250 ton bulk sample of niobium-bearing carbonatite was mined for metallurgical testing.  The shaft was sunk to 133 ft (40.54 m) and a 100 ft (30.5 m) crosscut was driven.

In 1967, Canadian Bechtel Limited (Bechtel) completed a preliminary mining appraisal on the Argor deposit.  The study considered three scenarios 1) mining the entire orebody by open pit, 2) mining the entire orebody by underground methods, and 3) mining the south end of the orebody by open pit followed by underground mining of the northwest limb.  The assessment of the three scenarios was based on annual tonnage sufficient to produce 7.5 million pounds of Nb2O5 for 20 years with an overall mill recovery of 75%.  Bechtel estimated 'geological ore reserves' of 61,560,000 tons grading 0.52% Nb2O5.  This estimate was prepared prior to the implementation of National Instrument 43-101 and is considered to be historical in nature and should not be relied upon.  This historical resource estimate is superseded by RPA's estimate presented in this report.

In 1979, Bechtel updated the feasibility study.

## GEOLOGY AND MINERALIZATION

The James Bay niobium deposit is hosted by the Argor Carbonatite Complex and occurs in the northern portion of the KSZ of the Superior Province.  Numerous alkalic and carbonatite intrusions  occur  along  this  structure  which  extends  from  the  east  shore  of  Lake  Superior northeast  to  James  Bay.  Rocks  in  the  general  area  of  the  Property  are  characterized  by granulite facies rank gneisses and a pervasive north- to northeast-trending fault pattern.

The carbonatite complex is overlain by approximately 10 m of overburden and 20 m of Lower Devonian rocks of the Sextant Formation consisting of poorly bedded sandstone, mudstone, siltstone, and loosely cemented conglomerate.

The Argor Carbonatite Complex appears to be a dyke-like body with a long axis striking north. The enclosing gneisses are described as mylonitic or augen gneisses.

The principal niobium-bearing mineral is pyrochlore but niobium also occurs, to a much lesser extent, in the mineral columbite.

The main pyrochlore-bearing phases of the carbonatite complex include lineated dolomitic carbonatite  (Unit  5),  calcite-dolomite  carbonatite  breccia  (Unit  6),  massive  calcite-dolomite carbonatite (Unit 7), and 'crushed' dolomitic carbonatite (Unit 8).

Significant pyrochlore mineralization occurs only in sodium- and magnesium-rich phases of the carbonatite.  The highest-grade mineralization occurs in a mixed dolomite-calcite host (Unit 6).  The pure dolomitic host (Unit 5) produces intermediate grades and pure calcite (Units 2, 7, and 9) is normally low in grade or barren .

The columbite occurs along the eastern side of the complex over a strike length of 120 m in the crushed dolomitic carbonatite (Unit 8).  The columbite is totally or partially pseudomorphic after pyrochlore.  The columbite may occur in the core of the crystal, on the rim of the crystal, or completely replaces the pyrochlore.  The columbite does not appear to be restricted to any one rock unit, but it does appear to be related to fracturing and hematitic alteration.

Pale green fluor-variety of apatite is universally present in all rock units within the carbonatitepyroxenite complex.  Usually, the highest-grade bands of pyrochlore-bearing carbonatite also contains abnormally high quantities of apatite, while the converse is not true.

## EXPLORATION STATUS

The  James  Bay  niobium  deposit  is  at  the  Mineral  Resource  development  stage.    The remainder of the Property is at an early exploration stage.

## MINERAL RESOURCES

The Mineral Resources conform to CIM (2014) definitions and are summarized in Table 1-1. RPA  considers  the  Mineral  Resources  of  the  James  Bay  Project  to  be  amenable  to underground extraction.  The Mineral Resource estimate has an effective date of November 8, 2017 and excludes a portion of the deposit designated as part of the crown pillar.

RPA evaluated the Mineral Resources through database compilation and verification, defining the mineralization domains and constructing wireframes, capping and compositing data for geostatistical  analysis  and  variography,  selection  of  estimation  strategy  and  estimation parameters, block modelling and grade interpolation, block model validation, classification of Mineral Resources, assessment of reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction, and selection of reporting assumptions.

RPA used Leapfrog software to create a three-dimensional geological model from core log information.    Mineralization  was  modelled  at  an  approximate  modelling  threshold  of  0.3% Nb2O5.  It was determined that capping was not required due to the disseminated nature of the niobium and the overall grade distribution.  Prior to grade interpolation, the assay data within each  of  the  individual  mineralized  grade  shells  were  combined  into  10  ft  long  downhole composites,  based  on  the  analysis  of  the  predominant  sampling  length,  the  style  of mineralization, and continuity of grade.  Grade estimation was carried out in three passes with the first pass using full variogram ranges for the search, twice the variogram range for the second pass, and 2.5 times the variogram range for the third pass.

The block model was validated using volumetric comparison of the blocks versus wireframes, a QQ plot of 2017 resampling versus historical data, comparison of block grades by the primary ordinary  kriging  estimator  to  results  from  inverse  distance  cubed  and  nearest  neighbour estimates, swath plot comparisons, visual inspection of block grades versus composite grades, and statistical comparison of block grades to assay and composite grades.  A cut-off grade of 0.3%  Nb2O5  was  calculated  using  an  average  operating  cost  of  C$70/t,  a  metallurgical recovery of 70%, and a niobium price of US$40.0 per kg with a US$/C$ exchange rate of 1:1.2.

## 2 INTRODUCTION

Roscoe Postle Associates Inc. (RPA) was retained by NioBay Metals Inc. (NioBay) to prepare an  independent  Technical  Report  on  the  James  Bay  Niobium  Project  (the  Project  or  the Property), located in Cochrane District, northeastern Ontario.  The purpose of this report is to support  the  disclosure  on  an  initial  Mineral  Resource  estimate.    This  Technical  Report conforms to NI 43-101 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects.  RPA visited the Property on September 27, 2017.

NioBay is a Montreal-based company formed in January 1954 as Exploration Minière du Nord Inc. and was subsequently known as MDN Inc. (MDN).  NioBay is a reporting issuer in British Columbia, Alberta, Ontario, and Quebec.  The common shares of NioBay trade on the TSX Venture  Exchange and the company is under the jurisdiction  of  the Autorité  des  marchés financiers du Québec .

Apart from the James Bay Niobium Project, NioBay has an option to acquire a large land position in La Peltrie Township in northwestern Quebec with potential to host volcanogenic massive sulphide (VMS) mineralization and controls a property in Crevier Township, Lac St. Jean area, Quebec with the potential to host niobium-tantalum mineralization.

Currently, the major asset associated with the Project is a strategic land position covering prospective  lithologies  and  structures.    The  Project  hosts  the  James  Bay  niobium  deposit (historically referred to as the Argor deposit), which is at the resource definition stage, as well as a large land position which merits additional exploration.

Since acquiring the Property, NioBay has completed a re-logging program of historical core, check sampling, and preliminary metallurgical testwork on a composite sample taken from historical drill core.

## 4 PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION

The James Bay Niobium Project is located in northeastern Ontario, approximately 40 km south of the town of Moosonee and approximately 640 km north of Toronto (Figure 4-1).  It is located in the West of Marberg Creek Area and West of Flinch Lake Area, District of Cochrane, within 1:50,000  scale  National  Topographic  System  (NTS)  sheet  42I/15  (Meengan  Creek).    The Project consists of a single, heptagonally shaped mining lease which extends over a distance of 9.36 km in a north-northeasterly direction and covers an area of approximately 2,585.1 ha. The center of the mining lease is located at approximately Latitude 50°50'69' N and Longitude 80°40'48' W.  The centre of the currently defined mineralization is located at approximately Latitude 50°43'31' N and Longitude 80°34'46' W (Berger, Singer and Orris, 2009).

## LAND TENURE

The Property consists of a single mining lease (Lease 19586 or Claim CLM11) covering an area of 2,585.148 ha (Figure 4-2).  The lease includes both mining and surface rights.  It was issued on March 1, 2008 and expires on February 28, 2018, and is renewable.

The annual mining rental costs due annually on Lease 19586 total $7,755.54.

On June 7, 2016, MDN, a predecessor company to NioBay, announced that it had signed a definitive property purchase agreement to acquire a 100% interest in the Project from Barrick Gold Corporation, James Bay Columbium Ltd. and Goldcorp Inc. (collectively the Vendors).  In consideration for acquiring the Project, MDN agreed to make a one-time cash payment of $25,000 and issue 5,000,000 common shares to the Vendors.  MDN's interest in the Project is subject to a 2% net smelter return (NSR) royalty with MDN having the right to buy-back half the  royalty  (1%)  at  any  time  for  $2,000,000  (in  constant  2016  dollars,  subject  to  a  cap  of $3,000,000).  The Vendors retained the right to re-acquire a 51% interest in the Project for 2.5 times MDN's expenditures should one or more deposits containing at least two million ounces of gold and/or gold equivalent ounces of resources in aggregate be established.  The back-in right  does not apply to the niobium content.  On June 28, 2016, MDN announced that the transaction had closed.  On September 2, 2016, MDN announced a name change to NioBay Metals Inc.

## 5 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE AND PHYSIOGRAPHY

## ACCESSIBILITY

The  Project  is  located  approximately  40  km  south  of  the  town  of  Moosonee  which  has  a population  of  1,725  according  to  the  2011  census.    Moosonee  is  connected  to  Cochrane, Ontario by the Ontario Northland Railway which provides six day a week passenger service and twice weekly freight service.  Moosonee also benefits from daily commercial flights from Timmins.  The Wetum winter road links Moose Factory to the provincial road system at Otter Rapids seasonally, approximately 149 km to the south.  Access to the Property is by helicopter year-round and bush roads from Moosonee during the winter months. Helicopters are available for charter in Timmins.

## CLIMATE

The Property lies within the James Bay Lowland ecoregion of the Hudson Bay Plain ecozone and is marked by brief and warm summers and cold and snowy winters.  The average mean daily temperature in July ranges from 12°C to 16°C and in January it hovers around -25°C to -23°C (Marshall and Schutt, 1999).

Despite  the  harsh  climatic  conditions,  geophysical  surveying  and  diamond  drilling  can  be performed on a year-round basis.  Geological mapping and geochemical sampling are typically restricted to the months of May through to October.

## LOCAL RESOURCES

Various services including temporary accommodations, medical services, a post office, fuel (gas  diesel  and  propane)  stations,  and  some  heavy  equipment  and  machinery  shops  are available in Moosonee.  A greater range of general services are available in Cochrane and specialized services including trained manpower and contractors are available in Timmins. Moosonee is connected to the provincial power grid system by a 115 kV high tension line from the 182 MW Otter Rapids generating station located on the Abitibi River, approximately midway between Cochrane and Moosonee.

## INFRASTRUCTURE

There is no permanent infrastructure on the Property except for the historical underground excavations which consist of a 133 ft (40.54 m) shaft and a 100 ft (30.5 m) crosscut.  The Property is located approximately 46 km east of the Ontario Northland Railway which links Cochrane to Moosonee.  Figure 5-1 illustrates the infrastructure in the vicinity of the Project.

## PHYSIOGRAPHY

The area is poorly drained, flat and dominated by extensive wetlands.  The elevation on the Property varies from approximately 35 MASL to 45 MASL.

Treed-open fen (28.6%) and treed-open bog (38.9%) comprise the primary vegetation found in  the  James  Bay  Lowland  ecoregion.    Coniferous  forest  is  the  predominant  forest  class (12.6%), with black spruce usually being the most dominant tree species, followed by sparse forest (7.6%).  Well-developed forests are usually limited to alongside rivers and creeks.  Open water covers 5.6% of the area (EEM Inc., 2017).

The region provides habitat for large mammals such as woodland caribou, moose, black bear, lynx, timber wolves, and small mammals including muskrat, ermine, weasel, marten, snowshoe hare,  and  wolverine.    Migratory  bird  species  returning  to  these  lowlands  annually  to  nest include Canada goose, black duck, oldsquaw, king eider, pintail, and whistling swan.  Upland

## 6 HISTORY

## PRIOR OWNERSHIP

Contiguous  mining  concessions  #13758,  #13759,  and  #13760  were  held  by  Consolidated Morrison Explorations Ltd. (Consolidated Morrison), Argor Explorations Ltd. (Argor Explorations), and Goldray Mines Ltd. (Goldray) as of 1965, respectively.  Ownership of these concessions  was  eventually  consolidated  and  held  by  Barrick  Gold  Corporation  (60%), Goldcorp Inc. (9%), and James Bay Columbium/Consolidated Morrison (31%).  In June 2016, NioBay entered into an agreement whereby it acquired a 100% interest in the Project, subject to a 2% NSR royalty.

## EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT HISTORY

The location of the early ground geophysical surveys and diamond drilling performed in the area of the current Mining Lease is not well documented.  Some of the surveys and drill holes mentioned below may in fact not be located on the current Mining Lease.

Historically, little interest had been shown in the James Bay region of northeastern Ontario by mining companies.  Some prospecting was done in the Partridge River area in 1929 and 1930. During  the  1950s,  a  thorium  prospect  was  discovered  in  Pitt  Township,  southwest  of  the Project.  Later Selco Exploration Inc. (Selco) made a reconnaissance survey along the French River for diamonds.  A subsidiary of de Beers, Hard Metals, continued the work initiated by Selco, with negative results (Boyko, 1966).

The following is taken primarily from Stockford (1970) unless otherwise indicated.

In 1965, a consortium of companies including Argor Explorations Limited (Argor Explorations), Consolidated  Morrison  Explorations  Limited  (Consolidated  Morrison),  and  Goldray  Mines Limited (Goldray) were awarded three licences of occupation, each covering 64,000 acres (25,900 ha) and covering some 60 miles in length by three to seven miles wide.  The initial financial support for the Project was provided by Imperial Oil Enterprises Ltd. which earned a 60% interest in the licence areas and claim holdings in the vicinity.

<!-- image -->

From  April  to  June  1965,  Canadian  Aero  Mineral  Surveys  Limited  (Canadian  Aero)  was contracted to fly a combined magnetic-electromagnetic (EM)-radiometric survey over an area including the licences of occupation held by Consolidated Morrison, Argor Explorations, and Goldray.  A total of approximately 3,059 line-km were flown at an azimuth of N045°W and at a nominal flight line spacing of approximately 400 m.  A total of 46 anomalous zones consisting of  clusters  of  individual  anomalies  of  various  intensities  and  magnetic  correlation  were detected, including three high priority areas (Wagg, 1966).

From  June  to  August  1965,  as  a  follow-up  to  the  airborne  survey,  a  helicopter-supported geological mapping program was carried out by Argor Explorations on behalf of the concession holders  to  establish  the  regional  geological  controls  and  investigate  the  cause  of  specific magnetic anomalies.

From June to October 1965, Huntec Limited (Huntec) was contracted to complete ground geophysical  surveys  over  several  airborne  geophysical  anomalies.    Geophysical  surveys consisted of vertical loop electromagnetic (VLEM), horizontal loop electromagnetic (HLEM), magnetic, and refraction seismics.  A total of 27 anomalies or anomaly complexes identified by these surveys were selected for diamond drill testing from 1965 to May 1969.  In total, 49 holes totalling 32,041 ft (9,765.6 m) were drilled.  A number of conductors were defined, two of which (the Alpha A and Gamma targets on the Consolidated Morrison concession) were recommended for drilling.  Additional geophysical surveying was recommended for several other targets prior to defining drill targets (Patterson and Lane, 1966).

One of the magnetic anomalies, the Alpha-B, was found to be caused by a niobium-bearing carbonatite complex.  In 1966, 18 holes were drilled and niobium mineralization was traced over a strike length of 7,800 ft (2,377 m).  An additional 67 holes were drilled in 1967, bringing the number of holes drilled to 85 for a total of 47,625 ft (14,514 m) in outlining the deposit to a maximum  depth  of  900  ft  (274.3  m).    Niobium  mineralization  was  encountered  between sections  8+00S  and  40+00N  but  the  mineralized  carbonatite  remained  open  to  the  north (Stockford, 1972).

Fifteen soil test holes were drilled during this period to investigate the stability of the glacial overburden and Paleozoic sedimentary cover, which together average approximately 100 ft (30.5 m) over the Precambrian basement.

<!-- image -->

In 1968, a test shaft was sunk in the central part of the mineralized body and a 250-ton bulk sample of niobium-bearing carbonatite was mined for metallurgical testing.  The shaft was sunk to 133 ft (40.54 m) and a 100 ft (30.5 m) crosscut was driven.

In 1967, Canadian Bechtel Limited (Bechtel) completed a preliminary mining appraisal on the Argor deposit.  The study considered three scenarios 1) mining the entire orebody by open pit, 2) mining the entire orebody by underground methods, and 3) mining the south end of the orebody by open pit followed by underground mining of the northwest limb.  The assessment of the three scenarios was based on annual tonnage sufficient to produce 7.5 million pounds of Nb2O5 for 20 years with an overall mill recovery of 75%.

From June to October 1968, Huntec completed approximately 87.5 ln-km of reconnaissance HLEM and ground magnetics in the area of the Goldray #2 anomaly.  Two distinct conductors were defined and recommended for diamond drilling (Patterson, 1969).

In 1969, McPhar Geophysics (McPhar) completed ground magnetic and EM surveys over five airborne anomalies on behalf of Argor Explorations.  Two strong conductors corresponding to Anomalies 'P' and 'G' were defined and recommended for drilling.

In early 1970, Bergmann (1970) reported on ground magnetic and electromagnetic surveys completed  by  Prospecting  Geophysics  Ltd.  (Prospecting  Geophysics)  to  recover  airborne geophysical anomalies on behalf of Argor Explorations.  Several conductors were identified and two (Anomalies 'A' and 'B') were recommended for drilling.

In late 1970, Questor Surveys Limited (Questor) flew a combined magnetic and EM (Mark IV INPUT) survey totalling approximately 264 ln-km on behalf of Argor Explorations over an area northwest of Kesagami Lake.  A total of 13 conductors were detected, most of which were recommended for either VLEM or HLEM follow-up (De Carle, 1970).

In 1979, Bechtel updated the feasibility study.

## HISTORICAL RESOURCE ESTIMATES

In  July  1967,  Bechtel  estimated  'geological  ore  reserves'  on  behalf  of  Argor  Explorations. Between  sections  6+00S  and  18+00N,  Bechtel  estimated  61,560,000  tons  grading  0.52% Nb2O5 for the pyrochlore and columbite mineralized zones (Canadian Bechtel Limited, 1967).

This estimate was prepared prior to the implementation of National Instrument 43-101 and is considered to be historical in nature and should not be relied upon.  A qualified person has not completed sufficient work to classify the historical estimate as a current Mineral Resource or Mineral  Reserve  and  NioBay  is  not  treating  the  historical  estimate  as  current  Mineral Resources or Mineral Reserves.  This historical estimate is a good indication of significant mineralization on the Property.

## PAST PRODUCTION

With the exception of the bulk sample taken in 1968, there has been no past production from the James Bay Niobium Project.

## 7 GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND MINERALIZATION

## REGIONAL GEOLOGY

According to Sage (1991), the James Bay Niobium Project lies at the northern portion of the Kapuskasing Structural Zone (KSZ).  The following description of the regional geology is taken from Sage (1991).

The KSZ extends from the east shore of Lake Superior northeast to James Bay.  The KSZ is poorly  defined  along the  east  shore  of  Lake  Superior  but  becomes  better  defined  towards James Bay.  The KSZ crosscuts an east-trending fabric within Archean rocks of the Superior Province and is sub-parallel to the Trans-Superior Tectonic Zone (TSTZ).

The KSZ is characterized by a north-northeast-striking linear aeromagnetic pattern (400 to 600 gammas above regional background) and positive gravity highs (up to 20 mgal) (Innis 1960; ODM-GSC 1970; GSC 1984).  Numerous alkalic and carbonatite intrusions occur along this structure.

The KSZ has been interpreted as an upwarp of the Conrad Discontinuity (Wilson and Brisbin 1965; Bennett et al. 1967; Thurston et al. 1977), a product of collision of the Churchill and Superior  cratons  in  Paleoproterozoic  time  (Gibb  1978),  and  as  a  deep  transcurrent  shear (Watson 1980).  More recently, Percival and Card (1983) have proposed that the KSZ is an east-verging  thrust  fault  which  has  exposed  an  oblique  section  through  20  km  of  uplifted Archean crust.  Granulite-facies rocks of the KSZ are juxtaposed against greenschist-facies rocks  of  the  Abitibi  Sub-province  along  the  Ivanhoe  Lake  cataclastic  zone.    The  KSZ  is characterized by a high-grade gneiss terrain and grades westward into a central gneiss terrain and then into  low-grade terrain  of  east-west-striking  linear  belts  composed  of  supracrustal rocks.

In addition to the major fault which forms the east boundary of the KSZ, three major northeaststriking faults dip 60° to 70° northwest and are present within the uplift (Percival and McGrath 1986).  These internal faults are west-side-down with displacement of 7 km to 10 km and result

<!-- image -->

from a late tensional event that followed the compressional uplift (Percival and McGrath 1986; Percival 1987).

Northey  and  West  (1986)  have  interpreted  seismic  refraction  data  to  indicate  a  crustal thickness  of  48  km  below  the  KSZ,  which  thins  slightly  to  the  west  and  the  east.    The interpretation of seismic data is consistent with the upthrust of mid-crustal rocks along a westdipping listric fault (Northey and West, 1986; Boland et al., 1988).

The precise age of the KSZ is uncertain (Watson 1980; Percival and Card 1983).  The 1,800 to 1,900 Ma carbonatite intrusions are exposed at a high structural level and are enclosed within high-grade deep level gneisses.  The KSZ has therefore formed prior to the 1,800 to 1,900 Ma carbonatite intrusion event; however, the KSZ remains seismically active (Forsyth and Morel, 1982).

Alkaline magmatism  along  the  KSZ  took  place  during  the  Penokean  and  GrenvilleKeweenawan orogenic  events  and  in  the  Neoproterozoic  to  Early  Cambrian  and  Jurassic periods.  Woolley (1989) has documented the worldwide spatial and temporal distribution of carbonatite with doming, linear structures, and orogenesis .

Figure 7-1 illustrates the regional geology of the KSZ and indicates the location of the James Bay Niobium Project (indicated as the Argor Carbonatite Complex #21).

## LOCAL GEOLOGY

The following description of the local geology is abridged from Sage (1988).

The James Bay niobium deposit is hosted by the Argor Carbonatite Complex and occurs in the  northern  portion  of  the  KSZ  of  the  Superior  Province.    Rocks  in  the  general  area  are characterized by granulite facies rank gneisses and a pervasive north- to northeast-trending fault pattern (Bennett et al., 1967).

The carbonatite complex is overlain by approximately 9 m of overburden and 21 m of Lower Devonian rocks of the Sextant Formation consisting of poorly bedded sandstone, mudstone, siltstone, and loosely cemented conglomerate (Stockford, 1972).

## EARLY PRECAMBRIAN (ARCHEAN)

## GNEISS

In  proximity  to  the  carbonatite  complex,  Stockford (1972) reported the presence of garnethornblende-feldspar gneiss and augen gneiss.  The gneisses contain up to 20% quartz, up to 50% plagioclase, 10% to 15% biotite, 10% to 20% hornblende, 5% sericite, and 5% carbonate (Stockford,  1970).    Stockford  observed  that  nepheline-bearing  rocks  and  evidence  of fenitization  are  absent.  The  reported  presence  of  carbonate  and  possibly  sericite  in  the gneisses suggests some weakly developed metasomatic activity.

Twyman (1983) reported the presence of fine to medium grained, light grey syenitic dykes with a phaneritic to porphyritic-phaneritic  texture.  The  feldspars  are  microcline  perthite  or orthoclase and albite.  Calcite occurs interstitially to the feldspars.  The mafic minerals reported by  Twyman  include  biotite,  pyroxene  (salite  to  sodic  salite),  and  local  arfvedsonite.    The relationship of the syenite to the carbonatite is unknown, but Twyman (1983) considered it to be older than the complex.

## GABBRO DYKES

Stockford (1972) reported that gabbroic dykes cutting the gneisses east of the carbonatite complex appear to have been crushed and metamorphosed along with the gneisses.  He reported that the dykes consist of plagioclase, feldspar, hornblende, augite and garnet, with accessory apatite, sphene, quartz, chlorite, calcite, pyrite, and magnetite.  Stockford (1970) reported  that  the  mode  of  the  gabbro  dykes  is  30%  to  35%  plagioclase,  30%  to  40%

<!-- image -->

hornblende, 10% to 15% augite, and up to 25% garnet.  A lamprophyre dyke was reported in drill core by Stockford (1972), although he stated that lamprophyres are uncommon in the area.

## MIDDLE PRECAMBRIAN (PROTEROZOIC) - ARGOR CARBONATITE COMPLEX

## PYROXENITE-HORNBLENDITE

This phase of the Argor Carbonatite Complex is not well represented in the drill core examined. Hornblende is dominant over clinopyroxene and the pyroxenite and hornblendite appear to grade  into  each  other.    While  some  hornblende  is  undoubtedly  primary,  other  hornblende clearly formed as a replacement of the clinopyroxene.  The pyroxenite and hornblendite are likely part of the same lithologic unit and part of the same magmatic phase.  Because of the intimate relationship between the two rock types, they are discussed as one unit.  Stockford (1972)  described  the  unit  as  pyroxenite  and  he  also  interpreted  the  hornblendite  to  have formed by alteration of the pyroxene.  Pyroxenite-hornblendite drill core is black to dark green in colour.

In thin section the rock is fine to coarse  grained, massive, inequigranular seriate, allotriomorphic, with straight to curved grain boundaries.  Several specimens have a weakly developed granoblastic texture and several appear to have been weakly deformed.

## SILICOCARBONATITE

The limited number of silicocarbonatite specimens examined appear to be possible cumulate phases of the carbonatite magma, however, some may be reaction products between sovite and other rocks.  Drill core representative of this lithology is grey in colour or mottled grey and black.

Samples from the western side of the complex were described by Twyman (1983) as hybrid rocks with mylonitic fabric and are likely silicocarbonatite.  Twyman investigated the possibility of a genetic link between carbonate and silicate magmas.  On the basis of observed mineral disequilibrium, Twyman concluded the silicocarbonatite rocks examined by him were the result of  assimilation  or  reaction  of  carbonatite  magma  with  the  enclosing  rocks.    Microprobe analyses of biotite indicated Al content intermediate between silicate and carbonatite rocks; microprobe analyses of amphibole indicated high Fe content which would have resulted from reaction with a carbonatite magma.

<!-- image -->

## SOVITE AND MINOR RAUHAUGITE

Sovite  contains  in  excess  of  50%  carbonate.    The  vast  majority  of  the  diamond  drilling completed  on  this  complex  intersected  this  lithology  since  it  is  host  to  the  niobium mineralization.  Rocks of this grouping are grey to white in colour.  No attempt was made to estimate the dolomite-calcite ratios in these rocks.

Twyman (1983) reported dolomite (rauhaugite) interstitial to calcite (sovite), implying that both carbonates crystallized simultaneously or that dolomite formed somewhat later.  Two types of dolomite were reported by Twyman (1983): (1) a lineated variety composed of clear, anhedral to  subhedral,  elongated,  interlocking  tabular  crystals;  and  (2)  a  fine  grained  recrystallized variety with irregular grain boundaries. The lineated variety is interlayered with the sovite and the fine-grained variety occurs along intrusive contacts.

Microprobe analyses of carbonate, presented by Twyman (1983), indicate that dolomite at the Argor Carbonatite Complex has a Mn enrichment trend while dolomite at the Cargill complex displays a constant Mn content.  At both complexes, the carbonate contains minor Mg, Fe, Mn and Sr, but the Argor rocks are richer in Fe.  Twyman reported that the Fe enrichment trends in dolomite are compatible with chemical variations in associated amphiboles and biotites.

The minor element trends in dolomite within sovites and rauhaugites are similar, indicating that the sovites and rauhaugites formed at the same time (Twyman, 1983).

Stockford (1972) subdivided rocks in this group into five subunits based on texture, colour, and calcite-dolomite ratios.  Stockford's (1972) efforts were directed to close identification of the pyrochlore-bearing carbonatite.  While the pyrochlore is the essential economic mineral, it is nonetheless a minor accessory phase within the rock.  Stockford (1972) places the pyrochlore content  at  1.0%  for  the  potentially  economic  portion  of  the  carbonatite.  Texturally  or mineralogically, there is no difference between sovite with and without pyrochlore.

Twyman (1983) reported the presence of olivine sovite and provided a chemical analysis of this rock type.  The olivine sovite occurs only on the western side of the complex, does not occur with dolomite, and has been interpreted to be an early phase of the carbonatite magma.

Pyrochlore occurs as anhedral to sharply euhedral grains that commonly contain rounded, irregular grains of carbonate.  The mineral is red-brown to grey in colour. Its high relief and

<!-- image -->

isotropic nature make it relatively easy to distinguish from other minor mineral phases.  The mineral often appears crudely zoned from red-brown cores to grey rims, however, the reverse zoning pattern has also been observed.  The zonation implies compositional variation.

## GEOCHRONOLOGY

The Argor Carbonatite Complex has been dated at 1655 Ma by K-Ar isotopic techniques on biotite (Gittins et al., 1967). Most Middle Precambrian (Proterozoic) complexes have isotopic ages of 1,800 Ma.

## METAMORPHISM

The Argor Carbonatite Complex displays all variations, from a well-developed granoblastic texture with curved grain boundaries typical of carbonatite rocks, to one that is very fine to finegrained  recrystallized with serrate to lobate grain boundaries.  Relatively undeformed carbonate alternates with deformed carbonate, suggesting that deformation and recrystallization has occurred in zones within the carbonatite, likely due to dynamo-thermal metamorphism associated with fault movement.

Stockford (1972) reported the absence of fenitization presumably on the basis of the absence of green to blue-green soda-iron amphiboles and pyroxenes within the enclosing gneissic wall rocks.  The presence of carbonate, the alteration of pyroxene to amphibole and amphibole to biotite-phlogopite  in  the  pyroxenite  rocks,  is  interpreted  to  represent  metasomatism  of  the pyroxenite by alkali-rich, aqueous, carbonate-rich fluids similar, if not identical, to a fenitizing liquid.  The pyroxenite is, however, an early crystallizing phase of the carbonatite complex and not part of the much older wall rock assemblage.

Stockford  (1972)  reported  the  presence  of  sodic  amphiboles  in  a  mylonitic  gneiss  at  the pyroxenite-gneiss contact on the east side of the complex.  These sodic amphiboles may be indicative of more typical fenitization developed within restricted zones of greater permeability. Carbonate  along  fractures  in  the  gneisses  was  reported  by  Stockford  (1972)  to  occur  for distances of up to a few hundred metres from the carbonatite contact.  This is considered by Sage (1988) to be due to either the effect of a fenitizing liquid in a distal setting, or to a fenitizing fluid at relatively low temperatures, in essence, under hydrothermal conditions.

## STRUCTURAL GEOLOGY

## REGIONAL SETTING

The Argor Carbonatite Complex is located in the north portion of the KSZ of the Superior Province  of  the  Canadian  Shield.    This  KSZ  is  characterized  geophysically  by  a  north northeast-trending zone of gravity highs and pronounced linear aeromagnetic trends (Innes 1960; ODM-GSC 1970).  This anomalous gravity zone has been interpreted to be due to an upwarp in the Conrad discontinuity caused by major regional faulting and the formation of a complex horst structure (Wilson and Brisbin, 1965; Bennett et al., 1967).  This upthrown block is characterized by rocks that have locally reached the granulite facies rank of metamorphism (Bennett et al, . 1967; Thurston et al., 1977).

The KSZ has been interpreted by Percival and Card (1983) to be an oblique section through 20 km of the Archean crust.  The structural zone has been uplifted along a northeast-striking, northwest-dipping thrust fault.  Along the east side of the structural zone, high-grade rocks are thrust against low-grade rocks.  To the west, the high-grade rocks grade into low-grade rocks over a distance exceeding 100 km.  Thrusting has exposed the Conrad Discontinuity within the KSZ (Percival, 1986).

## LOCAL STRUCTURES

Stockford (1972) indicated that the Argor Carbonatite Complex was emplaced into a series of northeast- and north-trending faults.  The enclosing gneisses are described as mylonitic or augen gneisses and minor faulting along the east contact has been reported (Stockford, 1972). Stockford (1972) indicated the Argor Carbonatite Complex to be a dyke-like body with a long axis striking north.

The body occurs in a north-trending fault zone, north of the junction of a northeast- and a northtrending zone of faulting.  The intrusion has not been totally delineated in strike length.  It is known to be approximately 1,440 m long and remains open to the north.  The complex appears to  have a minimum width of approximately 360 m in the area of pyrochlore mineralization. Pyrochlore mineralization has been identified to a maximum depth of 270 m.  The zone of pyrochlore mineralization occurs in the southern portion of the complex and, in plan view, it covers a maximum area approximately 900 m long and 180 m wide.

It is unknown whether the complex was originally emplaced as a dyke-like body or as a more circular  stock  typical  of  most  carbonatite  intrusions,  and  then  subjected  to  faulting  and deformation to produce its present shape.

Sage (1988) suspects that the body may have originally been more elliptical in shape with its long axis parallel to the faults that controlled its emplacement.  This elliptical shape has been modified to a dyke-like plan view by subsequent fault movements.

The carbonatite displays a mineralogical variation which imparts a banding to the rock. In addition, the elongate minerals, amphibole and apatite, have their long axes subparallel to each other and define a lineation in the plane of the banding.  The attitude of the banding is steep to vertical and contacts appear conformable (Stockford, 1972).

Stockford (1972) reported a zone of crushed dolomitic carbonatite (Zone 8) in the approximate centre  of  the  carbonate  phase  of  the  complex.    This  zone  of  crushed  dolomitic  carbonate consists of crushed and recrystallized carbonate in a turbid groundmass of carbonate, chlorite, and  hematite  (Stockford,  1972).    He  reported  that  accessory  apatite,  feldspar,  pyrite,  and pyrochlore-columbite are also present.  Amphibole crystals within this rock unit are contorted and minor molybdenite has been recognized (Stockford, 1972).

Stockford (1972) has interpreted the deformation textures to be the result of the pulsating emplacement of the carbonatite magma as a crystal mush.  The Argor Carbonatite Complex has been emplaced into a fault zone as have nearly all of the other carbonatite complexes of this age group.  According to Sage (1988), most Proterozoic complexes occur in rocks cut by faults and display evidence of deformation and recrystallization.  Sage (1988) considers the deformation-recrystallization textures to be due to dynamo-thermal metamorphism associated with fault movement subsequent to emplacement and crystallization.

Based on its re-logging of the historical core, NioBay is of the opinion that the carbonatite is undeformed and that the deformation textures reported in the literature are related to magmatic processes and events (Gauthier, 2017, pers. comm.).

## PROPERTY GEOLOGY

A more detailed description of the lithologies found in the immediate vicinity of the deposit are taken from Stockford (1972).  A property geology map, showing the lithologies, is provided in Figure 7-2.

## PYROXENITE (UNIT NO. 1)

Pyroxenite is a medium to coarsely crystalline, dark green ultramafic rock which appears to have  been  the  earliest  intrusive  phase  in  the  complex.    The  field  terms,  'pyroxenite'  or 'hornblendite',  have  generally  been  used,  although  the  original  composition  was  probably pyroxenitic.

Mineralogically, it consists of hornblende, diopside and augite, coarse biotite after hornblende, and  variable  calcite.    Accessory  minerals  include  sphene,  apatite,  coarse  titaniferous magnetite, and minor sulphides (1% to 2% pyrite and pyrrhotite with occasional chalcopyrite). Zircon  is  fairly  common,  particularly  where  the  carbonate  content  increases.    Thin-section studies indicate that hornblende is often secondary after pyroxene, occurring as uralitic rims and cleavage replacements, although much of the amphibole is clearly primary as well.

Pyroxenite is interbanded with barren carbonatite along the west side of the complex.  A narrow band also extends between mineralized carbonatite and mylonitic gneiss along the southeast boundary from 8+00S to 00+00.  Boundaries of the pyroxenite have not yet been delimited to the north, south, and west of the niobium-bearing carbonatite.

At least one age of barren, calcitic carbonatite (Unit No. 2) has invaded the pyroxenite and consequently all combinations between massive pyroxenite and massive carbonatite and their mixed counterparts are seen in the complex.

Frequent inclusions and bands of hybrid material are apparent within the pyroxenite and barren carbonatite phases.  These hybrid zones, which consist of pink or grey feldspar, biotite mica and carbonate, are presumed to be xenoliths of gneissic country rock, partially digested by the intrusive  magma.    Additional  petrographic  work  is  required  to  determine  the  detailed mineralogy of this type of material.

## AMPHIBOLE-BIOTITE CARBONATITE (UNITS NO. 2 AND 9)

Intrusion of the first carbonatite phase followed the pyroxenite.  Brecciation and veining of the pyroxenite by carbonate support this theory.  The primary constituent of the rock is calcite (generally  60%  to  80%)  with  variable  quantities  of  the  following  minerals:  5%  to  10% hornblende, 5% to 15% pale green apatite, 2% to 10% titaniferous magnetite, 2% to 15% biotite, 1% to 2% pyrrhotite, up to 1% zircon and occasional olivine.

The amphibole-biotite carbonatite is white to grey, coarsely crystalline and massive to well banded.  Rolled crystal aggregates of carbonatite enclosed in a carbonate groundmass are thought to be indicative of pulsating movement during periods of intrusion and cooling.

Rock Unit No. 9 is interpreted as being a contact phase between Units 2 and 5 along the western boundary of the pyrochlore zone and in the centre of the intrusive north of section 4+00N.  This phase appears to have been subjected to soda metasomatism and contains soda amphibole instead of hornblende and phlogopite in place of biotite.  The unit is distinctly pinkish or  mauve-grey in colour,  coarser grained  and  contains  scattered grains  of  dark  red-brown pyrochlore. This unit, which rarely grades more than 0.20% Nb2O5, could alternatively be a separate intrusive carbonatite phase.

Partial  sideritization  of  the  carbonate  and  chloritization  of  ferromagnesian  minerals  has occurred near the Precambrian surface.

## GNEISS (UNIT NO. 3)

Only the eastern gneiss-carbonatite contact has been outlined to the south of section l0+00N; both east and west contacts have been intersected to the north.  The country gneisses consist of  quartz,  plagioclase  feldspar,  hornblende  and  biotite-chlorite,  with  accessory  amounts  of sericite, carbonate, magnetite, zircon, sphene, apatite, epidote, and garnet.  Minor pyrite and pyrrhotite have also been noted.

A narrow zone of chloritized gneiss extends along the eastern contact of the carbonatite from 00+00 to 16+00N.  Minor faulting along this contact appears to have caused some fracturing of the eastern limb of the carbonatite in this area.  There is local evidence of intense crushing and mylonitization of the gneiss, with local well-developed augen textures.  It is unlikely that the augen textures would have been produced by intrusion of the carbonatite; it seems more probable that these structures were already in existence before intrusion.

<!-- image -->

Most of the carbonate in the gneisses occupies minute fractures extending for several hundred feet away from the carbonatite contact.

## METAGABBRO (UNIT NO. 4)

Dykes of gabbroic composition are found to the east of the carbonatite intrusion within the gneisses.  Knowledge of these dykes is limited due to lack of detailed drilling, however, they generally appear to have been metamorphosed and crushed along with the gneisses.

The main constituents are plagioclase feldspar, hornblende, augite, and 5% to 2·5% garnet. Accessory minerals include apatite, sphene, quartz, chlorite, calcite, pyrite, and magnetite. Notably absent in the country rocks are lamprophyre dykes which are commonly associated with carbonatites, although one isolated occurrence was noted in a drill hole 2.4 km north of the main anomaly.

## PYROCHLORE CARBONATITE (UNITS NO. 5 TO 8)

Rock Units 5 through 8, described in the following paragraphs, constitute the main pyrochlorebearing carbonatite.  The various rock units reflect the different textures and compositions of the carbonate hosts encountered in drill core.  As such they indicate mappable units containing fairly predictable niobium grades and possibly represent several different ages of carbonatite intrusion.

Thin sections indicate that the carbonate in Unit 5 is clear and unstrained, although distinctly lineated parallel to the dip and strike of the contacts.  It is most likely that this lineated, dolomitic unit is the contact zone between Units No. 2 and No. 6, along the east and west margins of the pyrochlore zone and between No. 6 and No. 8 in the centre of the mass.  The mineral constituents of the rock are 60% to 80% pale grey, medium to coarse-grained dolomite, 5% to 10% sodic amphibole (riebeckite),  5% to  15%  apatite,  5% to  10%  phlogopite,  2%  to  15% magnetite,  1%  to  2%  pyrrhotite,  and  0.5%  to  1%  pyrochlore,  with  occasional  epidote  and zircon.

The host dolomite occurs as elongated crystals which, together with parallel orientation of riebeckite, apatite, and mica, impart the distinct wavy lineation to the rock.

<!-- image -->

Sideritization has taken place along the surface of the carbonatite.  It is visualized as a layer of varying depth - up to three metres in the test shaft - which has been affected by groundwater and oxidation.  The source of secondary iron appears to have been the ferruginous sediments above and/or magnetite in the dolomitic host rock.  The dolomite has presumably been stained and partially replaced by siderite, particularly along fracture planes.  There is no evidence in underground exposures to suggest a separate primary mass of siderite.

The pyrochlore content in this rock is usually uniform, with grades averaging between 0.3% and 0.5% Nb2O5, and is generally the pale honey-coloured variety occurring as octahedra 0.1 mm to 4.0 mm in size.  The heart of the intrusion appears to be a solidified mush of medium to  coarse-grained  brecciated  carbonatite  (Unit  No.  6),  so-called  because  of  the  frequent occurrence of rolled crystalline aggregates of carbonate rock within a carbonate groundmass. The unit  consists  of  50%  to  70%  grey  to  pinkish,  mixed  calcite  and  dolomite,  5%  to  15% riebeckite, 5% to 15% phlogopite, 2% to 10% magnetite (hematite along east side of deposit), 5% to 20% apatite, 1% to 2% pyrrhotite, 0.5% to 3% pyrochlore, and up to 3% zircon.  This rock type is the host for the best grade of columbium mineralization, with assays ranging up to a maximum of nearly 3% Nb2O5 over three metres.  Segregation of accessory minerals into wavy bands is a feature of the rock, although the lineation is less distinct than in the dolomitic type (Unit No. 5).  Pyrochlore is generally light to dark brown in colour and individual crystals frequently exhibit internal zoning.  Pyrochlore is generally accompanied by riebeckite, although many exceptions to this rule have been found.  Crystals range in size from 0.2 cm to 2.0 cm and  are  easily  identified  by  their  resinous  lustre  and  octahedral  crystal  form,  sometimes modified by cube faces.

Almost massive concentrations of mica appear locally as rolled blocks or inclusions up to a few metres across.  Where feldspar is present, these have been termed "hybrid zones" and are possibly remnant xenoliths of country rock, as seen in rock Unit No. 2.

Bands of medium to coarse-grained sovite (Unit No. 7), which are almost lacking in riebeckite and magnetite, have been identified as distinct units within rock Unit No. 6.  The pyrochlore content is erratic and normally low in tenor.  The massive sovite contains between 5% and 10% apatite and 0 to 15% coarse phlogopite.

A disturbed and crushed dolomitic zone (Unit No. 8), interpreted as being the final phase of intrusion,  is  the  most  difficult  rock  unit  to  correlate  between  drill  holes.    However,  it  could

<!-- image -->

represent the central core of the original intrusive which has been squeezed, recrystallized, and hydrothermally altered.  The mineral assemblage in the unit is quite different from other phases within the complex.  It consists mainly of crushed, coarsely recrystallized dolomite enclosed  in  a  dirty  groundmass  of  fine  carbonate,  chlorite  and,  locally,  hematite  and  is generally low in sodic amphibole content.  Accessory minerals include apatite, feldspar, and pyrite, with erratic pyrochlore and/or columbite and scattered molybdenite.

Figures  7-3  and  7-4  illustrate  geological  sections  with  composite  intersection  grades  for Sections 0+00 and 8+00N, respectively.

## MINERALIZATION

The following is taken from Stockford (1972).

## PYROCHLORE

Pyrochlore, the main mineral of economic interest, occurs as discrete octahedral crystals in carbonatite.  It  is  usually  accompanied  by,  and  sometimes  enclosed  in,  apatite,  riebeckite, magnetite, and phlogopite.  Although these accompanying minerals seem to be essential to pyrochlore occurrences when considering the carbonatite as a whole, the columbium mineral does occur locally on its own, within a pure carbonate host.

Pyrochlore varies in colour from a pale honey to dark brown or reddish, and frequently displays spectacular zoning.  Preliminary electron-microprobe studies by Dr. J. Gittins at the University of  Toronto  were  carried  out  on  seven  pyrochlore  crystals  to  determine  the  difference  in composition  of  various  zones,  if  any.    He  found  that  the  most  striking  features  were  the compositional  simplicity,  homogeneity  despite  the  colour  variation  and  the  absence  of tantalum.  Some of the darker areas were assumed to be iron-rich, but further work is required to verify this fact.

The microprobe studies indicate that the pyrochlore ranges in composition from 57% to 65% Nb2O5 and contains minor quantities of the following compounds: 0.8% to 2.0% TiO2; 0 to 0.4% FeO; 0.01% to 4.0% Al2O3; 13% to 16% CaO; 6% to 14% Na2O.  Most of the crystals were found  to  contain  Ce  (0.5%  Ce2O3)  and  half  contained  La  (0.04%  La2O3).  Other  elements searched for but not detected were U, Th, Zr, Ta, Ba, Eu, and Sr.  Historical ore dressing tests on the core and bulk sample indicated that a concentrate averaging 64% Nb2O5 could be produced from the deposit.

## COLUMBITE

Columbite, FeNb2O6, occurs along the eastern side of the deposit and in the transgressive crushed dolomite zone between sections 4+00N and 8+00N.  The mineral totally or partially pseudomorphs pyrochlore and is typically earthy and dark brown to black in colour.  Individual crystals of pyrochlore have been replaced by columbite in various ways - central cores, inner zones, outer rims, or total crystals.  Columbite is not restricted to any one rock unit within the complex, but appears to be associated with fracturing and hematitic alteration.

<!-- image -->

## APATITE

The  pale  green,  fluor-variety  of  apatite  is  universally  present  in  all  rock  units  within  the carbonatite-pyroxenite complex.  Usually, the best-grade bands of pyrochlore carbonatite also contain  abnormally  high  quantities  of  apatite,  while  the  converse  is  not  true.    The  mineral occurs  as  fine  to  coarse-grained,  hexagonal  prisms  aligned  parallel  to  the  wavy  foliation. Assays for phosphate content from cross-cut samples indicated an apatite range of 6% to 10%.

## MAGNETITE

Titaniferous magnetite, like apatite, is present in all units within the intrusive, and also in the gneissic country rocks to a lesser degree.  It is most abundant in the pyroxenitic phase (No. 1) and in the barren carbonatite (No. 2); the magnetite content of the pyrochlore zone rarely exceeds  5%.  Hematite  or  martite  are  dominant  over  magnetite  along  the  east  side  of  the deposit and in brecciated sections of the crushed dolomite zone in association with minor, latestage quartz.

Submicroscopic hydrothermal hematite could also account for the reddish colouring observed in some of the mylonitic gneisses.

## SULPHIDES

Up  to  2%  primary  pyrrhotite  is  evenly  distributed  throughout  all  intrusive  units  with  the exception of the crushed dolomite zone, where pyrite is dominant.  Molybdenite occurs only in the crushed dolomite (No. 8), as discrete, scaley grains, in sub-economic quantities.  Both molybdenite and pyrite may have been primary constituents of the last intrusive phase, or they could represent a later stage of hydrothermal mineralization.

Chalcopyrite,  of  minor  importance,  occurs  in  the  pyroxenite  in  association  with  pyrite  and pyrrhotite.

## 8 DEPOSIT TYPES

The following is taken from Richardson and Birkett (1996).

Carbonatite-associated deposits include a variety of mineral deposits that occur both within and  in close spatial association with carbonatites and  related alkalic silicate rocks. Carbonatite-associated  deposits  are  mined  for  rare-earth  elements  (REEs),  niobium,  iron, copper, apatite, vermiculite, and fluorite.  By-products include barite, zircon, or baddeleyite, tantalum, uranium, platinum group elements, silver, and gold.  In some complexes, calcite-rich carbonatite is mined as a source of lime to produce Portland cement.

Carbonatites are igneous rocks which contain at least 50% modal carbonate minerals, mainly calcite,  dolomite,  ankerite,  or  sodium-  and  potassium-bearing  carbonates.    Other  minerals commonly present include diopside, sodic pyroxenes or amphiboles, phlogopite, apatite, and olivine.  A large number of rare or exotic minerals also occur in carbonatites.

Carbonatites occur mainly as intrusive bodies of generally modest dimensions (as much as a few tens of square kilometres) and to a lesser extent as volcanic rocks which are associated with a wide range of alkalic silicate rocks (syenites, nepheline syenites, nephelinites, ijolites, urtites, pyroxenites, etc.). Carbonatites  are generally surrounded  by  an  aureole  of metasomatically altered rocks called fenites produced by the reaction of country rocks with peralkaline fluids released from the carbonatite complex.

Carbonatite-associated deposits can be subdivided into magmatic and metasomatic types. Magmatic  deposits  are  formed  through  processes  associated  with  the  crystallization  of carbonatites, whereas metasomatic deposits form by the reaction of fluids released during crystallization with pre-existing carbonatite or country rocks.

Many carbonatite-associated deposits are relatively small, in the order of tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of tonnes, however, significant production of phosphate, niobium, and rare earth oxides is derived from larger, higher grade deposits in Brazil, Canada and South Africa, which vary greatly in size and grade.

<!-- image -->

Most  carbonatite  complexes  occur  in  relatively  stable,  intra-plate  areas.  The  regional distribution of these complexes is controlled by major tectonic features.  About half the known carbonatites are located in topographic highs or domes and are bounded by zones of crustalscale faulting (Wooley, 1989).  Other major controls on carbonatite emplacement are major faults, anorogenic rifts, and the intersection of major faults.  A few carbonatites are found near plate  margins  and  may  be  linked  with  orogenic  activity  or  plate  separation.    Because carbonatites generally occur in clusters or in provinces that display episodic magmatic activity, physical  and/or  chemical  properties  of  lithospheric  plates  may  exert  some  control  on  their location and genesis (Wooley, 1989).

There appears to have been a gradual increase in carbonatite magmatism with time.  Dates fall  into  groups  that  generally  correspond  to  major  orogenic  and  tectonic  events  (Wooley, 1989).    Identified  age  groups  include;  1)  a  mid-Proterozoic  group  (1,800-1,550  Ma)  that corresponds to the Hudsonian and Svecokarelian orogenies in North America and Europe, respectively; 2) a mid- to late Proterozoic group corresponding to the Grenville orogeny (peak at ca. 1,100 Ma); 3) a group between 750 Ma and 500 Ma, and 4) a major period starting at 200 Ma.  A few carbonatites of Archean age are known.

Carbonatites  may  consist  of  a  number  of  intrusive  phases  with  different  textural  and mineralogical characteristics.  Early phases typically consist mainly of calcite, do not contain peralkaline pyroxenes or amphiboles, and contain associated apatite + magnetite ± pyrochlore mineralization.  Later phases, which may contain dolomite, ankerite and siderite, in addition to calcite, are commonly enriched in pyrochlore.  Many very late stage carbonatites contain only trace, or no, Nb mineralization and are enriched in primary REE-bearing minerals.

Economic  mineralization  in  carbonatites  is  generally  associated  with  plutonic  carbonatite phases, not with lavas.  Magmatic carbonatite deposits generally occur in small (3 km to 5 km) plug-like and cressentic bodies in composite plutons with coeval silica-undersaturated mafic and/or ultramafic rocks.  Mineralization is commonly related to magmatic layering, and flow structures with the host rocks.  The deposits are commonly groups of lenses or irregular ore shoots  that,  in  plan,  have  crescent-shaped  or  annular  forms.    In  section,  these  deposits generally have steep dips, parallel to the walls of the intrusive complex, and may extend to great depths.

## www.rpacan.com

Metasomatic carbonatite deposits typically have the form of 1) dykes and dilatant veins of ankerite or dolomite, with or without calcite; 2) thin hydrothermal veins; 3) stockworks, and 4) replacement bodies rich in calcite and dolomite or ankerite.  Veins and dykes which locally form  radial  or  annular  patterns,  commonly  crosscut  consanguineous  fenitized  alkaline lithologies and adjacent country rocks.

## 9 EXPLORATION

NioBay recovered all historical drill logs, collar survey data, historical assay certificates, and vertical drill sections with assays and geological interpretation from the archives of James Bay Columbium Ltd., one of the previous owners of the Property.  All the existing historical drill core was stored in a secure building in Moosonee.

During the fall of 2016, NioBay undertook a program of core re-logging and check sampling to confirm the historical results on the Property.

NioBay selected two holes on each of six vertical sections located at 400 ft spacing for a total of  twelve  holes  for  the  re-logging  and  check  sampling  study.    The  sections  involved  are Sections 400S, 00, 400N, 800N, 1200N, and 1600N.  NioBay re-analyzed all of the remaining core, with the exception of a 3 inch character sample for each sampled interval.  Samples were typically 10 ft in length with some samples measuring not less than 5 ft.  In some instances, previous sampling for metallurgical testing during the 1960s left only 25% of the split core available for re-assaying.

A  total  of  629  samples,  exclusive  of  blanks  and  Certified  Reference  Material  (CRM  or standards), were taken for analysis

Table 9-1 illustrates the composite results of the original sampling and the results of the check sampling for the corresponding intervals.

## 11 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND SECURITY

The  core  from  the  historical  drilling  on  the  Property  was  continuously  stored  in  a  secure building in Moosonee.

Samples  taken  during  the  2016  check  sampling  program  were  bagged  on  site  and  were assigned a unique sample number.  The samples were first transported on two stretch wrapped pallets  by  NioBay  personnel  to  NioBay's  warehouse  in  Montreal  where  standards  were inserted  into  the  sample  sequence.    The  samples  were  then  bagged,  stretch  wrapped  on pallets, and sent directly to SGS Minerals in Lakefield, Ontario, by courier for processing and analysis.    SGS  Minerals  in  Lakefield  is  Accredited  Laboratory  No.  184  and  conforms  with requirements of CAN-P-1579, CAN-P-4E (ISO/TEC 17025:2005).

At Lakefield, core samples were dried and weighed, then crushed to 90% passing 2 mm, split into representative sub-samples using a riffle (or rotary) splitter, dry screened to -180 mesh and  a  500  g  sample  pulverized  to  85%  passing  75  microns  according  to  SGS  sample preparation code PRP91.

Samples were routinely analyzed for a suite of 12 major oxides including Al2O3, CaO, Cr2O3, K2O, MgO, MnO, Na2O, P2O5, Fe2O3, SiO2, TiO2 and V2O5 and loss on ignition (LOI) as well as Nb2O5.  Analyses were done by the borate fusion/X-ray fluorescence (XRF) method (SGS lab code GO XRF76V).

NioBay and RPA are independent of SGS Minerals.

In RPA's opinion, the sample preparation, analysis, and security procedures at the James Bay Niobium Project are adequate for use in the estimation of Mineral Resources.

## QUALITY ASSURANCE AND QUALITY CONTROL

In  2016,  NioBay  initiated  a  Quality  Assurance  and  Quality  Control  (QA/QC)  program  that includes the systematic use of CRMs and blanks.  No field, coarse reject, or pulp duplicate

<!-- image -->

samples were collected during the 2016 check sampling program. RPA is unaware of QA/QC results collected by previous operators.

## BLANKS

The  regular  submission  of  blank  material  is  used  to  assess  contamination  during  sample preparation and to identify sample numbering errors.  NioBay's QA/QC protocol calls for blanks to be inserted into the sample stream at a rate of approximately 1 in 20.

The  blank  material  used  by  NioBay  consisted  of  decorative  calcite  acquired  from  a  local hardware store in Moosonee which was expected to have a very low Nb2O5 content.

RPA received results for 28 analyses of blanks.  All the blanks from 11 of the 12 holes analyzed returned values of less than 0.01% Nb2O5.  Four of the five blanks from hole 66-2 returned values  ranging  from  0.05%  Nb2O5  to  0.94%  Nb2O5  suggesting  either  contamination  at  the laboratory or, more likely, sample mis-numbering.  RPA recommends that NioBay investigate the associated sample batches from hole 66-2 and reanalyze if necessary.

## CERTIFIED REFERENCE MATERIAL (STANDARDS)

Results for the regular submission of CRMs are used to identify issues with specific sample batches and long-term biases associated with the regular assay laboratory.

NioBay  acquired  two  non-certified  standards  from  GéoMéga  Resources  Inc.  (GéoMéga). GéoMéga is in the process of developing the Montviel REE-Nb deposit located approximately 125  km  north-northeast  of  Lebel-sur-Quévillon,  Québec  and  developed  in-house  standard material for its internal purposes.

Table 11-1 documents the composition of the standards acquired from GéoMéga.

## TABLE 11-1   STANDARDS

## NioBay Metals Inc. - James Bay Niobium Project

|                    |   Low Standard (S4)  Nb  (ppm) |   High Standard (S5)  Nb  (%) |
|--------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Mean               |                          75.36 |                       0.845   |
| Variance           |                           2.43 |                       2.5e-05 |
| Std. Dev. (S)      |                           1.56 |                       0.005   |
| Rel. Std. Dev. (%) |                           2.07 |                       0.59    |

The  results  for  24  of  the  27  standards  were  reasonable,  however,  three  standards  show significant differences from the expected value.  RPA recommends that NioBay investigate the associated sample batches and reanalyze if necessary.

## ENHANCEMENTS TO QA/QC PROGRAM

RPA recommends several enhancements to the QA/QC protocol for use during the drilling programs recommended in this report including the acquisition of certified standards and blank material.

Furthermore,  RPA  recommends  including  the  regular  submission  of  pulp  duplicates  to  an alternative  laboratory  and  a  temporary  coarse  reject  duplicate  analysis  program.    NioBay should also implement a QA data monitoring system used to detect failed batches, and in turn, identify sample batches for reanalysis.

Pulp duplicates are submitted to a second laboratory to make an additional assessment of laboratory bias.  The primary laboratory should be instructed to prepare one pulp duplicate for every 50 samples.  These should be forwarded to an alternative laboratory for analysis using similar digestion and analysis methods as used by primary laboratory.

Reject duplicates consist of a second split of the crushed sample, and should be prepared and analyzed at the primary laboratory.  The split should be taken using the same method and have the same weight as the original sample.  RPA recommends an initial test program of 50 reject duplicates of samples over a range of grades.  Results from the reject duplicate QC program will determine if the splitting procedures are applied consistently and are appropriate. NioBay should then continue to submit one coarse reject duplicate every 50 samples.

In RPA's opinion, the QA/QC program as designed and implemented by NioBay is adequate and the assay results within the database are suitable for use in a Mineral Resource estimate.

## 12 DATA VERIFICATION

## SITE VISIT

Paul Chamois, P. Geo., Principal Geologist with RPA and an independent QP, visited the Project on September 27, 2017.  During the visit, Mr. Chamois examined the historical shaft site  on  the  Property,  examined  core  from  historical  drilling  programs  stored  in  Moosonee, identified pyrochlore mineralization in the historical core, confirmed the local geological setting, and investigated factors that might affect the Project.

While on the site visit, Mr. Chamois also collected 21 samples of split core from mineralized intersections  for  bulk  density  determinations  by  the  water  immersion  method.  The  core samples  were  transported  to  Toronto  by  Mr.  Chamois  and  expedited  to  SGS  Minerals  in Lakefield, Ontario by courier where the bulk density determinations were made (SGS lab code G PHY04V).  Table 12-1 lists the results of the determinations.

## DATA VERIFICATION

RPA extracted 422 samples from the 2016 check sampling results, representing approximately 67% of the total samples, and compared them to the original assay certificates.  No errors were found.

RPA is of the opinion that the database verification procedures for the James Bay Niobium Project comply with industry standards and are adequate for the purposes of Mineral Resource estimation.

## 13 MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING

The following summary of historical and recent metallurgical testwork completed on material from the Property is taken from Pelletier (2017).

## HISTORICAL WORK

Extensive laboratory process testwork has been done in the past including:

- · Heavy liquid separation
- · Gravity separation (tabling, jigging and spiralling)
- · Magnetic and electrostatic separation
- · Flotation (direct and dual flotation)

The results of the historic work suggest that part of the material could be removed before the flotation process with a positive impact to the process plant size and cost.  The dual flotation provides better results than direct flotation.  Based on the laboratory results, a pilot plant test was carried out on a bulk sample from underground.  The sample combined part of the muck coming from the shaft sinking and a cross-cut over 100 ft long at 122 ft below the surface.  The sample assayed 0.72% Nb2O5, which is higher than the average grade reported for the historic resource estimate (0.55% Nb2O5).  The total amount of sample sent to SGS Lakefield for the pilot plant was 250 tons and another 18 tons were sent to the Ontario Research Centre (ORC).

## MINERALOGY

The  historical  mineralogy  indicated  that  only  two  niobium-bearing  minerals  were  present: sodium  pyrochlore  (a  fluocalciopyrochlore  salt  (NaCa)2  (NbTi)2  (O,F)7)  and  columbite (FeNb2O6).

## PILOT PLANT TESTWORK

Grinding test investigation included wet autogenous and dry autogenous grinding.  Wet rod mill  was  suggested  but  not  investigated.    Results  suggest  that  wet  autogenous  grinding produced a desirable size distribution and pebble size.  Grinding tests were carried out at the ORC.

<!-- image -->

A detailed pilot plant program was conducted at Lakefield Research (now SGS Minerals) to assess the final plant flowsheet and pilot plant design criteria.  The pilot plant consisted of the following:

- · Grinding and gravity separation
- · Magnetic separation
- · Calcite flotation
- · Pyrochlore flotation
- · Reverse sulphide flotation
- · Acid leach
- · Tabling

## Results from the pilot plant were:

- · 45% of the initial mass was removed with niobium losses of 4% to 5%.
- · A final niobium concentrate of 64% Nb2O5 was produced at a niobium recovery of 79%.
- · Two types of concentrate were produced; a low and higher silica content (grade 1 with max 1% SiO2 and grade 2 with max 4% SiO2)

Despite  the  positive  results  achieved,  the  final  process  flowsheet  was  complicated  and included a number of cleaning stages, a regrinding stage, and a tabling stage.  It may be challenging to operate and control the niobium losses.  Some of the reagents are hazardous (HF) or obsolete.  With the current evolution in niobium ore processing during the last four decades, it appears that this process flowsheet needs to be revisited and possibly simplified.

Table 13-1 lists the quality of the niobium concentrates produced from the historical testwork.

| CaO          | 15.7%        | 13.6%       |
| MgO          | 0.26%        | 0.69%       |
| BaO          | ---          | ---         |
| Na2O         | 7.31%        | 7.28%       |
| Al2O3        | 0.04%        | 0.13%       |
| S            | 0.05%        | 0.06        |
| P2O5         | 0.08         | 0.23        |
| MnO          | 0.01         | 0.03        |

## CURRENT WORK

The 2017 test work was performed on a representative composite sample of coarse reject material from the 2016 core sampling program.

## HEAVY LIQUID SEPARATION

Heavy liquid separation provided excellent results with 90% of Nb2O5 concentrate in 5% mass pull  at  an  SG cutting point of 3.5.  These results suggest a good liberation of the niobium mineral  and  open  the  possibility  of  gravity  concentration  inside  the  process  flowsheet. Historical process flowsheets used gravity separation to remove up to 40% of the mass prior to flotation with limited niobium losses.

## QEMSCAN

Advanced mineralogy available today reveals a good liberation of most of the mineral in the samples.  QEMSCAN results combined with the heavy liquid separation results indicate that a better niobium recovery can be achieved at the Project compared to other niobium deposits. The main niobium mineral at the Project is pyrochlore (87%), with columbite accounting for only 9.6%.  The niobium-bearing pyrochlore is easier to recover than columbite.  The best

<!-- image -->

result is achieved using niobium liberation, with approximately 95% of the niobium mineral free or liberated.  This result can explain the historical niobium recovery achieved.  The other critical minerals in the niobium processing are also well liberated.  The theoretical grade recovery curve provides other details in the potential niobium recovery.  It can also explain the potential for gangue rejection by gravimetry.

| Niobium   | 71.1%  | 23.8%       | 94.9%                       |
| Silica    | 89.5%  | 5.6%        | 95.1%                       |
| Apatite   | 97.2%  | 1.4%        | 98.6%                       |
| Sulphide  | 87.5%  | 4.1%        | 91.6%                       |
| Fe Oxide  | 68.7%  | 26.5%       | 95.2%                       |

## TESTWORK

The work performed in 2017 is referred to as preliminary process testwork.

A master composite was prepared based on the results of re-assaying of 12 historical drill holes.    The  grade  of  the  master  composite  approximates  the  historical  grade  used  in  the feasibility study and is estimated to be 0.56% Nb2O5.  All of the testwork was done on the master composite.  Table 13-3 lists the grade of the master composite estimate and direct assay grade.

## The testwork included:

- · Completion of head grade assay for 12 holes including major elements to understand the variability of the principal elements/contaminants
- · Heavy liquid separation
- · QEMSCAN mineralogy
- · Gravity separation (2)
- · Flotation tests (10)

The flotation testwork used the dual flotation system with mainly the new approach developed over time.  A typical reagents scheme was used.  The pH regulation was done using fluosilicic and  oxalic  acids  that  are  less  corrosive  and  hazardous  than  hydrofluoric  acid  (HF).    Ten flotation tests were completed and the results appear to be in line with the historical data.  The tests were done in open circuit and the final results will need to be confirmed by locked cycle and  possibly  pilot  plant  tests.    The  test  identified  one  major  issue,  that  is,  the  silica concentration remains relatively high or close to the upper limit.

The results achieved are higher in terms of Nb2O5 recovery than any other niobium operation. The actual flowsheet is simplified compared to the historical one.  The gravity tests failed to reproduce the historical results.  For the current testing, it was decided to complete the flotation test on the entire sample without any mass removal by gravity.  The gravity separation will be reviewed in a future testwork phase, considering its impact on process plant and capital cost as well as the flotation.

The proposed process flowsheet includes:

- · Grinding to 100% 200 microns or 300 microns
- · Desliming
- · Magnetic separation
- · Sulphide flotation
- · Mica flotation
- · Carbonate flotation
- · Niobium flotation

The concentrates produced ranged from 56% to 59% Nb2O5 with Nb2O5 recovery between 68% and 77% in open circuit.  The main contamination grades meet specifications except for silica.  TiO2 ranges from 3.9% to 6.0%, P2O5 is low at 0.12% to 0.14% (the HCl leaching cost will be low), the sulphide S ranges from 0.04% to 0.8%.  At present, no secondary sulphide flotation appears necessary on the final concentrate.  For the silica, the lower grade achieved was 3.21% SiO2 up to 4.5% SiO2 in the next best flotation test.  Presently this is the main issue to address in the next phase of testwork.  The historical flowsheet included many stages of cleaner and gravity separation.  Characterization on the concentrate will be carried out to find the best alternative to resolve this issue.

Table 13-4 lists the typical preliminary open circuit flotation results:

## CONCLUSIONS

Extensive historical testwork has been completed for the Project and good recovery has been achieved.  Multiple cleaning, however, reveals that the control of the silica, and to some extent sulphur, remains complicated and requires the use of gravity table to achieve these results.  It was proposed in 2016 to revisit all the processes to see if it was possible to reduce and simplify the number of cleaning stages and the overall processing.

Preliminary testwork was carried out in 2017 on historical samples available.  Despite limited testwork, good results have been achieved.  Silica remains the main area of concern and will require attention in the next phase of testwork.  The sulphur issue appears to be well controlled in the current testwork program by using a different flotation approach than in the past.  The sulphur grade in the concentrate is well below the target limit.   Additional  testing  on fresh material is recommended to verify the 2017 testwork results.  Variability testwork should be carried out to develop the final flowsheet.  The testwork program should be completed with a pilot plant run with all the processing stages to understand the impact of recirculation and water management.

Gravity  concentration  testwork  should  be  carried  out  to  verify  the  historical  result  of approximately  40%  mass  pull  being  removed  with  limited  Nb2O5  losses  (4%  to  5%  Nb2O5 recovery).  If the gravity test proves to be successful, the new process flowsheet will need to be validated on the reduced mass circuit feed.

## 14 MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATE

## SUMMARY

The Mineral Resource estimate reported herein is a reasonable representation of the global Mineral Resources of the Project at the current level of sampling.  The Mineral Resources conform to Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (CIM) Definition Standards for Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves dated May 10, 2014 (CIM (2014) definitions) and are reported in accordance with the Canadian Securities Administrators' National Instrument 43-101.  Mineral Resources are not Mineral Reserves and have not demonstrated economic viability.  RPA considers the Mineral Resources of the James Bay Project to be amenable to underground extraction.  A summary of the Mineral Resources is presented in Table 14-1. Note that the estimate is reported in short tons.  RPA has excluded approximately 7.1 million tons averaging 0.52% Nb2O5 situated in a 150 ft thick crown pillar.

TABLE 14-1   MINERAL RESOURCES, NOVEMBER 8, 2017 NioBay Metals Inc. - James Bay Niobium Project

| Classification   |   Tonnage  (M st) |   Grade  (%Nb2O5) |   Contained Nb2O5  (M lb) |
|------------------|-------------------|-------------------|---------------------------|
| Indicated        |              25.5 |              0.53 |                       271 |
| Inferred         |              25.3 |              0.51 |                       259 |

## Notes:

- 1. CIM (2014) definitions were followed for Mineral Resources.
- 2. Mineral  Resources  are  reported  at  a  cut-off  grade  of  0.3%  Nb2O5  based  on  an  underground  mining operating cost of C$70/t and a metallurgical recovery of 70%.
- 3. Mineral  Resources  are  estimated  using  a  long-term  niobium  price  of  US$40  per  kg  and  a  US$/C$ exchange rate of 1:1.2.
- 4. A tonnage factor of 12.2 ft³/ton (2.93 g/cm³) was used.
- 5. A minimum mining width of approximately 25 ft was used to build the resource wireframes.
- 6. Resources situated in a 150 ft thick crown pillar have been excluded.

Leapfrog Geo software (version 4.1) was used to construct the geological solids.  GEOVIA GEMS  (Gems)  software  (version  6.8)  was  used  to  prepare  assay  data  for  geostatistical analysis,  construct  the  block  model,  estimate  niobium  oxide  grades,  and  tabulate  Mineral Resources.

RPA  is  not  aware  of  any  environmental,  permitting,  legal,  title,  taxation,  socio-economic, marketing, political, or other relevant factors that could materially affect the Mineral Resource estimate.

## MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATION METHODOLOGY

The evaluation of Mineral Resources involved the following procedures:

- · Database compilation and verification
- · Definition of mineralized domains and construction of wireframes
- · Data conditioning (capping and compositing) for geostatistical analysis and variography
- · Selection of estimation strategy and estimation parameters
- · Block modelling and grade interpolation
- · Validation, classification, and tabulation
- · Assessment of 'reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction' and selection of reporting assumptions
- · Preparation of the Mineral Resource Statement

## RESOURCE DATABASE

NioBay  provided  assay  and  logging  data  as  separate  multi-tab  Excel  files  containing  log information for each core borehole.  The data include location, survey, lithology, mineralogy and assays.  RPA combined the individual logs for import into Leapfrog software.

The data used to estimate Mineral Resources include 79 core boreholes (43,405 ft), all of which are located within the resource model area.  The data include 2,517 assays, of which 56 have a value of zero for Nb2O5.

NioBay re-logged and re-assayed 12 boreholes completed in the 1960s to confirm that the historical  borehole  data  can  be  used  to  support  a  new  Mineral  Resource  estimate  without drilling  any  new  holes.    In  RPA's  opinion,  there  is  a  good  correlation  of  the  historical  and resampled Nb2O5 values (Figure 14-1).

## FIGURE 14-1   QQ PLOT OF THE HISTORICAL AND RESAMPLED DATA

<!-- image -->

RPA conducted a limited number of checks on the resource database, including a search for unique, missing, and overlapping intervals, a total depth comparison, and a visual search for extreme or deviant survey values.  As part of the review of the data, RPA compared the Excel files with scanned copies of the original paper logs.  No errors were encountered.

The resource database is considered by RPA to be sufficiently reliable for grade modelling and Mineral Resource estimation.

## GEOLOGICAL INTERPRETATION AND MODELLING

RPA used Leapfrog software to create a three-dimensional geological model from core log information.  As part of the modelling routine, RPA simplified original logging codes into seven main geological groups:

<!-- image -->

- 1. Overburden
- 2. Sediments
- 3. Gneiss
- 4. Gabbro
- 5. Pyroxenite
- 6. Carbonatite
- 7. Pyrochlore

Niobium  mineralization  occurs  only  in  the  pyrochlore,  in  which  RPA  defined  two  zones  of enriched mineralization separated by internal waste.  The two domains join at the south end to form a single body.  RPA retained the two-domain differentiation for modelling purposes. Mineralization was modelled at an approximate modelling threshold of 0.3% Nb2O5 (Figure 142).  Based on the combined geological and mineralization model, RPA assigned rock codes to seven geological domains, two mineralization domains, and one waste domain (Table 14-2).

| Domain         | Rock Code   |

| Lithology      |             |
| Gneiss         | 11          |
| Gabbro         | 22          |
| Pyroxenite     | 33          |
| Carbonatite    | 44          |
| Pyrochlore     | 55          |
| Sediments      | 66          |
| Overburden     | 77          |
| Mineralization |             |
| Internal Waste | 99          |
| Western Zone   | 200         |
| Eastern Zone   | 100         |

## EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS (EDA) - ASSAYS

Niobium assays located inside the wireframe models were tagged with domain identifiers and exported  for  statistical  analysis.    Results  were  used  to  help  verify  the  modelling  process. Descriptive statistics by domain are summarized in Table 14-3.

TABLE 14-3   STATISTICAL SUMMARY OF NB2O5 ASSAY DATA NioBay Metals Inc. - James Bay Niobium Project

| Domain             | Count   |   Min  (%Nb2O5) |   Max  (%Nb2O5) |   Mean  (%Nb2O5) |   Variance |   Std. Dev  (%Nb2O5) |   CV |
|--------------------|---------|-----------------|-----------------|------------------|------------|----------------------|------|

| Total              | 2,373   |            0    |            2.66 |             0.44 |       0.09 |                 0.29 | 0.67 |

## CAPPING HIGH GRADE VALUES

Extreme high-grade values, called 'outliers', can lead to overestimation of grade in the block model.    RPA  performed  a  capping  analysis  comprising  decile  analysis,  histograms,  log probability  plots,  and  cutting  curves.    Considering  the  disseminated  nature  of  the  niobium distribution  and  the  overall  grade  distribution,  RPA  is  of  the  opinion  that  capping  is  not necessary for this deposit.

## EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS - COMPOSITES

Prior to grade interpolation, the assay data within each of the individual mineralized grade shells were combined into 10 ft long downhole composites.  The composite length was chosen based on the analysis of the predominant sampling length, the style of mineralization, and continuity of grade.  Sample lengths vary considerably and range from 2 ft to 20 ft within the wireframe models, with 98% of the samples taken at ten ft lengths (Figure 14-3).  Assays within the wireframe domains were composited in Gems, starting at the first mineralized wireframe boundary from the collar and resetting at each new wireframe boundary.  Since assay intervals cross lithological contacts, the created composites contain a small number of residuals with lengths less than ten feet.

## FIGURE 14-3   HISTOGRAM OF JAMES BAY NIOBIUM SAMPLING LENGTH

Based on the composite length analysis summarized in Table 14-4, RPA elected to remove composites less than three feet from the estimation process.  The descriptive statistics for composites used for resource estimation are presented in Table 14-5.

## BLOCK MODEL PARAMETERS

Leapfrog wireframes were imported into Gems in order to estimate the Mineral Resources.  A block  model  was  created  using  Gems.    The  block  model  was  not  rotated.    Block  model coordinates  are  based  on  the  local  mine  grid.    Table  14-6  summarizes  the  block  model definition.  The block model fully encloses the modelled resource wireframes.

## VARIOGRAPHY

Variogram analyses were completed with Gems for both domains using the 10 ft composites. RPA modelled the variograms using two spherical structures with a nugget effect of between 0% and 0.1% of the sill (Figure 14-4).  A summary of the variogram parameters is shown in Table 14-8.

## TONNAGE FACTOR

During  the  site  visit,  RPA  collected  21  independent  samples  to  determine  density  of  the niobium mineralization.  RPA assigned the average value of 12.2 ft³/ton (2.93 g/cm³) to material in the pyrochlore domain.  Table 14-9 shows summary statistics for density data provided by NioBay.

## NIOBIUM GRADE ESTIMATION

The primary grade interpolation used an Ordinary Kriging estimator (OK) of the 10 ft long composites based on a minimum of six and a maximum of twelve composites in the first pass, a minimum of four and a maximum of 12 composites in the second pass, and a minimum of two  and  a  maximum  of  15  composites  in  the  third  estimation  run.    The  first  and  second

<!-- image -->

estimation runs required composites from at least two boreholes to interpolate block grades. Search ellipse dimensions were chosen following a review of variography and interpolation efficiency.  Estimation was performed in three passes, with the first pass using full variogram ranges for  the  search,  twice  the  variogram  range  for  the  second  pass,  and  2.5  times  the variogram  range  for  the  third  pass.    Soft  boundaries  were  used  between  the  mineralized domains.    The  resource  wireframes  were  split  into  four  search  domains.    Table  14-10 summarizes interpolation parameters for all three passes.

Grade interpolation was carried out using OK, inverse distance to the power of 3 (ID 3 ) and nearest neighbour (NN) on mineralized domain.

## BLOCK MODEL VALIDATION

RPA validated the block model using the following methods:

- · Comparison of block model versus resource wireframe volumes
- · Comparison of block grade estimation by the primary OK estimator to results from ID 3 and NN estimates
- · Swath plots of composite grades versus OK, ID 3 , and NN swath plots of composite grades versus ID 3 and NN
- · Visual inspection of block grades versus composite grades on plans, vertical sections, and longitudinal sections
- · Statistical comparison of block grades to assay and composite grades

Since  the  percent  values  were  used  to  report  the  mineral  resources,  the  volume  of  the wireframes matches the volume of the blocks.

<!-- image -->

The volumetric comparison of the blocks versus the domain wireframes match very closely (Table 14-11).

TABLE 14-11   BLOCK VERSUS WIREFRAME VOLUMES NioBay Metals Inc. - James Bay Niobium Project

|   Domain Number | Wireframe Volume (000 ft )  3   | Block Volume  (000 ft )  3   | Volume  Difference  (%)   |
|-----------------|---------------------------------|------------------------------|---------------------------|
|             100 | 728,717                         | 727,121                      | 0.2%                      |
|             200 | 268,335                         | 267,210                      | 0.4%                      |

Comparing the swath plots of the estimated block grades using ID 3  and NN (Figures 14-5 to 14-7) show that there is slight smoothing using the OK interpolant as expected.  Since the OK results are very similar to the ID  results, RPA decided to use the blocks estimated by the OK 3 method for the mineral resource reporting.  The swath plots compare the mean block grades estimated  by  the  three  interpolation  methods  to  the  composite  grades  in  the  X,  Y,  and  Z directions.

## CUT-OFF GRADE

The cut-off grade calculation was based on an average underground operating cost of C$70/t, metallurgical recovery of 70%, and niobium price of US$40 per kg with a US$/C$ exchange rate of 1:1.2.

Table 14-14 shows the sensitivity of the block grade estimates to a range of cut-off grades both above and below the 0.3% Nb2O5 resource cut-off grade.  The Indicated resource grade increases significantly from 0.53% Nb2O5 to 0.64% Nb2O5 when the cut-off grade is raised to 0.5% Nb2O5.  At a zero cut-off grade, the Indicated mineralization grade is essentially the same as at the 0.3% Nb2O5 cut-off grade, and the tonnage increase is very minor relative to the Indicated resource because the mineralization wireframes were built based on approximately a  0.3%  Nb2O5  cut-off  grade.    This  means  that  there  is  only  a  small  amount  of  low  grade mineralization present in the mineralization wireframes and that reporting the resources at a zero  cut-off grade  or  a  0.3%  Nb2O5  cut-off  grade  does  not  make  much  difference. Approximately two million tons of low grade material within the wireframes are below the 0.3% Nb2O5 resource cut-off grade and were not reported as part of the Mineral Resource.  RPA reviewed the location of this material and determined that it was relatively contiguous and could be avoided in the case of underground mining.

A tonnage grade curve for the global resource is provided in Figure 14-14.  Again, it shows that the tons and grades are insensitive to cut-off grades below 0.3% Nb2O5 but very sensitive to cut-off grades greater than 0.3% Nb2O5.

## CLASSIFICATION

Definitions for resource categories used in this report are consistent with CIM (2014) definitions incorporated by reference into National Instrument 43-101.  In the CIM classification, a Mineral Resource is defined as 'a concentration or occurrence of solid material of economic interest in or on the Earth's crust in such form, grade or quality and quantity that there are reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction. The location, quantity, grade or quality, continuity, and other geological characteristics of a Mineral Resource are known, estimated or interpreted from specific geological evidence and knowledge, including sampling.'  Mineral Resources are classified into Measured, Indicated, and Inferred categories.

The  basis  for  the  classification  is  a  distance  based  scheme  using  the  relative  confidence expressed  by  the  range  of  the  variograms,  distance  to  nearest  neighbour,  and  apparent continuity of mineralization.  RPA manually defined the portions of the deposit supported by drill hole spacing up to approximately 200 ft and 400 ft and classified these areas as Indicated and Inferred Resources, respectively (Figures 14-15 and 14-16).

## 19 MARKET STUDIES AND CONTRACTS

The following is taken from Camet (2017).

Niobium is a niche metal present in a variety of minerals, the most commercially important of which is pyrochlore which accounts for as much as 97% of global niobium supply.  There are currently  only  three  significant  producers  of  pyrochlore:  CBMM  and  China  Molybdenum (CMOC) in Brazil; and Niobec in Canada.  All three convert their mine output to ferro-niobium prior to sale, mostly into export markets and on a yearly contract basis.  CBMM, a privately owned company, is by far the largest producer of ferro-niobium in the world and, unlike CMOC and Niobec, CBMM also supplies a range of other downstream products like niobium oxide and niobium metals.  Its share of the global niobium products market has peaked at 85%.

Niobium is used in a variety of forms but by far the most important in terms of tonnage is standard-grade ferro-niobium, which has applications in steelmaking, most notably in highstrength low-alloy (HSLA) and stainless steels.  This market accounts for approximately 90% of niobium usage.  Niobium is added in very small amounts (usually in the order of 0.05%) as a grain refiner to produce  high-quality  steels  for  use  in  gas  pipelines,  automobiles, construction, stainless steels, and other applications.

Two factors are essentially impacting the ferro-niobium demands; i) increase in overall steel production with an associated increase in production of high strength steels and ii) a rise in the intensity  of  use  of  niobium  in  the  steel  industry.    Traditionally  steel  production  growth  has always been the greatest contributor to niobium consumption growth, but with moderate steel production forecasts, the greatest potential for niobium consumption growth lies in an increase of intensity of use which is currently approximately 50 grams per tonne of steel.  China, which represents  nearly  half  of  the  world  steel  output,  is  a  key  region  for  future  ferro-niobium consumption.  Chinese GDP growth is forecasted to slow down in the upcoming years which could negatively affect the rate of increase in ferro-niobium consumption.  On the other hand, the  importance  of  construction  and  pipeline  steels  produced  in  China  combined  with  new regulations in construction material quality could push Chinese niobium requirements to new heights.

<!-- image -->

Camet  forecasts  that  the  world  consumption  for  ferro-niobium  will  rise  from  an  estimated 82,000  tonnes  in  2016  to  approximately  100,000  tonnes  in  2020.  With  the  upcoming expansions  announced  by  the  two  Brazilian  producers  and  one  or  two  probable  niobium projects around the world, the market will remain in oversupply for several years.  Presently at 125,000 tonnes of ferro-niobium production, capacity is expected to reach 150,000 tonnes by 2020.

With only three main producers of ferro-niobium in the world, prices have been historically very stable at approximately $40/kg before falling to a low of $30/kg and currently at approximately $35/kg.    Camet  believes  that  there  is  still  room  for  price  increases  without  affecting  the demand.  Market trends and industry sources indicate that prices are heading towards $45/kg in the medium to long term.

## 20 ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES, PERMITTING, AND SOCIAL OR COMMUNITY IMPACT

The following is taken from EEM, Inc (2017).

## REQUIREMENTS

The  Government  of  Canada  has  a  constitutional  duty  to  consult,  and  where  appropriate, accommodate Aboriginal groups when it considers resource development projects that might adversely impact potential or established Aboriginal or treaty rights.  While third parties such as  project  proponents  do  not  have  a  legal  obligation  to  consult  Aboriginal  groups  in  most Canadian jurisdictions, in practice the Crown may delegate some responsibility for consultation to third parties to collect information about how the impacts of project development may affect potential or established Aboriginal or Treaty rights.

## PROVINCIAL REQUIREMENTS

At  the  provincial  level,  the  MNDM  has  established  requirements  to  ensure  that  project proponents  consider  Aboriginal  consultation  throughout  the  project  lifecycle.    MNDM  has identified Moose Cree First Nation (MCFN) as the only Aboriginal community that must be consulted for the Project.  As part of the consultation process, NioBay is required to:

- · Provide further details to MCFN about the company's proposed exploration activities;
- · Gather information from MCFN about whether or how the proposed activities have the potential to adversely affect the communities' Aboriginal or treaty rights;
- · Discuss with MCFN, and MNDM if appropriate, ways to avoid, eliminate, or minimize any concerns raised;
- · Seek further direction or advice from MNDM, if needed; and
- · Document the process and decisions made and report to MNDM.

NioBay is required to submit regular Aboriginal Consultation Reports as part of the MNDM's reporting requirements once the consultation process has begun.  If the Project progresses to the advanced exploration and production stages of the project lifecycle, NioBay will be required to submit regular Aboriginal Consultation Plans and Aboriginal Consultation Reports to MNDM, including plans and reports about Closure Plan consultation.

<!-- image -->

Despite a number of requests, the leadership of MCFN has to this day refused to open a dialogue with NioBay and to discuss their concerns associated with the exploration program and the Project.  The MNDM is taking steps to organize a meeting with representatives of the MCFN to address any concerns they may have about the proposed drilling campaign.  NioBay will continue to hold discussions with the local community members and government officials and will maintain its efforts to engage with the MCFN leadership.

## FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS

At the federal level, the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act will be triggered if the Project Description submitted to Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency (CEAA) includes one or more physical activities defined in the Inclusion List Regulations or Regulations Designating Physical Activities .  The federal CEAA process requires proponents to undertake consultation with First Nations, the public, and other stakeholders to promote meaningful public participation before  and  during  the  environmental  assessment  process.    CEAA  also  requires  project proponents to collect and/or facilitate the collection of traditional and community knowledge (mainly related to land use and ecological value) relative to the proposed project area. First Nations  communities  that  are  included  within  the  scope  of  the  federal  environmental assessment are determined by project-specific CEAA guidelines and often lie outside of the project's perceived immediate area of influence.

## PLANS, NEGOTIATIONS, AND AGREEMENTS

Above and beyond its legal obligations, NioBay is committed to building lasting relationships with  Project  partners  and  stakeholders  based  on  the  principles  of  transparency,  trust,  and mutual  respect  to  ensure  the  maximum  possible  local  benefit  from  the  Project.    NioBay recognizes that the Project is  situated  in  the Traditional  Home  Lands  of the  MCFN  and  is committed to fully respecting MCFN's traditional land, culture, environment, and water.

Although NioBay has been contacted by a number of Moose Cree band members who are interested  in  learning  more  about  the  Project,  NioBay  is  seeking  permission  from  MCFN's leadership  to  hold  an  information  session  in  Moose  Factory.    The  company  wishes  to emphasize that the Project would be an underground mine located outside the North French River watershed and that it will have a minimal impact on traditional harvesting activities and to the environment.  The Project would create important economic benefits to MCFN members in the short, medium, and long term.  Due to the proximity of the Project to Moose Factory and

<!-- image -->

Moosonee, daily transport services would allow all local workers to return to their homes and families at the end of the workday.

NioBay  is  interested  in  entering  into  a  partnership  agreement  with  MCFN  for  Project development and ownership.  As part of such a partnership agreement, some of the aspects of the Project that NioBay would like to discuss with MCFN include:

- · Project monitoring and mitigation
- · Bird and wildlife conservation
- · Support for the community, including traditional concerns
- · Employment
- · Contracting and procurement opportunities
- · Apprenticeship, training, and career development opportunities
- · Any  other  issues  of  importance  to  MCFN,  as  identified  during  consultation  and negotiation

## 25 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS

The James Bay Niobium Project is hosted by the Argor Carbonatite Complex which occurs within the northern portion of the KSZ.  The KSZ crosscuts an east-trending fabric within the Archean rocks of the Superior Province and is sub-parallel to the TSTZ.  Numerous alkalic and carbonatite intrusions occur along and within the KSZ.

Pyrochlore and, to a lesser extent, columbite, are the economic minerals of interest and are hosted predominantly by the sovite phase of the carbonatite.

Extensive work during the mid to late 1960s resulted in a historical Mineral Resource estimate and  feasibility  study.    The  Property  has  been  dormant  since  1969.    Re-sampling  of  the historical  diamond  drill  core  by  NioBay  has  confirmed  that,  despite  some  variation  at  the individual sample level, the overall grade over wide intervals is similar to historical values.

Preliminary testwork on a composite sample consisting of core from 12 historical drill holes included gravity, flotation, QEMSCAN mineralogy, and heavy liquid separation tests.  Although preliminary and subject to verification, the results proved encouraging.  Additional testwork on fresh material is recommended.

Historical diamond drilling has outlined mineralization with three-dimensional continuity, and size and grades that can potentially be extracted economically.

Mineral Resources were estimated and classified by RPA following CIM (2014) definitions.  At a cut-off grade of 0.3% Nb2O5, Indicated Mineral Resources are estimated to total 25.5 million tonnes grading 0.53% Nb2O5 containing approximately 271 million pounds of niobium oxide. Inferred  Mineral  Resources  are  estimated  to  total  25.3  million  tonnes  grading  0.51  Nb2O5 containing 259 million pounds of niobium oxide.

RPA is  of  the  opinion  that  there  is  excellent  exploration  potential  to  increase  the  Mineral Resource at depth with more diamond drilling.

The MNDM has identified Moose Cree First Nation (MCFN) as the only Aboriginal community that must be consulted for the Project.  Despite a number of requests, the leadership of MCFN

<!-- image -->

has  to  this  day  refused  to  open  a  dialogue  with  NioBay  and  to  discuss  their  concerns associated  with  the  exploration  program  and  the  Project.    The  MNDM  is  taking  steps  to organize a meeting with representatives of the MCFN to address any concerns they may have about the proposed drilling campaign.  NioBay will continue to hold discussions with the local community members and government officials and will maintain its efforts to engage with the MCFN leadership.

## 26 RECOMMENDATIONS

RPA  is  of  the  opinion  that  the  James  Bay  Niobium  Project  hosts  a  significant  niobium mineralized  system,  there  is  good  potential  to  increase  the  resource  base,  and  additional exploration and technical studies are warranted.

RPA has reviewed and concurs with NioBay's proposed exploration programs and budgets. Phase  I  of  the  recommended  work  program  will  include  4,000  m  of  drilling  focussed  on upgrading  portions  of  the  Inferred  Resources  to  Indicated  Resources  and  extending  the Mineral Resources at depth, as well as environmental, engineering, and metallurgical studies required to support a PEA in 2018.
