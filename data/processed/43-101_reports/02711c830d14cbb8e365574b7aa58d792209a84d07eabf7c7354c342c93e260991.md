Mr Will Felderhof, President of Acadian Gold Corp (ADA, TSX-V) based in Halifax, Canada engaged MineTech International Limited on December 21, 2005 to complete a National Instrument 43-101-compliant resource and reserve estimate. The economic analysis of the proposed operation was to be of feasibility study accuracy, or plus-or-minus ten percent. Mr Douglas Roy, M.A.Sc., P.Eng., who was the Principal Author of this report, is a Qualified Person under Section 1.1 of National Instrument 43-101.

The Scotia Mine property is located approximately sixty kilometres northeast of Halifax, Nova Scotia and one kilometre east of the community of Gays River in the Halifax Regional Municipality. The property's general location is $45^{\circ} 02^{\prime}$ North, $63^{\circ} 20^{\prime}$ West. Access to the property is by paved roads and is approximately fifteen kilometres off the Trans Canada Highway along Route \#224. The Halifax International Airport is located twenty kilometres southwest of the mine site.

The site lies along the south side of the Gays River main branch, immediately east of the confluence with the Gays River south branch. The deposit is in a rural-residential area of central Nova Scotia that is typified by rolling topography and abundant surface water.

The climate is variable because of mixed continental and maritime weather patterns. Mean annual temperature is $5.9^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, mean annual precipitation is $1,250 \mathrm{~mm}$ and yearly evapotranspiration is estimated to be 560 mm . The relatively mild climate (for Canada) permits year-round operations.

The property consists of 615 hectares of mineral rights, including land with exploration potential for zinc/lead mineralisation, and 568.4 hectares of land ownership (real property). The ScoZinc land package also includes five exploration licenses in the general vicinity of the mine. In total, the 91 claims cover 3,640 acres ( 1,473 hectares). These licenses are located along strike from the Scotia Mine deposit and include favourable host rocks similar to that at the mine site. All lands were in good standing and were registered to ScoZinc Limited as of February 17, 2006. The range in anniversary dates is from May 2, 2006 for Licence No. 06268 to November 5, 2006 for Licence No. 05851.

Mineral Lease \#90-1, which covers the entire mine site, was originally granted by the Nova Scotia Government to Westminster Canada Limited on April 2, 1990. Its anniversary date is April 2, 2006. The lease was transferred to Savage Resources in 1996 and later to Pasminco Resources Canada Company in 1999. It was transferred to ScoZinc in 2002. Savage retains a $2 \%$ net smelter return royalty. Acadian has the option to purchase the royalty for $\$ 1.45$ million. The duration of the mineral lease is twenty years, at which time it may be renewed. The Mineral Lease grants sufficient rights for mining.

Gallant Aggregates signed a thirty-year lease agreement to mine and remove aggregate from the property for one dollar per tonne of material that is removed from the property. The lease was signed on May 15, 2003 and entitles Gallant, with certain limitations, to mine anywhere on ScoZinc's land. A major condition of Gallant's lease is that metal mining takes precedenceover aggregate mining. Therefore, Gallant's lease will not interfere with zinc and lead mining operations.

An updated Phase I ESA was carried out in conjunction with this Resource/Reserve report. It was completed in March, 2006 by Conestoga-Rovers \& Associates (CRA). CRA (then MGI Limited) also carried out a Phase I ESA in 1996. The updated assessment included several site inspections, during which several minor, but no major liabilities were identified.

Between 1997 and 2000, an Environmental Registration Document was prepared. It addressed the environmental concerns of a surface and underground mining operation along with the diversion of a 500 metre section of the Gays River to accommodate the pit design. On August 4, 2000 the Open Pit Lead/Zinc Mine and River Diversion Project proposed by Pasminco Resources Canada Company received environmental assessment approval.

Before mining can begin, the existing Industrial Approval (Industrial Waste Discharge Permit) must be returned to operating status from its current "care and maintenance" status. This should be relatively straightforward process because the proposed operation is nearly identical to the operation for which the Industrial Approval was originally granted.

The Scotia Mine mill, designed and built in 1978/1979, is a flotation process and has a rated capacity of 1,350 tonnes per day. However, it has operated for extended periods at a rate of 2,000 tonnes per day (Thornton, 2006). Other existing site infrastructure includes:

- an administration building containing offices, a dry, warehouses, workshops, a large boardroom, and several heavy equipment bays;
- a compressor building ( 1,600 square feet);
- a tire shop (2,000 square feet);
- a welding shop;
- a geology building; and,
- a core shed.

Storage and ship loading facilities for lead and zinc concentrates are available at the seaport of Sheet Harbour, a distance of eighty kilometres from the mine site over paved roads. ScoZinc does not own these facilities, but Westminster used them in 1990. Rail transport facilities have also been used for concentrate shipping. A railway siding is located in Milford, eight roadkilometres from the site.

The existing surface rights are sufficient for mining operations. Power is supplied through the regional grid at reasonable rates. Most of the mill's water requirements are satisfied by inprocess recycling. Make-up water is drawn from the perennial Gays River. The existing tailings pond has sufficient capacity for the life of the project. There is also sufficient area for waste rock storage on the property.

The Scotia Mine property is underlain by basement rocks of the Cambro-Ordovician Meguma Group which had significant local topographic relief due to rift faulting and erosion. Locally, a veneer of Horton Group, red-brown conglomerate and sandstone mark the base of the unconformably overlying Lower Carboniferous rocks which host the Scotia Mine deposit.In areas where the basement rocks formed islands in the Carboniferous Sea, coral reefs formed along the shores. These carbonate rocks are the Gays River Formation. The MacCumber Formation is time-equivalent to the Gays River Formation. The MacCumber and Gays River Formations are overlain by evaporites of the Carrolls Corner and Stewiake Formations.

The Scotia Mine mineralisation has long been considered a Mississippi Valley-type lead-zinc deposit - a carbonate-hosted deposit classified as a typical open space filling type, hosted in a dolomitized limestone which developed as a carbonate build-up on an irregular preCarboniferous basement topographic high where conditions allowed for growth of reefbuilding organisms.

In the immediate area of the Scotia Mine, the zinc/lead-bearing Gays River Formation trends in an east-northeast direction across the ScoZinc property. Locally, the mineralisation dips up to $45^{\circ}$ to the north-northwest which is the depositional slope of the front of the Gays River reef unit but tends to be horizontal in the back reef area. The mineralisation is present as sphalerite and galena and grades from massive $\mathrm{Pb}-\mathrm{Zn}$ ore-grade material in the fore reef to finely disseminated, lower grade material in the back reef. In the mine area, the Gays River Formation is overlain either by the evaporites of the Carrolls Corner Formation and/or overburden.

The Scotia Mine was discovered in 1973 by the Imperial Oil Enterprises/Cuvier Mines joint venture. Esso initiated mine development in 1978 and commissioned the mill in 1979. From 1979 to 1981 the mine produced 554,000 tonnes of ore containing $2.12 \%$ Zinc and $1.36 \%$ Lead. Esso had difficulty dealing with groundwater conditions along the hanging wall of the mineralised zone, which resulted in having to leave a hanging wall pillar that was comprised of high-grade material. The mine closed in 1982 due to groundwater inflow and operating losses.

Seabright Resources Inc. acquired the mine and mill in 1984. Despite a favourable feasibility study, they did not reactivate the mine due to depressed metal prices at the time. They converted the mill for gold processing and processed gold ore from several satellite properties.

With the takeover of Seabright by Western Mining Corporation (Westminer) in 1988, a review of the potential for mining the deposit was undertaken. Following completion of feasibility studies in 1989, the underground workings were dewatered and test mining was carried out. A total of 187,000 tonnes were mined over a fifteen month period with average grades of $7.47 \%$ Zinc and $3.50 \%$ Lead. In 1991, production was suspended again due to groundwater inflow and economic considerations.

In 1997, Savage Resources Canada Limited acquired the Scotia Mine assets from Westminster. Savage concluded that an open pit operation was feasible and initiated environmental permitting, including provisions for a diversion of a portion of the Gays River. Savage was subsequently taken over by Pasminco Resources Canada Company (Pasminco Resources) andthe environmental assessment plan was approved by the Nova Scotia Minister of the Environment in August 2000. The operating plan was never initiated.

Regal Mines Limited (Regal Mines) purchased Pasminco Resources in February 2002. Regal was owned $50 \%$ by OntZinc Corporation (OntZinc) and $50 \%$ by Regal Consolidated Ventures Limited (Regal Consolidated). As part of the sale, Pasminco Canada Holdings Inc (Pasminco Holdings) retained a $2 \%$ net smelter return (NSR) royalty on future production. OntZinc acquired Regal Consolidated's $50 \%$ interest in December 2002 to own $100 \%$ of Pasminco Resources. Savage Resources Limited is the successor of Pasminco Holdings and currently holds the $2 \%$ royalty.

OntZinc later changed its name to HudBay Minerals Inc (Hudbay) after purchasing Hudson's Bay Mining and Smelting in December 2004. Hudbay currently owns Scotia Mine through its wholly-owned subsidiary, ScoZinc Limited.

The author reviewed the sampling results and verified that the sample types and density are adequate for establishing Resources and Reserves. The sampling results are representative of the mineralisation. The available information and sample density allow a reliable estimate to be made of the size, tonnage and grade of the mineralisation in accordance with the level of confidence established by the Mineral Resource categories in the CIM Standards.

The deposit is characterised by complex geometry and is difficult to model in terms of standard techniques. Lying along a 'paleo-shoreline', it features repetitive changes in strike around a general trend of $060^{\circ}$ Azimuth, and with varying dip.

For Resource calculation, the deposit was divided into two zones. The Surface Resource Zone, south of Highway 224, includes lower grade, disseminated rock that is amenable to surface mining. The Northeast Underground Zone lies north of the highway. It consists of higher-grade, moderately dipping mineralisation. It lacks the lower grade, disseminated rock, making underground mining more attractive.

For both the Surface and Northeast Underground Zones, manual interpretation was required to properly model the geology. The Surface Zones ore zones were differentiated into a highgrade massive sulphide zone and a low-grade disseminated zone. Drill-hole data and underground openings were then plotted on hard-copy plans at ten metre intervals, and interpretations of the high-grade zone, the low-grade and the hanging-wall 'Trench' were produced. The cut-off grades that were for the high-grade (HG) and low-grade (LG) zones were $7 \% \mathrm{Zn}-\mathrm{Eq}$ and $2 \% \mathrm{Zn}-\mathrm{Eq}$ respectively.

The Surface Zone's geometry made it difficult to incorporate the true spatial relationship of the samples for estimation purposes without the use of 'unfolding' techniques that transform the sample data into another co-ordinate space that honours the spatial relationships. Variography and estimation were conducted in the transformed space, and the results are then back-transformed into the original space.

Equal length composites were prepared from uncut assay values in a two step process. Initial composite intervals were defined from the intercepts of the drill holes with the high-grade andlow-grade 3D solids of the mineralised zone. Equal length composites of 1.5 metres were then generated within these intervals - 1.5 metres is approximately the average length of the assay intervals.

Three dimensional experimental correlograms were generated using the transformed (unfolded) Zn and Pb composite data, for both low-grade and high-grade mineralised zones below an elevation of 490 metres (Datum, Mean Sea Level $=500.11$ metres). Separate 3D experimental correlograms were generated using un-transformed composite data for the lowgrade mineralised zone above 490 metre elevation, where the deposit is essentially horizontal in attitude. Nested correlogram models comprising nugget effect and two spherical components were fitted to all experimental variograms.

No evidence of specific gravity test work was available. Therefore, a formula for specific gravity based on zinc and lead grades was used for the mineralised zones.

Two block models were constructed for interpolation purposes, a primary model in normal (un-transformed) space, and a secondary, smaller model in transformed space for interpolation of the un-folded data.

The standard ordinary kriging (OK) procedure was used to interpolate Zn and Pb block values in the flat lying portions of the deposit above 490 metre elevation. Separate interpolations of Zn and Pb block values for the LG and HG zones were kriged in three passes using ordinary kriging (OK), the transformed composites and the correlograms generated from those composites.

Because it was determined that the Northeast Underground Zone would be most profitably mined using underground mining methods, a cut-off grade of $5 \%$ zinc equivalent was used to outline the mineralisation on sections spaced fifty metres apart. To permit mechanised mining, the minimum mining width and height were both 2.4 metres.

One contiguous body made up the Northeast Underground Resources. To determine the quantity of material, the outline area on each section was multiplied by its strike length (fifty metres) to determine the volume. That figure was multiplied by an average SG of 2.9 to determine mass. To determine grade, the length-weighted average grade and the true width of each intercept was calculated. The average section grade was determined by calculating the true-length-weighted average grade of all of the section's intercepts. The average true width of the intercepts was also calculated.

Using a $0.75 \%$ zinc-equivalent cut-off, the undiluted Surface and Underground Resources were estimated to be:

| Mineral Resources |  |  |  |  |  |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Category | Volume $\left(\mathrm{m}^{3}\right)$ | SG | Tonnes | Zinc <br> Grade | Lead <br> Grade |
| Measured (Surface) | 680,000 | 2.78 | 1,880,000 | $3.8 \%$ | $1.6 \%$ |
| Indicated |  |  |  |  |  |
| Surface | 810,000 | 2.77 | 2,250,000 | $3.2 \%$ | $1.4 \%$ |
| Underground ${ }^{1}$ | 381,000 | 2.90 | 1,110,000 | $6.6 \%$ | $3.7 \%$ |
| Subtotal | 1,190,000 | 2.82 | 3,360,000 | $4.3 \%$ | $2.2 \%$ |
| Measured + Indicated <br> (Surface and Underground) | 1,870,000 | 2.80 | 5,240,000 | $4.1 \%$ | $2.0 \%$ |
| Inferred | 652,000 | 2.76 | 1,800,000 | $3.1 \%$ | $1.1 \%$ |

Notes:

1. Northeast Underground Zone.
2. Undiluted Resources.

To estimate the Surface Reserves, an optimised pit shell was generated from the block model utilising Whittle 3.4 pit optimisation software. Only blocks in the Measured and Indicated Resource categories were used. A surface mine plan, complete with haul roads, was designed using the optimum pit shells as a guide.

Mine dilution and recovery values were estimated to be $15 \%$ and $90 \%$, respectively. These values were applied to the Surface Reserves and the Northeast Underground Resources, resulting in the following Reserve estimate:

| Mineral Reserves |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Category | Volume $\left(\mathrm{m}^{3}\right)$ | SG | Tonnes | Zinc <br> Grade | Lead <br> Grade |  |
| Proven Reserves (Surface) | 630,000 | 2.78 | 1,750,000 | $3.2 \%$ | $1.3 \%$ |  |
| Probable Reserves |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Surface | 610,000 | 2.76 | 1,690,000 | $2.5 \%$ | $1.0 \%$ |  |
| Underground | 395,000 | 2.90 | 1,150,000 | $5.7 \%$ | $3.2 \%$ |  |
| Subtotal | 1,005,000 | 2.83 | 2,840,000 | $3.8 \%$ | $1.9 \%$ |  |
| Total Proven and Probable Reserves (Surface and Underground) | 1,635,000 | 2.81 | 4,590,000 | $3.6 \%$ | $1.7 \%$ |  |

Notes:

1. Dilution equals $15 \%$ and mining recovery equals $90 \%$.

The effect of changing metal prices on Surface Reserve size and grade was investigated. Two additional optimum pit shells were generated using plus and minus $25 \%$ of the base case metal prices. The relationship shows that Surface Reserve tonnes drop in an approximately linear manner as the cut-off grade increases:

|  | Corresponding | Reserve |  |  |  |  |  |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Zinc Price <br> (\$/US/lb) | Cut-off <br> Grade $^{1}$ (Zn-Eq) | Tonnes | Zinc <br> Grade | Lead <br> Grade | $\begin{gathered} \text { Zn-Eq } \\ \text { Grade } \end{gathered}$ | Stripping <br> (Tonnes) | Stripping <br> Ratio |
| \$ 0.64 | $1.20 \%$ | 2,200,000 | $3.25 \%$ | $1.42 \%$ | $3.86 \%$ | 17,301,000 | 7.9 |
| \$ 0.85 | $0.85 \%$ | 3,321,000 | $3.30 \%$ | $1.35 \%$ | $3.88 \%$ | 32,855,000 | 9.9 |
| \$ 1.06 | $0.66 \%$ | 3,831,000 | $3.48 \%$ | $1.46 \%$ | $4.11 \%$ | 48,869,000 | 12.8 |

Notes:

1. Cut-off grade calculated according to zinc price and base case operating parameters.
2. Zinc-Equivalent equals zinc grade $+0.43 \times$ lead grade.For the first few years, mining will be by surface methods using standard methods of drilling, blasting, and excavating using excavators and truck haulage. This equipment will be leased from a local dealer. The pit will have an oval shape with its long axis oriented along the northeast-southwest strike of the deposit.

To the northeast, the pit is constrained by Gays River and Highway 224. Gays River will be diverted slightly to allow the pit to expand toward the highway. This was incorporated in the project's environmental registration that was approved in 2000.

After the pit reaches an elevation of approximately 480 metres (approximately 50 metres depth), underground development can begin from a portal in the northeast end of the pit, extending along strike to the northeast.

For underground mining of the Northeast Zone, a main haulage drift will be established on the 480 metre level. It will extend from the pit along strike to the northeast. It will pass underneath the river but it will be entirely situated within the competent footwall quartzites. A second decline and portal will be located at the northeast end of the Northeast Zone to provide a second access for the underground workings.

As part of minimising the operational and safety hazards posed by the hanging wall Trench clay, the groundwater table will be lowered below the active mine workings. The cut-and-fill mining method was chosen specifically to address the weak hanging wall issue. The mining method is a modified form of mechanised cut and fill mining. It is a combination of undercut and fill and conventional (overhand) cut and fill mining. It will be mechanised, meaning drill jumbos will do the development and production drilling. LHD's (Load-Haul-Dump vehicles) will muck the broken rock back to re-muck stockpile bays. In narrower stopes, slushers may be used to muck the broken rock. Underground dump trucks will haul the rock to surface.

When processing lower grade, carbonate ore, the mill performs well at production rates of 2,000 tonnes per day (Thornton, 2006 (1)). A production rate of 2,000 tonnes per day is planned for the surface operation. Operating 350 days per year, that translates to 700,000 tonnes of ore per year. That translates to 85 tonnes of dry zinc concentrate per day ( 30,000 tonnes per year) with a concentrate grade of $60 \%$ zinc. The lead concentrate production rate will be 29 tonnes per day ( 10,000 tonnes per year) with a concentrate grade of $75 \%$ lead.

Stripping operations will start at the beginning of the fourth quarter of Year One. Milling will begin two months later, during the eleventh month of Year 1, after a sufficient amount of material has been stockpiled.

Because of the higher grade of the underground ore, a production rate of 1,350 tonnes per day is planned for the underground operation. This is so as not to overwhelm the filtering and drying sections of the mill. Operating 350 days per year, that translates to 472,000 tonnes of ore per year. Because the grades are higher underground, zinc concentrate production during underground mining will increase, despite a slower mine production rate. The zincconcentrate production rate will be 115 tonnes of dry zinc concentrate per day (40,000 tonnes per year) with a concentrate grade of $60 \%$ zinc. The lead concentrate production rate will increase to 54 tonnes per day ( 19,000 tonnes per year) with a concentrate grade of $75 \%$ lead.

The on-site processing plant will concentrate zinc and lead in mineral form (sphalerite and galena, respectively). These separate concentrates will be sold to one or more outside smelters within North America or overseas. The Scotia Mine concentrate has very few impurities and is high grade. Currently, world-wide smelter capacity is under-utilised and the demand for concentrate exceeds what the mines can supply. Therefore, there should be no trouble selling the concentrate.

At the time of report writing, spot prices for zinc and lead were both at historically high levels. The zinc and lead spot prices were approximately \$US 3,590 ( $\$ 1.63$ per pound) and \$US 1,156 per tonne ( $\$ 0.53$ per pound) of refined metal, respectively. The prices of both metals were recovering from near-historic low levels experienced in 2002/2003, when zinc and lead spot prices were approximately \$US 800 and \$US 500 per tonne of refined metal, respectively.

The following economic and technical parameters were adopted for the base case economic scenario:

| Item | Value |
| :-- | :--: |
| Zinc Spot Price |  |
| (\$US/lb) | 1.10 |
| Lead Spot Price |  |
| (\$US/lb) | 0.40 |
| Zinc Treatment Charge |  |
| (\$US/tonne) | 170 |
| Lead Treatment Charge |  |
| (\$US/tonne) | 160 |
| Exchange Rate |  |
| (\$US/\$CAN) | 0.86 |

Using those values, net yearly revenue (after smelting costs) during the surface mining operation will be $\$ 43$ million. For the underground operation, yearly revenue will be $\$ 60$ million.

The purchase price for ScoZinc Limited and all of its assets was $\$ 7.5$ million. Purchasing Savage's $2 \%$ NSR royalty will cost another $\$ 1.45$ million at the end of Year 1. General project capital costs include permitting costs, a highway semi-dump truck for concentrate hauling and office equipment. The mill, which has been under a care and maintenance condition for the past fifteen years, must be cleaned-up and re-commissioned. This will require a relatively minor amount of work (compared with building an entirely new mill). The overall capital cost for the surface mining operation, excluding pre-production stripping, is $\$ 2.9$ million. The surface mobile equipment fleet will be leased.

As the surface mine nears completion in Year 6, the underground mine will start developing. The capital cost for the underground operation is $\$ 5.6$ million.Operating the surface mine and processing plant is expected to cost $\$ 19$ million per year ( $\$ 27$ per tonne of ore or \$US 0.34 per pound of zinc-equivalent). Operating the underground mine and processing plant is expected to cost $\$ 23$ million per year ( $\$ 49$ per tonne of ore or \$US 0.30 per pound of zinc-equivalent). The operating cost for Scotia Mine will be competitive with other major producers.

Reclamation will be an on-going process. The goal will be to minimise the overall land disturbance at any point in time. As much as possible, stripped waste rock and soil will be placed in their final resting places. After the mine is decommissioned, it was proposed to allow the pit to fill with ground and surface water to create a deep lake.

For the base case scenario (\$US 1.10 per pound zinc, \$US 0.40 per pound lead, \$US 0.86 exchange rate), the economic analysis indicated that the project is very profitable. The project's after-tax, net present value using a $8 \%$ discount rate $\left(\mathrm{NPV}_{8 \%}\right)$ was $\$ 73.6$ million. The internal rate of return was $76 \%$. The payback period was twenty-one months. The profitability using other discount rates was:

| $\mathrm{NPV}_{7.5 \%}$ | $\$ 75,687,000$ |
| :-- | :--: |
| $\mathrm{NPV}_{9.0 \%}$ | $\$ 73,628,000$ |
| $\mathrm{NPV}_{10.0 \%}$ | $\$ 66,028,000$ |
| $\mathrm{NPV}_{12.5 \%}$ | $\$ 57,789,000$ |
| $\mathrm{NPV}_{15.0 \%}$ | $\$ 50,723,000$ |
| Internal Rate of Return (IRR) | $76 \%$ |

The surface operation will last almost six years. The underground operation will last more than two years for a total mine life of just over eight years. The best possibility for extending the mine life lies with the adjacent Getty Deposit. There are also In-pit Inferred Resources that could extend the surface mine life.

A sensitivity analysis was carried out to determine the sensitivity of the project's profitability to changes in metal prices, mine dilution, grade, initial capital costs, operating costs and exchange rate. The profitability indicators that were observed were the project's net present value using a $8 \%$ discount rate $\left(\mathrm{NPV}_{8 \%}\right)$ and the project's internal rate of return (IRR). For both the surface and underground operations, the greatest risk for project profitability is metal price fluctuation. The best methods for controlling this risk are mining as quickly as possible and selling forward (hedging) while prices are high.

Water inflow to the underground workings provides a less quantifiable, technical risk to the underground portion of the project. The modified undercut-and-fill mining method that has been adopted for this deposit was designed for very poor ground conditions and offers a high level of protection against potentially unstable ground. Other measures, such as lowering the groundwater table below the level of the mine workings, will also be taken to further alleviate the risk..# Table of Contents

# 3.2 Mineral Lease

Mineral Lease \#90-1, which covers the entire mine site, was originally granted by the Nova Scotia Government to 8 Miminer Canada Lim ited on April 2, 1990. It was originally granted as a Mining Lease.'However, changes to the Nova Scotia Mineral Resources Act that came into effect in November 2004 changed the terminology such that existing Mining Leases'are now known as Mineral Leases."

The anniversary date (review date) of Mineral Lease \#90-1 is April 2 of each year. Table 7 lists the claims comprising the Mineral Lease. Figure 3 shows its location. The lease conveys the rights to all minerals except coal, uranium, salt and potash. The lease was transferred to Savage Resources in 1996 and later to Pasminco Resources Canada Company in 1999. It was finally transferred to ScoZinc in 2002. Savage retains a 2 9 it sm elter return royalty. Acadian has entered into an option agreement that would enable it to purchase the royalty for $\$ .45$ million. The duration of the lease is twenty years, at which time it may be renewed.Table 7: Claims comprising Mineral Lease 90-1.

# 3.3 Surface Rights (Real Property)

ScoZinc owns outright approximately 568 hectares (1,404.6 acres) of land (real property) containing the entire surface infrastructure; the tailings area and most of the outlined mineralisation (Table 8 and Figure 3). The boundaries were established through legal surveys. Details of a title search on the ScoZinc's real property are reported in Appendix 3.

# 3.4 Aggregate Leases

Gallant Aggregates signed a thirty-year lease agreement to mine and remove aggregate from the property for one dollar per tonne of material that is removed from the property. The lease was signed on May 15, 2003 and entitles Gallant, with certain limitations, to mine anywhere on ScoZinc's land. The agreement contains a renewal clause and gives Gallant the right of first refusal to purchase the surface rights (real property titles). A major condition of Gallant's lease is that metal mining takes precedence over aggregate mining. Therefore, Gallant's lease will not interfere with zinc and lead mining operations.

Another, older agreement was made between Seabright and Nova Recreation Development Company Limited (Nova) on December 19, 1985. The 99-year lease gave Nova the right to mine and process sand on ScoZinc's land. Two million tonnes of sand would be left for Seabright's use. Again, the agreement stated that metal mining takes precedence over sand mining. A copy of this lease is attached in Appendix 3.

### 3.5 Environmental Liabilities

An updated Phase I ESA was carried out in conjunction with this Resource/Reserve report. It was completed in March, 2006 by Conestoga-Rovers \& Associates (CRA). CRA (then MGI Limited) also carried out a Phase I ESA in 1996. The updated assessment included several site inspections, during which the following, relatively minor liabilities were identified.Solid waste (garbage) is currently collected and taken to a local landfill. A former on-site landfill is located southwest of the mill. It was abandoned in 1991 and covered with clay till. There is also a scrap yard (bone yard) next to the abandoned landfill. It contains mainly steel refuse, but there are several containers and drums with unknown contents.

The laboratory, located in the mill, contains many containers filled with chemicals, some with unknown contents.

There are several fuel and oil storage tanks both above ground and underground. There is no evidence that these tanks are leaking, but their condition must be assessed before operations begin.

# 3.6 Environmental Permitting Work

A number of reports regarding the environmental conditions at the Scotia Mine site have been completed since the deposit's discovery in the 1970's. These were reviewed as part of the initial Phase I Environmental Site Assessment (ESA) that was completed in 1996.

An updated Phase I ESA, carried out in conjunction with this Resource/Reserve report, was completed in March, 2006 by Conestoga-Rovers \& Associates (CRA). They reported that the following environmental or related permits have been issued for the Scotia Mine site:

1. Industrial Waste Discharge Permit (IWDP) \#88-073, a Milling Permit for Full Scale Operations at the Gays River Mill, 1990.
2. IWDP \#90-007, Lead/Zinc Mine and Mill, 1990;
3. IWDP \#90-023, Transhipment of Lead/Zinc Concentrates from Gays River Mine to Sheet Harbour, 1990;
4. NSDOE Water Rights Permit Authorisation \#2891 and \#2892 for Water Withdrawal from Annand Brook and Gays River, respectively;
5. Excavation Permit E-118 issued September, 1997;
6. Environmental Assessment Approval for full-scale Surface and Underground mining operations; and,
7. Environmental Approval \#2003-037381, issued December 10, 2003 to Gallant Aggregates to construct, operate and reclaim a sand pit on site.

Item 1, the milling permit stipulated that liquid effluent, sound level, and particulate emission monitoring at several stations be carried out. The monitoring requirements have been fulfilled, and all parameters have been within limits, since the permit was issued in 1990. Under the terms of the latest version of Nova Scotia's Mineral Resources Act, milling permits no longer exist. The requirements that had been covered by a milling permit are now included under the Industrial Approval.

Item 2, an IWDP, was almost identical to Item 1, with the addition of total fecal coliform testing, blast monitoring, and waste oil handling stipulations. An amendment to this permit was issued April 20, 1998 to return the mine to "care and maintenance" status. The requirements included maintaining annual groundwater and effluent monitoring starting in October, 1998. Those monitoring activities have been maintained to the present day.Item 3, regarding concentrate shipment to Sheet Harbour, dealt with the prevention and cleanup of concentrate spills.

Item 4, regarding water rights permits, dealt with limits for withdrawing water from Annand Brook (between the tailings pond discharge and Gays River (Main Branch)) and Gays River (Main Branch). The limits were 2650 and 1210 litres per minute. They both expire on December 31, 2006.

Item 6 had to do with the environmental registration of a proposed surface and underground mine. Between 1997 and 2000 work proceeded on an Environmental Registration Document. This document, which was submitted with the regulatory authorities in September 1999, addressed the environmental concerns of a surface and underground mining operation along with the diversion of a 500 metre section of the Gays River to accommodate the pit design. On August 4, 2000 the Open Pit Lead/Zinc Mine and River Diversion Project proposed by Pasminco Resources Canada Company received environmental assessment approval. The approval is still in place; however, because six years have elapsed since approval was granted, the environmental registration document will likely need to be updated before mining can begin. This update will address whether the existing environment has changed since 2000.

Before mining can begin, the existing Industrial Approval for the site must be returned to operating status from its current "care and maintenance" status. This should be relatively straightforward process because the proposed operation is nearly identical to the operation for which the Industrial Approval was originally granted.

The Industrial Approval and Environmental Registration documents are the only environmental permits that are to start production. It will require approximately six months to update those documents.

# 4. Accessibility, Climate, Local Resources, Infrastructure and Physiography

The Scotia Mine property is located approximately fifty-five kilometres northeast of Halifax, Nova Scotia along the border between Colchester and Halifax Counties ( $45^{\circ} 01^{\prime} 55^{\prime \prime}$ North Latitude and $63^{\circ} 21^{\prime} 30^{\prime \prime}$ West Longitude). It lies approximately one kilometre east of the community of Gays River. Access to the property is by paved roads and is approximately fifteen kilometres off the Trans Canada Highway along Route \#224. The Halifax International Airport is located twenty kilometres southwest of the mine site.

A portion of Highway \#224 is subjected to Spring weight restrictions. Truck weights are limited for a period that normally lasts six weeks.

The site lies along the south side of the Gays River main branch, immediately east of the confluence with the Gays River south branch. The deposit is in a rural-residential area of central Nova Scotia that is typified by rolling topography and abundant surface water.Descriptions of the climate at the site are reported as average data collected at the Halifax International Airport. Climate is variable because of mixed continental and maritime weather patterns. Mean annual temperature is $5.9^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, mean annual precipitation is $1,250 \mathrm{~mm}$ and yearly evapo-transpiration is estimated to be 560 mm . The relatively mild climate (for Canada) permits year-round operations.

The Gays River watershed is characterised by gently rolling topography, having a maximum elevation of 170 metres, an extensive cover of deciduous forest, a small population and local agricultural land development. Lakes, ponds and rivers are sparsely distributed throughout the watershed. Typical vegetation consists of northern black spruce, balsam fir and juniper with birch in more wet areas. Areas of open bog occur on part of the claims. Currently, parts of the forest are being harvested or thinned.

The Scotia Mine mill, designed and built in 1978/1979 has a nominal capacity of 1,350 tonnes per day (Figure 4). It was initially built to treat the zinc/lead ore from the Gays River Mine. In 1986, it was modified to treat gold ores using gravity and flotation circuits. In 1989, it was again reworked to treat zinc/lead ore from the Scotia Mine then being operated by Westminer Canada Ltd. ("WMC"). The concentrator has been properly maintained and is ready for quick start-up at minimum cost.

The mill is equipped with two stage crushing, two stage grinding, flotation cells, thickening, disk filtration and rotary kiln concentrate drying. The concentrator building contains a complete analytical laboratory, metallurgical testing laboratory, control room, maintenance area and office facilities. Its total area is approximately 32,000 square feet.

The administration building has an area of approximately 26,000 square feet. It contains offices, a dry, warehouses, workshops, a large boardroom, several heavy equipment bays. Other, smaller surface facilities include:

- a compressor building ( 1,600 square feet);
- a tire shop (2,000 square feet);
- a welding shop;
- a geology building;
- a core shed; and,
- several shipping containers.

Storage and ship loading facilities for lead and zinc concentrates are available at the seaport of Sheet Harbour, a distance of eighty kilometres from the mine site over paved roads. ScoZinc does not own these facilities, but Westminer used them in 1990. Sheet Harbour is a natural harbour on the Atlantic coast that remains ice free in the winter months and can handle vessels up to 40,000 tonnes in displacement. Rail transport facilities have also been used for concentrate shipping. A railway siding is located in Milford, eight road-kilometres from the site. The 500 tonne per hour ship loader that had been installed at the wharf in Sheet Harbour was dismantled in 2005 and brought to the Scotia Mine site.

The existing surface rights are sufficient for mining operations.Power is supplied through the regional grid at reasonable rates. Scotia Mine owns and maintains step-down transformers adjacent to the mill.

Most of the mill's water requirements are satisfied by in-process recycling. Make-up water is drawn from the perennial Gays River.

The existing tailings pond is large enough for the life of the proposed operation. It is located just south of the mill on the footwall side of the deposit. Its design capacity was ten million tonnes. Just over one million tonnes of tailings have been stored there, leaving a current capacity of over eight million tonnes. The proposed operation will generate just over six million tonnes of tailings over the project's life.

There is sufficient area for waste rock and overburden storage on the property. The main area for waste rock storage lies adjacent to the tailings pond on its northwest shore, on the footwall side of the deposit.

# 5. History

The history of the project begins with its discovery in the early 1970's by Cuvier Mines. Cuvier and Imperial Oil Limited (ESSO) carried out exploration work and delineated the mineralised zone which was then identified as being four kilometres long, 220 metres wide with depths varying from 20 to 200 metres. Initial development consisted of an exploration decline driven in 1975/76 with mine development starting in 1978 and mill commissioning in October 1979.

From 1979 until 1981, ESSO operated the mine and targeted the lower grade ore using a lower cost, bulk room and pillar mining method approach. The higher grade mineralisation near the carbonate contact was not part of the mine plan at that time. During this period, 554,000 tonnes of lead/zinc ore was mined with and average grade of $2.12 \%$ zinc and $1.36 \%$ lead (Table 9). Due to low metal prices, problems caused by high rates of water influx and difficult ground conditions, mining was suspended in 1981 and the mine was allowed to flood.

| Total | 740,000 | 1.9 | 3.5 | 18,000 | 38,000 |  |  | 93.25 | 89.27 |

In 1985, Seabright Resources purchased the property and modified the mill circuits to treat gold ore from other Nova Scotian properties.In 1988, Westminer Canada Limited (WMC) purchased Seabright Resources. WMC began dewatering the underground mine in 1989. Their extraction method was to use narrow vein, cut and fill mining to extract the higher grade ore zones. The mine was placed back into operation and reached commercial production in March 1990 (Figure 6 and Figure 7). During the period of operations by WMC, August 1989 to May 1991, the mine produced 190,000 tonnes of ore at an average grade of $7.5 \%$ zinc and $3.5 \%$ lead. Mining was curtailed due to low metal prices, mining method problems and high rates of water influx. Also, for corporate reasons, WMC decided to focus on larger scale mining ventures. Following suspension of mining at Gays River Mine, WMC commissioned several studies to characterise the local hydrology of the mine and to control the ground water in the mine. These results were never tested during mining, since a cyclic low in metal prices, among other factors, prompted WMC to place the property for sale.

Figure 7: Flotation circuit (circa 1990).In late 1996, Savage Zinc, Inc. purchased the Gays River Mine property from WMC and formed a wholly owned subsidiary named Savage Resources Canada Company (Savage). Savage started to rehabilitate the property, shops, equipment and office with the aim of starting production in 1997.

When Savage took over the operation of the former Gays River mining facility, the underground workings were flooded to the surface. After purchasing equipment and hiring employees, the mine dewatering phase started on June 7, 1997. With an installed pumping capacity of 9,000 USGPM, the average pumping rate to reach the 425 metre level was 5,200 USGPM. This level was reached during late August 1997. During this period of dewatering, men and equipment went underground to clean out the workings while management carefully examined the ground conditions. They decided to prepare a mine plan that considered an open pit design. Later, after much review during a period of depressed metal prices, it was decided to abandon the proposed underground mining activities and keep the mine dewatered to the 425 level. The electrical equipment was removed and the pumps were shut off on April 1, 1998. At present the mine is flooded above the portal.

Savage concluded that an open pit operation was feasible and initiated environmental permitting, including provisions for a diversion of a portion of the Gays River. The environmental assessment plan was approved August 2000. The operating plan was never initiated.

A detailed account of the Mineral Lease and exploration claim history is reported in Appendix 2 .

# 5.1 Historical Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve Estimates ${ }^{1}$

Numerous resource estimates have been carried out over the past thirty years since the discovery of the Scotia Mine mineralisation. These resource estimates have been based on differing underlying parameters including varying minimum thickness of intercept, differing cut-off grades, utilisation of zinc equivalent or independent lead and zinc minimum grades, etc. Resource figures have ranged throughout the years from an initial 12,000,000 tons at $7 \%$ zinc-equivalent (drill-indicated) in 1974 (Patterson, 1993) to the 1985 figure of 980,000 tonnes at $5.35 \%$ lead and $9.42 \%$ zinc (mineable) at a $7 \%$ zinc-equivalent cut-off (Hale and Adams, 1985).

Westminer (Nesbitt Thompson, 1991; WMC, 1995) reported resources that were outlined by over 1,300 underground and surface holes in addition to the information derived from the underground workings. The calculations were based on a minimum true thickness of two metres with a cut-off of $7 \%$ zinc-equivalent. The total geologic reserves were quoted as 2,400,000 tonnes averaging $6.3 \% \mathrm{~Pb}$ and $8.7 \% \mathrm{Zn}$ (Table 10). A mineable reserve was also quoted as $1,370,000$ tonnes averaging $5.3 \% \mathrm{~Pb}$ and $9.8 \% \mathrm{Zn}$.

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{1}$ The resource estimates referred to in this section are historical in nature and are quoted as such. These estimates have not been reviewed by the authors of this report and thus should not be relied upon.In 1992, Campbell, Thomas and Hudgins reported that there was potential for mining an additional 800,000 tonnes of lower grade mineralisation via open pit methods. The authors went on to say "there is excellent potential to expand the underground reserves, particularly in the eastern section of the mine. Underground development in the western and central zones resulted in significant expansion of the reserves as ore zone continuity has generally been better than had been originally interpreted from the drill information."

The most recent resource and reserve estimate was carried out in 1998. In Claude Poulin's July 1, 1998 memo titled "Scotia Mine, Mineral Resource Status," he reported the deposit's resources. Higher grade [greater than $7 \% \mathrm{Zn}$-equivalent ( $\% \mathrm{Zn}+0.5 \mathrm{x} \% \mathrm{~Pb}$ )] and lower grade zones (greater than $2 \%$ but less than $7 \%$ ) were outlined by Savage's geologists. The higher grade zone consists of massive sulphide and lies at the contact between the dolomite and the Trench or evaporite units. The lower grade zone consists of disseminated zinc and lead within the dolomite. These outlines were transferred to a block model by Tim Carew, manager of Gemcom Services in Reno, Nevada. Inverse-distance squared weighting was used to calculate block grades. Top-cut values of $15 \% \mathrm{Zn}$ and $10 \% \mathrm{~Pb}$ were used. No dilution or mining recovery factors were applied to the calculations. Undiluted resources are reported in Table 10 .

The reader should note that the Resources were unclassified. They were not separated into Measured, Indicated and Inferred categories "due to the lack of geostatistical information" [Poulin, 1998 (1)]. Those Resources were not entirely independent and did not follow NI 43101 guidelines, as the report predated that Standard.

Reserves were estimated through a pit optimisation process carried out on the Central portion of the deposit. These were reported in Claude Poulin's July 1, 1998 memo titled "Scotia Mine, Mining Reserve Status." Zinc and lead prices were \$US 0.55 and 0.36 per pound, respectively. The optimised pit, which considered diverting Gays River by moving it toward the highway, was sent to Mine Design Associates (MDA) for practical pit design. Savage supplied the economic and geotechnical parameters to MDA. Dilution and recovery factors of $20 \%$ and $90 \%$, respectively, were used.

Reserves included Resources that lie northeast of the highway. These would be accessed using underground methods. For this material, dilution and recovery factors of $25 \%$ and $90 \%$, respectively, were used. The estimated Reserves are reported in Table 10. Those Reserves were not entirely independent and did not follow NI 43-101 guidelines, as the report predated that Standard.

It was discovered during the current Resource estimation process that an error was made when calculating resource and reserve grades during the 1998 estimate. When estimating block grades in the High Grade Zone, lower grade (less than $7 \% \mathrm{Zn}$-Eq) assays in the zone were filtered-out because they were thought to belong to a separate domain. Likewise in the lower grade Disseminated Zone, higher grade (greater than $7 \% \mathrm{Zn}$-Eq) were filtered-out. This incorrectly increased the grade of the high grade zone, which increased the overall resource and reserve grade by approximately $1 \% \mathrm{Zn}$-Eq. The error had less of an effect on the lower grade zone. The error was corrected during the current Resource and Reserve estimate.Table 10: Recent historical resource and reserve estimates.

| Estimator | Category | Tonnes | Zinc <br> Grade | Lead <br> Grade |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Westminer (1991) | "Geologic Reserve" (Undifferentiated) | 2,400,000 | $8.7 \%$ | $6.3 \%$ |
|  | Reserve (Underground) | $1,370,000$ | $9.8 \%$ | $5.3 \%$ |
| Savage (1998) | Resource (Undifferentiated): |  |  |  |
|  | Higher Grade | $1,700,000$ | $11.1 \%^{1}$ | $4.7 \%^{1}$ |
|  | Lower Grade | 3,400,000 | $2.6 \%^{1}$ | $1.3 \%^{1}$ |
|  | Total | $5,100,000$ | $5.5 \%^{1}$ | $2.4 \%^{1}$ |
|  | Reserve (Undifferentiated): |  |  |  |
|  | Northeast (Underground) | 360,000 | $8.6 \%$ | $4.3 \%$ |
|  | Central (Open Pit) | $1,900,000^{1}$ | $4.1 \%^{1}$ | $1.6 \%^{1}$ |
|  | Total | 2,260,000 | $4.8 \%$ | $2.0 \%$ |

${ }^{1}$ It was discovered during the current study that an error had been made during the grade estimation process in 1998.

It should be noted that the above referenced Resources and Reserves estimates were not carried out in accordance with the Canadian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy and Petroleum CIM standards on Mineral resources and Reserve Definitions ("CIM Standards") and therefore do not conform to Sections 1.3 and 1.4 of NI 43-101.

# 6. Regional Geology and Mineralisation

An excellent summary of the regional and deposit geological settings of the Scotia Mine deposit is supplied by Patterson (1993). There is also a recent "special issue devoted to zinclead mineralisation and basinal brine movement, lower Windsor Group (Viséan), Nova Scotia Canada" released as Volume 93 by Economic Geology in 1998. The bulk of the descriptions below are taken from those publications.

The Scotia Mine deposit occurs along the southern margin of the large (more than $250,000 \mathrm{~km}^{2}$ ) and deep (more than 12 kilometres) late Palaeozoic Fundy (Magdalen) Basin, bordered on the northwest by the New Brunswick platform, and on the south by the Meguma platform (Figure 8). During the late Palaeozoic, the Fundy Basin was divided or segregated through a complex series of grabens into deep linear successor basins or sub-basins, which are now interpreted (Fralic and Schenk, 1981) as small pull-apart basins. Subsequent basement subsidence, fragmentation and block faulting produced the irregular pre-Carboniferous topography that was partly filled-in by early Carboniferous clastics, and later flooded by middle Carboniferous seas. Carboniferous sediments consisting of terrestrial conglomerates, and sandstones, siltstones and marine limestones and evaporites, were deposited in this Fundy Basin probably remained active during and after the Carboniferous, and may have had a major impact in the ore-forming process. These sub-basins contained thick accumulations of terrestrial and shallow marine sediments, and therefore could provide substantial volumes of basinal fluids (Ravenhurst, 1987).The Gays River area is underlain by the Cambro-Ordovician metasediments of the Meguma Group which form the pre-Carboniferous basement upon which the Gays River carbonate host rock was deposited. The Meguma rocks were tightly folded during the Acadian Orogeny into long northeast-southwest anticlines and synclines which have been faulted and jointed. Erosion of this basement into irregular knobs and ridges was controlled by these structures prior to the deposition of overlying sediments (the Gays River carbonate). Unconformably overlying the Meguma Group are clastic sedimentary rocks of the Horton Group and marine sedimentary rocks of the Windsor Group which overstep the Horton near the basin margins and rest directly on Meguma basement. It is these Windsor Group carbonates which have been the host for the carbonate-hosted base metal sulphide and associated sulphate deposits in Nova Scotia.

Over 100 base metals occurrences, including a few deposits, are hosted by Lower Windsor Group marine carbonate rocks in Nova Scotia. About half of these occur within the Kennetcook, Shubenacadie, Musquodoboit and River Denys sub-basins. In addition to the Scotia Mine deposit, the most significant examples include the Walton deposit and the Jubilee deposit. Walton has two types of mineralisation: concordant sheets of barite contain lenses of lead-rich and copper-rich mineralisation. Between 1941 and 1978, 4.5 million tonnes containing over $90 \% \mathrm{BaSO}_{4}$, and 0.4 million tonnes containing $0.52 \% \mathrm{Cu}, 4.28 \% \mathrm{~Pb}, 1.29 \%$ Zn and $350 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{t} \mathrm{Ag}$ were produced (Sangster, Savard and Kontak, 1998). At the Jubilee deposit on Cape Breton sulphides cement fault-related breccias and replace adjacent limestone; there are reported, unclassified resources (e.g. Fallara and Savard, 1998) of 0.9 million tonnes containing $5.3 \% \mathrm{Zn}$ and $1.4 \% \mathrm{~Pb}$.![img-7.jpeg](img-7.jpeg)

The Gays River Formation and its lateral equivalent, the Macumber Formation, form the basal carbonate units of the Windsor Group. The underlying 380-400 million-year-old basement rocks consist of greenschist facies meta-turbidites of the Meguma Group that form a northeast-trending, paleotopographic high which separates the Shubenacadie and Musquodoboit basins, and over which the Gays River carbonate bank developed (Kontak, 1998; Savard \& Chi, 1998). The property's stratigraphy is shown in Figure 9. The basement is overlain by a laterally extensive, but discontinuous, talus breccia composed of centimetre- to metre-size, rounded to sub-rounded fragments of Meguma Group lithologies cemented by dolostone. Overlying the basal breccia or directly in contact with the basement rocks is a carbonate build-up composed of various bank and interbank facies: algal, coral and bryozoan bafflestones, skeletal packstones and wackestones. Contours for the top of Goldenville / bottom of carbonate contact are shown in Figure 10. The carbonate bank can be traced basinward into a laterally extensive, thinly laminated, 3 to 18 metre thick argillaceous, bituminous dolostone or limestone unit referred to as the Macumber Formation.

Overlying the carbonate rocks are evaporites (gypsum, anhydrite, halite and minor potash) with minor interbeds of dolostone and mudstone, all of which constitute the Carrolls Corner Formation. Nearby, (5 kilometres to the southwest), the gypsum is being mined at the National Gypsum Quarry.

In the deposit area, the contact between the evaporites of the Carrolls Corner Formation and the carbonates of the Gays River Formation was deeply incised by a palaeochannel during a period of uplift and erosion. It was filled-in by sedimentary debris (boulders, sands, silts, clay and gypsum fragments) to which a Cretaceous age has been assigned. This dense, overcompacted debris has been termed "Trench" material; it occurs adjacent to the massive sulphide mineralisation. Near the contacts, highly permeable, open channel-type structures have caused locally high rates of water flow that have been an impediment to underground mining.

Both the bedrock and "trench" sediments are overlain by 20-40 m of glacial till, which is locally cut by glacial-fluvial sands and gravels. Three geological cross sections are included as Figure 11, Figure 12, and Figure 13. Figure 13 represents the prototypical cross-sectional geology for the deposit.# STRATIGRAPHY - WINDSOR GROUP

The Scotia Mine mineralisation has long been considered a Mississippi Valley-type ("MVT") lead-zinc deposit. Characteristics of sedimentary formations that host MVT lead-zinc mineralisation include shallow-water, shelf-type carbonate rocks with reefs around the peripheries of intracratonic basins, karst structures, limestone-dolomite interfaces and proximity to a major hydrocarbon-bearing basin. The archetypical MVTs occur in the United States in several famous districts surrounding the Michigan-Illinois Basin which also has significant hydrocarbon production. Each of the districts is enormous, with resource potential of 75 million to 750 million tonnes and individual deposits in the order of 1 to 100 million tonnes.

Other MVTs have been mined in the past in Canada (e.g. Pine Point in the Northwest Territories, Nanisivik mine in Nunavut, and Newfoundland Zinc) and in Ireland. MVTs are thought to have formed when hot, basin-derived, oil field-type brines, formed at depth of $>2 \mathrm{~km}$, migrated towards lower pressure areas around the basin periphery. Mineralisation precipitated from the brines when they encountered porous areas like reefs, karst breccias or sedimentary traps.

Sangster and others (1998) draw on their own and others' evidence to conclude that all Windsor Group lead-zinc deposits are epigenetic relative to their enclosing strata, exhibiting both open-space filling and host-rock replacement. At the Scotia Mine deposit, textures (including fossils) have been preserved; representing volume-for-volume replacement of original limestones by dolomite, and the sulphides are, in turn, replacements and porosity fillings within the previously altered host rocks. Kontak (2002) feels that petroleum in fluid inclusions in the Scotia Mine mineralisation suggest a role of hydrocarbons in the mineralising process, like many MVTs, but Sangster and others (1998) point to basement rocks underlying the Palaeozoic sedimentary rocks as the source of the mineralising fluids.

The temperatures of formation of the Scotia Mine deposit (and others in Nova Scotia) are higher than most North American MVTs, and compare more favourably with the clearly epigenetic MVTs of the Central Ireland Basin (Sangster and others, 1998). The Irish deposits also occur in Upper Paleozoic (Carboniferous) carbonate rocks, predominantly in shallowwater carbonates and a mudbank limestone (reef). The Irish deposits are also preferentially associated with east-northeast-trending faults which are thought to have acted as conduits for mineralising hydrothermal fluids; basement lineaments may also have controlled deposition. As with the Scotia Mine, sphalerite and galena are the main sulphides; barite is also usually present (Exploration and Mining Division Ireland, 2004). Seven economic deposits have been mined or are currently in production in Ireland. The largest of these, the world-class Navan deposit, had total production and proven + probable reserves of 82.1 million tonnes containing about $10.6 \% \mathrm{Zn}+\mathrm{Pb}$; its annual production is 2.5 million tonnes of ore. Other producers and former producers had resources between about 8 and 18 million tonnes and grades of 9-25\% Zn+Pb (Exploration and Mining Division Ireland, 2004).

It is noteworthy that two major carbonate-hosted zinc-lead deposits discovered in Ireland since 1986 occur down-dip from areas where considerable exploration, including diamonddrilling, had been carried out over the prior 20 years (Patterson, 1993). Similarly, the MVT deposits of the Viburnum trend in the U.S.A. were discovered at depths of 300 metres by understanding of the regional geology of the hosts rocks of the Old Lead Belt about 80 km away.

# 9. Mineralisation

Nesbitt Thomson Inc. (1991) describe the high-grade mineralisation as consisting of a massive sulphide zone in contact with the evaporite or Trench, ranging in thickness from 0.1 to 5.0 metres and locally containing up to $78 \% \mathrm{~Pb}$ and $57 \% \mathrm{Zn}$. On the footwall of the massive sulphide, there is a zone of disseminated material ( $>7 \% \mathrm{Zn}$ equivalent ${ }^{2}$ ) which, in places, is up to 12 metres in thickness. Locally disseminated mineralisation ( $>2 \% \mathrm{Zn}$ equivalent) extends up to twenty metres into the footwall.

The Scotia Mine deposit is essentially controlled by a sinuous paleo coastline. The main part of the deposit is shallow (generally $<150 \mathrm{~m}$ deep), has a dip length of approximately 100 m and a strike length following the paleo-coastline over a straight line distance of 2 km (Nesbitt Thomson Inc., 1991).

The mineralisation at the Scotia Mine deposit consists of massive and/or disseminated ore hosted predominantly by the carbonate rocks, with extensions down into the basal breccia unit. The massive mineralisation consists of fine-grained ( $<10-20 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ ), Fe-poor, beigecoloured sphalerite and medium to coarse-grained, Ag-poor galena ( $<10-20 \mathrm{ppm} \mathrm{Ag}$ in galena concentrates) (Kontak, 1998; Savard and Kontak, 1998), is restricted to the carbonateevaporite contact and is 1 to 3 metres in true thickness. Disseminated mineralisation, consisting of yellow to orange, millimetre-size euhedral sphalerite and millimetre-tocentimetre-size euhedral galena, fills in primary porosity in the dolomitized carbonates and walls of primary cavities (Kontak, 1998).

Sphalerite and galena constitute about $99.5 \%$ of metallic minerals. Other sulphide minerals are marcasite, pyrite and chalcopyrite, while gangue minerals include calcite, dolomite, fluorite, barite and selenite (Patterson, 1993).

## 10. Exploration History

Lead-zinc mineralisation at Gays River was first mentioned in records dating back to 1824. Knowledge of the occurrence may even go back to the early 1700's when French soldiers reportedly used the lead for making ammunition (MacEachern and Hannon, 1974). Other early references to Gays River lead were made in 1868 by J. W. Dawson in "Acadian Geology" and by H. Howe in "Mineralogy of Nova Scotia".

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{2}$ The parameters used to calculate " Zn equivalent" are unknown, but would have reflected the prices of zinc and lead at the time.The earliest recorded prospecting may have been trenching along the outcrops in 1873-1874. Additional trenching and pit sinking was carried out in 1928. Assessment records do not indicate any resumption of interest in the area until 1951. From the first reports of mineralisation in the area in the early 1800's, exploration activity up to 1950 had yielded best values of $3 \%$ lead (Patterson, 1993).

# 1951

Maritime Barytes Limited acquired the property at Gays River and carried out a surface exploration program involving some trenching and sampling. Gays River Lead Mines subsequently became involved in the evaluation of the property and commenced a drill program to delineate the occurrences of lead and zinc. A total of 67 delineation drill holes were completed by mid-1952 and an additional seven holes were completed for exploration in the vicinity.

The drilling by Gays River Lead Mines Limited outlined four zones of mineralisation in an area about 400 metres by 900 metres. Over 800,000 tonnes of mineralised (galena, sphalerite, pyrite, marcasite and chalcopyrite) Windsor carbonate were defined overlying and flanking a northeast-trending anticlinal Meguma greywacke basement high. Grades for the four zones ranged from $1.10 \%$ to $3.50 \%$ combined lead plus zinc with an average of $2.32 \%$ combined lead plus zinc. Most, if not all, assays were apparently from sludge samples.

## 1962

Gunnex Limited carried out extensive soil sampling in the Gays River area in 1962. Anomalies were encountered only over areas of previously known mineralisation where overburden was thin. An induced polarisation survey indicated only a very weak response over known mineralisation and did not add any new target areas. The lack of encouraging response on the periphery of the earlier defined mineralised area prompted Gunnex to forego any further exploration activity.

## $1968-1969$

In 1968 and 1969 Penarroya Canada Limited completed extensive soil sampling and geological mapping in the Gays River and Meaghers Grant areas. Two diamond drill holes in the Meaghers Grant area intersected minor zinc mineralisation. No drilling was carried out in the Gays River area even though a number of soil anomalies had been identified. Most of the major anomalies corresponded with previously known mineralisation. Two new anomalous areas were, however, defined. They occur near Carrolls Corner and in the Black Brook area east of the Gays River and define a northeast trending geochemical high. The latter area is close to the northeast end of the presently defined Gays River deposit itself.# 1971

Texasgulf Inc. drilled four diamond drill holes in the Gays River area in 1971. One hole adjacent to a Gays River Lead Mines drill hole confirmed significant mineralisation in the carbonates. The remaining holes tested one soil anomaly southeast of Gays River and two areas northwest of Gays River. No encouraging mineralisation or carbonate build-ups were intersected in the last three holes and work was terminated.

## 1972 - 1984

In 1972 personnel of Cuvier Mines Limited ("Cuvier") prospected the Gays River area and located significant mineralised float material to the south of the old occurrence (MacEachern and Hannon, 1974) and subsequently acquired the ground. Cuvier also outlined geophysical and geochemical anomalies. In September of 1972 Cuvier optioned the property to Imperial Oil Enterprises ("Esso") with Esso holding a 60\% interest and acting as the operator. Cuvier formed a joint venture with Preussag Canada Ltd. ("Preussag") to finance Cuvier's $40 \%$ interest in the property.

Both Cuvier and Esso were of the opinion that the area had the proper geological setting for a Mississippi Valley-type deposit. Esso recognised the possible existence of a reef complex trending north-easterly from the old Gays River drilling site. The source of the mineralised boulders had not been located and a combination of deep glacial till and lack of outcrop would necessitate fence-type drilling in geologically favourable areas for the purpose of obtaining geological information as well as locating any mineralised areas.

A total of 20 holes were drilled prior to drilling the discovery hole 2.5 kilometres northeast of the original showing along the postulated reef trend. The discovery hole intersected 3.35 metres averaging $7 \%$ zinc (MacEachern and Hannon, 1974).

From October 1972 to August 1974, Esso/Cuvier drilled off the deposit and identified 12,000,000 tons averaging $7 \% \mathrm{Zn}+\mathrm{Pb}$ (Patterson, 1993) over an area of approximately 4 kilometres by 220 metres at depths ranging from 20 to 200 metres ( 450 surface core holes) ${ }^{3}$.

The initial mine development by Esso began with developing the exploration decline in 1976 across the central portion of the mineralised zone to verify mining conditions, the grade and continuity of the mineralisation and to provide bulk samples for metallurgical testing. The decline was 760 metres in length but by mid-1979 some 1,800 metres of drifting and 744 metres of underground development had been completed. The deepest workings were at a vertical depth of 100 metres. In December of 1977 Esso purchased Cuvier's and Preussag's interests in the property and formed Canada Wide Mines to develop and mine the deposit.

During the next two years various feasibility studies were carried out. Recoverable proven plus probable reserves were then estimated at 4.7 million tonnes at $2.8 \% \mathrm{~Pb}$ and $4.2 \% \mathrm{Zn}$

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{3}$ A summary table of all known drilling at the Gays River deposit by all exploration companies over the years is included as Table 11. A map depicting the location of the surface holes is included as Figure 14.(WMC, 1995). Esso commenced with the construction of the mill and other facilities in August of 1977. The 1,350 tonne processing plant was commissioned in October of 1979 and the mine was further developed to support a 1,350 tonne per day operation.

From 1978 until 1981, Esso operated the mine and targeted the lower grade mineralisation using a trackless, lower cost, bulk room and pillar mining method approach. The higher grade mineralisation near the carbonate contact was not part of the mine plan. Operations continued until August 1981 when production was suspended except for an underhand cut and fill technique test stope. Mining conditions exacerbated by bad ground conditions and excessive water inflow caused the operation to be suspended. During the operation, a total of 553,688 tonnes of mineralised material averaging $1.36 \% \mathrm{~Pb}$ and $2.12 \% \mathrm{Zn}$ were produced and run through the mill - 272,000 tonnes of waste were also removed. Throughout this period efforts to achieve the full production rate, as well as efforts to mine areas of higher grade mineralisation were complicated by the combination of the complex geological setting and the severe hydrological problems.

The plant was shut down in 1982 as a result of operating losses due to lower than expected grades, higher than expected operating costs, the difficult water problems and low metal prices.

Seabright Resources Inc. acquired the mine and mill in 1984 but despite a favourable feasibility study did not reactivate the mine due to depressed metal prices at the time.

# 1985 - 1987

Seabright's primary intention was the usage of the mill facility to process gold ore from their outlying properties, and a secondary intent to later re-open the Gays River mine (WMC, 1995). At the time, Seabright was mining (bulk sampling) gold-bearing quartz veins from four small operations; Beaver Dam, Forest Hill, Caribou and Moose River, all located within the Meguma Group (Cambro-Ordovician).

The milling facility was converted for gold processing. The mine was not re-opened at that time by Seabright as a sharp drop in zinc prices rendered the underground mining operation uneconomic.

## 1987 - 1991

In 1988 Westminer Canada Limited ("WMC") purchased Seabright Resources. A review of the deposit, including the drilling of 89 surface core holes, led WMC to a positive production decision based on a reinterpretation of the geology and mining method. They began dewatering the underground workings in early 1989. Following the success of the mine dewatering and a test mining period to assess the suitability of the proposed narrow vein cut and fill mining method to extract the high grade ore zones, the mine was placed back into production. It reached commercial production rates in March 1990 (WMC, 1995) at a rate of 800 tonnes per day.WMC's initial approach was to drive small $2.5 \times 2.5$ metre cut and fill stopes adjacent to the "Trench" material. Dry waste rock backfill was placed after each lift. In most areas, the method allowed the high grade ore on the carbonate-Trench contact to be extracted. In one area WMC successfully tested the room and pillar mining method (Nesbitt Thomson, 1991). A total of 187,010 tonnes of ore at an average grade of $3.5 \% \mathrm{~Pb}$ and $7.47 \% \mathrm{Zn}$ were mined during WMC's involvement on the property.

Hydrological difficulties causing poor ground conditions continued to play a factor in the mine operation. In May 1991, rising water levels due to the spring run off forced the cessation of mining in a number of stopes and WMC decided to place the mine in project mode. Following the suspension of production in 1991, WMC carried out an extensive program to understand the mine hydrology and concluded that the groundwater could be successfully managed so that mining operations would no longer be adversely affected.

WMC has identified the Eastern zone of the deposit as an area for possible early development because ground conditions are substantially better due to the hanging wall being generally gypsum/anhydrite rather than Trench. The grade is also higher relative to other sections of the deposit. The Eastern area appears promising for additional resources.

WMC thoroughly assessed the property in 1991 and prepared a revised mine plan to resume mine production. The revised plan provided for more mechanisation of the mining method, institution of paste backfill, increased groundwater drainage through screened drainage wells and a revised pumping system. However, the operation was WMC's only lead and zinc producer, was not associated with any downstream smelting facilities and was a smaller operation relative to other corporate assets. For these reasons, the property did not fit within WMC's corporate strategy to focus on large scale operations and for this reason the property was sold to Savage Resources.

# 1996 - 1999

After acquiring the Scotia Mine in 1996, Savage conducted two exploration drilling programs to fill in the gaps from prior drilling and improve the mineral resource estimate on the mine property. In December 1996, 36 diamond drill holes, totalling 1,325 metres were drilled in the central mine area adjacent to the underground mine entrance to test the continuity of the disseminated low grade mineralisation in the back reef (known as the sand pit area -an area of commercial aggregate) ${ }^{4}$. In April and May 1997, an additional 30 diamond drill holes totalling 2,339 metres were drilled in the Northeast zone (as identified by WMC). Both programs were successful and confirmed the presence of low grade (in the central area) and high grade mineralisation (in the Northeast zone). According to Cullen (1997), the results of the drilling (based on a $7 \% \mathrm{Zn}$-equivalent cut-off grade) enhanced some areas of the Northeast zone and diminished other areas. He also states that a complete revision of some of this area (with additional drilling evaluation) be completed prior to any production decision.

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{4}$ Aggregate mining is currently being carried out by a local aggregate company.Savage dewatered the underground workings from June to August 1997 and started to rehabilitate the mine before a decision was made to extract the ore in the main, central zone using open pit methods. An open pit design was prepared using appropriate technical criteria for ore mining and waste stripping (Gemcom and Whittle 3-D Optimisation). The preliminary mine plan assumed the processing of 1,350 tonnes per day with the ore coming from a combination of underground ( 1,000 tonnes per day) and open pit operations ( 350 tonnes per day).

In early 1999 ownership of Savage was transferred to the Australian mining company Pasminco Canada Limited ("Pasminco").

# 2001-2003

Regal Mines Limited (Regal Mines) purchased Pasminco Resources Canada Company (Pasminco Resources) and its assets in February 2002. Regal was owned $50 \%$ by OntZinc Corporation (OntZinc) and $50 \%$ by Regal Consolidated Ventures Limited (Regal Consolidated). As part of the sale, Pasminco Canada Holdings Inc (Pasminco Holdings) retained a $2 \%$ net smelter return (NSR) royalty on future production. OntZinc acquired Regal Consolidated's $50 \%$ interest in December 2002 to own $100 \%$ of Pasminco Resources. Savage Resources Limited is the successor of Pasminco Holdings and currently holds the $2 \%$ royalty. Pasminco Resources was later renamed ScoZinc Limited (ScoZinc). The mining and environmental permits are still in force and are held by ScoZinc along with all the Scotia Mine assets.

## 2004 - Present

Exploration activity by ScoZinc has included diamond core drilling, a hydraulic mining test, prospecting of the general area, geological compilation of past relevant data and two lines (ten samples) of Mobile Metal Ion Geochemistry (MMI) across areas of known mineralisation covered by thick accumulations of glacial till. MMI is a relatively new and powerful geochemical exploration tool that is enabling companies to explore areas that have been previously too difficult for surface geochemistry. The results of the MMI survey were inconclusive.

A hydraulic mining test was performed to determine whether such a method might be useful to uncover the glacial overburden and some of the Trench material in the area of the low grade potentially open-pitable resources. This was primarily performed near the area of the sand pit next to the original portal.

At the bottom of the existing "sand pit," there is very little soil (average of two metres) covering the flat-lying dolomite. Based on diamond drilling results, the dolomite contains galena and sphalerite in low, but potentially economic concentrations. The intention of the excavation work was to remove the soil from the dolomite to better characterize the potential resource. In the process, the possibility of using dredging to strip overburden was evaluated, utilizing a small dredge that would pump a soil/water slurry from the pit floor through atemporary, plastic pipeline to a small, purpose-built settling pond. The soil would settle in the pond and the decanted water would flow back to the portal pond through a short network of ditches. The design capacity of the settling pond was approximately $13,000 \mathrm{~m}^{3}$. The total footprint of the pond was approximately $8,200 \mathrm{~m}^{2}$.

It was originally intended that the dredge would operate and would enlarge the pond as it dredged, gradually moving out of the pond and over the bedrock. However, there was not enough water depth over the bedrock to allow the dredge to work properly.

Bulldozers were used to push material toward the dredge, but the productivity of the bulldozers was far less than the dredge's productivity. As a result, the dredge operated at only a fraction of its capacity.

Generally, the test showed that it is possible to mine the sandy overburden in the current pit bottom using dredging methods.

A commercial aggregate sand deposit (fine aggregate for concrete and masonry mortar or grout) on the property was operated under lease by an independent company. The lease required the sand operation to conduct its activities such that it did not interfere with the metal mining and milling operations. The lease also made provision for free access to the sand deposit for material required in the mining operation.

Six holes were drilled through the Trench using a soil drilling rig. The Trench is a geological unit that separates the gypsum and dolomite units. The purpose of this program was to characterize the soils that make up the Trench. Four holes were drilled in the Central Zone near the current pit. The two other holes were drilled near the highway (Hwy 224) in the East Zone.

The holes in the Central Zone around the current pit consisted mainly of dark brown clay with fine-to-medium grained sand. Rock fragments, rounded-to-angular, were occasionally noted.

The holes in the East Zone near the river and highway consisted of fine-to-medium grained sand with minor clay. This observation may be an important factor during future mining. Permeability underneath the river is expected to be high to a depth of at least 20-30 metres. This will adversely affect slope stability should the walls of an open pit approach the river.

Twenty five diamond core drill holes ( $1,845.3$ metres) were completed by ScoZinc on the Scotia Mine property. Seventeen of these holes were meant to further define the lead and zinc mineralisation contained within the reef carbonate while the remaining eight holes were meant to test the gypsum potential immediately overlying the mineralised zones.

Four holes ( 477 metres) were completed in the north-eastern portion of the deposit while thirteen holes ( 1,172 metres) were completed in the central area of possible lower grade open pit mineralisation. The program was moderately successful in the central area with zinc values consistently in the 2 to $4 \%$ range over 1 to 2 metres (Table 11). The drilling program in the north-eastern zone proved less successful with mineralised intervals being quite thin.Four holes ( 673.3 metres) were drilled in the northeast zone and an additional four in the central area to test the overlying gypsum in the hanging wall of the base metal mineralisation. The holes were drilled to obtain core samples of the gypsum deposits that immediately overlie the mineralised zones. The purpose of the samples was to carry out early tests of gypsum consistency and quality as well as to confirm preliminary estimates of the probable size of the gypsum resource adjacent to the mineralised trend.

In most holes, a gypsum "cap," 20-30 metres thick was encountered. Grade was highest (greater than $90 \%$ gypsum) near the bedrock surface and decreased with depth. At 2030 metres depth, gypsum grade dropped below $80 \%$, transitioning to anhydrite over an interval of approximately ten metres. Because the gypsum was quite hard, it was difficult to visually determine the contact between gypsum and anhydrite.

# 11. Drilling

To date, over 1,300 diamond core drill holes have been drilled on the Scotia Mine property (Figure 14, Figure 15 and Table 11). The majority were drilled to determine the characteristics of the zinc- and lead-mineralised dolomite. Eight holes were drilled in 2004 to determine the characteristics of the gypsum hanging wall rock.

Most of the 896 surface holes were drilled vertically. The azimuth and dip of the 467 holes drilled from the underground workings was variable.

Generally, holes were drilled so as to fully penetrate the dolomite reef and continue on until no more mineralisation is found. Generally, holes were drilled a few metres beyond the dolomite reef.

A compilation of core logs and sample assays is given in Appendix 6. The sample intervals do not necessarily represent true widths. The orientation of the mineralisation is well known and is described in Section 8.![img-13.jpeg](img-13.jpeg)

[^0] [^0]: ${ }^{5}$ Data supplied by ScoZinc. ${ }^{6}$ The electronic database does not contain information for underground holes 342-499.# 11.1 Sample Statistics

Sample statistics were calculated for sampling within the carbonate. All samples for which at least one metal (zinc or lead) was assayed were considered. Most samples were assayed for both zinc and lead. Depending on the amount of visible mineral, some samples were assayed for only one metal. The total sample count was 8,022 .

The mean sample interval length was 1.44 metres with a standard deviation of 0.82 metres (Table 12). Skewness is a measure of symmetry, or more precisely, the lack of symmetry. The positive value for skewness indicates that the data is skewed right, meaning that the right tail is heavier than the left tail. This is also shown in the histogram in Table 13. The aggregate sample length was 11,522 metres.

The mean zinc grade was $3.55 \%$. From the histogram, we can see that zinc assays are approximately lognormal. The range in zinc content was zero to $62.10 \%$. Theoretically, the maximum possible zinc assay is $67.10 \%$ - the zinc content of pure sphalerite.

The mean lead grade was $1.91 \%$. From the histogram, we can see that lead assays are also approximately lognormal. The range in lead content was zero to $79.50 \%$. Theoretically, the maximum possible lead assay is $86.6 \%$ - the lead content of pure galena.

# 12. Sampling Method and Approach

There is no written record regarding the sampling method employed during the early exploration years (i.e.: pre-1970's) in the Scotia Mine area.

The exploration approach and sample collection procedures employed by the more recent exploration efforts reflects thorough sampling methodology and documentation procedures. Exploration activity was carried out in a professional manner by a team of local, experienced geologists and technicians supervised by Esso's, Seabright's, Westminster's, Savage's and ScoZinc's professional staff. The work has been well organised throughout their exploration efforts and more recently computer facilities were available to generate reports and prepare maps, etc. from the vast database.

The assay data and other parameters for all core drilling programs and underground work were entered into a computerised database using Microsoft Excel and resource-generating software programs. The quality control and validation of the coded data included steps to ensure that the assay intervals and the sample locations were correct. To ensure accuracy of the database, all assays were coded and the data entry system automatically checked for interval overlaps. The coded assays were also printed and a visual inspection was completed for comparison with the original (logged) data sheets. The sample locations were validated with appropriate plotting and visual checks against the original sections and plans.Core drilling was carried out using North American service providers with the collection of BQ and NQ core. The portions of core to be analysed were either split or sawed into two sections with one half submitted for analysis, the other half remaining in the core tray. All sampling procedures were carried out on site.

Sampled core lengths were determined visually. All drill holes were logged, noting lithology, structure, alteration and mineralisation. Core recovery was generally greater than $90 \%$. Early in the exploration program, the samples were been sent via air cargo to several analytical laboratories; however, after the construction of the mill facility, the internal laboratory was used.

# 13. Sample Preparation, Analysis and Security

Core samples from Savage's 1997 drilling program and ScoZinc's 2004 drilling program were submitted to the Minerals Engineering Centre of Dalhousie University (formerly Technical University of Nova Scotia) in Halifax. The laboratory was not International Standard Organisation (ISO) accredited.

According to the Minerals Engineering Centre; the core sample preparation procedure was as follows. The samples were dried, and then crushed in one or more jaw crushers, depending on the original size, to under one-quarter inch. The sample was then split in a Jones riffle to a mass of 150-200 grams. The sample was then pulverised using a ring and puck pulverisor to $80 \%$ minus 200 mesh ( 75 microns). Then it was put into either a bag or a vial. Rejects were kept for six months.

The sample analysis procedure consisted of the following: one gram sample lots were digested with hydrochloric-nitric-hydrofluoric-perchloric acids. Elements were determined by Flame Atomic Absorption with detection limit of 1 ppm . Arsenic was determined by atomic absorption/hydride generation method.

Soil and rock samples may also be digested with aqua regia only to partially extract soluble elements. On a 10 gram sample, the detection limit is 0.1 ppm for base metals. The arsenic detection limit is 1 ppb on a 10 gram sample using the hydride generation atomic absorption technique.

Reference standards from CANMET were routinely used as internal checks on the accuracy of the analysis.

## 14. Data Verification

The author has reviewed the sampling results and verified that the sample types and density are adequate for establishing Resources and Reserves. The sampling results are representative of the mineralisation. The available information and sample density allow a reliable estimate to be made of the size, tonnage and grade of the mineralisation in accordance with the level of confidence established by the Mineral Resource categories in the CIM Standards.# 14.1 Database Validation

A sample of 59 drill holes (4.3\%) was selected for database validation. The collar locations, downhole survey data, geological logs and assay data in the database was compared against the original, written logs.

### 14.1.1 Methodology

ScoZinc provided scanned original drill logs in Adobe .pdf format. An up-to-date copy of the electronic database of all drill hole information was also provided. An additional data file of drill hole co-ordinates was supplied as many of the original drill logs did not have coordinates.

A total of 59 holes were selected (Table 14). Most of the holes were located within areas with the highest economic potential, but the selection process also strived to provide good coverage for the whole deposit. This amounted to $4.3 \%$ of the more than 1400 holes drilled on the property.

Print-outs were made of the relevant sections of each of the holes and also of the assay data of the corresponding assay intervals The assays were printed on the reverse of the drill logs. Coordinates on the log and database were manually compared.

### 14.1.2 Results

The data in the Excel database and original drill logs were manually compared. They were found to be, for the most part, comparable. Many of the original drill logs, both underground and surface, did not have collar co-ordinates or downhole survey data. Another database was located that contained the required information. It is more than likely that the holes were surveyed and the information filed in a separate location from the original logs.

# S 69

Data base 73.76-75.59 lead 0.01\% Original Log 73.76-75.59 lead 0.32\%

## S110

Assay data for database match that on original log. However, a hand-written correction on the log shows reduced lead and zinc values.

## S 663

Minor sample depth errors - not significant.

## S703

Assays on original log for interval 89.0-99.83 metres not shown. These were likely assayed at a later date.

## S 726

Assay section on original log 77.72- 83.82 m (6.1m) used on database. Original log interval was corrected by hand at a later date to $2 \mathrm{ft}$. $(0.61 \mathrm{~m})$

## U 129

Sample from 115 '-125' (10') misread as 115' -128' (13'). Written entry on original log looks like 128'.

## U218

Azimuth on database shows 235 degrees, which is consistent with other angle holes with the same co-ordinates. However, a listing in another database shows an azimuth of 180 degrees. It is more than likely that the database listing is correct.

### 14.1.3 Conclusion

With the exception of Hole S 110 and S 726 where significant assay intervals and values were involved, the remainder of the holes do not represent any factor that would change the status of the deposit. In general, the data transfer from the original logs was of high quality and the database was considered a valid representation of the mineral deposit.

### 14.2 Verification Sampling

The Scotia Mine property was visited by Mr. Reg Comeau of ACA Howe (Howe) on June 17 and June 21 and on September 22 and September 26, 2004 in order to become familiar with the area and to conduct verification sampling on the property. Split, random, core samples were inspected and sampled from the site on the second visit from the 2004 drilling campaign in the area of the proposed low grade open pit in the central portion of the deposit as well as the higher grade zone in the Northeast zone. A second set of core samples from the 1997 drilling campaign were later collected by Mr. Doug Roy.

Samples from 1997 and 2004 drilling campaigns were collected, packaged and independently shipped by Reg Comeau. All samples were taken from the remaining half core samples in the core boxes and were sawed in half reflecting a quarter core sample. The remaining quartercore was left in the core tray. The samples were packaged and shipped to ACA Howe's office in Toronto, then shipped to and analysed by SGS Toronto. The comparison of assay results is shown in Table 15.

SGS is an internationally recognised organisation that operates over 320 laboratories worldwide and has ISO 9002 certification for many of their laboratories. In North America, the central laboratory is located in Toronto with specialised laboratories located in Red Lake, Ontario and Rouyn-Noranda, Quebec. The SGS Toronto office is an ISO 9002 registered geochemical laboratory and the centre for SGS' international geochemical network.

Each SGS Canada branch office specialises in areas of independent testing, inspection and certification services. SGS Canada is certified or accredited by a wide variety of independent, third party programs such as Agriculture Canada, the Standards Council of Canada and ISO 9000. The comparison of analytical results between SGS and the original 1997 samples and the samples from the 2004 drilling program (analysed at Minerals Engineering Centre of Dalhousie University) was excellent. The author is satisfied that the assay data base for the property is sound and sufficient to guide the next exploration phases of the programs.

The "Getty Deposit" is located on contiguous land to the immediate northwest of the Scotia Mine deposit on lands presently set aside by the provincial government (Figure 3). The deposit was discovered at approximately the same time as the Scotia Mine deposit by a joint venture enterprise consisting of Getty Mining Northeast Limited and Skelly Mining Company.

A potentially viable lead zinc deposit was outlined which, although perhaps not economic on its own, might prove successful if incorporated as part of the ScoZinc overall resources. Both open pit and underground areas of potential development have been defined.

Drilling activity defined potential lead-zinc ore in one, possibly two, open pitable zones and in two possible underground zones. The deposit overlies a northward projecting segment of the Meguma greywacke high that continues south-westerly through the Carrolls Corner area. An irregular conglomeratic and breccia unit at the base of the Windsor Group locally overlies the basement and is in places interbedded with units at the base of the overlying carbonate section. Thicknesses as great as 30 metres are attained in what may represent talus-type deposition. The conglomerate is composed of angular to sub-rounded and unsorted Meguma Group lithologies cemented by finely crystalline dolostone. The contact with overlying carbonates of the Windsor Group is often gradational with Meguma clasts decreasing in quantity upwards until only carbonate is present.

### 15.1 Geology

When Mississippian seas covered this area, the biogenic activity was concentrated along, around and on top of this and other basement highs. Local reefal development occurred and it is mainly within these reefal carbonates that the lead-zinc mineralisation is located. The carbonates are predominantly dolostone. Buff to grey, finely bedded algal units account for much of the carbonate accumulation. Irregular zones rich in brachiopod, gastropod and bryozoa assemblages and algal stromatolites and coral growth account for the remainder of the carbonate build-up.

The northward projecting, undulating reefal structure now covers an area approximately 1,250 metres east-west by 600 metres north-south. The reef developed along the flanks of, and eventually over most of the Meguma basement high during early Mississippian time. Carbonate accumulations are minor near the axis of the basement high and then to a maximum of approximately 40 metres on the flanks. The reef may have extended much higher prior to erosion. From the present maximum thickness along the flanks the carbonates rapidly thin basin ward to less than 2 metres within a lateral distance of as little as 60 to 70 metres. Further out from the basement high the carbonate grades laterally into muddy carbonate, limy shale, mudstone and non-calcareous sandstones.

A thick evaporitic sequence with minor shale and carbonate beds pinches out against the reefal carbonates overlying the basement high. As a result, the evaporite beds are usually thinnest near the Meguma high and rapidly thicken with distance away from the reef.Although the evaporite beds are thin or absent on top of the basement high, the thickness exceeds 400 metres about 1 kilometre of the seaward side of the reefal complex.

The deposit is overlain completely by poorly sorted glacial till, the thickness of which ranges from 3 metres to 100 metres. The maximum thicknesses are encountered in the evaporite pinch-out zone.

# 15.2 Mineralisation

Lead-zinc mineralisation has been delineated within three separate zones on the original Getty/Skelly lands but confined to a more or less continuous reefal complex. The Southeast mineralised zone lies immediately south of the village of Gays River and is an extension of the original Gays River deposit. Both the central and southwest zones are west of the main highway. The central zone is crescent-shaped and conforms to the shape of the reefal complex developed around the northerly protruding paleo-topographic high. Minor mineralisation has been located between the three main zones.

Sulphide mineralisation is found throughout the reefal carbonate complex as well as in the carbonate matrix of the underlying conglomeratic unit. Galena and sphalerite are the main sulphide minerals with pyrite, marcasite and chalcopyrite present in minor to trace amounts. Strong zones of mineralisation occur throughout all sections of the conglomeratic and reefal rock units with no apparent preference for specific horizons. There is, however, a tendency for the higher grade mineralisation to occur along the flanks of the carbonate reef which appears to represent the general fore-reef area. The Gays River deposit also contains its more massive mineralised zones along the fore-reef area to the northwest of the reefal trend with lesser amounts of ore-grade material along the reef crest.

The sphalerite is honey yellow to light buff, finely crystalline and generally tends to occur as irregular disseminations in weak to intense concentrations varying from discrete segregated crystals to concentrations greater than $10 \%$ but can also occur as semi-massive to massive seams along bedding planes, coating fossils, and infilling vugs.

Galena is less abundant than sphalerite and often occurs as fine to medium size cubic crystals. It is found throughout the carbonate and conglomeratic sections most commonly as irregular disseminations in high to low concentrations as discrete crystals to concentrations greater than $10 \%$. It also commonly occurs as irregular veins and semi-massive to massive seams.

Based on a $1.5 \%$ zinc-equivalent cut-off grade $(1 \% \mathrm{~Pb}=0.6 \% \mathrm{Zn}$ in 1975 and a minimum core length of 3 metres) resources at the Getty deposit were estimated by Hudgins and Lamb (1992) at 4.5 million tons at an average grade of $1.3 \% \mathrm{~Pb}$ and $1.9 \% \mathrm{Zn} .^{7}$

Within the mill building, in addition to the lead and zinc processing equipment, is a complete analytical and metallurgical laboratory. Provision for replacing some of the analytical equipment have been made in the capital cost section (Section 19.12) of the economic analysis.

The very high grade of the concentrates, coupled with the absence of any appreciable amount of elements that complicate the smelting process, make the concentrates desirable material for smelter operators. In the past, WMC trucked the concentrates from the mine site to the storage and loading facility at Sheet Harbour. Rail transport facilities have also been used.

Scotia Mine's past production history is reported in Table 9. The expected metallurgical balance, based on the past performance of the mill, is reported in Table 16. A complete description of the mineral processing operation is reported in Section 19.3.

Surface Resources were calculated by Tim Carew, P.Geo., who was a co-author of this report and is a Qualified Person under Section 1.1 of National Instrument 43-101.

Underground Resources, in the Northeast Underground Zone, were calculated by Douglas Roy, M.A.Sc., P.Eng., who was this report's Principal Author and is a Qualified Person under Section 1.1 of National Instrument 43-101.

### 17.1 Surface Resources

### 17.1.1 General

The deposit is characterised by complex geometry and is difficult to model in terms of standard techniques. Lying along a 'paleo-shoreline', it features repetitive changes in strike of $90^{\circ}$ and more around a general trend of $060^{\circ}$ Azimuth, and with varying dip.

The deposit has been mined by underground methods in the past and is therefore intersected by numerous openings along the hanging wall contact. This geometry makes it difficult to incorporate the true spatial relationship of the samples for estimation purposes without the use of 'unfolding' techniques that transform the sample data into another co-ordinate space that honours the spatial relationships. Variography and estimation are conducted in the transformed space, and the results are then back-transformed into the original space.

### 17.1.2 Geological Modelling Approach

The drill-hole data entered in the database was displayed in 3D graphics mode (G4W), and a number of triangulated surfaces (TINs or Triangulated Irregular Networks) were created to represent the base of the overburden, and the lower and upper contacts of the carbonate (ore) horizon. The surfaces were developed by selecting the relevant down-the-hole intersects (with interactive inspection and adjustment), and calculating a best-fit plane through the data points derived. The selection process for the underground holes was complicated by the fact that some holes were drilled from footwall to hanging-wall, and some in the opposite direction. To assist in differentiating the contacts, a new field (T/B) was added to the Geology table of the database to contain a numeric code designating the contact as either a top or bottom contact. Codes were also defined to designate carbonate intervals that were either the first or the last interval in a hole, indicating that the hole had been either collared or ended in carbonate. The codes were calculated by a formula in the original Excel spreadsheets and then merged into the 'T/B' field in the Geology table. The drill-holes were grouped by orientation (vertical up, vertical down and inclined) to further facilitate this process. A smooth 3D surface through the active data was then created by Laplace interpolation, relative to the best-fit plane.

Topographic contour data derived from the AutoCAD drawing files provided was utilised to create a TIN of the original topography over the project area.A 3D solid of the carbonate formation was initially created from the top and bottom surfaces developed above. In the initial absence of detailed geologic plans and sections, the surfaces used were based solely on drill hole intersections. The drill holes utilised were the surface holes, up-holes from underground, and horizontal underground holes that had clearly defined 'top' and 'bottom' contacts, as designated by the 'TJB" numeric code described above. A set of 3D solid models of the existing underground development and stope areas developed by Mr. Bruce Hudgins of Hudgtec Consultants was imported from the AutoCAD DXF files provided. It should be noted that these solids could not be validated in G4W, indicating that they were probably not completely closed. This problem again reflects the complexity of the models, but does not significantly affect the results of volume determinations or block model 'stamping' in G4W.

Subsequent Inspection of the 3D solid in section and plan indicated that although the overall geometry of the deposit was being honoured, there were significant variances from existing manual interpretations and underground mapping in a number of areas. After a number of reinterpolations utilising both drill-hole and digitised data, it was concluded that inconsistencies in lithological coding in the drill holes would negate the contact modelling approach.

It was further decided that manual interpretation was required, and that the ore zone be differentiated into a high-grade massive sulphide zone and a low-grade disseminated zone. Drill-hole data and underground openings were then plotted on hard-copy plans at ten metre intervals, and interpretations of the high-grade zone, the low-grade and the hanging-wall 'Trench' were produced. The cut-off grades that were for the high- grade and low-grades zones were $7 \% \mathrm{Zn}-\mathrm{Eq}$ and $2 \% \mathrm{Zn}-\mathrm{Eq}$ respectively. These values were selected to correspond with cut-offs utilised in earlier resource evaluations. The plan-view interpretations were digitised as closed polygons, then tied together in the solids modelling system to create separate 3D solid models of the high-grade, low-grade and trench zones of the deposit. This work was completed by Mr. Peter Irwin, of Resource Data Management Inc., under contract to Savage Resources Canada Co. The geometric complexity of the deposit is reflected in the large number of tie lines required to adequately control the triangulation process utilised to create 3D solid models. The modelling was, therefore, time consuming but produced valid solids for the ore and trench zones. These models were adopted for use during the previous resource estimate in 1998 (Carew, 1998) and again for the current resource estimate.

# 17.1.3 "Unfolding" Process

As stated in Section 17.1.1, the deposit is characterised by complex geometry and is difficult to model in terms of standard techniques. An 'unfolding' technique was used that transformed the sample data into another co-ordinate space while honouring the spatial relationships.

The Gemcom ${ }^{\circledR}$ unfold application was used for the transformation in this case. This approach is based on the concept of slabs - a slab being a region of space that is topologically equivalent to a cube. The edges are 3D polylines and are not necessarily straight from end to end. Each face is defined by four polylines on its perimeter and the nominally vertical edges of the slab may also have more than two points. The geological feature of interest, e.g. a folded and/or faulted vein or seam is broken down into a collection of adjacent slabs, the onlyproviso being that any two adjacent slabs must share an entire common face. The algorithm highlights three of the edge polylines of a representative slab that are nominally orthogonal and allows them to be associated with $\mathrm{X}, \mathrm{Y}$ and Z axes of the unfolded space. All of the polylines are then categorised into three sets of lines corresponding to these unfolded axes. The unfolded slabs are displayed below the original polylines, and the unfolded lines will be aligned approximately to the $\mathrm{X}, \mathrm{Y}$, and Z axes. The average length of each of the sets is calculated and a nominal graticule size, or spacing, is entered. The unfolding transformation includes two graticules - one for the folded region and one for the unfolded region. The points in the two graticules have an exact 1:1 correspondence, which provides for a check that the transformation will be reasonable. If any graticule cells are highly skewed, for example, the folded region can be subdivided into smaller slabs. In addition, the interior vertices can be allowed to slide on the various sets of lines in order to minimise distortion.

The graticule points are simply samples of the transformation, and are connected by straight lines to make the visualisation easier. Various combinations of the sliding axes can be experimented with, particularly in cases where the polyline lengths along the feature are different, in order to minimise the distortion in these cases. The 3D polylines were generated by contouring the 3D solid of the mineralised carbonate developed for the deposit in earlier studies at 10 m plan intervals, as the original polylines are no longer available. These polylines were subdivided into a series of smaller adjacent slabs corresponding to the alternating strike direction of the deposit. A section showing the slabs and the allocation of the association with the unfolded axes is illustrated in Figure 16. The unfolded space is illustrated later in Figure 21 .
![img-17.jpeg](img-17.jpeg)

Figure 16: 3D Polyline slabs and axes.

The basic procedure is as follows:

- Creation of the unfolding transformation;- Forward transformation (unfold) of the sample data points;
- Variography and block modelling in the transformed space;
- Back-transformation of the estimated block data ( Zn and Pb ) into normal (folded) space; and,
- Allocation of the values to a block model in normal (folded) space by nearest neighbour interpolation.


# 17.1.4 Drillhole Data

A subset of the overall drillhole database was utilised for estimation purposes, comprising those drill holes that intersected the 3D solid model of the carbonate mineralisation. This subset comprises 623 holes and includes both surface and underground drilling.

### 17.1.5 Mineralised Envelope

The mineralised envelope for estimation purposes was restricted to the carbonate material within the 3D solid models created from plan view interpretations. These interpretations and 3D model are regarded as the most representative constraints on the mineralisation available. Separate 3D models were developed for the low grade, disseminated portion of the deposit, and for the less continuous high grade zone that lies along the footwall contact, and which was exploited by previous underground mining.

### 17.1.6 Statistical Analysis and Capping

The sample sets for zinc and lead mineralisation comprised those assay intervals falling within the 3D solids and were compiled separately for the low-grade (LG) and high-grade (HG) zones. The sample statistics, histograms and probability plots are shown in Figure 17 and Figure 18.

While both Zn and Pb assay grades exhibit fairly typical positively skewed distributions, the Pb values exhibit evidence of a multi-modal distribution, with a set of values falling in the 0.01 to $0.1 \%$ range - this may be related to the use of arbitrary and variable values for detection limits in the Pb data. In general, Zn and Pb values are not particularly well correlated, with a correlation coefficient of 0.32 . There is also some evidence of possible misclassification of some values between low grade and high grade zones in both cases, either in terms of original typing, or in geometric boundary effects relative to the 3D solids. The Zn values are generally well behaved, with relatively low Coefficients of Variation (COV), whereas the Zn values exhibit a relatively high COV.

Whereas initial studies on the deposit by Savage Resources Canada Co. considered a capping value of $13 \%$ on both Zn and Pb , examination of the probability plots indicates that although the number of high values steadily decreases, the upper tail for the all distributions are fairly continuous and unbroken up to values considerably higher than this, suggesting that higher capping values could be utilised. In later studies, discussions with Savage personnel led to an alternative approach in which the high-grade outliers in the distributions were retained in thedata set prior to any compositing, but severely restricted in terms of interpolation. Block centroids were required to be within 5 metres of the sample before it could be used in the estimation of the block in question. Given the indication that higher capping values could be considered, and to maintain consistency, this approach was retained for this study. No grade capping was applied prior to compositing, but the range restriction was subsequently applied in estimation for Zn and Pb composites above $26 \%$.![img-18.jpeg](img-18.jpeg)

![img-20.jpeg](img-20.jpeg)# 17.1.7 Compositing

Equal length composites were prepared from uncut assay values in a two step process. Initial composite intervals were defined from the intercepts of the drill holes with the high-grade and low-grade 3D solids of the mineralised zone. Equal length composites of 1.5 metres were then generated within these intervals - 1.5 metres is approximately the average length of the assay intervals. Residual intervals of less than 1.5 metres at the top and bottom contacts were retained if the length was at least $0.6 \mathrm{~m}(40 \%$ of composite length). Intervals less than 0.6 m in length were discarded. The low-grade composites set was further subdivided into those falling below 490 m elevation (below which the deposit dips at varying angles) and those above 490 m where the deposit is essentially flat-lying. The composite statistics and histograms for the overall high grade and low grade Zn and Pb are shown in Figure 19.

### 17.1.8 Variography

Three dimensional experimental correlograms were generated using the transformed (unfolded) Zn and Pb composite data, for both low-grade and high-grade mineralised zones below an elevation of 490 m . Separate 3D experimental correlograms were generated using un-transformed composite data for the low-grade mineralised zone above 490 m elevation, where the deposit is essentially horizontal in attitude. Nested correlogram models comprising nugget effect and two spherical components were fitted to all experimental variograms as tabulated in Table 17 and shown in Figure 20.

![img-24.jpeg](img-24.jpeg)# 17.1.9 Specific Gravity/Density

No evidence of specific gravity test work was available. Therefore, a formula for specific gravity based on zinc and lead grades was used for the mineralised zones. This formula, which was also used by Savage Resources for their 1998 resource estimate, was:

$$
\mathrm{SG}=1 /(\mathrm{Pb} \% /(86.6 \times 7.6)+\mathrm{Zn} \% /(67.0 \times 4.0)+(1-\mathrm{Pb} \% / 86.6-\mathrm{Zn} \% / 67.0) / 2.7)
$$

A default density of $2.7 \mathrm{t} / \mathrm{m}^{3}$ was utilised for mineralisation where grade data was not available. The densities utilised for other materials were:

| Evaporites (Average) $2.40 \mathrm{t} / \mathrm{m}^{3}$ |  |
| :-- | --: |
| Quartzite | $2.65 \mathrm{t} / \mathrm{m}^{3}$ |
| Overburden and Trench | $2.00 \mathrm{t} / \mathrm{m}^{3}$ |

### 17.1.10Block Model and Grade Interpolation

Two block models were constructed for interpolation purposes, a primary model in normal (un-transformed) space, and a secondary, smaller model in transformed space for interpolation of the un-folded data. The primary block model was defined to cover the volume of interest, and has the following Gemcom ${ }^{\circledR}$ parameters:

| Origin: | $7200.00 \mathrm{E} / 6592.82 \mathrm{~N} / 375.00 \mathrm{AMSL}$ (Lower Left) |
| :-- | :-- |
| Block Size: | $5 \mathrm{~m} \times 5 \mathrm{~m} \times 5 \mathrm{~m}$ |
| Columns: | 160 |
| Rows: | 400 |
| Levels: | 45 |
| Rotation: | $-60^{\circ}$ (To align with overall strike of deposit - Azimuth 060) |

The primary block model is configured as a 'partial' block model, which allows the percentage of various rock types within the block to be stored and utilised for manipulation and reporting purposes. The rock type model was initialised with the default rock code for air and all blocks below the topographic surface were set to the Evaporites (gypsum) rock code. The model was then overprinted with rock codes for the overburden, Trench and Goldenville (quartzite) using 3D solids created from surfaces and sectional interpretations. This rock type model is referred to as the 'Standard' rock type model. The final step was overprinting with rock codes for the existing U/G mining excavations, the high-grade (HG) carbonate and the low-grade (LG) carbonate. The percentage of these three material types in blocks intersecting the solids was calculated and stored separately, with the excavations having the highest priority, and the high-grade zone the next highest priority, in blocks where the solids overlapped. This procedure ensures that the mined-out material in the model is correctly accounted for. The rock code for any other material in these blocks was taken from the standard rock type model, i.e. a block on the hanging wall contact might comprise $50 \% \mathrm{U} / \mathrm{G}$ excavation, $20 \% \mathrm{HG}$ carbonate and $30 \%$ Trench material.The 3D solid of the existing U/G excavations was generated by Mr. Bruce Hudgins of Hudgtec Consulting and was supplied by ScoZinc. The 3D solids of the HG and LG zones were generated by Mr. Peter Irwin of Resource Data Management, Inc. from plan interpretations. Zinc equivalent cut-offs of $2 \%$ and $7 \%$ were utilised for the LG and HG zones, respectively in developing the interpretations.

The standard ordinary kriging (OK) procedure was used to interpolate Zn and Pb block values in the flat lying portions of the deposit above 490 m elevation. This estimation was restricted to the LG zone, as the HG zone does not extend above this elevation. The kriging was done in three passes with parameters as follows:

Mineralised blocks in the dipping portion of the deposit below 490 m elevation were populated separately following interpolation in transformed space and back-transformation of the generated values (at block centroids) into normal space, as described below. The backtransformed data was then used to interpolate the $\mathrm{Zn}, \mathrm{Pb}$ and Classification values in normal space by the nearest-neighbour technique, separately for the LG and HG zones.

The secondary block model is a standard block model (every block has only one rock code), defined in 3D space to cover the volume of interest. As described earlier, the transformation process associates three of the edge polylines of a representative slab that are nominally orthogonal with the $\mathrm{X}, \mathrm{Y}$ and Z axes of the unfolded space - this space is orthogonal with respect to the original co-ordinate axes, and offset by a specified amount. The transformation selected in this case results in a space in which the X axis corresponds to the unfolded strike component of the deposit (approximately 3050 m ), the Y axes with cross-strike component(12 m), and the Z axis with the down-dip component (143 m), as shown in Figure 21 and Figure 22, which also show transformed and un-transformed composite data.

An additional block model variable (Class) was updated according to the pass in which the block was interpolated; with a default value of 3 . The $\mathrm{Zn}, \mathrm{Pb}$ and Class block values were then back-transformed into normal space, using the block centroid as the 3D co-ordinate. These points do not correspond to block centroids in the original rotated block model and are used as input data in the nearest-neighbour interpolation to assign values to corresponding models in the primary model. The HG and LG models are interpolated into separate grade models associated with the percentage models that store the percentage of HG and LG material in a particular block.The primary density model for the mineralised zone was then generated, utilising the Zn and Pb block values and the formula:

$$
\mathrm{SG}=1 /(\mathrm{Pb} \% /(86.6 \times 7.6)+\mathrm{Zn} \% /(67.0 \times 4.0)+(1-\mathrm{Pb} \% / 86.6-\mathrm{Zn} \% / 67.0) / 2.7)
$$

The Zn and Pb block values were also used to generate a zinc equivalent model ( Zn -Eq ) using the following formula:

$$
\mathrm{Zn}-\mathrm{Eq} \%=\mathrm{Zn} \%+(\mathrm{Pb} \% \times 0.68)
$$

Typical cross- and plan sections through the block model are illustrated in Figure 23 and Figure 24.

# 17.1.11 Mineral Resource Classification

The mineral Resources were classified according to the pass in which a block was interpolated, as recorded in the Class variable. Blocks interpolated in Pass 1 were considered to be in the Measured category. The Pass 1 ranges are based on the ranges of the first spherical component of the corresponding correlogram, and vary from $10 \%$ to $80 \%$ of the maximum ranges of the correlograms. Blocks interpolated in the second and third passes are considered to be in the Indicated and Inferred categories, respectively.![img-27.jpeg](img-27.jpeg)

# 17.1.12 Results

As described in previous paragraphs, Surface Resources for the High-grade and Low-grade zones were calculated separately (Table 18). Resources are reported using a cut-off grade of $0.75 \%$ zinc-equivalent. For both zones, undiluted Measured Resources total 1.9 million tonnes containing $3.8 \%$ zinc and $1.6 \%$ lead. Indicated Resources total 2.2 million tonnes containing $3.5 \%$ zinc and $1.5 \%$ lead. The combined Measured + Indicated Resources total 4.1 million tonnes containing $3.5 \%$ zinc and $1.5 \%$ lead.

Undiluted Inferred Surface Resources total 1.8 million tonnes containing $3.1 \%$ zinc and $1.1 \%$ lead.Table 18: Undiluted surface Resources.

# 17.2 Underground Resources - Northeast Zone

Resources in the Northeast Zone were estimated. Because it was determined that this area would be most profitably mined using underground mining methods, a cut-off grade of $5 \%$ zinc equivalent was used to outline the mineralisation on sections spaced fifty metres apart. To permit mechanised mining, the minimum mining width and height were both 2.4 metres. An additional 0.1 metre "skin" dilution was incorporated into the resource outlines. This resulted in a widening of the outline beyond the grade cut-off point. Although the dilution material was below cut-off, in most cases it contained some metal.

The section outlines were drawn under the assumption that selective mining could be carried out within the carbonate. Meaning, it would be possible to mine along either the footwall or the hanging wall contact rather than mining the full width of the carbonate unit.

To determine the quantity of material, the outline area on each section was multiplied by its strike length (fifty metres) to determine the volume. That figure was multiplied by an average SG of 2.9 to determine mass. To determine grade, the length-weighted average grade and the true width of each intercept was calculated. The average section grade was determined by calculating the true-length-weighted average grade of all of the section's intercepts. The average true width of the intercepts was also calculated.

One contiguous body made up the underground resources that lie northeast and along strike from the proposed pit (Figure 26). Cross-sections showing the resource outline are shown in Figure 27 through Figure 29. The average grade of each body was determined by calculatingthe average-true-width-weighted grade of the sections that made up the body. The average true width of the body was determined by calculating the volume-weighted average true section width.

Because of the 20-30 m sample spacing and the lack of bulk or underground sampling in this area, these Resources were classified as Indicated Resources. Indicated Resources in the Northeast Underground Zone were estimated to be 1,110,000 tonnes containing $6.6 \%$ zinc and $3.7 \%$ lead. The average true width was estimated to be 3.6 metres (Table 23).

Prior to 2004, very little sampling and assaying for gypsum was done. Past drilling campaigns focused solely on zinc and lead. Prior to 2004, much of the gypsum core was saved; however, much of it was improperly stored and the gypsum weathered away.

In 2004, fourteen vertical holes were drilled that penetrated the gypsum resource. These holes, which are shown in Figure 15, were sampled and assayed for gypsum. Most of the samples were also assayed for chloride. The chloride assay was for all chlorides - chloride ions from any source.

Examination of the core revealed that the gypsum was relatively hard and pure. There were very few clay interbeds as appear at National Gypsum's deposit in nearby Milford. The gypsum graded into anhydrite, typical of Nova Scotia gypsum deposits. There was no clear contact between the two rock types.

A preliminary assessment of gypsum quality was carried out using the holes that were drilled in 2004. A cut-off grade of $85 \%$ gypsum was used. Where the hole entered the gypsum was defined as the top contact. Where the hole left the gypsum, meaning where the hole left the gypsum horizon and passed into material with an average gypsum grade of less than $85 \%$ (in other words, into anhydrite), was defined as the bottom contact.

The average gypsum thickness was 31 metres with a range of 9-85 metres. The gypsum was covered by 16-61 metres of overburden, averaging 38 metres. The average stripping ratio was 1.7.

The subset of samples within the gypsum consisted of sixty-nine (69) samples from fourteen holes. More than half of these samples ( 44 of them) were also assayed for chloride. The length-weighted average grade was $93 \%$ gypsum. The length-weighted average chloride content was 43 ppm . Only one sample contained over 100 ppm chloride - this sample averaged 142 ppm over three metres.Table 21: Raw (non-weighted) assay statistics.

The reader should note that this analysis represents only an arithmetic analysis of gypsum quality and chloride content. No spatial statistics were calculated. Therefore, this is only an indication of gypsum quality - not an accurate estimate. The gypsum sample spacing is currently too wide for meaningful calculation of Resources or Reserves.

There are many bags of sample rejects available for mineral processing work. These are stored at the Scotia Mine site. Also, the core was sawed in half for sampling and the remaining halves were stored in a dry facility. The sample pulps are also readily available for further assay work.![img-31.jpeg](img-31.jpeg)

### 18.1 Surface Reserves

To estimate the Surface Reserves, an optimised pit shell was generated from the block model utilising Whittle 3.4 pit optimisation software. Tim Carew, P.Geo., carried out the optimisation process using a set of economic and geotechnical parameters that were supplied by Mr. Douglas Roy, P.Eng of MineTech International Limited. Only blocks in the Measured and Indicated Resource categories were used. The base case economic and geotechnical parameters were:

## Revenue

- Prices (\$US per tonne of Metal)

Zn $\$ 1,760$
$\mathrm{Pb} \$ 990$

- Exchange Rate (\$US per \$CAN) \$0.75

- Processing Recovery

Zn $90 \%$
$\mathrm{Pb} \quad 95 \%$

- Smelter Return

- Carbonate (Dolomite) $45^{\circ}$
- Trench/Till $27^{\circ}(2: 1)$
- Evaporites (Gypsum / Anhydrite) $55^{\circ}$

A surface mine plan, complete with haul roads, was designed using the optimum pit shells as a guide (Figure 31). Table 22 reports the Reserves that are contained within the pit design. Figure 32 shows a grade-tonnage curve for diluted, recoverable, Proven and Probable Reserves.

Using a $0.75 \%$ zinc-equivalent cut-off grade, diluted, recoverable Proven Reserves total 1.8 million tonnes containing $3.2 \%$ zinc and $1.3 \%$ lead. Probable Reserves total 1.7 million tonnes containing $2.9 \%$ zinc and $1.2 \%$ lead. Proven + Probable Reserves total 3.4 million tonnes containing $2.9 \%$ zinc and $1.2 \%$ lead.

In-Pit Inferred Resources total 510,000 tonnes containing $2.2 \%$ zinc and $1.1 \%$ lead. The reader should note that in-pit Inferred Resources cannot be considered Reserves.![img-32.jpeg](img-32.jpeg)

Figure 32: Grade-tonnage relationship for diluted and recoverable, Proven and Probable Surface Reserves.

The effect of changing metal prices on Reserve size and grade was investigated. Two additional optimum pit shells were generated using plus and minus $25 \%$ of the base case metal prices. The relationship shows that Reserve tonnes drop in an approximately linear manner as the cut-off grade increases (Figure 33). Interestingly, the average Reserve grade is fairly insensitive to a change in cut-off, implying that for this deposit, a drop in cut-off (increase in metal price) means that more ore can be mined at a higher stripping ratio.|  | Corresponding Reserve |  |  |  |  |  |  |

# 18.2 Underground Reserves - Northeast Zone

To determine the Underground Reserves, the estimated dilution and mining recovery factors of $15 \%$ and $90 \%$, respectively, were applied to the Northeast Zone Underground Resources (Section 17.2). Diluted and recoverable Probable Reserves were estimated to be $1,150,000$ tonnes containing $5.7 \%$ zinc and $3.2 \%$ lead. The average true width was estimated to be 3.6 metres (Table 23).

The overall, diluted and recoverable, Surface and Underground, Proven and Probable Reserve totals 4.6 million tonnes containing $3.6 \%$ zinc and $1.7 \%$ lead (Table 24)Table 23: Northeast Zone Probable Diluted \& Recoverable Reserves.

### 19.1 Mining Operations

### 19.1.1 Initial Surface Mining

For the first few years, mining will be by surface methods using standard methods of drilling, blasting, and excavating using excavators and truck haulage. An equipment list is reported in Table 25. This equipment will be leased from a local dealer. The pit will have an oval shape with its long axis oriented along the northeast-southwest strike of the deposit. To the northeast, the pit is constrained by Gays River and Highway 224. Gays River will be diverted slightly to allow the pit to expand toward the highway.

The pit haul road will traverse the footwall of the deposit, generally along the carbonate/quartzite contact. The overall pit slope angle for the footwall will be less than $45^{\circ}$. The gypsum/anhydrite evaporite hanging wall is more stable, allowing a steeper overall slope angle of $55^{\circ}$. Overburden slope angles will be kept below a $2: 1$ grade $\left(27^{\circ}\right)$. The overcompacted Trench clay will also be kept below a $2: 1$ grade $\left(27^{\circ}\right)$. A complete description of geotechnical work is reported in Section 19.4.

Working benches in ore will be five metres high for grade control purposes. Final bench heights in ore will be up to twenty metres. Higher benches, up to twenty metres high, taken in one or more cuts, are planned for the hanging wall evaporites.

After the pit reaches an elevation of approximately 480 metres (approximately 50 metres depth), underground development can begin from a portal in the northeast end of the pit, extending along strike to the northeast.

Table 25: Equipment list for the surface mine.

| Equipment | Number | $\$ 124$ |
| CAT 345 Excavator | 1 | $\$ 185$ |
| CAT 385 Excavator | 1 | $\$ 146$ |
| CAT 773 Haul Truck | $3-4$ | $\$ 107$ |
| CAT 14H Grader | 1 | $\$ 111$ |
| CAT 980 Wheel Loader | 1 | $\$ 134$ |
| CAT D8 Bulldozer | 1 |  |

### 19.1.2 Underground Mining

A main haulage drift will be established on the 480 metre level. It will extend from the pit along strike to the northeast. It will pass underneath the river but it will be entirely situated within the competent footwall quartzites. A second decline and portal will be located at thenortheast end of the Underground Reserves to provide a second access for the underground workings.

The weak hanging wall Trench clay poses the greatest technical challenge to underground mining. The Trench material is relatively strong for clay because it is overconsolidated (compacted). However, groundwater influx weakens it and also poses a dewatering challenge. As part of minimising the operational and safety hazards posed by the weak Trench clay, dewatering operations will lower the groundwater table below the active mine workings.

The cut-and-fill mining method was chosen specifically to address the weak hanging wall issue. It will be mechanised, meaning drill jumbos will do the development and production drilling. LHD's (Load-Haul-Dump vehicles) will muck the broken rock back to re-muck stockpile bays. In narrower stopes, slushers may be used to muck the broken rock. Underground dump trucks will haul the rock to surface.

From the main haulage drift on the 480 metre level, the main ramp will spiral downwards on the footwall side of the stope (Figure 34). A "lift ramp" will extend from the main ramp downward to Lift 1, approximately twenty metres from the planned top of the stope.

The mining method is a modified form of mechanised cut and fill mining. It is a combination of undercut and fill and conventional (overhand) cut and fill mining. Lift 1 (Figure 34) will be five metres high, at least 2.5 metres wide and its along strike length will be limited by ground conditions and haulage efficiencies. Generally, cut and fill lifts can be as long as two hundred metres. The overall stope height will be a maximum of eighty metres.

Every 50-100 metres, as required, raises will be driven, in ore, upward from lower levels. These will provide valuable geologic information, grade information, alternate escape routes and ventilation pathways. During the fill cycle, cribbing will be built around the raises to keep them open.

When Lift 1 has finished, the fill cycle will begin. As no sill pillars will be left, Lift 1 fill will form the back for Lift 8 (Figure 34). Therefore, the first few metres of Lift 1's fill will contain a higher cement content (up to $15 \%$ cement:solids) and possibly some reinforcing material. The remaining fill will contain only enough cement (approximately $3 \%$ ) to hold together the aggregate fill, providing a stable floor on which to work. The aggregate in the fill will consist of sand and gravel that will be sourced from on-site glacial-fluvial deposits. It will be filled to within one-two metres of the back to allow for blasting swell during Lift 2 mining. Production will be accomplished using breasting. The mining will progress upwards to Lift 4 in the same manner. After Lift 4 has been filled, production will move to Lift 5 and the cycle will be continue.

The eastern half of the underground reserves lie under Gays River. If groundwater influx presents an unacceptable operational or safety hazard in this area, mining the first group of lifts (Lifts 1-4, Figure 34) in this area can be carried out during the drier months.![img-34.jpeg](img-34.jpeg)

# 19.1.3 Dewatering

Mine dewatering will be important for both surface and underground mining, but particularly for underground mining. In the underground mine, prior to starting a new lift cycle, the ramp will be continued deeper so that sumps can be established. Typical of soils, the hanging wall Trench clay is stronger when it is dry. Therefore, dewatering operations will strive to maintain the local water table at a level lower than the current workings. This will also significantly reduce the possibility of a sudden inrush of water. In the past, dewatering operations removed an average 4,000 gallons per minute ( gpm ) from the underground workings. The flowrate ranged from as little as $2,000 \mathrm{gpm}$ in drier months to $6,000 \mathrm{gpm}$ in months with heavier precipitation.

A significant portion of the inflow to the mine was groundwater recharge from Gays River. The river diversion plan includes lining part of the river with clay, which should reduce the recharge flowrate.

Drainage from backfilling operations is not expected to form a significant component of the overall dewatering requirement.

### 19.2 Mine Dilution and Recovery

Dilution was estimated at $15 \%$. The amount of ore that will be recovered from the mine was estimated at $90 \%$.# 19.3 Mineral Processing Operations

The Scotia Mine processing plant was constructed during the late 1970's by Canada Wide Mines (Esso) (Figure 35). Esso operated for less than two years during the period 1979-1981. Seabright converted the mill to process gold during the mid-to-late 1980's. Westminster later re-converted and updated the mill to process zinc and lead, then operated it for a short time during the period 1989-1991. In all, 740,000 tonnes of zinc and lead ore have been processed in the mill (Table 9).

From a stockpile adjacent to the mill, a wheel loader loads ore into the primary jaw crusher (Figure 36). It is further crushed to $-1 / 2$ inch and stored in a fine ore bin. From there, it passes to the grinding mills, then to a lead flotation section. The ore, with most of the galena (lead sulphide or PbS ) removed, passes to the sphalerite (zinc sulphide or ZnS ) flotation section. The zinc and lead concentrates are separately thickened, filtered and dried before being stockpiled for shipment to the smelter.

Figure 35: Views of the outside (left) and inside (right) of the mill.![img-36.jpeg](img-36.jpeg)

Figure 36: Process flowsheet.

Bulk concentrate will be stored on site. A front-end loader will be used to load concentrate into a highway semi-dump truck for the short trip to a railway siding in Milford, NS. Milford is eight kilometres along the highway from the mine site. The truck will dump from a ramp directly into gondola-style, 100 tonne railway cars. Canadian National will retrieve the cars and take them to the smelters. Lead concentrate will be taken Noranda's Belledune smelter in Northern New Brunswick and zinc concentrate will be taken to Noranda's Valleyfield smelter outside Montreal.# 19.3.1 Production Forecast

The mill has a nominal capacity of 1,350 tonnes per day of higher grade (greater than seven percent zinc), quartzite breccia ore. When processing lower grade, carbonate ore, the mill performs well at production rates as high as 2,000 tonnes per day (Thornton, 2006 (1)). A production rate of 2,000 tonnes per day is planned for the surface operation. Operating 350 days per year, that translates to 700,000 tonnes of ore per year (Table 26).

Stripping operations will start at the beginning of the fourth quarter of Year One. Milling will begin two months later, during the eleventh month of Year 1, after a sufficient amount of material has been stockpiled. Each year, surface operations will produce 30,000 tonnes of zinc concentrate and 10,000 tonnes of lead concentrate.

Because of the higher grade of the underground ore, a production rate of 1,350 tonnes per day is planned for the underground operation. This is so as not to overwhelm the filtering and drying sections of the mill. Operating 350 days per year, that translates to 473,000 tonnes of ore per year Table 26). Each year, underground operations will produce 40,000 tonnes of zinc concentrate and 19,000 tonnes of lead concentrate.

### 19.3.2 Recoverability

Over its operating history, whenever the feed contained a consistent grade, zinc and lead recovery values were $90 \%$ and $95 \%$, respectively (Thornton, 2006 (1)). In a monthly report for November, 1990, Westminer reported recovery values of $90 \%$ and $93 \%$ for zinc and lead, respectively (Appendix 1). Thornton (2006 (1)) reported that Westminer encountered some oxidised zinc and lead that did not float well, thereby decreasing their recovery values.

Table 27 reports the mineral processing parameters that were used for this report. Smelter return is expected to be $85 \%$ and $95 \%$ for zinc and lead, respectively. Treatment charges also apply (Table 27).

Mining Recovery was estimated at $90 \%$.Table 27: Mineral processing parameters.

# 19.4 Geotechnical Aspects

No detailed geotechnical fieldwork was carried out to determine the optimum slope angles in rock. However, laboratory strength testing was carried out by CANMET. Triaxial testing of six dolomite samples and eight quartzite samples yielded the following mechanical properties:

| Property | Quartzite | Dolomite |
| :-- | :--: | :--: |
| Number of Samples | 8 | 6 |
| SG | 2.69 | 2.73 |

| $v$ | 0.26 | 0.45 |

| $\mathrm{~s}_{\mathrm{r}}$ | 0 | 0 |
| $\mathrm{r}^{2}$ | 0.86 | 0.98 |

The footwall at the carbonate/quartzite contact has an average dip of less than $45^{\circ}$. The haul road will also be incorporated into the footwall, further reducing the overall pit slope angle. The footwall consists of strong, competent quartzite with no major adverse geotechnical features such as faulting that are the major causes of slope instability. The overall slope will be less than $45^{\circ}$, which is more than adequate.

The hanging wall consists of gypsum/anhydrite evaporites and Trench clays. The Trench is wider near the surface and pinches at depth. Gypsum and anhydrite are strong, competent rocks that make for stable slopes. Evidence of this stability can be observed at National Gypsum's quarry in nearby Milford/Dutch Settlement. An overall slope angle of $55^{\circ}$ in evaporites is warranted. Trench clays are more competent than glacial till because they are over-compacted. A maximum grade of $2: 1$ is warranted. However, whenever possible, the Trench clay will be stripped flat, back to the evaporite contact.

The overburden consists of a thick mantle of clayey-glacial till with localised glacio-fluvial deposits (McKee and Hannon, 1985). It will be pushed back five metres from the edge of the pit and sloped at a maximum grade of 2:1. CBCL (1999) determined that the factor of safety was 1.5 using that grade. Loose surficial sands or soft silts will be graded under 2.5:1 (CBCL, 1999). The till stratum ranges in thickness from 10-40 m. It has been cut in turn by glacialfluvial deposits of sand, silty sand and gravel including the Gays River sediments. It was noted that fluvial sediments many contact the bedrock in some locations.

Aston and Lamb (1993) identified two main aquifers associated with the property. First is the Overburden Aquifer consisting of highly permeable fluvial-glacial coarse sands and gravels, interlaced with less permeable bands of fine sand and silt. Second is the Bedrock Aquifer with consists of highly permeable interconnected karstic gypsum cavities along with hydraulically connected but less permeable jointed and fractured carbonates and quartzites. The two aquifers are hydraulically connected in areas where the permeable overburden sediments are in contact with permeable bedrock zones.# 19.4.1 Underground Geotechnical Investigation of Trench Material

In 1981, Jacques, Whitford and Associates carried out a geotechnical investigation of the hanging wall Trench clay (Brown, 1981). They inspected three underground Trench exposures in the 101, 104 and 107 areas. They also drilled three surface boreholes using a power augur. Clay and rock samples were taken for laboratory testing.

They observed that the unsupported stand-up time for the Trench material is at least several days - an adequate length of time for installing ground support. They recommended that grouted soil anchors and wire mesh screen be installed to support underground Trench exposures. Shotcrete could be added as an additional stabilising feature, if and where conditions were particularly unstable.

They stressed that dewatering efforts must be sufficient to prevent pore pressure from developing around the opening, that blasting vibrations be within safe limits and that changes in the stress field caused by mining be within acceptable limits. They recommended that wherever shotcrete is employed, weep holes be provided to prevent hydrostatic pressures from building.

They carried out three direct shear tests on a sample of Trench clay and determined the shear strength to be:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \tau=16.5 \mathrm{kPa}+\sigma_{\mathrm{n}}^{\prime} \tan \left(23^{\circ}\right) \\
& \text { where: } \tau=\quad \text { shear strength }(\mathrm{kPa}) \\
& \sigma_{\mathrm{n}}^{\prime}=\text { normal stress }(\mathrm{kPa})
\end{aligned}
$$

### 19.5 Mine Water and River Diversion

Groundwater infiltration into the Scotia Mine has historically posed a safety hazard and an operational problem. Water decreases the strength of soil and rock masses. There have also been several high pressure inrushes of soil laden water. Mine dewatering operations typically removed $4,000 \mathrm{gpm}$, on average. When Gays River was high during spring flooding, up to 6,000 gpm was removed. Golder Associates (1992) determined that one-quarter to one-half of that water originated from Gays River, apparently due to seepage through the riverbed.

Several sinkholes have developed due to mine dewatering operations. Groundwater flow through the gypsum hanging-wall rocks cause rapid dissolution of the gypsum, creating karst features, the surface expression of which are sinkholes. These can present a hazard to equipment and personnel.

To allow the northeast end of the proposed open pit to expand closer toward Highway 224 and to decrease the water seepage from the river into the proposed mine, CBCL (1999) designed a minor diversion of Gays River after carrying out a geotechnical investigation. The design was based on a 1998 field investigation that included drilling twelve boreholes at six sites. At each site, they found a 1.2-1.8 m layer of surficial silt overlying interbedded, alluvial silt and sand.The recommended design consisted of digging a new channel for part of the river that would be separated from the pit by a dyke. Rather than using a single, wide dyke, CBCL recommended using two narrower dykes to mitigate the hazard of sinkholes causing damage to the dyke. Their rationale was that if sinkholes cause a breech in one dyke, the other would hold back the water.

The overall structure would be 600 metres long, fifty metres wide at the base and have a crest elevation of 519 metres. The dyke will be set back a minimum of ten metres from the top of the pit slope. The pit side of the dyke would have a $3: 1$ slope while the river side would have a 5:1 slope. Because of its low permeability, CBCL recommended that the dyke be constructed using the till that was stripped from the area of the pit. It should be built up in layers, allowing time for pore pressure to dissipate before placing the next layer. The riverbank would be lined with rip-rap for erosion control.

The new river channel would be lined with 60 centimetres of till to prevent water from seeping down through the riverbed. This will greatly reduce the amount of water that seeps into the mine workings.

# 19.6 Markets

The on-site processing plant will concentrate zinc and lead in mineral form (sphalerite and galena, respectively). These separate concentrates will be sold to one or more outside smelters within North America or overseas. The Scotia Mine concentrate is high in purity without any penalty-attracting impurities. Currently, world-wide smelter capacity is under-utilised and the demand for concentrate exceeds what the mines can supply. Therefore, there should be no trouble selling the concentrate.

The principal use for zinc is in galvanising, with continuous galvanised sheet demand accounting for around two-thirds of this. Other major uses are die-casting and brass goods and both these are used in a very wide range of manufactured goods. Galvanising applications are principally to be found in construction and automobiles. Investment in infrastructure and manufacturing facilities are important factors in this rapid expansion of consumption in China. Growth of global demand is estimated to have averaged $3.7 \%$ between 2000 and 2005; whilst Chinese consumption has increased by $16 \%$ on average over this period, growth has been much more modest in the rest of world, at only $0.6 \%$ (Roberts, 2006). Zinc demand outside China has suffered as a result of the rapid increase in China's exports of manufactured goods but, on the other hand, has benefited from China's need to import increasing quantities of galvanised sheet and die-casting alloys.

World-wide, approximately 10.7 million tonnes of refined zinc metal was consumed in 2005 (Roberts, 2006). Unlike zinc, where more than $90 \%$ of refined metal production derives directly from zinc and bulk concentrates, less than $40 \%$ of total refined lead production is produced directly from lead and bulk concentrates (Roberts, 2006). This is because the principal end use of lead, the manufacture of lead-acid batteries, accounts for $80 \%$ of total demand. The useful life of these batteries is rather short, typically no more than five or six years at best, and often shorter, and virtually all these batteries are recycled to recover thelead. Thus a large share of production increases in line with consumption, but with a lag of a few years. Essentially, mine production only needs to meet the incremental use of lead in batteries, and the remaining dissipative uses which currently account for only $20 \%$ of total demand.

World-wide, approximately 7.5 million tonnes of refined lead metal was consumed in 2005 (Roberts, 2006). The main use for lead is in the manufacture of lead-acid batteries used in almost all motor vehicles for starting, lighting and ignition (SLI batteries) and industrial batteries which have widespread application providing back-up, portable and motive power (Roberts, 2006). There has been good growth in global lead demand since 2003, albeit that most of this growth has been in China. With global economic growth expected to be sound over the next few years, demand growth is expected to continue.

World-wide zinc consumption (RBC, 2005).
![img-38.jpeg](img-38.jpeg)

World-wide lead consumption (Roberts, 2006).

While there are alternatives to lead-acid batteries, for the foreseeable future lead-acid will remain the technology of choice in almost all of its current applications. This is because leadacid batteries are relatively cheap, the technology is very well proven and robust and there is a well-established infrastructure to recycle batteries. Over the longer term the emergence of mass-produced hybrid and pure electric vehicles may threaten the use of lead in automobiles, and some industrial applications may also be lost to new battery technologies. However, such developments are not expected to have a material impact on the lead market over the next ten years.

# 19.6.1 Gypsum Market

Gypsum is the main ingredient in plaster. Most gypsum that is produced in the world is made into gypsum wallboard. Another major use of gypsum is as a set retarder for portland cement. Synthetic gypsum, made during the flue gas desulphurisation process, can substitute for natural gypsum in wallboard manufacture and is gaining in market share.In 2004, world gypsum production totalled 106 million tonnes. The United States produced the most gypsum at 18 million tonnes. Canada ranked Third, producing 9.3 million tonnes, 7.9 million of which came from Nova Scotia. Approximately half of Nova Scotia's gypsum production came from National Gypsum Canada Limited's Milford quarry, approximately ten kilometres from the Scotia Mine site. This quarry has been operating for over fifty years.

Specifications for gypsum used in wallboard manufacture vary slightly among producers. Typically, they require the gypsum content to be greater than $85 \%$ and the total chloride ion content to be less than 100 ppm (parts per million).

The gypsum industry consists almost exclusively of vertically integrated corporations. Gypsum wallboard manufacturers typically own and operate their own mines. As a consequence, there is no spot market for gypsum.

Several companies have expressed an interest in the gypsum on the Scotia Mine site. A large quantity of gypsum will be removed as waste rock to uncover the zinc and lead Reserves. No formal contracts have yet been signed.

# 19.7 Contracts

No smelter contracts have been established. But, because the demand for concentrate by smelters currently exceed what mines can produce, there should be no trouble establishing smelter contracts at reasonable terms if production can commence within the year. As evidence of that statement, some smelters have recently been paying for zinc concentrate rather than adding a treatment charge (Roberts, 2006).

### 19.7.1 Smelter Returns

For zinc concentrates, a treatment charge must be paid to the smelter for each tonne of concentrate submitted that is linearly related to the spot market zinc price. There is a fixed charge per tonne plus a price escalator clause. The price escalator charge increases linearly for every dollar by which the spot price exceeds a certain value. For example, the benchmark fixed charge for 2005 was \$US 126 (Roberts, 2006). At the end of 2005, the spot market zinc price was $\$$ US 1,900 per tonne of zinc metal. The average price escalator value was $\$$ US 0.14 for every dollar by which the price exceeded $\$$ US 1,400 . Therefore the price escalator clause amounted to $\$$ US 70 per tonne extra ( $\$ 0.14 \times \$ 500$ ), for a total of $\$$ US 196 per tonne of concentrate.

Because of a zinc concentrate shortage in 2005, some smelters were actually paying for zinc concentrate rather than applying a treatment charge.

In addition to the treatment charge, the smelter generally retains $15 \%$ of the zinc metal submitted. In other words, the smelter charges a treatment charge, then pays for $85 \%$ of the zinc metal submitted.Generally, the same arrangement also applies to lead. On average, in 2005, the fixed portion of the treatment charge was \$US 135 and the price escalator value was \$US 0.075 , basis \$US 800 (Roberts, 2006). On top of the treatment charge, the smelter pays for $95 \%$ of the lead metal submitted.

# 19.7.2 Spot Prices

For both zinc and lead, concentrate treatment charges and the price that a smelter will pay for concentrate both depend on the spot markets. The London Metals Exchange (LME) publishes spot market prices for zinc and lead.

At the time of report writing, spot prices for zinc and lead were both at historic high levels (Figure 37 and Figure 38). The zinc and lead spot prices were approximately \$US 3,590 (\$1.63 per pound) and \$US 1,156 per tonne ( $\$ 0.53$ per pound) of refined metal, respectively. The prices of both metals were recovering from near-historic low levels experience in 2002/2003, when zinc and lead spot prices were approximately \$US 800 and \$US 500 per tonne of refined metal, respectively.

From Figure 37, it appears that zinc prices have historically been cyclical. Generally, the price has been fairly steady and increasing at a slow, but steady rate. Every fifteen years, there has been a large price increase that lasted one or two years before falling again to a price that was somewhat higher than the pre-spike price.

Historically, lead prices (Figure 38) have also seemed cyclical, but with not as regular a frequency. High lead prices have not always occurred with high zinc prices.Since 1970:

Figure 38: LME spot price history for lead (\$US per tonne of refined lead).

Low metal prices during the late 1990's and early 2000's led to a swathe of mine closures. The effect on mine output was not limited to closures. Cash flow problems at many mines led to a reduction in exploration and development expenditures, which in turn led to attrition of output at existing operations. These effects are still negatively affecting the current level of output at some mines, though the increase in prices since late 2003 has led to substantial improvement in mine cash flow. Prices increased after 2003 as demand for zinc and lead increased, exceeding what the existing mines could supply.

The current high metal prices are causing new mines to come online and existing ones to expand production. In 2007, just a year away, the greenfield mine project pipeline starts to look much fuller, with some major projects expected to be commissioned. The largest of these is Apex Silver's San Cristobal open-pit project in Bolivia, expected to produce well over $200 \mathrm{kt} / \mathrm{a}$ contained zinc when it reaches full capacity (Roberts, 2006).

If supply starts growing at a faster rate without a corresponding increase in the demand growth rate, prices may begin to decline. Some analysts feel that this is about to occur,starting in 2007 (Roberts, 2006). If they are correct, prices will drop from current levels, but not down to 2002/2003 levels (Table 28).

The anticipated (by some) drop in metal prices will likely be accompanied by a strengthening of the US dollar. Because most of the Scotia Mine's costs would be in Canadian dollars, a strengthening US dollar will soften the blow of decreasing metal prices.

Table 28: Prediction of metal prices to 2012 (Roberts, 2006).

| Metal | 2006 | 2007 | 2008 | 2009 | 2010 | 2011 | 2012 |

| (\$US/lb) | 0.51 | 0.35 | 0.25 | 0.25 | 0.32 | 0.35 | 0.34 |

Other analysts' forecasts are not so dismal. They believe that although the zinc supply will grow over the coming years, it will not keep pace with growth in demand (RBC, 2005). The market may remain in deficit until 2008 at the earliest. By 2009, RBC expects that production increases at existing operations and previously approved new projects will contribute 2.1 million tonnes of new supply, relative to 2004 (Table 29, Table 30 and Table 31). Permanent closures between 2006 and 2009 include the Brunswick and Mattagami (Bell Allard) mines in Canada, Bougrine in Tunisia and Poland's second largest zinc mine (Trzebionka) (Table 32).

RBC's price prediction for zinc is shown in Table 33. They predict relatively high zinc prices until 2009. In 2010 and beyond, as supply catches up with demand, prices will decrease toward \$US 0.50 per pound. They also expect that treatment charges will remain low to 2009, at \$US 90-110 per tonne of concentrate (Table 33). With a drop in prices in 2010 and beyond, treatment charges will increase to \$US 180 per tonne.Table 33: Zinc price prediction to 2009 (RBC, 2005).

| Zinc Treatment <br> Charge (base <br> \$US 1,000) <br> (\$US/tonne) | 90 | 90 | 110 | 100 | $\$ 180$ |

Some analysts are even more optimistic. Based on falling inventory levels and increasing industrial demand in the short-term in Asia and the OECD nations, they believe that prices will increase over the near term to give average prices of \$US 1.35 per pound of zinc for 2006 and $\$ 1.50$ for 2007 (Rajeev, 2006).

Table 34 shows the metal price, treatment charge and exchange rate model that was adopted for this report. A sensitivity analysis was also carried out on those prices (Section 19.18).

# 19.7.3 Futures Markets

The London Metals Exchange reports the futures market prices for many metals including zinc and lead. For zinc, it reports futures contract prices for the next twenty-seven months. For lead, prices for the next fifteen months are reported. The LME spot and futures prices for July 13, 2006 are reported in Table 35. Futures prices take investment risk, inflation and supply and demand factors into account. Therefore, the expected spot price in say, fifteen months may be different from the 15 -month futures price.

Selling future production is known as hedging. Hedging during falling prices partially insulates the mine's revenue. Generally, mines sell a portion of production at spot or contract prices and hedge the remainder.Table 35: LME spot and futures prices for July 13, 2006 [\$US per tonne of refined metal (\$US per pound)].

# 19.8 Water and Sewer

In the past, most of the process water was recycled from the polishing pond. It was pumped from there, through a pipeline back to the mill. Process make-up water, potable water and water for fire suppression was drawn from Gays River using another pump and pipeline. For showers, toilets et cetera, part of that water was filtered in a small, on-site filtration plant. Bottled water was provided for drinking. The proposed mining operation will continue that practice.

A relatively small septic field, of a size appropriate for the care-and-maintenance status of the site, was installed in 2005. Sewage and grey water used to disposed in the tailings pond. If permitted, that practice will be reinstated. If not permitted, it will be a straightforward matter to expand the current septic field.

### 19.9 Environmental Considerations

### 19.9.1 Progressive Reclamation

Reclamation will be an on-going process. The goal will be to minimise the overall land disturbance at any point in time. As much as possible, stripped waste rock and soil will be placed in their final resting places. As mining progresses, final grading and seeding will be carried out as soon as possible. At the end of the mine life, there should be very little reclamation left to carry out.

### 19.9.2 Final Reclamation

A conceptual reclamation plan was submitted during the environmental registration process. It was included as an appendix to the registration document (MGI, 1999). After the mine is decommissioned, it was proposed to allow the pit to fill with ground and surface water to create a deep lake. The temperature of the incoming groundwater will assist in the creation of conditions necessary for the lake waters to undertake seasonal turnovers, resulting in good mixing conditions and maintenance of acceptable dissolved oxygen levels.Prior to the flooding of the pit, the edge areas and slopes that will become the new shoreline will be graded to a maximum allowable 2:1 slope. As appropriate, graded slopes ranging from 3:1 to 5:1 will be created in some areas of the new shoreline. Extending from above the projected water line to depths approaching ten metres, these shores will allow the development of a variety of shoreline habitats (terrestrial, riparian, emergent and submergent) and provide the potential for human recreational use. Submergent and emergent species will assist in the maintenance of water oxygen levels, improve the quality of water reaching the lake and provide a diverse habitat for a variety of terrestrial and aquatic species. The remainder of the area of the bottom of the lake will retain its rugged conditions to provide additional diverse and irregular substrate and subsurface habitat.

When the lake has filled with water to the same elevation as the water in the adjacent River channel, the dyke will be breached in two locations to connect the lake to the Gays River system. Future use of the lake could include artificial stocking with game fish species and/or fresh water aquaculture. However, water and habitat conditions and water quality would first need to be stabilised, and the ramifications of the introduction of non-local game fish carefully examined.
![img-42.jpeg](img-42.jpeg)

Figure 39: Conceptual reclamation plan (CBCL, 1999).The final reclamation plan also includes dismantling the buildings, removing scrap from the property, contouring the property such that it blends with the surrounding topography, and seeding.

# 19.10 Revenue

The mill will start production in Month 11 of Year 1. Using the base case scenario (Table 34), net yearly revenue (after smelting costs) during the surface mining operation will be $\$ 43$ million. For the underground operation, yearly revenue will be $\$ 58$ million. See Table 43 for more details.

### 19.11 Taxes and Royalties

### 19.11.1 Taxes

Acadian purchased ScoZinc Limited as opposed to the Scotia Mine asset. Purchasing the company rather than the asset complicates the project from a taxation perspective. The ownership history, tax history, etc must be considered. To avoid overly complicating the tax model, the feasibility study was carried out on a project basis rather than a corporate one.

Net income is subject to Federal and Provincial tax at rates of $29.12 \%$ and $16 \%$, respectively. There are several tax-related issues for the project, including Canadian Exploration Expenses (CEE), Canadian Development Expenses (CDE), capital cost allowances (CCA), resource allowance and the Atlantic Investment Tax Credit.

Most Canadian Exploration Expenses (CEE) are 100 \% deductible against mining income. Eligible expenses include exploration, delineation and pre-production development.

Canadian Development Expenses (CDE) are depreciated on a $30 \%$ declining balance. Eligible expenses include the cost of acquiring a mining property in Canada, sinking a mine shaft, main haulage way or similar underground work. It applies to development that is designed to be used for life use of the mine. The mine can deduct up to $30 \%$ of the unclaimed balance in that pool at the end of each year. Unclaimed balances may be carried forward indefinitely.

Capital costs are depreciated according to a capital cost allowance. The rate for most mining equipment is $25 \%$ per year (Class 41). In most cases, the amount deductible in the first year that an asset is acquired is subject to the "half-year" convention, which means that only onehalf of the amount that would be deductible at the normal CCA rate of that asset class can be claimed.

In addition to the normal $25 \%$ rate of depreciation accorded to Class 41 assets, an accelerated capital cost allowance (ACCA) can provide for an additional depreciation allowance of up to $100 \%$ of asset cost. To be eligible for that accelerated depreciation, however, assets must have been acquired before the beginning of commercial production or for major expansions.In the calculation of taxable income, the ACCA deduction is taken after the normal CCA, but before the resource allowance, CEE and CDE. Essentially, the ACCA acts to provide the full write-off of capital costs before a mine starts to pay income tax.

The resource allowance is a tax deduction equal to $25 \%$ of "resource profits." Resource profits are equal to revenue, less operating costs (excluding head office costs, royalties and mining taxes), less capital cost allowances. The resource allowance is being phased-out and will no longer exist after January 1, 2007. Replacing it will be a deduction for corporate income tax purposes of all payments of provincial and other Crown royalties and mining taxes.

An investment tax credit of $10 \%$ is available for capital investments in the Atlantic provinces. A business may deduct ten percent of eligible costs from its federal income tax liability. Eligible investments include qualifying buildings, machinery and equipment used or leased by the taxpayer.

# 19.11.2 Royalties

As stated in Section 3.2, Savage retains a $2 \%$ net smelter return royalty. Acadian entered into an option agreement that would enable it to purchase the royalty for $\$ 1.45$ million at the end of Year 1. That scenario was modelled in the economic analysis. Also, the Province of Nova Scotia levies another $2 \%$ of net revenue royalty. For the purpose of calculating the royalty, net revenue is essentially equal to net smelter return, minus shipping costs.

### 19.12 Capital Cost Estimates

The purchase price for ScoZinc Limited and all of its assets was completed on July 6, 2006 for $\$ \mathrm{CAN} 7.5$ million.

Capital costs are listed in Table 36. General project capital costs include permitting costs, a highway semi-dump truck for concentrate hauling and office equipment.

The mill, which has been under a care and maintenance condition for the past fifteen years, must be cleaned-up and re-commissioned. This will require a relatively minor amount of work (compared against building an entirely new mill). Belts will be replaced and gear oil will be changed. Heat will be applied to all of the motors to drive out any moisture. Bearings will be checked. Circuit breakers will be cleaned. The mill will be thoroughly cleaned and painted. The major capital items include labour for the re-commissioning work, a spare parts inventory and a heating system.

Because the mobile mining equipment will be leased, capital costs for the surface mine will be relatively minor. The most significant cost will be a fleet of four utility pick-up trucks.Pre-production stripping will take approximately two months and cost approximately two million dollars. In the economic analysis, this cost was applied as an operating cost rather than a capital cost.

The overall capital cost for the surface mining operation, excluding pre-production stripping, is $\$ 2.9$ million.

As the surface mine nears completion, the underground mine will start developing. For this work, drill jumbos, scooptrams (load-haul-dump units), a haul truck, utility vehicles, tractors, a compressor, fans, a raise climber, a backfill mixing plant and numerous other pieces of equipment must be purchased. The overall capital cost for the underground mining operation is $\$ 5.6$ million.

Table 36: Capital costs.

| Item | Cost |
| :-- | :--: |
| ScoZinc Purchase Price (Sale Completed) | $\$ 7.5$ million |
| Savage Royalty Purchase | $\$ 1.45$ million |
| Surface Mining Operation | $\$ 2.9$ million |
| Subtotal | $\$ 11.9$ million |
|  |  |
| Underground Mining Operation | $\$ 5.6$ million |

# 19.13 Operating Cost Estimates

Operating costs were based on producing 2,000 tonnes per day from the surface mine, then 1,350 tonnes per day from the underground mine. The operation would run 350 days per year, twenty-four hours per day in two shifts of ten hours each.

### 19.13.1Labour

At the time of report writing, there was a Canada-wide shortage of trades-people and mineral industry professionals. However, recruiting for this project will not be nearly as difficult as an equivalent project in a remote location. Its closeness to Halifax will be attractive for many people. Also, for the first few years of operation, relatively few skilled workers will be required. The majority of processing plant operators and surface mine equipment operators can be trained on-the-job.

For the staff, pay rates will range from $\$ 40,000$ for clerical work to $\$ 100,000$ for the manager (without burden) (Table 36 and Table 37). Salary burden includes Canada Pension Plan, unemployment insurance, vacation pay, Workers Compensation Board premiums, a basic pension plan and a basic health plan. Burden averages $19 \%$ of salary.For the surface shift workers including processing plant workers and equipment operators, salaries range from $\$ 30,000$ for general labourers to $\$ 60,000$ for supervisors. Burden averages $19 \%$ of salary.

Pay rates are much higher for underground miners. Salaries for underground miners average $\$ 100,000$, plus burden.

There is no history of unionised labour at Gays River. However, part of the workforce is unionised at National Gypsum's quarry in nearby Milford, Nova Scotia.Table 37: Staffing requirements.

# 19.13.2 Electric Power

The Scotia Mine site is currently supplied with three-phase power from the grid. Nova Scotia Power will supply electricity to the site using Rate 22. Peak demand is charged monthly at $\$ 8.01$ per kVA (kilovolt-ampere) per month when customers use their own transformers. Usage is charged at a rate of $\$ 0.048$ per kWh (kilowatt-hour).

### 19.13.3 Ongoing Development

For the surface mine, ongoing development is included in the operating costs and includes stripping, haul road construction and waste rock removal.

For the underground mine, ongoing development includes drift, ramp, cross-cut and raise construction. In total, approximately 4,000 metres of drifts and ramps are required. For an underground mine life of $21 / 2$ years, the average yearly development requirement is 1,600 metres per year. Also, a minimum of 1,000 metres of raising is required over the mine life for a yearly average of 400 metres.

### 19.13.4 Yearly Operating Costs

Operating the surface mine and processing plant is expected to cost $\$ 19$ million per year or $\$ 27$ per tonne of ore (Table 39). Operating the underground mine and processing plant is expected to cost $\$ 23$ million per year or $\$ 49$ per tonne of ore (Table 40).Table 39: Average yearly operating cost estimate for the surface mining operation.

* One pound of lead equals 0.43 pounds of zinc.

The operating costs per pound of zinc-equivalent are \$US 0.34 and \$US 0.30 for surface and underground mining, respectively. Figure 40 shows the zinc producer cost curve for 2005. It shows that approximately half of world-wide zinc is produced for \$US $0.25-0.37$ per pound. The estimated operating cost for Scotia Mine is competitive with other major producers.

The timing of cash flows determines the amount of initial working capital that is required. Mill repair will take 4-6 months and will start in Month 6 (Table 41). Pre-production stripping will last two months and will begin in Month 10, or as soon as the equipment is delivered. Ore production will begin two months later in Month 12.

It will take approximately two weeks to stockpile enough concentrate for an initial shipment of ten rail cars ( 1,000 tonnes). The initial payment, consisting of $85 \%$ of the concentrate value, is paid thirty days after the concentrate is shipped.

The timing and amount of the final payment depends on several factors. Firstly, the price per pound of metal is determined by averaging the spot metal prices for one month after the concentrate is shipped. Secondly, the average concentrate grade is determined through an exhaustive assaying process. The results are shared with the mine and if they disagree, samples are sent to an independent umpire. This process can take at least 2-3 months. If the mine agrees with the assays, the final payment may be paid in as little as 6-8 weeks after concentrate shipment.

Table 41: Timing of cash flows.

| Activity | Start Time (Month) |
| :--: | :--: |
| Mill Repair | 6 |
| Pre-production Stripping | 10 |
| Ore Production | 12 |
| Initial Payment (85 \%) | $131 / 2$ |
| Remaining Payment (15 \%) | $151 / 2$ (or later) |

### 19.15 Working Capital

The minimum initial working capital requirement is equal to the minimum cash balance during start-up. This was determined through analysing the project's start-up cash flow, on a month-by-month basis, for the first twenty-four months (Appendix 5). The minimum cash balance was calculated to be $-\$ 5.1$ million, occurring during Month 13. A contingency amount, equal to four months operating costs or $\$ 6.0$ million, should also be added to cover any initial start-up challenges. Therefore, the total initial working capital requirement, including contingency, is $\$ 11.1$ million.

During the project's operation, enough cash will be retained to cover operating costs for the following three months. At a total operating cost of approximately $\$ 1.5$ million per month during surface mining, $\$ 4.5$ million in working capital will continually be maintained. During underground mining, working capital will be maintained at $\$ 5.9$ million.# 19.16 Financing

The project will be financed through debt and equity financing. Equity financing was raised to cover the $\$ 7.5$ million purchase price of ScoZinc Limited. The minimum level of project financing that is required is $\$ 15,500,000$ (Table 42).

### 19.17 Economic Analysis

The economic analysis indicated that the project is very profitable. The analysis was carried out on an after-tax basis. Table 43 shows the project's income. The complete economic analysis is reported in Appendix 5.

The after-tax, net present value of the project, using base case parameters (Table 34) and an $8 \%$ discount rate $\left(\mathrm{NPV}_{8 \%\right.$ ) was $\$ 73.6$ million. The internal rate of return was $76 \%$. The profitability using other discount rates was:

A sensitivity analysis was carried out to gauge the sensitivity of the project's profitability to changes in metal prices, mine dilution, grade, initial capital costs, operating costs and exchange rate. The profitability indicators that were observed were the project's net present value, using a $8 \%$ discount rate $\left(\mathrm{NPV}_{8 \%}\right)$, and the project's internal rate of return (IRR).

Most parameters were varied to plus or minus $20 \%$ of the base case value. Metal prices were varied to minus $50 \%$ and plus $30 \%$ of the base case values. As one parameter was varied, the other parameters maintained their base case values.

From Figure 41, one can see that factors affecting the revenue, such as metal prices, grade, dilution and exchange rate, had a greater effect on profitability than factors affecting the costs, such as operating costs and initial capital costs. In other words, profitability is most sensitive to changes in metal prices, grade, dilution and exchange rate. It is less sensitive to changes in operating costs and relatively insensitive to changes in initial capital costs. Recall that the surface mobile equipment fleet will be leased.

At the time of report writing, prices for zinc and lead were experiencing historic high values of \$US 1.63 and $\$ 0.53$ per pound, respectively. The exchange rate was approximately$\$ 0.89$ (US dollars per Canadian dollar). Using slightly more conservative zinc and lead prices of $\$ U S 1.50$ and $\$ 0.45$ per pound, an exchange rate of $\$ 0.89$ and maintaining the other parameters at their base case values (Table 34), the project's net present value and internal rate of return were:

| Metal Prices (\$US per pound): |  |

# 19.19 Discussion of Risks

For both the surface and underground operations, the greatest risk for project profitability is metal price fluctuation. At the time of report writing, zinc and lead prices were at historical highs. For example, the zinc price increased more than three-fold since 2002. Some analysts believe that the zinc price will remain stable and high through 2006 and 2007, then start to decrease. They disagree on when it will start to decrease and by how much. There is the possibility of the zinc price decreasing to \$US 0.50-0.60 per pound by 2010. Other analysts are more bullish regarding metal prices, believing that world demand will outpace supply. Whichever view is correct, the best methods for controlling this risk are mining as quickly as possible and selling a portion of production forward (hedging) while prices are high.

Water inflow to the underground workings provides a less quantifiable, technical risk to the underground portion of the project. Because of the past history of water inflow problems, a "worse case" mine plan has already been adopted. The modified undercut-and-fill mining method that has been adopted for this deposit was designed for very poor ground conditions and offers a high level of protection against potentially unstable ground. Other measures, such as lowering the groundwater table below the level of the mine workings, will also be taken to further alleviate the risk. Because the underground portion of the project begins so far in the future (Year 8), major changes in the underground mining costs and revenue have only a minor effect on the project's net present value.

### 19.20 Payback Period

The payback period for the project, according to cumulative net income after interest and taxes, is twenty-one months (Figure 42).Figure 42: Project payback period according to cumulative net income after interest and taxes.

# 19.21 Mine Life

The surface operation will last almost six years. The underground operation will last more than two years for a total mine life of just over eight years.

The best possibility for extending the mine life lies with the Getty Deposit. Based on a $1.5 \%$ zinc-equivalent cut-off grade ( $1 \% \mathrm{~Pb}=0.6 \% \mathrm{Zn}$ in 1975 using a minimum core length of three metres), resources at the Getty deposit were reported by Hudgins and Lamb (1992) to be 4.5 million tons at an average grade of $1.3 \% \mathrm{~Pb}$ and $1.9 \% \mathrm{Zn} .^{8}$

There are also In-pit Inferred Resources that could potentially extend the surface mine life. The diluted and recoverable In-pit Inferred Resources amounted to 510,000 tonnes containing $2.2 \%$ zinc and $1.1 \%$ lead. The reader should note that there is no guarantee that any of this material can be profitably mined. Grade control sampling during surface mining operations will identify which part(s), if any, of this material could be profitably mined and processed.

Using a combination of surface and underground mining methods, the overall mine life is just over eight years.

The project's capital cost is $\$ 2.9$ million. The surface mobile equipment fleet will be leased. The purchase price for ScoZinc Limited is $\$ 7.5$ million and purchasing Savage's $2 \%$ NSR royalty will cost $\$ 1.45$ million, for a total initial capital cost of $\$ 11.85$ million. The capital cost for the underground operation, starting in Year 6, is $\$ 5.6$ million. The initial working capital requirement, including contingency is $\$ 11.1$ million.

Operating the surface mine and processing plant is expected to cost $\$ 19$ million per year ( $\$ 27$ per tonne of ore or \$US 0.34 per pound of zinc-equivalent). Operating the underground mine and processing plant is expected to cost $\$ 23$ million per year ( $\$ 49$ per tonne of ore or \$US 0.30 per pound of zinc-equivalent).

Net yearly revenue (after smelting costs) during the surface mining operation will be $\$ 43$ million. For the underground operation, yearly revenue will be $\$ 60$ million.

For the base case scenario (\$US 1.10 per pound zinc, \$US 0.45 per pound lead, \$US 0.86 exchange rate), the project's after-tax, net present value using a $8 \%$ discount rate $\left(\mathrm{NPV}_{8 \%\right.$ ) was $\$ 73.6$ million. The internal rate of return was $76 \%$. The payback period was twenty-one months.

Profitability is most sensitive to changes in metal prices, grade, dilution and exchange rate. It is less sensitive to changes in operating costs and relatively insensitive to changes in initial capital costs.

The greatest risk for project profitability is metal price fluctuation. Water inflow to the underground workings provides a less quantifiable, technical risk to the underground portion of the project.

## 21. Recommendations

The technical and economic analysis indicates that the project will be very profitable.
Because the project's profitability is most sensitive to metal prices, production must begin as soon as possible while metal prices remain high.

The Getty Deposit's Resources should be estimated. A feasibility study should also be carried out to determine if the Getty Deposit has any Reserves. This work should cost \$30,000$40,000$.# 22. References

Note: Our Colchester Title Searcher failed to find any record of the Gallant Lease against the Colchester parcels. Similarly, our Halifax Title Searcher failed to find any record of the Sand Lease against the Halifax parcels. There is also a Mortgage and Debenture that affected many of these parcels, both of which were released by a document recorded in both counties despite the wording of the document only referring to one of the counties. In summary, the fact that the parcels overlap both counties has caused some confusion in the past. Any future documents to be recorded against the properties should be sent to both county registries. ** Please see attached map for overview of the parcels and their locations.![img-47.jpeg](img-47.jpeg)
