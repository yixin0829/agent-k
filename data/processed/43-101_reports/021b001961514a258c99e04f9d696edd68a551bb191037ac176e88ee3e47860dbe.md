## 1 SUMMARY

This technical report on the Aley Niobium Project has been prepared by Geosim Services Inc. (Geosim)  at  the  request  of  Taseko  Mines  Limited  ('Taseko'  or  the  'Corporation'),  which  is based in Vancouver B.C., Canada.  The purpose of the report is to support the announcement of a mineral resource estimate for the Aley property announced in the Taseko News Release dated  March  28,  2012.  The  report  was  written  in  compliance  with  disclosure  and  reporting requirements set forth in the Canadian Securities Administrators' National Instrument 43-101, Companion Policy 43-101CP, and Form 43-101F1. In general, the information in this report is based on work completed and assay results received as of March 1, 2012.  An updated mineral resource estimate is provided based upon the current geological interpretation and exploration results obtained up to the effective date of March 1, 2012.

## 1.1 Introduction

The Aley Property is owned by Aley Corporation which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Taseko Mines  Limited  ('Taseko').    The  project  is  located  in  northeastern  British  Columbia  within  the Omineca Mining Division. The property comprises 104 mineral claims covering 43,316 hectares in  the  headwaters of the Ospika River closely adjacent to Ospika Arm of Williston Lake. The Aley claims are centered on 56° 27' N 123° 44' W, NTS mapsheets 94B.041 and 94B.042.

## 1.2 Geology and Mineralization

The  Aley  Carbonatite  complex  intrudes  Cambrian  to  Ordovician  sedimentary  rocks  of  the Kechika  (limestone),  Skoki  (dolomite  to  volcaniclastics)  and  Road  River  Group  formations (clastic sedimentary rocks). The intrusion is ovoid in plan with a diameter of approximately 2 km and surrounded by a fenite aureole up to 500 m. The complex is predominantly composed of dolomite carbonatite (CD) with minor calcite carbonatite (CC). Texturally relationships suggest CD to be metasomatic in origin while CC is interpreted to be primary.

Niobium (Nb) bearing  minerals  at  Aley  are  pyrochlore,  fersmite  and  columbite,  the  latter  two being  alteration  products  of  pyrochlore.  Alteration  at  Aley  has  followed  a  general  sequence: pyrochlore has altered to fersmite then fersmite has altered to columbite

## 1.3 Project History

Cominco Ltd. ('Cominco') acquired the property in 1980 after following up on base metals soil anomalies  in  the  northern  part  of  the  property.  Cominco  geologists  followed  the  stratigraphy from  the  anomalies  to  the  southeast  and  encountered  the  carbonatite  complex.  Samples collected in the Aley area showed evidence of carbonatite including the presence of pyrochlore. In  October  1982,  the  claims  Aley  1  through  Aley  4  (80  units  total)  were  staked  to  cover  the carbonatite complex. In 1986 the claims Aley 5 through Aley 7 (32 units) were staked and the final claim, Aley 8, was added in March 1986 (20 units).

Field  work  by  Cominco  commenced  in  1983  and  continued  regularly  through  the  1986  field season.  The  work  included  access  trail  construction,  ground  magnetic  and  scintillometer surveys, geologic mapping, soil and rock chip sampling and drilling of 19 core holes (3,046 m). Preliminary metallurgical work followed in 1983-85 using material from a 5 ton bulk sample.

Following  the  acquisition  of  control  of  the  mineral  claims  by  Aley  Corporation  in  2004, exploration efforts concentrated on trench sampling for metallurgical material and the confirmation of previous geology and drill hole collar locations.

In  2006, some metallurgical test work continued on surface samples blasted from the Saddle and  Central  Zone  trenches.  Approximately  1200  kg  of  material  was  shipped  to  Process Research Associates ('PRA') laboratories in Vancouver for metallurgical work.

In  2007  Taseko  took  over  as  operator  of  the  project  and  completed  a  program  of  helicopter supported exploration drilling comprising a total of 1,369m in 11 holes.

In 2010, an additional exploration program was completed comprising geological mapping and diamond drilling of 23 drill holes (2010-12 through 2010-34), for a total of 4,460 metres

In the fall of 2010, petrological work was carried out on 35 core samples (Kressall, 2010).

In 2011 Taseko completed an additional 70 exploration core holes totaling 17,093 m.

## 1.4 Drill Hole and Assay Database

The sample database for the Aley project contains results from 104 core holes drilled between 1985 and the end of 2011.  The Central Zone has been tested by 96 holes (21,434m) all of which were entirely within  the  carbonatite  complex.    Six  of  these  were  drilled  by  Cominco  in 1986 and 90 by Taseko Mines in 2010 and 2011.

## 1.5 Metallurgical Testing

A metallurgical testing program on eight samples from the Central Zone of the Aley carbonatite was initiated in November 2004 at PRA under the direction of Michel Robert.  The program was based on applying and testing the same mineral processing scheme used commercially at the Niobec niobium mine in Quebec since 1976.

The  laboratory  unit  processes  investigated  were  desliming,  magnetic  separation,  carbonate rougher  flotation,  niobium  rougher  and  scavenger  flotation,  and  the  first  and  second  niobium cleaner flotation stages. Sufficient work has been performed to establish a bench mark for these unit processes and establish operating criteria. The results obtained compared favorably to the operating results at Niobec.

The 2008 test program at PRA was conducted on a composite sample of Saddle Zone material that was extracted in 2005 from a surface trench and used the same test parameters developed on  Central  Zone  material.        The  Saddle  Zone  material  is  in  the  same  mineral  complex  and adjacent to the Central Zone, but is not part of the inferred resource described in this report. These tests were conducted to test coarser feed particle sizes than the previous test work on the  Central  Zone.    Feed  size  targets  were  conducted  at  80  %  passing  180  microns,  150 microns, and 110 microns.  The 110 micron tests were to provide a point of reference that could be used to compare the results to the 2005 work, as this is the same target size used in that program.

The  2008  test  program  encompassed  five  stages  of  niobium  cleaner  flotation.    These  test results  indicate  that  decreasing  grade  and  recovery  of  NB O   to  the  5th  cleaner  concentrate 2 5 were observed with increasing particle size.  In comparison to the 2005 test program, the 2008 second cleaner concentrate results show similar recovery at the same feed target size, but a reduced concentrate grade.

A metallurgical test program has been initiated utilizing drill core from the 2010 field season.

## 1.6 Resource Estimate

The Resource Estimate was prepared by Ronald G. Simpson, P.Geo of Geosim Services Inc. of Vancouver,  Canada,  utilizing  analytical  results  from  the  96  core  holes  drilled  on  the  Central Zone  to  date.      Assays  were  composited  in  6  metre  down-hole  intervals.    Grades  were  not capped as no significant outlier population was identified.

Block grades were estimated by means of ordinary kriging in three passes using incremental search distances.  The first pass used a maximum anisotropic search of 50m equivalent to ¼ of the maximum variogram range. The second pass search was set at ¾ of the variogram range at 150m and the final pass search was extended to the maximum range of 200m.

Blocks were classified as 'Measured' if there were two composites from at least two drill holes within  50  m  of  the  block  centroid  based  on  the  anisotropic  search  parameters.    Blocks  not meeting the criteria for 'Measured' were classified as 'Indicated' if there were two composites from at least two drill holes within 100m of the block centroid.  All other estimated blocks were classified as 'Inferred'.

In  order  to  meet  the  requirements  of  NI43-101  with  respect  to  reasonable  prospects  of economic  extraction  by  open  pit  mining  methods,  a  45°wall  slope  Lerchs-Grossman  pit  was generated  to  constrain  the  resource  within  the  block  model.    Metal  prices  assumed  were US$50kg Nb with process  recovery  of  50%.    General  &amp;  Administration,  Processing  and  Ore Mining costs were assumed to be $30/tonne.  Base waste mining costs were assumed to be $1.50/tonne.

The in-pit mineral resource for the Central Zone of the Aley Deposit is summarized in the table below for a range of cutoff grades with the base case of 0.2% Nb O  in boldface.  The effective 2 5 date of the mineral resource is March 1, 2012.

## 1.7 Conclusions and Recommendations

Evaluation of the exploration programs and results available to the effective date of this report indicates that:

-  The geology is sufficiently  well  understood  to  support  the  mineral  resource  estimation presented in this report and summarized in the section above.
-  Core  drilling  has  identified  a  continuous  body  of  near-surface  niobium  mineralization within  an  area  measuring  1400m  E-W  by  500m  N-S  and  to  a  depth  below  surface  of about 250 m.  The ultimate limits have not been defined.
-  Data collection to the end of 2011 at the drill site is acceptable.
-  Average grades for all the drill assays returned from the Central Zone as of the report effective date were 0.32% Nb2O5 .
-  The database contains  all  drilling  data  collected  on  the  project  to  date  and  has  been structured for resource estimation.
-  QA/QC with respect to the results received to date for the Taseko 2007, 2010 and 2011 exploration programs is acceptable and protocols have been well documented.
-  As of March 1, 2012, the Aley deposit is estimated to contain a measured and indicated resource  of  286  million  tonnes  grading  0.37%  Nb O   using  a  cut-off  grade  of  0.2% 2 5 Nb2O5..    An  additional  144  million  tonnes  averaging  0.32%  Nb O   is  classified  as 2 5 inferred.

Additional drilling is warranted to define the extents of the Nb mineralization in the Central Zone, to upgrade the resource classification and to follow up on other targets on the property.

Metallurgical  testwork  designed  to  support  a  Preliminary  Economic  Assessment  should  be continued.

## 4.3 Nature and Extent of Issuer's Title

The extent of Aley Corporation's title to the Aley property are the claims listed in Section 4.2. There are no title encumbrances that would preclude Aley Corporation from carrying out further exploration or developing a mine.

There are no surface right issues or legal access obligations that must be met in order for Aley Corporation to retain this property. The Aley Property is not subject to any royalty terms, back-in rights, payments or any other agreements or encumbrances.

## 4.4 Permits &amp; Environmental Liabilities

The Aley property is subject to environmental liabilities related to the rehabilitation of drill sites and  exploration  access  roads  associated  with  the  work  permits  received  for  the  2010,  2011 exploration drilling programs and the road right of way construction taking place in 2012.  Funds

to cover the expense of these reclamation activities are held in trust and are fully recoverable by Aley  Corporation  once  the  site  has  been  rehabilitated  to  the  satisfaction  of  the  Inspector  of Mines.

To the extent known, there are no other environmental liabilities to which the property is subject.

At  this  stage,  further  exploration  work  and  road  right  of  way  construction  is  being  carried  out under  stipulations  assigned  through  Notices  of  Work  and  Reclamation  Programs  held  under Mines Act Permit # MX-13-141.   Licenses to Cut, and Road Use Permits required to carry out all planned work are in place and valid.

## 5 Accessibility, Climate, Infrastructure and Physiography 5.1 Accessibility

The  property  is  situated  approximately  20  km  northeast  of  the  head  of  the  Ospika  Arm  of Williston Lake. Logging roads lead from Mackenzie, BC along the west shore of Williston Lake around its head, via the Tsay Keh Dene community, and down the east shore of the same lake to CANFOR's Ospika Camp. Northern Thunderbird Air of Prince George operates a charter air flight service that links Prince George to the Ospika Camp. Barge access has historically been available  from  Mackenzie  (approximately  90  km  south  on  Williston  Lake)  for  the  purposes  of movement of heavy equipment. Logging roads and a caterpillar trail constructed by Cominco in 1985 once provided rough surface access to the property,  however  due  to  the  poor  state  of repair  of  this  trail  and  in  consideration  of  the  time  consuming  permitting  process  for  its reestablishment,  site  access  and  equipment  transport  during  the  2007,  2010  and  2011  field seasons  was  effected  by  Bell  206  and  407  helicopters.  Helicopter  access  was  conducted principally from the airstrip at Ospika Camp approximately 30 km from the claims as well as a staging site on a cut block 10 km from the claims.

Recently-constructed logging roads under the jurisdiction of CANFOR extend approximately 20 km beyond the Ospika Camp towards the property. Road use permits have been obtained for these  roads.  These  logging  roads  are  proximal  to  the  disused  Cominco  trail.  Right  of  way clearing for a new trail to tie into the Cominco Trail had progressed four out of the total twelve kilometres at the time of the effective date of this report.

After the right of way is constructed and freshette has ended in 2012, the access trail will be upgraded to allow access for exploration equipment to the site. This upgraded road will connect the logging roads from Ospika Camp to the exploration sites. In 2005 (prior to the acquisition of Aley Corporation by Taseko Mines Limited), AllNorth Consultants ('AllNorth') of Prince George conducted a helicopter-supported survey of the access to the Aley claims via existing CANFOR logging roads, upon which a route (on Aley claim blocks) connecting these logging roads to the disused trail was designed. The AllNorth road has been substantially modified from Cominco's trail  in  compliance with the current Forest Practices Code of British Columbia, and the Forest Road  Engineering  Guide  for  road  construction.  This  work  was  presented  by  AllNorth  in  a detailed report entitled 'Aley Property Exploration Road Survey' dated September 6, 2005 by Ken MacDonald, P.Geo.  The design for this road is being used to construct the road right of way and will guide construction of the exploration road upgrade in the latter half of 2012. Until this road is complete, exploration activities will continue to be supported through helicopters.

## 5.2 Local Resources Infrastructure

The  property  is  located  near  the  northern  shore  of  Williston  Lake.  The  W.A.C.  Bennett hydroelectric  dam  is  about  120  km  east-southeast  of  the  centre  of  the  property  at  Hudson's Hope. The BC Railway lies approximately 160 km to the east-northeast.

Logging operations in recent years have improved access into the area. Road construction in 2012 will  allow  for  rough  exploration  access  but  this  road  will  require  further  upgrades  if  the project progresses through to construction and operation.

A  temporary  exploration  camp  has  been  constructed  on  the  CANFOR  Ospika  camp  land. Several  trailers  are  in  place  providing  sleeping  quarters,  dining,  showers  and  toilet  facilities. Core sheds and maintenance buildings are also on the camp site.  A landing strip, helicopter pad, and barge landing are all available. Electricity is currently provided by generators. Potable water is trucked in. Garbage is either incinerated or trucked offsite as is sewage.

## 5.3 Physiography

Elevations range from 1,300 m in the creek valleys to the west and south of the claim blocks to 2,233  m  on  the  ridge  to  the  very  east  of  the  property  known  as  the  Saddle  Zone.  The topography primarily consists of steep mountainous terrain with U to V-shaped glacial valleys. Small  creeks  drain  from  several  peaks  that  form  a  ridge  that  surrounds  the  property  in  all directions.  Flows  are  seasonal  depending  on  snow  meltwater,  rain,  and  winter  freezing  and avalanche terrain is evident on some of the steeper slopes.

Boreal  forest  covers  the  area  below  the  tree  line  (~1600-m).  Much  of  the  central  part  of  the claims lies above the tree line and this area is dominated by alpine shrubs and grasses. The higher elevations are commonly covered with sparse grass, broken scree, and outcrop.

## 5.4 Climate

The  northern  boreal  forest  region  is  subjected  to  an  extreme  range  of  weather  conditions throughout the year. Summers are short, from June to late September and are variably dry to wet.  Local storms of heavy rainfall or even snow may occur at any time. Autumn is short with the  rapid  onset  of  snowstorms  and  heavy  rains  starting  in  late  September,  which  effectively ends the field  season. Snow stays on the ground from October through early June and may remain  year  round  in  relatively  shaded  patches  on  the  peaks  on  the  property.  As  such, exploration is limited to the period from June to late September.

## 6 HISTORY

Cominco acquired the property after following up on regional base metals anomalies in 1980 north  of  the  property.  While  following  the  stratigraphy  southeast  from  the  anomalies  they encountered the carbonatite complex. Samples showed evidence of carbonatite including the presence of pyrochlore. In 1982, Cominco revisited the property to collect additional samples and assess the scale of the carbonatite and, in October 1982, the claims Aley 1 through Aley 4 (80 units total) were staked to cover the carbonatite complex. Aley 5 through Aley 7 (32 units) were staked in 1986 and the final claim Aley 8 was added in March 1986 (20 units).

Field work started in 1983 and continued regularly through the 1986 field season. Metallurgical work  followed  in  1983-85.  No  exploration  has  been  done  since  September  1986  prior  to  the current studies. There is no record of why Cominco suspended work on the property.

## 7 GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND MINERALIZATION

## 7.1 Regional Geology

Reference: McLeish, 2011 - Technical Report on Structural Geology, Aley Carbonatite Niobium Project

The  Aley  region  lies  within  the  Western  Foreland  belt  of  the  Rocky  Mountains  which  is characterized by Early to Middle Paleozoic deep water carbonates and shales (Fig. 2.1).  These slope to off-shelf deep water strata defining the paleogeographic Kechika Trough.  In the Aley region, the north-south trending, 50 km wide trough is bound to the west by the Northern Rocky Mountain Trench (NRMT), which is host to an Eocene dextral strike-slip fault interpreted to have accommodated  &gt;400  km  of  dextral  strike-slip  displacement;  and  to  the  east  by  a  facies boundary defined by the western limit of shallow water carbonates of the Macdonald Platform. North of 59 degrees N Latitude, the Kechika Trough widens into the Selwyn Basin.  The trough terminates immediately south of the Aley region, where the facies boundary marking the east margin of the trough curves around to the west, and is truncated against the NRMT fault.  Strata on  the  western  side  of  the  NRMT  are:  (1)  lithologically  similar  Paleozoic  continental  margin sediments, (2) assigned to the Kechika formation, and (3) form part of the Cassiar terrane, a continental block of uncertain paleogeographic affinity (Pope and Sears, 1997).

The  Aley  Creek  area  lies  near  the  eastern  limit  of  Paleozoic  volcanism  and  coarse  clastic sedimentation  in  the  Foreland  Belt.  The  Lady  Laurier  volcanics  and  westerly  derived  Earn Group conglomerates, exposed to the immediate north and west of the Aley carbonatite (Fig. 2.2), have been cited as evidence for tectonism in the mid-Paleozoic (e.g. Gordey et al., 1987). Synmagmatic contractional deformation structures in continental margin strata that is host to the Aley carbonatite suggest that this activity was (1) at least in part the result of convergence along the parent margin and (2) associated with carbonatite emplacement (McLeish, 2011).

## 7.2 Local and Property Geology

The  Aley  Carbonatite  complex  intrudes  Cambrian  to  Ordovician  sedimentary  rocks  of  the Kechika  (limestone),  Skoki  (dolomite  to  volcaniclastics)  and  Road  River  Group  formations (clastic sedimentary rocks). The intrusion is ovoid in plan view with a diameter of approximately 2 km and surrounded by a fenite aureole up to 500 m thick that has previously been mapped as 'amphibolite'  (Pride,  Cominco  Ltd.,  1987)  and  'syenite'  (Mäder,  1986).  The  complex  is predominantly  composed  of  dolomite  carbonatite  (CD)  with  minor  calcite  carbonatite  (CC).

Texturally relationships suggest that CD is metasomatic in origin while CC is interpreted to be primary.  An overview of the property geology and stratigraphic table is presented in Figure 7-2.

Following  a  detailed  petrographic  study  of  the  Aley  carbonatite  complex  during  the  2010 exploration  program,  a  system  of  geological  codes  was  established  for  the  purposes  of harmonized core-logging  and  as  a  basis  for  geological  interpretation.  This  system  comprises standardized composite nomenclature based on primary lithology (represented in upper case), modified by prefixes designed to capture information pertinent to the style of mineralization, its fabric  and  texture  (indicated  in  lower  case)  and  suffixes  formulated  to  record  structural  detail (also indicated in lower case). The underlying basis for this coding system is presented in Table 7-1; in which regard an example, banded laminated porphyritic cumulate carbonatite would be represented  as  'blpCM'.  Such  data  are  directly  captured  by  core  shack  personnel  using  an MSAccess-based logging system developed by Hunter Dickinson. Regular site meetings, led by either the senior or project geologist, are held to ensure consistency of logging between coreshack personnel.

In view of the composite nature of this system, the process of assigning codes to each logged interval inevitably resulted in numerous code permutations. While such codes are believed to be geologically  accurate,  these  often  require  simplification  in  order  to  be  of  use  in  geological modeling for resource estimation. For this reason, resource domains were primarily defined on the basis of simplified observation of pre-alteration lithology, specifically Cumulate Carbonatite (CM), Dolomite Carbonatite (CD) and Silicocarbonatite (CS), the qualifying criteria for which are laid out below. In addition to lithological constraint, consideration was also given to trends and discontinuities identified in preliminary unconstrained grade-shell modeling, as well as points of inflection in down-hole assay data.

## Cumulate Carbonatite (CM):

Primary, unaltered lithologies principally comprise:

- (i) Banded  laminated  +/-  porphyritic  cumulate  carbonatite  or  mixed  calcite  and dolomite carbonatite (blpCM or blpCCCD, respectively).
- (ii) Globular and laminate cumulate carbonatite or globular laminated mixed calcite and dolomite carbonatite (glCM or glCCCD, respectively).

Secondary, dolomitized lithologies principally comprise :

- (iii) Banded  laminated  +/-  porphyritic  dolomite  carbonatite  or  banded,  massive porphyritic dolomite carbonatite (blpCD or bmpCD, respectively).

## Dolomite Carbonatite (CD)

- (i) Due to the propensity of this domain to exhibit intensely oxidized to calcitized and highly  fractured  intervals  near  surface  or  in  the  vicinity  of  faults,  these  intervals commonly exhibit brecciation, decalcification and faulting, as well as inequigranularity, in association with the principal dolomite carbonatite (CD) identifier. In addition, due  to  the  close  textural association  of  the dolomite carbonatite domain with the cumulate magnetite domain it is common  for, disseminated, banded, massive and l - laminated textures to be associated with the domain, in which regard it should be noted that assay results are generally required to distinguish the dolomite carbonatite domain from the cumulate carbonatite domain and delimit with greater certainty its boundary.

## Silicocarbonatite (CS)

Primary, unaltered lithologies principally comprise

- (i) aggregated, laminated +/-porphyritic silicocarbonatite or aggregated and massive silicocarbonatite or disseminated, massive and porphyritc silicocarbonatite or massive, laminate and porphyritic silicocarbonatite (glpCS or gmCS or dmpCS or mlpCS, respectively).
- (ii) aggregated phoscorite (gPH)
- (iii) banded,  laminated +/-porphyritic mixed  calcite and  dolomite carbonatitie orbanded,  massive  +/-  porphyritic mixed  calcite and  dolomite  carbonatitie (blpCCCD or bmpCCCD)
- (iv) aggregated, laminated and porphyritic cumulate carbonatite or aggregated and massive  cumulate  carbonatite  or  banded,  laminated  and  porphyritc  cumulate carbonatite (glpCM or gmCM or blpCM)

Secondary, dolomitized lithogies comprise:

- (i) +/- disseminated, +/- laminated and porphyritic dolomite carbonatite (dlpCD)

The significant range in lithological codes associated with the silicocarbonatite occurs due to the fact that the domain contains texturally variable lithologies (see Section 7.1).

For each of the three geological domains the modifiers for mineralization style, fabric, texture and structure  have  potential  to  be  associated  with  fenite,  giving  rise  to  AMX  intervals  and  in general would represent the characteristic of the carbonatite in which the fenite was hosted.  In such situations, unless the fenite clasts or blocks were encapsulated in clearly-defined intervals with little ambiguity, core-logs and core photos were used to confirm the domain to which it was assigned.

Under circumstances where ambiguity remained as to which domain to which the interval was attributed,  core-logs  and  core  photos  were  consulted,  and  where  appropriate  drill  core  re-

examined to establish the nature of the interval. In instances where uncertainty still remained subsequent to drill core examination, assay records were applied in further characterization of the intervals.

## 7.3 Mineralization

The niobium (Nb) minerals at Aley consist of pyrochlore, fersmite, and columbite.  The alteration follows  a  general  sequence  whereby  pyrochlore,  and  to  a  lesser  degree,  columbite,  alter  to fersmite.  The  chemistry  of  the  alteration  minerals  appears  to  be  inherited  from  the  parent mineral. At Aley, no significant amount of tantalum (Ta) has been noted in the pyrochlore and the alteration minerals also do not contain it. Likewise, the reduction of solid solution capacity in the minerals reduces in the alteration sequence. The iron (Fe) content appears to increase in atomic proportion towards columbite.

The  term Pyrochlore applies  to  a  broad  group  of  minerals,  one  of  three  subgroups  and  one mineral in a subgroup of the same name (Hogarth, 1977). The mineral pyrochlore has generic formula: A2-m B2O6(O,OH,F)1n . p H2O with a wide variety of elements occurring as the A element, including ( Na, Ca ,  K,  Sn,  Ba,  REE,  Pb,  Bi,  U)  and  T  or  Ti  occurring  as  B.    (Bold  =  essential

element;  italics  =  low/rare  elements).  Pyrochlore  forms  euhedral  to  subhedral  octahedral crystals 0.2 to 4-mm in size concentrated in the heavy mineral bands.

Fersmite is  a  relatively  rare  Nb  oxide mineral found in carbonatites and certain pegmatites. It has been recorded in less than 15 places globally. It has the generic formula AB2(O,OH,F)6 , where A = ( Ca ,Na,Ce) and B = ( Nb ,Ti, Fe,Ta ). Fe is a potential but not essential element. There appears  to  be  a  range  of  solid  solution  that  may  accommodate  Ta,  but  it  isn't  an  essential element.  It  forms  as  fine  granular  anhedral,  subhedral,  and  rarely  euhedral  crystals  growing within the boundaries of pyrochlore octahedral with lesser amounts of primary fersmite growing as sprays and single crystals in carbonate.

Columbite is an end-member of the columbite-tantalite series with the formula (Fe, Mn)(Nb,Ta)2O6 . The Nb-rich member is columbite. Fe is an essential element. Columbite can be ferroan or manganoan, depending on the dominance in the elements in the A-sites. It occurs at  Aley  only  as  an  alteration  of  fersmite.  Limited  data  suggests  it  occurs  more  persistently, perhaps as a majority Nb-mineral, in the Central Zone in dolomite carbonatite (McLeod, 1986d).

The  two  largest  exploration  targets  are  the  Central  and  Saddle  zones.  The  Central  Zone occupies the core of the carbonatite complex and has a strike varying from 070° to 120° strike (predominantly 120) and dips 60° to 70° to the south. Mineralization is associated with bands and swirls of magnetite. The Saddle zone occupies the northern part of the carbonatite complex in proximity to the contact with the amhibolite annulus and has a strike of 070° to 090° dipping at 60° to 70° to the north. Mineralization is associated with alternating bands of pyritic calcite (varying in width from 5cm to 5m) with dolomitic or calcitic carbonatite.

## 8 DEPOSIT TYPE

In the Aley deposit, niobium occurs in pyrochlore that formed as early-stage mineral precipitates in  primary  magma.  Alteration  of  the  dolomite  carbonatite  by  unknown  factors  created  the  Nb bearing alteration minerals fersmite and columbite. The changes are believed to have occurred largely in situ, and as such there has been less scope for transport or concentration of Nb by secondary processes. The type of deposit is considered to be that of magmatic segregation.

Fluid dynamics in the liquid magma provided the primary influence on Nb distribution. Magmatic carbonate differs from silicate magmas by not exhibiting the polymerisation of the latter and thus remaining  more  liquid  until  the  initial  stages  of  solidification.  Fluid  flow  within  the  magma chamber  is  relatively  rapid  and  turbulent.  Mäder  (Mäder,  1986g)  notes  that  apatite  and pyrochlore  precipitated  early  in  the  dolomite  carbonate  magma,  and  pyrochlore,  apatite, magnetite,  richterite,  and  biotite  precipitated  early  in  the  calcite  carbonate  magma.  These heavier  minerals  were  then  lifted  by  thermal  convection  currents  within  the  lighter,  high carbonate  magmas,  only  to  be  entrained  by  and  settle  within  counterflow  currents.  These currents concentrate the minerals into subvertical bands or sheets that have significant vertical and  lateral  continuity,  even  though  they  may  be  less  than  several  metres  wide.  The  rapid convection means that the heavy minerals will not settle into subhorizontal layers, as occurs in silicate magmas, such as immiscible sulphides in ultramafic magmas. The bands were blocked during solidus. Some streaming and attenuation likely occurred during emplacement of the Aley carbonatite  in  its  sub-solidus  (crystal  mush)  state.  The  mineral  bands  were  already  steeply dipping, and little change in band geometry or orientation is believed to have occurred during intrusion.

The control of location of the mineral bands lies mainly in the shape of the magma chamber and the form of the intrusion. With no evidence of post-emplacement remobilisation or concentration of Nb, the inherited geometry of the bands provides the final control of Nb emplacement. The Aley  intrusion  is  roughly  ovoid.  Measurements  of  the  mineral  bands  show  that  they  are subparallel with the intrusive contacts in concentric, arcuate bands (Mäder, 1986g). Traditional exploration for Nb involves identifying the richest bands and following them with surface and drill testing.

## 9 EXPLORATION

## 9.1 Cominco Ltd. 1983-1986

Field work started in 1983 and continued regularly through the 1986 field season. Metallurgical work  followed  in  1983-85.  The  work,  which  was  accomplished  in  10  months  of  field  work, included

-  Roads: over 20-km of bulldozer access trail from the Ospika barge landing to the Aley camp (1984). This is now partially superseded by the recent logging roads and Ospika Camp of CANFOR.
-  Trail developments: skid trails accessible by means of 4x4 vehicle from the Aley camp in the vicinity of the drill targets for a total ~28 km of trail.
-  Orthophotography (1983) and derived base maps.
-  Geophysical surveys: magnetometer surveys at several scales from reconnaissance to detailed local grids (17 line-kilometres); scintillometer reconnaissance surveys.
-  Geological mapping at a scale of 1:5,000 over claims Aley 1-7 and on a more localized basis at a scale of 1:2,500 plus mapping of trenches at a scale of 1:500.
-  Soil sampling on contour lines and along road banks.
-  Rock chip sampling of outcrops, talus, road cuts with outcrop/subcrop, and all trenches (5-m contiguous samples).
-  Diamond drilling in two campaigns for a total of 3,046.36m in 19 holes. NQ diameter core was drilled in 1985 and BQ diameter in 1986. Core was stored on site.
-  An environmental baseline study conducted over the 1985 and 1986 field seasons by Norelco.
-  Mineralogical studies conducted on samples throughout programs.
-  Sample preparation for rock and core samples was done in the field.

## 9.2 Aley Corporation 2004-2006

Following  the  acquisition  of  control  of  the  mineral  claims  by  Aley  Corporation  in  2004, exploration efforts were concentrated on trench sampling for metallurgical material, confirmation of  previous  geology  and  establishment  of  historic  drill  hole  collar  locations.  Trenches  were opened by means of drilling and blasting in the vicinity of the Cominco trenches cut in 1985 and 1986. The purpose of these new trenches was twofold, firstly to acquire material suitable for metallurgical testwork, and secondly to confirm the grades estimated by Cominco in the 1980's. The samples were collected from trenches in the Central Zone near to the location of historic trenches CZ-85-6, CZ-85-6A and CZ-85-8, and in the Saddle Zone at SZ-84-4. In total, 912 kg

of  sample  were  gathered  from  the  Aley  site.  During  the  same  period,  all  of  the  major  zones identified by Cominco were visited and drill holes locations identified and logged using a GPS. This work was carried out as a means by which to validate the previous mapping and survey work  undertaken  using  conventional  survey  compass  mapping,  as  compared  to  current  GPS technology  in  order  to  identify  any  systematic  errors  in  the  mapping  developed  by  Cominco. Aley Corporation reported a 'reasonable correlation' between the Cominco sampling work and that of Aley Corporation and that in their view  GPS survey work verified the Cominco mapping as reasonable and suitable for continued exploration, with the recommendation of conducting a survey for future resource work.

In 2006, a geological review and compilation of previous drilling and trenching was performed by Dave Thomas of AMEC with the objective of evaluating the mineralization and planning the 2006 field program. The 2006 drilling program was postponed to 2007 to accommodate a study being carried out on mountain goat movements.

Also in 2006, some metallurgical test work was continued on surface samples blasted from the Saddle and Central Zone trenches to which end approximately 1200 kg of material was worked on by PRA laboratories in Vancouver.

## 9.3 Taseko Mines Limited 2007-2011

In  2007  Taseko  took  over  as  operator  of  the  project  and  completed  a  program  of  helicopter supported  exploration  drilling  comprising  1,369  metres  in  11  holes.  The  objective  of  the  drill program was the confirmation  of  previous  exploration  work  undertaken  by  Cominco  between 1985 and 1986.

In  2009,  and  independently of Taseko, a five-week academically oriented mapping campaign was conducted on the property by Duncan F. McLeish, Dr. Stephen T. Johnston, and Mitch G. Mihalynuk  with  the  objective  of  gaining  a  better  understanding  of  the  tectonic  and  structural controls on, and timing of, emplacement of carbonatites in the Canadian Cordillera. Observations from this work formed the basis of a M.Sc. thesis (McLeish, 2011).  In 2010, a two-week  mapping  campaign  by  Duncan  F.  McLeish  was  conducted  under  the  auspices  of Taseko,  with  the  objective  of  providing  a  structural  and  petrographic  basis  within  which  to undertake the targeting of exploration drilling that summer.

In 2010, an exploration program comprising diamond drilling of 23 drill holes (2010-12 through 2010-34), for a total of 4,460 metres was completed.

In  the  fall  of  2010,  petrological  and  petrographic  characterization  work  was  carried  out  on  35 core samples (Kressall, 2010).

In 2011 Taseko completed an additional 70 exploration core holes totaling 17,093 m.

## 10 DRILLING

## 10.1  Historical Drilling (1985-1986)

The  Aley  deposit  was  discovered  in  1980  by  Cominco.  From  1985  to  1986,  3062  meters  of diamond  drilling  was  completed  in  20  holes  (A85-01  to  A85-10  and  A86-01  to  A86-10)  with average length of 153 meters (Table 10-1).  The holes were drilled at various azimuths (20º to 345º) and inclinations (-45º to -65º).  No downhole surveys were performed on the 1985 holes.

In 1986, downhole surveys were performed all ten holes, with three holes having two downhole surveys.  The  downhole  survey  method  is  unknown.  The  1985  drilling  was  completed  in  the Saddle, Saddle West, Bear Extension and East Zones. In 1986, the first six holes were drilled in the Central Zone with the remaining four in the Saddle and Saddle West.

Although core recovery data records for the 1985 and 1986 drill programs were not located, the 1985  and  1986  assessment  reports  state  that  core  recovery  average  greater  than  85%.  NQ (47.6 mm) and BQ (36.4 mm) core sizes were drilled and a total of 1,026 core samples with average length of 3 meters were taken.

Table 10-1 Historical drilling summary

| Operator   |   Year | Drill Hole ID    |   No. of  Holes | Core  Size   |   Metres |
|------------|--------|------------------|-----------------|--------------|----------|
| Cominco    |   1985 | A85-01 to A85-02 |              10 | BQ/NQ        |   1580.8 |

## 10.2  2007 Drilling

In 2007, 11 drill holes (2007-001 through 2007-011) were completed by Taseko Mines Limited for  a  total  length  of  1,369  meters.  Among  them,  2007-001,  2007-002,  2007-004,  2007-006, 2007-007 and 2007-010 were of NQ (50.6 mm) diameter,  and 2007-003, 2007-005, 2007-008, 2007-009 and 2007-011 were of BTW (48.5 mm) diameter.

All 2007 holes were drilled vertically and geotechnical data was measured on all holes except 2007-008 and 2007-011. Core was measured on 318 drill runs averaging 3.1 metres in length and averaging 97% in recovery. The only non-vertical hole, 2007-011 at an azimuth of 040º and an inclination of -88.3º, also recorded the only downhole survey taken that year.

The 2007 drill core was cut in half lengthwise using a diamond saw. Sample lengths averaged 3 metres. The half-core samples were tagged, bagged and assembled into shipping containers and shipped by commercial carrier to International Plasma Labs Ltd (IPL), Richmond, BC for preparation and analysis.

## 10.3  2010 Drilling

In  2010,  23  holes  (2010-012  through  2010-034)  were  drilled  by  Taseko  for  a  total  length  of 4,516 meters.  All holes were drilled at similar orientation with azimuths ranging from 020º to 060º and inclination from -45º to  -55º.    Downhole  surveys  by  single  shot  magnetic  tool  were performed  on  18  of  the  23  holes  drilled  in  2010.  Five  holes  were  not  surveyed  due  the unavailability of survey  equipment.  The  downhole  survey  tests  performed  also  included magnetic strength and temperature measurements. The directional component of the surveys was  later  evaluated  as  to  the  degree  of  curvature  implied  in  each  borehole.  A  few  records deemed to be errant due to magnetic influence were removed.

All 2010 drill holes were of NQ (47.6 mm) diameter. Geotechnical data were collected for most of  the  holes  with  the  exception  of  2010-031  through  2010-034.  A  total  of  1,178  drill  runs averaging 3.0 m in length were measured with 97% overall average core recovery

The 2010 drill core samples were transported by helicopter from drill sites on the Aley Project to the nearby Ospika Camp where it was logged and sampled by company personnel. Samples

were taken by cutting the drill core in half lengthwise using a diamond saw. Cores from the first six drill holes were split at Ospika and cores from the remaining 17 drill holes were split at the Gibraltar  Mine,  under  supervision of company geological personnel. The 2010 drill cores and split samples were trucked from Ospika to the Gibraltar Mine by commercial carrier. The halfcore  samples  were  tagged,  bagged  and  shipped  by  commercial  carrier  to  Inspectorate Exploration &amp; Mining Services Ltd. (Inspectorate), Richmond, BC for preparation and analysis. The half core remaining in the boxes is stored at the Gibraltar Mine site. Coarse rejects and pulp samples are stored at the Hunter Dickinson warehouse facility in Surrey, BC.

A total of 1,314 half core samples averaging 3 m in length were collected during 2010.

## 10.4  2011 Drilling

A total of 17,093.5 meters of drilling was completed in 70 Central Zone drill holes in 2011 by Taseko Mines Limited on the Central Zone. The 70 hole total includes, 65 exploration drill holes numbered  2011-035  through  2011-099  and  three  geomechanical  holes  2011-GM-01  through 2011-GM-03 completed by Blackhawk Drilling, and two geotechnical holes GTF-4 and GTF-5 drilled by Foundex Drilling.

In addition, six vertical monitoring wells, 2011-MW01  through  2011-MW06,  and  three geotechnical  holes  2011-GT01  through  2011-GT03  were  drilled  by  Foundex  outside  of  the Central Zone  area  to test site infrastructure options. These  nine  monitoring well and geotechnical holes drilled are not reflected in the footage totals.

The exploration  holes  were  drilled  predominantly  with  azimuths  of  between  20   and  30   and   were typically inclined from -40  to -60 . The geomechanical holes were drilled at the following   collar azimuth and inclination: 2011-GM-1 at 28  and -56 , 2011-GM-02 at 201  and -70 , 2011-    GM-03 at 21  and -75 . Geotechnical holes GTF-4 and GTF-5 were drilled vertically. Downhole   surveys were performed on all 2011 holes drilled by Blackhawk holes 2011-035, 2011-036 and 2011-07  due  to  the  unavailability  of  equipment.  None  of  the  holes  drilled  by  Foundex  had downhole surveys.

All exploration and geomechanical drill holes were cored at NQ diameter (47.6 mm). Recoveries were measured on 5,203 drill runs averaging 3.0 m in length from these holes. Overall average core recovery was 95%.

The 2011 drill core samples were transported by helicopter from drill sites on the Aley property to  Ospika  Camp  where  the  core  was  logged  and  samples  laid  out  by  company  personnel. Samples were taken by cutting the drill core in half lengthwise using a diamond saw. The halfcore  samples  were  tagged,  bagged  and  shipped  by  commercial  carrier  to  Inspectorate Exploration &amp; Mining Services Ltd. (Inspectorate), Richmond, BC for preparation and analysis. The half core remaining in the core boxes is stored at the Mackenzie core storage facility and will, in part, be used for purposes of metallurgical test work. Coarse rejects and pulp samples are stored at the Hunter Dickinson warehouse in Port Kells, BC.

A  total  of  5,437  half  core  samples  were  collected  in  2011  drilling  program  with  an  average length of 3 m.

A summary of all drilling completed by Taseko is presented in Table 10-2.  Hole collar data for the 2011 drilling is shown in Table 10-3.  Drill hole locations are illustrated in Figure 10-1.

## 11 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND SECURITY

11.1  Historical Samples (1985-2986)

The  1985  and  1986  samples  were  analyzed  by  the  Exploration  Research  Laboratory  of Cominco in Vancouver, BC by the pressed pellet XRF method. Samples were dried, crushed to 9 mm, a ¼ split taken, pulverized and mixed with boric acid. A subsample was placed in a 40 mm diameter by 3 mm high aluminum cup and the mixture was compressed at 40,000 psi to make the  pressed  pellet.  The  preserved  pellet  was  analysed  by  XRF  to  determine  Nb O   in 2 5 percent. A total of 1,026 core samples were assayed by this method.

## 11.2  2007 Samples

Samples from the 2007 drill program were dried and crushed to 70% passing 2 mm (10 mesh). Then 250 g sub-samples were split and pulverized to 95% passing 150 mesh (106 micron).

In 2007 drill program, IPL (renamed as Inspectorate in 2010) performed the primary assay work. Nb2O5 (%) was determined by special multi-acid digestion with ICP finish (IPL code: 0785). Ta (ppm) was determined by multi-acid digestion with inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy  (ICP-MS)  finish  (IPL  code:  0784).  Th  (ppm)  was  determined  by  Aqua  Regia digestion  with  atomic  absorption  spectroscopy  AAS/ICP  finish  (IPL  code:  0527).  U  (ppm)  by aqua regia digestion with ICP finish (IPL code: 0728). Re (ppm) by multi-acid digestion with ICPMS finish  (IPL  code:  0143).  The  major  components  (Al2O3,  BaO,  CaO,  Fe2O3,  K2O,  MgO, MnO,  Na2O,  P2O5,  SiO2,  TiO2  and  LOI)  were  analyzed  using  whole  rock  method  (HNO3 digestion with ICP finish, IPL code: 0401~ 0417).

## 11.3  2010 Samples

Samples collected in 2022 were dried and crushed to 70% passing 2 mm (10 mesh). From this material,  250  g  sub-samples  were  then  split  and  pulverized  to  95%  passing  150  mesh  (106 micron).

In  2011,  primary  assay  analysis  was  performed  by  Inspectorate,  Richmond,  BC.  Nb O   (%) 2 5 were  determined  by  multi-acid  digestion  with  ICP  finish  (Inspectorate  code:  Nb O -AD3-OR2 5 ICP). Ta (ppm) by 4 acid digestion with ICP finish (Inspectorate code: Ta-4A-LL-ICP). Th (ppm) by  4  acid  digestion  with  ICP  finish  (Inspectorate  code:  Th-4A-LL-ICP).  U  (ppm)  by  4  acid digestion with ICP finish (Inspectorate code: U-4A-OR-ICP). REE group (ppm) by lithium borate fusion  with  ICP-MS  finish  (Inspectorate  code:  REE-LB-MS).  The  major  oxide  whore  rock components (Al2O3, BaO, CaO, Fe2O3, K2O, MgO, MnO, Na2O, P2O5, SiO2, TiO2 and LOI) were analyzed by lithium borate fusion with ICP finish, (Inspectorate code: WR-FS-ICP). An additional 30 elements were measured by 4 acid digestion with ICP finish (Inspectorate code: 30-4A-TR). In-line duplicates were analysed the same as in 2010.

In  2010,  in-line  preparation  duplicates  were  assayed  at  the  same  time  as  the  mainstream samples by Inspectorate. These duplicate samples were prepared by pulverizing a coarse reject split and inserting it within the regular assay stream. Additional check assays were also carried out by Acme Analytical Laboratories in Vancouver, BC. Nb, U, W, Mo and Sr were determined by  phosphoric  acid  digestion  with  ICP  finish  (Acme  code:  7KP).    REE  group  and  refractory elements were determined by lithium borate fusion with ICP-MS finish (Acme code: 4B02).

## 11.4  2011 Samples

Samples collected in 2011 were dried and crushed to 70% passing 2 mm (10 mesh). Then 250 g sub-samples were split and pulverized to 95% passing 150 mesh (106 micron).

In  2011,  primary  assay  analysis  was  performed  by  Inspectorate,  Richmond,  BC.  Nb2O5  (%) were determined by  multi-acid  digestion  with  ICP  finish  (Inspectorate  code:  Nb2O5-AD3-ORICP). Ta (ppm) by 4 acid digestion with ICP finish (Inspectorate code: Ta-4A-LL-ICP). Th (ppm) by  4  acid  digestion  with  ICP  finish  (Inspectorate  code:  Th-4A-LL-ICP).  U  (ppm)  by  4  acid digestion with ICP finish (Inspectorate code: U-4A-OR-ICP). REE group (ppm) by lithium borate fusion  with  ICP-MS  finish  (Inspectorate  code:  REE-LB-MS).  The  major  oxide  whore  rock components (Al2O3, BaO, CaO, Fe2O3, K2O, MgO, MnO, Na2O, P2O5, SiO2, TiO2 and LOI) were  analyzed  by  lithium  borate  fusion  with  ICP  finish,  (Inspectorate  code:  WR-FS-ICP).  An additional 30 elements were measured by 4 acid digestion with ICP finish (Inspectorate code: 30-4A-TR). In-line duplicates were analysed the same as in 2010.

Additional  check  assay  was  performed  by  Acme  Analytical  Laboratories  (Vancouver)  Ltd ('Acme').  Nb,  U,  W,  Mo  and  Sr  are  determined  by  phosphoric  acid  digestion  with  ICP  finish (Acme  code:  7KP).    REE  group  and  refractory  elements  were  determined  by  lithium  borate fusion with ICP-MS finish (Acme code: 4B02). This work is in progress at the time of this report.

The sample preparation and analytical protocol for the 2011 drill program is shown in Figure 11-1.

| Sum    | 8,187 | 100  | 384  | 2    | 400  | 117  | 9,112   |

## 11.5.1  1985-1986

The  Cominco  Exploration  Research  Laboratory  was  well-recognized  within  the  industry  as  a facility  that  performed  high  quality  analytical  work.  However,  no  indication  of  external  QAQC samples inserted along with core samples for the historical drilling prior to 2007 was noted in the project files

## 11.5.2  2007

For  the  2007  drill  program,  Taseko  implemented  a  standard  external  QA/QC  program,  which included  external  standards,  duplicates  and  blanks.    A  total  of  23  commercial  standards,  22 coarse reject duplicates and 11 barren rock blanks were applied to the analytical program on the 2007 drill core.

Two niobium standard materials were used for QA/QC purposes: one matrix-matched, projectbased standard AHG1 and Canmet standard Oka-1.

Check  assaying  for  Nb,  Ta,  Th,  Nd,  Ce,  La  and  major  oxides  was  performed  on  92  pulp duplicate samples and 6 standards by Corem Laboratory in Quebec, QC. Teck Cominco Global Discovery Lab, Vancouver, BC analysed the same 22 duplicate pulp samples and 2 standards by pressed pellet XRF analysis for Nb, Th and U and by Li borate fusion XRF for major oxides (whole rock). The duplicate results from these two laboratories match the original IPL results reasonably well.

## 11.5.3  2010

For  the  2010  drill  program,  Taseko  Mines  Limited  implemented  a  similar  external  QA/QC program to that used in 2007. A total of 75 standards, 78 coarse reject duplicates and 25 barren rock blanks were applied to the analytical program of 2010 drill core.

## 11.6  Standards

In the 2010 drilling program, four different standards were used for QA/QC purposes, namely: Aley-1, Aley-2, Aley-3 and OKA-1 (Table 11-2). These standards were inserted into the sample stream at a frequency of approximately one in every twenty samples. Ideally, standards were placed to match the anticipated grade range of the surrounding samples. These standards are in  addition  to  those  routinely  analyzed  by  the  analytical  laboratories  as  an  internal  check. Standard performance was monitored and the results were compared with the expected value and range, as determined from the round-robin testing of the standard.

Nb2O5 assay results were monitored for QA/QC failures defined as results outside the control limits, and re-analyzed as necessary.

Warning limits: ± 2 S.D.

Control Limits: ± 3 S.D.

Table 11-2 Reference Materials Used in 2010 Drill Program

| Standard   | Times Used   | Nb2O5 %      | 2 Std. Dev. Nb2O5   |
|------------|--------------|--------------|---------------------|
| Aley-1     |              | 0.448  0.045 | 23                  |
| 21         | 0.720        | 0.055        | Aley-2              |

| 17         | 0.529        | 0.066        | OKA-1               |
| 75         | -            | -            | Sum                 |

Prior  to  2011  drilling  program,  five  new  matrix-matched  standards  (Aley-4  to  Aley-8)  were prepared and packaged by CDN Resource Laboratories Ltd, and round robin assayed by six commercial  laboratories  (ALS  Chemex,  Vancouver;  Actlabs,  Ancaster;  Genalysis,  Perth; Ultratrace, Perth; IPL Vancouver; Acme, Vancouver). The results were certified for Nb, La, Ce, Fe2O3 and P2O5 by Smee &amp; Associates Consulting Ltd. These five standards are derived from core coarse rejects from the 2010 Aley drill program and range from 0.28 to 1.3% Nb O5 2 . They are listed in Table 11-3

Table 11-3 New Matrix-Match Standard Specifications

| Standard  Name                | Type            | Source                 |
|-------------------------------|-----------------|------------------------|
| Fresh core with low Nb grade  | Central Zone    | Aley-4                 |
| Oxidized core                 | Central Zone    | Aley-5                 |
| Magnetite-rich core           | 2010 Drill Core | Aley-6                 |
| Phosphorus-rich core          | 2010 Drill Core | Aley-7                 |
| Fresh core with high Nb grade | 2010 Drill Core | Coarse Rejects  Aley-8 |

In the 2011 drilling program, eight standards (Aley 1 to Aley 8) were used for QA/QC purposes. They were inserted into the sample stream approximately one in every twenty samples. Ideally, standards  were  placed  to  match  the  anticipated  grade  range  of  the  surrounding  samples. Standard performance was monitored and the results were compared with the expected value and range, as determined from the round-robin testing of the standard.

Niobium assay results were monitored upon receipt from the laboratory for QA/QC performance and results outside the control limits were subject to re-analysis (Figure 11-2).

## 11.7  Blanks

Coarse granite and sand blanks were submitted with the regular half core samples in the field to test  for  possible  sources  of  contamination  during  analyses.  The  laboratory  was  instructed  to crush and prepare the samples in numerical order, so that an assessment of possible crosscontamination could be made. In 2010, total 25 blank samples were inserted.   Most of them returned  normal  values  and  without  significant  contamination  except  for  2  samples  from  hole 2010-021  (sample:  875385)  and  hole  2010-034  (sample:  912823).  The  first  one  was  likely contaminated from the previous sample and the second one appears to be a duplicate of the mainstream (sample 912824) that was mislabeled.

In  the  2011  drill  program,  a  total  of  81  course  blanks  (granite)  were  inserted  to  monitor  the potential  contamination  during  sample  preparation.    The  results  indicate  that  there  is  no significant  contamination  except  for  one  swapped  sample  (hole  2011-085  -  sample  943639: swapped with 943641) and one mixed sample (hole 2011-093 - sample 942708: mixed up with 942707).

## 11.8  Duplicates

In 2010, a total of 78 field duplicates were assigned; 71 of these were analyzed by Inspectorate using the same methods as the mainstream samples (results from 7 duplicates are pending).

The Nb2O5 comparison between the mainstreams and the field duplicates is shown in Figure 11-3.

In  addition,  41  inline  duplicates  and  6  standards  were  sent  to  Acme  for  further  checks.  The comparison  between  the  inline  duplicate  results  and  the  interlab  check  results  is  shown  in Figure 11-4.

In general, these duplicate pairs exhibited reasonable correlation with no significant bias.

Figure 11-3 Field Duplicate Results

Figure 11-4 Interlab Duplicate Results

<!-- image -->

In  2011,  a  total  of  306  in-line  preparation  (reject)  duplicates  were  assigned  and  analyzed  by Inspectorate using the exact same methods as the mainstream samples.  In addition, all the pulps  from  the  mainstream  samples  parallel  to  the  in-line  duplicates  were  sent  to  Acme  for check assays. This work was still in progress at the time of the report.

The duplicate pairs show reasonable correlation with no significant bias (Figure 11-5).

## 11.9  Density Data

A total of 3,818 individual density and specific gravity (SG) measurements were taken on Aley drill core samples during the 2077, 2010 and 2011 programs. Process Research Associates Ltd (PRA) took 88 density measurements in 2007 using the wax coat method from Saddle Zone drill core  samples.  Site  personnel  took  481  measurements  in  2010  and  3,249  measurements  in 2011 using an uncoated, quick-dunk water immersion method from whole drill core samples, predominantly from the Central Zone deposit area.

The procedures of the PRA wax-coated density method are as follows:

-  Samples dried in low temperature oven overnight
-  Waxed sample placed into a graduated cylinder with water, removed bubbles
-  Weighed single piece of drill core, coated with molten wax, recorded total weight
-  Volume change was recorded. Specific gravity of wax from literature.

The procedures of the uncoated, quick-dunk water immersion method are as follows:

-  Dry, whole core samples, typical of the surrounding rock
-  Weigh sample weighed in air (Ma)
-  Sample spacing one in ten assay samples, roughly every 10 m down hole
-  Weight sample suspended in water (Mw)

-  Read Mw quickly after balance stabilizes to minimize water incursion into rock pores

The summary of the bulk density is shown in Table 11-4.

Table 11-4 Bulk Density Summary by Year

| Year    | Number of  Measurements   |   SG   Minimum |   SG   Mean |   SG   Median |   SG   Maximum | Note                        |
|---------|---------------------------|----------------|-------------|---------------|----------------|-----------------------------|
| 2007    | 88                        |           2.34 |        2.77 |          2.78 |           3.06 | PRA  -  Wax coated method - |
| 2010    | 481                       |           1.04 |        2.77 |          2.78 |           3.98 | Site  -  Un coated method - |
| 2011    | 3,249                     |           2.25 |        2.92 |          2.9  |           4.02 | Site  -  Un coated method - |
| Overall | 3,818                     |           1.04 |        2.89 |          2.89 |           4.02 |                             |

In 2007,  88  apparent  specific  gravity  measurements  were  taken  by  Process  Research Associates Ltd in 2007 using wax-coat water displacement method on drill core samples from the Saddle Zone. This method more closely approximates the bulk density as any pores or vugs in  the  core  sample  would  be  sealed  from  water  penetrations  and  therefore  included  in  the measurement. The minimum value of this data set is 2.34 and the maximum is 3.06 with the mean value of 2.77.

In 2010, a total of 481 specific gravity measurements were done by site personnel using a rapid measurement water immersion method. In this method, the weight in water is measured before water permeates the sample.

The minimum value measured was 1.04 and the 3.98 and the mean value 2.77. All the higher values correspond with higher iron content (mostly magnetite) so were therefore deemed to be reasonable.  Sixteen  values  from  the  upper  part  of  hole  2010-022  which  were  lower  than  2.0 were deemed to be unreasonably low and were removed from the database.

In  2011,  a  total  of  3,249  specific  gravity  measurements  were  taken  by  site  personnel  using water immersion method. In 2011, each sample was weighed 2 to 3 times in air and then once in water. A total of 1,083 independent samples were measured. HDI personnel cross-checked and verified the original data set. Based on this review, some data entry and test errors were found. These erroneous data were removed from the data set. The calibration standard weight records were also verified to confirm that the relative error (RSD) is acceptably low.

After verification and elimination of erroneous data, a minimum SG value of 2.25, a maximum of 4.02  and  a  mean  of  2.92  was  obtained.  Most  of  the  higher  values  correspond  to  high  iron content (magnetite-rich rock) and are deemed to be reasonable.

## 11.10   Data Handling

All drilling data are compiled in a SQL database with tables that are compatible with Microsoft® Access  database.  Drillhole  logs  are  entered  into  laptop  computers  running  the  Access  data entry  module  for  the  Project  at  the  core  logging  facility.  The  core  logging  computers  are synchronized on a daily basis with the master entry database on the file server in the geology office at site.

Digital core photographs are also transferred to the file server in the geology office on a daily basis. The compiled site data is transmitted to the Vancouver office on a weekly basis where the

logging data are imported into the master drill database and merged with digital assay results provided by the analytical laboratories.  A further printing, validation and verification step follows after the data is imported.

Analytical  re-runs  are  submitted  to  the  analytical  laboratories  and  corrections  to  analytical results within the database are made in the Vancouver office.  Compiled data are exported to the site entry database, to resource modeling and other users.

Project data are processed so they can be assessed with respect to ongoing requirements for timely disclosure of material information. In this regard, compiled drill data and assay results are made available to project management, the technical team and project consultants advancing the project, immediately after the initial error trapping and analytical QA/QC appraisal processes are completed, provided there are no significant concerns. The data are then subjected to more extensive,  long-term  validation,  verification,  QA/QC,  and  error  correction  processes.  The findings of these longer-term reviews are assessed as to their impact on previous disclosures and the necessity for further disclosure in the event of material change.

The  author  is  of  the  opinion  that  the  sample  preparation,  security  and  analytical  procedures meet or exceeds industry standards and is adequate to support a mineral resource estimate as defined under NI 43-101.

## 12  DATA VERIFICATION

## 12.1  Verification by Aley Corporation

Following  the  acquisition  of  control  of  the  mineral  claims  by  Aley  Corporation  in  2004,  the exploration efforts concentrated on trench sampling for metallurgical material and the confirmation  of  previous  geology  and  drill  hole  collar  locations.  Trenches  were  opened  by means of blasting in the vicinity of the previous Cominco trenches cut in 1985 and 1986. The purpose  of  these  trenches  was  twofold,  firstly  to  acquire  material  suitable  for  metallurgical testwork, and secondly to confirm the grades estimated by Cominco in the 1980's. The samples were collected from trenches in the Central Zone in the vicinity of CZ-85-6, CZ-85-6A and CZ85-8, and in the Saddle Zone at SZ-84-4. In total, 912 kg of sample was gathered from the Aley site. During the same period, all of the major zones identified by Cominco were visited and drill holes  locations  identified  and  logged  using  GPS.  This  work  was  carried  out  as  a  means  by which to validate the previous mapping and survey work undertaken using conventional survey compass mapping, as compared to current GPS technology in order to identify any systematic errors  in  the  mapping  developed  by  Cominco.  Aley  Corporation  reported  a  'reasonable correlation' between the Cominco sampling work and that of Aley Corporation and that in their view GPS survey work verified the Cominco mapping as reasonable and suitable for continued exploration, with the recommendation of conducting a survey for future resource work.

In 2006, a geological review and compilation of previous drilling and trenching was performed by Dave Thomas of AMEC with the objective of evaluating the mineralization and planning the field program that year.

## 12.2  Verification by Taseko Mines

Before the property was acquired by Taseko company personnel reviewed related report and assay results.

## 12.3  Verification by Hunter Dickinson

Since  acquisition,  HDI  staff  reviewed  the  existing  database  and  related  technical  reports  on behalf of Taseko.  In addition, the following validation and verification was conducted:

- (1) Creation of a new drill database with tables compatible with Gemcom GEMS™ mining exploration software.
- (2) Verification  of  data  based  on  system  automatic  check  (duplicate  check,  unmatched check, max value check etc.) functions.
- (3) Verification of assay data in the database against the original certificates.
- (4) Review of QAQC sample results. Re-runs were triggered if external standards failed.
- (5) Assessment and periodic comparison of assay methods and assay results.
- (6) Corrections and updates were performed regularly.

## 12.4  Verification by Geosim

The  author  visited  the  site  and  the  Mackenzie  sampling  facility  on  August  29,  2011.  The purpose of the visit was to review the geology and mineralization encountered in the drill holes completed  to  date.    In  addition,  drilling,  sampling,  quality  assurance/quality  control  (QA/QC), sample preparation and analytical protocols and procedures were reviewed.

Eleven drill hole collar locations were verified by GPS readings.

The author did not collect or submit samples for analysis.

## 12.5  Conclusions and Recommendations

The author is of the opinion that  the  data  is  adequate  to  support  a  measured,  indicated  and inferred mineral resource estimate as defined under NI 43-101.

Pulp re-checks at a secondary laboratory are recommended.

## 13 MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING

Metallurgical test work conducted prior to 2007 by Cominco and the Aley Corporation prior to its purchase by Taseko is considered historical.  These tests were conducted using material from drill  or  trenching  programs  that  do  not  have  documentation  available  with  regards  to  sample preparation, analysis procedures, or QA/QC.  The metallurgical composites generated for these tests  are  not  representative  of  what  has  now  been  identified  as  a  measured,  indicated  and inferred  resource.    While  these  test  programs  are  indicative  in  nature  and  provide  valuable information with regards to the process conditions and response of the Aley mineralization, the analytical issues preclude using the results for predictive purposes.

## 13.1  Pre 2004 Cominco Test Programs

Test  work  conducted  by  Cominco  included  a  variety  of  alternate  processes  for  extraction including flotation on a 5 ton bulk sample.

## 13.2  2004-2005 Test Program

Reference:  Nethery,  2006  -  Report  of  Technical  Exploration  and  Development  -  2006 Evaluation and Exploration Planning on the Aley Carbonatite Property

A metallurgical testing program on samples from the Aley carbonatite was initiated in November 2004 at Process Research Associates Ltd, Vancouver BC, under the direction of Michel Robert.

The program was based on the application and testing of the same mineral processing scheme used  commercially  at  the  Niobec  mine  in  Quebec  since  1976.  This  metallurgical  process  for Niobec  was  developed  through  a  major  test  program  and  is  more  complex  than  processes typically applied to sulphide minerals. However, individually, the unit processes are not unique in the application of mineral processing.

The  composite  used  for  the  scoping  test  program  was  prepared  from  eight  fresh  samples collected in October 2004 by trenching in the Central Zone that had been identified by Cominco.

The  laboratory  unit  processes  investigated  were  de-sliming,  magnetic  separation,  carbonate rougher  flotation,  niobium  rougher  and  scavenger  flotation,  and  the  first  and  second  niobium cleaner flotation stages. Sufficient work was performed to establish a bench mark for these unit processes  and  establish  operating  criteria.  The  results  obtained  compare  favorably  to  the operating results at Niobec.

The  process  steps  from  the  Niobec  flow  sheet  that  were  not  investigated  in  this  program include; the third to sixth cleaner flotation stages for niobium, flotation of pyrite from the niobium concentrate,  leaching  of  the  niobium  concentrate  and  two  stage  cleaning  of  the  carbonate concentrate.  These  other  unit  processes  require  a  sufficiently  large  sample  of  second  stage cleaner concentrate, thus final recovery and grade were not determined in this program.

The Niobec flow sheet is presented (with the permission of Niobec) in Figure 13-1.

Figure 13-1 Simplified Niobec Flowsheet

<!-- image -->

Table 13-1 shows the main process results of the Niobec concentrator, compared to the bench mark test (F39) carried out by Process Research Associates Ltd on the Central Zone Composite from Aley.

The reference benchmark for the Aley Central Zone test is a batch test, without recirculation of intermediate products, while the Niobec results include recirculation of intermediate products. Hence the benchmark test results assume no recovery from the various recycle loops, such as cleaner tails and carbonate cleaners products.

| Overall Recovery to 2nd Concentrate (%)        | 60%  -  62%     | 64.50% |

The flotation response of the composite from the Aley Central Zone is similar to that from the ore at Niobec.  In some aspects, the test work indicates improved performance over the  Niobec results, in particular the lower quantity of niobium rejected with the slimes, and generally better stage recoveries in the niobium rougher, first and second cleaners.

Iron minerals in the niobium cleaner concentrates contribute to the mass of the concentrates. These  iron  minerals  are  typically  removed  by  mild  leaching  of  the  niobium  concentrate  and reverse flotation of the remaining pyrite as in the Niobec flowsheet.

A columbite mineral present in a small quantity in the composite also floated with fersmite/pyrochlore, according to the mineralogical investigation.  At Niobec, neither columbite nor ferrous pyrochlore is recovered in any significant quantity.

## 13.3  2008 Test Program

The  2008  test  program  was  conducted  at  Process  Research  Associates  on  a  composite  of saddle zone material that was extracted in 2005 from a surface trench sample, and used the test parameters developed on Central Zone material.  The Saddle Zone material is of the same mineral  complex  and  adjacent  to  the  Central  Zone,  but  is  not  part  of  the  inferred  resource developed for the Aley Project.  These tests were conducted to target coarser feed particle sizes than the previous test work on the Central Zone.  Feed size targets were conducted at 80 % passing 180 microns, 150 microns, and 110 microns.  The 110 micron tests were undertaken to provide a point of reference that could be used to compare the results to the 2005 work, as this is the same target size used in that program.

The  2008  test  program  encompassed  five  stages  of  niobium  cleaner  flotation.    Test  results indicate that decreasing grade and recovery of Nb2 O5 to the fifth cleaner concentrate occurred with  increasing  particle  size.    For  comparison  to  the  2005  test  program,  the  2008  second

cleaner  concentrate  results  show  similar  recovery  at  the  same  feed  target  size,  but  with  a reduced concentrate grade.

Qualitative  mineralogical  analysis  of  select  flotation  products  from  the  2008  program  showed that the niobium carrier minerals were either liberated or intergrown, with subordinate amounts of particle-locking with apatite, carbonate and quartz.  The heterogeneous mineral distribution indicates that the selectivity of the recovery process is influenced more strongly by factors other than  mineral  liberation.    However,  the  identified  mineral  locking  is  consistent  with  the  lower grade observed in the 2nd cleaner concentrate at 110 micron flotation when compared to the results  from  the  2005  test  program  conducted  at  the  same  particle  size.    This  locking  grade relationship  is  also  consistent  with  the  observed  decrease  in  grade  and  recovery  at  coarser particle sizes.

A metallurgical test program is presently underway utilizing drill core from the 2010 field season.

## 14  MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATE

Drilling  to  date  on  the  Project  has  partially  defined  the  Central  Zone,  which  comprises  a continuous body of near-surface niobium mineralization within an area measuring 1400m E-W by 500m N-S and to a depth below surface of about 250 m.  The ultimate limits have yet to be defined.

## 14.1  Exploratory Data Analysis

The sample database for the Aley project contains results from 104 core holes drilled between 1985 and the end of 2011.  The Central Zone has been tested by 96 holes (21,434m) all of which were entirely within  the  carbonatite  complex.    Six  of  these  were  drilled  by  Cominco  in 1986 and 90 by Taseko Mines in 2010 and 2011.  The area of the Central Zone defined by the drilling is roughly 1200m E-W by 500m N-S and to a depth below surface of about 250 m.

The bulk of the Nb2O5 mineralization  is  hosted  by  the  magnetite-apatite  carbonatite  cumulate domain  (CM).    Some  mineralization  is  hosted  in  the  dolomite  carbonatite  (CD)  domain  with lesser amounts in the silicocarbonatite (CS).

Cumulative frequency distribution for the Nb O  samples within the three main domains of the 2 5 Central Zone is illustrated in Figure 14-1 to Figure 14-3.  The sample population within the CD and CM domains is moderately skewed approaching log normal distribution with no significant bimodality evident.  The CS domain exhibits possible bimodal character but primarily represents sub-economic grades of Nb2O5.

Basic statistics for the individual and collective domains are shown in Table 14-1.

In the CM domain, Nb2O5 displays a weak to moderate positive correlation with P O  and Fe O3 2 5 2 values with correlation coefficients of 0.22 and 0.43 respectively.  A weak positive correlation with TiO2 was also noted.  There is also a moderate positive correlation with Cu grades but the levels of Cu are not of economic significance, rarely exceeding 100 ppm.

In the CD domain, Nb2O5 is weakly correlated with Fe O  but shows no correlation with P O .  In 2 3 2 5 the CS domain there is no significant correlation between Nb O  and Fe O  or P O 2 5 2 3 2 5

## 14.1   Outlier Analysis

Before  compositing,  grade  distribution  in  the  raw  sample  data  was  examined  to  determine  if grade capping or special treatment of high outliers was warranted. Cumulative log probability plots were examined for outlier populations and decile analyses was performed for Nb O  within 2 5 the zone domains. As a general rule, the cutting of high grades is warranted if:

-  the last decile (upper 10% of samples) contains more than 40% of the metal; or
-  the last centile (upper 1%) contains more than 10% of the metal; or
-  the last decile contains more than 2.3 times the metal of the previous decile; or
-  the last centile contains more than 1.75 times the next highest centile.

None of these criteria were met for any of the Central Zone domains.  The last decile contains less than 35% of the contained metal and less than 8% is contained in the last centile.   The cumulative probability plot of the data shows a break above 2.1% Nb O  in the CM domain with 2 5 a few scattered outliers above this level.  After compositing, only 2 composites were above this level with the maximum value of 2.35.  It is concluded that capping or outlier restriction is not necessary for the Central Zone Nb2 O5 grades.

## 14.2  Deposit Modeling

In 2011, Taseko personnel generated a geological model on the basis of lithological and assay data from the 2010 and 2011 drill programs. Within this model six initial lithofacies were defined, namely  Cumulate  Carbonatite  (CM),  Fenite-bearing  Cumulate  Carbonatite  (ACM),  Dolomite Carbonatite  (CD),  Fenite-bearing  Dolomite  Carbonatite  (ACD),  Silicocarbonatite  (SC)  and Fenite-bearing Silicocarbonatite (ACS). The six domains were initially delineated as polygons on a series of paper cross-sections covering the entire deposit area, and were then digitized using MapInfo and Discover 3D.  From the digital polygons, a series of continuous 3D solids were then  created  by  means  of  wireframing  using  a  largely  manual  tie-line  process.  Following appraisal, the original six lithofacies were simplified to three facies - specifically CM, CD and CS - for the purposes of resource constraint, this simplification being effected through the inclusion of the fenite bearing material into its corresponding lithofacies.

On  the  basis  of  sectional  interpretation,  three  fault-bounded  blocks  controlling  mineralization were modeled. Within these blocks, a combination of steeply-dipping and low-angle faults have been recognized by subtle variations in apatite, zircon, and niobium mineralization.

The final solid models are a simplified combination of the fault domains and lithofacies and were used as hard boundaries to constrain grade estimation in the block model.  The domains and corresponding integer codes are illustrated in Figure 14-5.

## 14.3  Compositing

Best fit downhole composites of Nb2O5 were generated within each of the 7 domains using a nominal 6 metre interval from drill holes within the Central Zone.  Basic statistics are shown in Table 14-2.  The mean values are identical to the weighted averages of the samples.   The pre2007 data represents about 4% of the total composites.

## 14.4   Density

A total of 1538 density measurements were made on drill core from the central zone.  Statistics for  density  measurements  within  the  zone  domains  are  presented  in  Table  14-3.    The  mean values were assigned to blocks within the corresponding domains.  A value of 2 was assumed for overburden.

Table 14-3 Density statistics by domain

## 14.5  Variogram Analysis

Directional semi-variograms were modeled for the main CM domain using the 6m composites. A nested spherical model was interpreted with moderate anisotropy.  The model parameters are shown in Table 14-4

Table 14-4  Variogram model of Central Zone

| Axis    |   Azim |   Dip |    co |    c1 |   r1 |    c2 |   r2 |

| Minor   |    357 |   -30 | 0.335 | 0.367 | 23.4 | 0.298 |  120 |

## 14.6   Block Model and Grade Estimation Procedures

A block model was set up in Gemcom Surpac© software with block dimensions of 10 x 10 x 10m.  Model extents are shown in Table 14-5.

Table 14-5 Block model extents

|    |     Min |     Max |   Extent (m) |   Block  Size |   #  Blocks |
|----|---------|---------|--------------|---------------|-------------|
| x  |  453400 |  455800 |         2400 |            10 |         240 |
| y  | 6255700 | 6258100 |         2400 |            10 |         240 |
| z  |    1200 |    2300 |         1100 |            10 |         110 |

Block grades were estimated by means of ordinary kriging in three passes using incremental search distances.  The first pass used a maximum anisotropic search of 50m equivalent to ¼ of the maximum variogram range. The second pass search was set at ¾ of the variogram range at 150m and the final pass search was extended to the maximum range of 200m.

A  preliminary  octant  search  pass  was  used  to  define  interpolated  blocks  for  classification purposes but was not used for final grade estimation.  This pass used a maximum search of 150m and required composites in a minimum of 5 octants.

Block model search parameters used in grade estimation are summarized in Table 14-6.

Table 14-6 Block model search parameters

|   Pass |   Max  Search  Dist |   Min #  Composites |   Max #  Composites |   Max/  Hole |
|--------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|--------------|
|      1 |                  50 |                   3 |                  12 |            2 |
|      2 |                 150 |                   4 |                  16 |            3 |
|      3 |                 200 |                   5 |                  20 |            4 |

## 14.7  Mineral Resource Classification

Resource classifications  used  in  this  study  conform  to  the  following  definitions  from  National Instrument 43-101:

## Mineral Resource

A  Mineral  Resource  is  a  concentration  or  occurrence  of  diamonds,  natural  solid  inorganic material, or natural solid fossilized organic material including base and precious metals, coal, and industrial minerals in or on the Earth's crust in such form and quantity and of such a grade or  quality  that  it  has  reasonable  prospects  for  economic  extraction.  The  location,  quantity, grade, geological characteristics and continuity of a Mineral Resource are known, estimated or interpreted from specific geological evidence and knowledge.

## Measured Mineral Resource

A 'Measured Mineral Resource' is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, grade or quality,  densities,  shape,  physical  characteristics  are  so  well  established  that  they  can  be estimated  with  confidence  sufficient  to  allow  the  appropriate  application  of  technical  and economic parameters, to support production planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit. The estimate is based on detailed and reliable exploration, sampling and testing information gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches,

pits,  workings  and  drill  holes  that  are  spaced  closely  enough  to  confirm  both  geological  and grade continuity.

## Indicated Mineral Resource

An 'Indicated Mineral Resource' is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, grade or quality, densities, shape and physical characteristics can be estimated with a level of confidence sufficient to allow the appropriate application of technical and economic parameters, to support mine planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit. The estimate is based on detailed and reliable exploration and testing information gathered through appropriate techniques  from  locations  such  as  outcrops,  trenches,  pits,  workings  and  drill  holes  that  are spaced closely enough for geological and grade continuity to be reasonably assumed.

## Inferred Mineral Resource

An 'Inferred Mineral Resource' is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity and grade or quality  can  be  estimated  on  the  basis  of  geological  evidence  and  limited  sampling  and reasonably assumed, but not verified, geological and grade continuity. The estimate is based on limited information and sampling gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes.

Blocks were classified as 'Measured' if there were two composites from at least two drill holes within  50  m  of  the  block  centroid  based  on  the  anisotropic  search  parameters.    Blocks  not meeting the criteria for 'Measured' were classified as 'Indicated' if there were two composites from at least two drill holes within 100m of the block centroid.  All other estimated blocks were classified as 'Inferred'.

In  order  to  meet  the  requirements  of  NI43-101  with  respect  to  reasonable  prospects  of economic  extraction  by  open  pit  mining  methods,  a  45°wall  slope  Lerchs-Grossman  pit  was generated to constrain the resource within the block model.  Metal prices assumed were $50/kg Nb with process recovery of 50%.  General &amp; Administration, Processing and Ore Mining costs were assumed to be $30/tonne.  Base waste mining costs were assumed to be $1.50/tonne.

Block classification on plan and section are illustrated in Figure 14-11 and Figure 14-12.  The resource pit shell is illustrated in Figure 14-13.

## 14.8  Model Validation

Model verification was initially carried out by visual comparison of blocks and sample grades in plan  and  section  views.  The  estimated  block  grades  showed  reasonable  correlation  with adjacent composite grades.

Block grades were also estimated using ID  and nearest neighbour methods. A comparison of 2 global mean values within the grade shell domain shows a reasonably close relationship with samples, composites and block model values (Table 14-7).

Table 14-7 Global mean grade comparison

| Data Set          |   % Nb2O5 |
|-------------------|-----------|
| Samples (Wt Avg)  |      0.31 |
| Composites        |      0.31 |
| Kriged Blocks     |      0.26 |
| ID  Blocks  2     |      0.26 |
| Nearest Neighbour |      0.26 |

Swath plots were generated to assess the model for global bias by comparing kriged, ID  and 2 nearest-neighbour  estimates  on  panels  through  the  deposit.  Results  show  a  reasonable comparison between the methods, particularly in the main portions of the deposit indicated by the bar charts (Figure 14-14 to Figure 14-17).

The  mineral  resource  estimate  is  quite  sensitive  to  metal  price.    There  are  no  other  known factors  or  issues  that  materially  affect  the  estimate  other  than  normal  risks  faced  by  mining projects  in  the  province  in  terms  of  environmental,  permitting,  taxation,  socio-economic, marketing and political factors.  There are no known legal or title issues that would materially affect the mineral resource estimate.

## 15  ADJACENT PROPERTIES

Not applicable

## 16  OTHER RELEVANT DATA AND INFORMATION.

There are no other data known to Geosim that are relevant to this Technical Report: therefore there are no relevant data or information presented in this section.

## 17  INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS

Evaluation of the exploration programs and results available to the effective date of this report indicates that:

-  The geology is sufficiently  well  understood  to  support  the  mineral  resource  estimation presented in this report and summarized in the section above.
-  Core  drilling  has  identified  a  continuous  body  of  near-surface  niobium  mineralization within  an  area  measuring  1400m  E-W  by  500m  N-S  and  to  a  depth  below  surface  of about 250 m.  The ultimate limits have not been defined.
-  Data collection to the end of 2011 at the drill site is acceptable.
-  Average grades for all the drill assays returned from the Central Zone as of the report effective date were 0.32% Nb2O5 .
-  The database contains  all  drilling  data  collected  on  the  project  to  date  and  has  been structured for resource estimation.
-  QA/QC with respect to the results received to date for the Taseko 2007, 2010 and 2011 exploration programs is acceptable and protocols have been well documented.
-  As of March 1, 2012 the Aley deposit is estimated to contain a measured and indicated resource  of  286  million  tonnes  grading  0.37%  Nb O   using  a  cut-off  grade  of  0.2% 2 5 Nb2O5..    An  additional  144  million  tonnes  averaging  0.32%  Nb O   is  classified  as 2 5 inferred.

## 18  RECOMMENDATIONS

Additional drilling is warranted to define the extents of the Nb mineralization in the Central Zone, to upgrade the resource classification and to follow up on other targets on the property.

Metallurgical  testwork  designed  to  support  a  Preliminary  Economic  Assessment  should  be continued.
