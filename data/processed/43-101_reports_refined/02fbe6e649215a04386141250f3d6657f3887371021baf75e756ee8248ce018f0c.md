## 1 SUMMARY

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Roscoe Postle Associates Inc. (RPA) was retained by Search Minerals Inc. (Search Minerals) to prepare an initial Mineral Resource estimate and an independent Technical Report on the Deep  Fox  Rare  Earth  Element  (REE)  Project  (the  Project)  near  Port  Hope  Simpson, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada.  The purpose of this report is to disclose the Mineral Resource estimate for the Deep Fox deposit.  This Technical Report conforms to National Instrument 43-101 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (NI 43-101).  RPA visited the Project on August 26, 2015.

Search Minerals is a public company that trades on the TSX Venture Exchange under the symbol SMY.  Search Minerals, through its wholly-owned subsidiary Alterra Resources Inc. (Alterra), owns the Deep Fox Project and the nearby Foxtrot Project, as well as a number of mineral prospects on its 100% owned Red Wine and Henley Harbour properties, also located in Labrador.

The  initial  Mineral  Resource  estimate  for  the  Deep  Fox  Project,  with  an  effective  date  of September  26,  2019,  is  listed  in  Table  1-1.    The  Mineral  Resource  estimate  conforms  to Canadian  Institute  of  Mining,  Metallurgy  and  Petroleum  Definition  Standards  for  Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves dated May 10, 2014 (CIM (2014) definitions).

## CONCLUSIONS

The Project is located approximately 47 km east-southeast of Port Hope Simpson, Labrador, and approximately two kilometres northeast of St. Lewis, Labrador.  It is located in the Fox Harbour Volcanic Belt which also contains Search Minerals' Foxtrot deposit and numerous other REE prospects and targets.

A significant REE deposit has been delineated at the Project.  The majority of the high grade mineralization occurs  within steeply dipping packages  of  pantellerite. The  resource wireframes, which were interpreted at a nominal cut-off NSR value of C$140/t, consist of three steeply dipping zones:  Hanging Wall Zone, a higher grade and more extensive Footwall Zone, and a smaller, deeper high grade Deep Zone.  Pantellerite is the most common lithology within the resource wireframes.  Statistical analysis of the resource assays shows that there is a bimodal  distribution  of  REEs  within  the  Deep  Fox  deposit,  with  higher  grade  generally corresponding to the Footwall Zone and moderate grades corresponding to the Hanging Wall Zone.

The mineralization is steeply dipping (&gt; 80°), with a strike length of approximately 725 m at an azimuth of 275°.  The understanding of the Project geology and mineralization, together with the procedures for drilling, sampling, collection of data, assaying, and quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) carried out by Search Minerals have produced a drill hole database that is acceptable for Mineral Resource estimation, in the opinion of RPA.  Results from 54 drill holes  and  channels  to  September  26,  2019  have  been  used  by  RPA  to  estimate  Mineral Resources.

The Mineral Resource estimate is reported on the basis of a possible open pit mining scenario using an NSR cut-off value of C$140/t.  RPA considers that open pit material with NSR values

<!-- image -->

greater  than  C$140/t  meets  the  requirement  of  CIM  (2014)  that  Mineral  Resources  have reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction.

Open pit Indicated Mineral Resources are estimated to total 2.3 Mt at 403 ppm Pr, 1,486 ppm Nd, and 206 ppm Dy, and open pit Inferred Mineral Resources are estimated to total 3.9 Mt at 357 ppm Pr, 1,323 ppm Nd, and 181 ppm Dy.  The level of confidence in the data is not high enough to classify any resource as Measured.  Definitions for resource categories used in this report are consistent with those defined by CIM (2014) and adopted by NI 43-101.

There has not been a previous Mineral Resource estimate on the Project.

The Deep Fox deposit is open at depth.  Current drilling suggests that the resource shows good grade continuity with depth, with no notable decrease in grade down dip.

## RECOMMENDATIONS

RPA has the following recommendations for the Deep Fox Project:

- · Continue diamond drilling on the Project to define the physical limits of the deposit. Further drilling should be completed to follow the high grade mineralization at depth down plunge below -100 m, and below the surface channel samples at the western part of the Deep Fox mineralized zones.
- · In order to bring the confidence level of the resource to Indicated:
- o Carry out infill drilling at the periphery of wireframes;
- o Complete  a  topographical  survey  over  the  deposit  and  survey  all  surface channels.
- · Resume the regular submission of blank material with regular drill core and surface channel samples.
- · Include selected half core samples (field duplicates) in the duplicate sampling protocol.
- · Work with an assay laboratory to develop certified reference materials (CRM) with REE grades similar to those found at the Project.  Alternatively, commercial CRMs can be used.
- · Implement a QA monitoring system used to detect failed batches, and in turn, identify sample batches for reanalysis.
- · Continue exploration of high grade REE prospects in the area.

Water sources are plentiful at the Project.

## HISTORY

Complete aeromagnetic coverage and lake-sediment geochemical surveys were conducted for  the  region  by  Geological  Survey  of  Canada in  1974 and 1984.  Geological mapping at 1:100,000 scale, as a five-year Canada-Newfoundland joint project aimed at mapping an 80 km coastal fringe of the Grenville Province in southern Labrador, was carried out from 1984 to 1987 by the Newfoundland and Labrador Geological Survey.  A detailed lake sediment survey was released by the Newfoundland and Labrador government in 2010 and covered the area of the claims.

In  2014,  a master's thesis was completed to determine the geology, mineralogy, age, and origin of the rare earth minerals at the Fox Harbour property.

Search  Minerals  entered  into  an  option  agreement  to  acquire  the  Deep  Fox  (formerly Deepwater Fox) property in 2011.  The deposit was discovered in 2014 and the acquisition completed in 2015.

## GEOLOGY AND MINERALIZATION

The Deep Fox deposit occurs in the 64 km long Fox Harbour Volcanic Belt (FHVB), which ranges in width from less than 50 m in the northwest to three kilometres in the east.  Units dip steeply in a northerly direction and strikes generally trend westerly to northwesterly, parallel to bounding faults to the north and south.  The FHVB contains one (in the northwest) to three (in the east) sub-belts of bimodal rocks dominated by REE-bearing felsic peralkaline flows and ash-flow tuffs and mafic to ultramafic volcanic and related subvolcanic units.

The  three  bimodal  sub-belts  in  the  FHVB,  from  north  to  south:  the  Road  Belt  (RB),  the Magnetite (MT) Belt and South Belt (SB), have been the focus of REE exploration.  The Deep Fox deposit is hosted in the RB.  In the Project area, the RB consists of, from north to south: 1)  northern  comendite;  2)  anorthositic  suite  rocks  consisting  of  anorthositic  gabbro  and associated volcanic rocks; 3) non-peralkaline rhyolite; 4) southern comendite; 5) mafic and

<!-- image -->

ultramafic volcanic rocks; 6) pantellerite with interbedded non-peralkaline rhyolite and mafic volcanic rocks, and 7) a footwall non-peralkaline rhyolitic ash-flow tuff.  Minor units of locally derived  volcanogenic  sediments,  mafic  volcanic  flows,  and  related  subvolcanic  units  and pegmatites occur throughout this sequence.  Most units generally dip 75° to 85° northerly; drill data indicates that the mineralized zone plunges towards the northeast.  The anorthositic suite and mineralized units form a prominent east-west trending ridge in the area.

High grade mineralization, characterized by Dy from 100 ppm to 400 ppm, is predominantly hosted by fine grained, layered to massive pantellerite and Zr-enriched equivalents.  Lower grade mineralization, characterized by Dy from 20 ppm to 100 ppm, is predominantly hosted by fine grained, mostly massive comendite and Zr-poor pantellerite.  Mineralized units are commonly interbedded with mafic to ultramafic volcanic units, quartzite, and locally derived volcanogenic sediments.

Most of the REE mineralization occurs in allanite and fergusonite; minor amounts of REE occur in chevkinite, monazite, bastnaesite, and zircon.  The majority of the light REE (i.e., La to Sm) in the mineralization occurs in allanite, whereas the majority of the heavy REE (i.e., Eu to Lu) occurs in both fergusonite and allanite.

Lower grade REE mineralization is commonly found in the SB.  The SB commonly consists of predominantly comendite, minor mafic and pantellerite units, feldspar-bearing porphyry, and locally abundant volcanogenic sediments.  Low grade mineralization (comendite) commonly ranges from 10 m to 50 m in thickness.

## EXPLORATION STATUS

A  detailed  exploration  program  on  the  Project  started  in  2014  with  detailed  mapping  and prospecting that led to the discovery channel (FDC-14-01) late in the season; this discovery was announced in early 2015.  An extensive channel sampling program was commenced in 2015 and consisted of 16 channels in 2015, five channels in 2017, four channels in 2018, and three channels in 2019.  The Phase I drilling program commenced in 2017 with three holes and  was  completed  in  2018  with  an  additional  12  holes.    The  Phase  II  drilling  program, consisting of eight holes, was completed in late 2018.  An Unmanned Airborne Vehicle (UAV) or drone detailed magnetic survey was carried out over the property in 2019.  Search Minerals anticipates that a UAV Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) survey will be completed in late 2019.

## MINERAL RESOURCES

RPA estimated Mineral Resources for the Project using all drill hole and channel sample data available as of September 26, 2019 (Table 1-1).  The Mineral Resources are reported based on a potential open pit mining scenario as of September 26, 2019 at an NSR cut-off value of C$140/t.  No Mineral Reserves have been estimated at the Project.

Resource wireframes were built to investigate geological and grade continuity and to constrain grade  interpolation  within  the  block  model.    Three-dimensional  wireframe  models  were constructed for three mineralized zones at an NSR cut-off value of C$140/t.  Assays were composited using nominal two metre lengths within discrete mineralized zones.  Evaluation of raw assay grades prior to compositing indicated that high grade values do not need capping. Grades for each block within discrete wireframe models were interpolated by ordinary kriging using all composites within the corresponding wireframes.

NSR cut-off values were derived from the estimated operating costs for an open pit mining method.  Grades for all assays were combined with estimated metallurgical recoveries and prices to estimate an NSR value for each sample.

To convert volume to tonnes, a simplified lithological model was created with the following rock types: Comendite, Anorthosite, NPR, Pantellerite, and Mafic/Ultramafic.  A bulk density factor was assigned for each lithology by determining the mean value of each rock type from bulk density testing carried out on the drill core and channel samples by Search Minerals.

Classification into the Indicated and Inferred categories was guided by drill hole and surface channel spacing, the reliability of data, and geological confidence in the continuity of grade.

## 5 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE, AND PHYSIOGRAPHY

The Deep Fox Project is located approximately 47 km east-southeast of Port Hope Simpson, and  approximately  two  kilometres  northeast  of  St.  Lewis,  Labrador.    The  majority  of  the property is accessible via Highway 513 to St. Lewis, which is an all season gravel highway, and a two kilometre private woods road from St. Lewis.  All parts of Deep Fox are within walking distance of the road and also accessible from Fox Harbour Pond by boat and walking.

Travel to the Deep Fox site from Goose Bay is available via charter airplane, helicopter, and Highway 510, a mostly paved road with some gravel sections.  Goose Bay, located 350 km to the  northwest,  is  a  preferred  hub  as  it  is  regularly  serviced  from  eastern  Canadian  cities including Quebec City and Montreal, Quebec and Halifax, Nova Scotia.  Flight time from the exploration site to Goose Bay by helicopter is approximately two hours, and by fixed wing aircraft approximately one hour.  Road travel from Goose Bay, a distance of approximately 460 km, to the site is approximately six hours.  The site is also accessible via Highway 510 from the Strait of Belle Isle and via a short ferry trip from insular Newfoundland.  The flight time to St. Anthony, Newfoundland is approximately half an hour.

## LOCAL RESOURCES AND INFRASTRUCTURE

The nearby communities of Port Hope Simpson, St. Lewis, and Mary's Harbour have port access as well as airstrips that can facilitate transportation of goods required for exploration programs.  St. Lewis has deep water dock facilities and a small gravel airstrip suitable for small aircraft.  Port Hope Simpson, St. Lewis, and Mary's Harbour, which have populations of 412, 195,  and  340  respectively,  have  various  services  including  grocery  stores,  fuel  stores, hardware stores, hotels, and heavy equipment for rent and labourers for hire.  Core storage and company lodging is located within the town of St. Lewis, in the newly renovated Loran C building (Figure 5-1), formally occupied by the Canadian Coast Guard.

## PHYSIOGRAPHY

Elevation ranges from sea level to approximately 120 MASL; drill hole collars mostly range from 60 MASL to 100 MASL.  Topography is rugged with generally east-west striking ridges and hills and low lying areas containing rivers, ponds, and brooks that generally drain west and south into St. Lewis Inlet.  The property occurs in an eco-region that can be classified as 'Coastal Barrens' with the majority of the property being scrubland.  Vegetation consists of isolated mixed black spruce, birch, balsam, and tamarack stands in sheltered valleys, mosses, lichens, and Labrador tea in more barren areas and lichen-covered bedrock in higher areas and along ridges.

## 6 HISTORY

## PUBLIC SURVEYS/STUDIES

Early knowledge of the area is based mainly on a 1:500,000 scale reconnaissance mapping (Eade, 1962).

Complete aeromagnetic coverage and lake-sediment geochemical surveys were conducted for  the  region  by  Geological  Survey  of  Canada (GSC) in 1974 and 1984.  A detailed lake sediment survey was released by the Newfoundland and Labrador government in 2010 and covered the area of the claims.

Geological mapping at 1:100,000 scale, as a five-year Canada-Newfoundland joint project aimed at mapping an 80 km coastal fringe of the Grenville Province in southern Labrador, was carried  out  from  1984  to  1987  by  Charles  F.  Gower  of  the  Newfoundland  and  Labrador Geological Survey (Gower et al., 1987).

Meyer and Dean visited the area in 1988 to investigate a lead-cadmium-tungsten-copper lake sediment anomaly (Meyer and Dean, 1988).

In  2014,  a master's thesis was completed to determine the geology, mineralogy, age, and origin of the rare earth minerals at the Fox Harbour property (Haley, 2014).

## EXPLORATION AND OWNERSHIP HISTORY

In  2008,  Search Minerals  began  actively trading  on  the  TSX  Venture  Exchange  under  the symbol SMY.  In 2009, it successfully acquired all outstanding shares of Alterra, now a whollyowned subsidiary of Search Minerals.  Search Minerals, through Alterra, currently holds 685 mineral claims in southeast Labrador including 623 claims in the Port Hope Simpson REE district,  where  the  Foxtrot  and  Deep  Fox  Projects  are  located.    Search  Minerals  began extensive exploration in the district in 2009 after it entered into a binding letter of intent to acquire an undivided 100% interest in certain claims in southeast Labrador owned by B and A Minerals  Inc.  known  as  the  Port  Hope  Simpson  property;  these  claims  have  since  been transferred to Alterra as per the option agreement.  Subsequent staking acquired adjacent

land,  including  the  Foxtrot,  Deep  Fox,  Silver  Fox,  and  Fox  Meadow  properties  in  the  Fox Harbour Volcanic Belt, and the Ocean View and Henley Harbour properties to the south.

The  Deep  Fox  property  (formally  named  Deepwater  Fox)  was  acquired  from  the  Quinlan brothers via an option agreement signed in 2011 and completed in 2015.  At the time, the property consisted of three mineral licences (016480M, 016620M, and 017646M), including 48 claims (1,200 ha) located east and north of the community of St. Lewis and contiguous with Alterra claims north and west of St. Lewis.  The Quinlan licences were merged with relevant and adjacent Alterra claims to form the current Licence 023108M.  Significant exploration at Deep Fox began in 2014 with a prospecting and mapping program; the discovery channel was completed in 2014.  Channelling programs continued in 2015, 2017, 2018, and 2019.  Drilling began with Phase I in 2017 and continued with Phase II in 2018.

There are no historical resource or reserve estimates on the Deep Fox Project.

There is no past production on the Deep Fox Project.

## 7 GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND MINERALIZATION

## REGIONAL GEOLOGY

The Deep Fox deposit occurs in the Fox Harbour Volcanic Belt (FHVB), part of the Fox Harbour Domain that is located in a region adjacent to the boundaries of three tectonic terranes within the eastern Grenville Province (Figure 7-1; Gower, 2012).  Units of the Lake Melville Terrane occur north of the FHVB, units of the Mealy Mountain Terrane to the west and southwest, and units  of  the  Pinware  Terrane  to  the  south.    Differing  lithologies,  structures,  ages,  and metamorphic  signatures  distinguish  these  terranes  from  one  another;  they  are  largely separated and defined by major fault zones (Gower et al., 1987, 1988; Gower, 2010, 2012; Hanmer and Scott, 1990).

The Lake Melville Terrane is located north of the FHVB.  This terrane is characterized by the Alexis  River  anorthosite,  biotite-bearing  granite,  granodiorite,  and  quartz  diorite-to-diorite gneiss (Gower et al., 1987, 1988; Gower 2010; Hanmer and Scott, 1990).  The Fox Harbour fault zone (Gower, 2012) separates the Lake Melville Terrane from the FHVB to the south. Near the Foxtrot and Deep Fox deposits, terrane boundary interpretations indicate that a thin sliver  (5  km  to  6  km  wide)  of  Mealy  Mountains  Terrane  occurs  between  the  Lake  Melville Terrane to the north and the Pinware Terrane to the south (Gower, 2012).  Detailed mapping indicates that the Fox Harbour Domain, including the FHVB, occurs in the northern half of this sliver and the Deer Harbour Domain in the southern half (Figure 7-1).

The Fox Harbour Domain, near the Foxtrot and Deep Fox deposits, is bordered to the north by the Fox Harbour fault zone and to the south by the Deer Harbour fault zone.  This domain has been traced in outcrop for 64 km; it is terminated by a fault zone at the northwest end (west of Port Hope Simpson) and by the Labrador Sea on the eastern end (near St. Lewis). REE mineralization, peralkaline felsic and mafic volcanic rocks of a bimodal suite (Fox Harbour Volcanic Suite), and an associated anorthositic gabbro/volcanic suite distinguish this domain from adjacent domains and terranes.  Feldspar porphyries and deformed augen gneisses also occur in this domain.  REE deposits and prospects in this domain include: Foxtrot, Deep Fox, Silver Fox, Fox Meadow, Fox Run, Foxy Lady, and Fox Pond.

Regional structural data, satellite image interpretation, geology, and unique lithologies suggest that the Fox Harbour and Deer Harbour domains are not part of the Mealy Mountains Terrane as originally suggested by Gower (2012).  Similar data suggest that at least two additional domains occur between the Lake Melville and Mealy Mountain terranes in the western portion of the region.  The Camp #1 Domain occurs between the Lake Melville Terrane and the Fox Harbour Domain whereas the Bobby's Pond Domain occurs between the Fox Harbour, Camp #1, and Deer Harbour domains and the Mealy Mountains Terrane.  The map pattern in the west shows the Mealy Mountains Terrane and the Bobby's Pond Domain as forming a wedge between the Fox Harbour and Deer Harbour domains; the Bobby's Pond Domain may be a subunit of the Mealy Mountain Terrane.  In the western portion of the study area, the Deer Harbour fault zone separates the Deer Harbour Domain  and the Mealy Mountain Terrane/Bobby's Pond Domain.

The Mealy Mountain Terrane units, west and southwest of the FHVB, consist of mostly biotite granitic  gneiss,  potassium  feldspar  megacrystic  granite  gneiss,  quartz  diorite  to  dioritic gneisses, and pelitic to semipelitic sedimentary gneisses (Gower et al., 1987, 1988; Gower, 2010).

The  Pinware  Terrane,  in  the  St.  Lewis  Inlet  area,  consists  of  metamorphosed  felsic  to intermediate intrusions and older intercalated quartzo-feldspathic supracrustal rocks. Intrusions  consist  mainly  of  granite,  k-feldspar  megacrystic  granite,  quartz  monzonite  and, granodiorite.    Supracrustal  rocks,  occurring  between  intrusions,  consist  mainly  of  felsic volcanic rocks and arenitic sediments (Gower, 2007, 2010).  The Long Harbour fault zone is interpreted  to  separate  the  Deer  Harbour  Domain  from  the  Pinware  Terrane  to  the  south (Gower, 2012).

Mapping and exploration south of the Long Harbour fault zone (south of the Deer Harbour Domain) indicate that peralkaline volcanic and intrusive rocks and related REE mineralization also occur in an area originally interpreted to be Pinware Terrane (Gower, 2012).  These rocks and  spatially  associated  non-peralkaline  supracrustal  rocks  have  been  grouped  into  the HighREE Hills Domain.  The HighREE Hills Domain is characterized by peralkaline volcanic and  subvolcanic  rocks  and  related  pegmatite-  and  vein-hosted  REE  mineralization.    REE prospects in the HighREE Hills Domain include: HighREE Island, Pesky Hill, Toots Cove, and Southern Shore.

The Fox Harbour Domain has many characteristics of a continental rift zone: 1) elongate faultbounded unit (64 km long); 2) bimodal subaerial volcanic/subvolcanic units; and 3) dominated by felsic peralkaline volcanic vents and spatially related non-peralkaline ash flow tuffs.  Similar, peralkaline-hosted,  REE  mineralization  has  been  discovered  throughout  this  domain  (e.g., Foxtrot and Deep Fox Projects).

Figure 7-1 illustrates the regional geology of the Deep Fox Project area.

## LOCAL GEOLOGY

The 64 km long FHVB ranges in width from less than 50 m in the northwest to three kilometres in the east (Figure 7-1).  The units dip steeply in a northerly direction and strikes generally trend westerly to northwesterly, parallel to bounding faults to the north and south.  The FHVB contains one (in the northwest) to three (in the east) sub-belts of bimodal rocks dominated by REE-bearing felsic peralkaline flows and ash-flow tuffs and mafic to ultramafic volcanic and related subvolcanic units.  Feldspar megacrystic/porphyritic units, including crystal tuffs in the eastern portion of the belt, predominantly occur between the three sub-belts.  Supracrustal units  of  sedimentary  origin,  including  quartzite  and  locally  derived  volcanogenic  sediments formed by erosion of felsic (commonly peralkaline) and mafic units, are locally abundant.

The  three  bimodal  sub-belts  in  the  FHVB,  from  north  to  south:  the  Road  Belt  (RB),  the Magnetite (MT) Belt and South Belt (SB), have been the focus of REE exploration.  The RB, which occurs on the northern boundary of the FHVB, can be traced throughout the FHVB.  The MT and SB have only been observed in the eastern 30 km of the FHVB.  The mineralized units within the belts, predominantly  pantellerite and  comendite,  commonly  occur  in  local topographic lows where ponds, bogs, and scarce outcrop predominate.  Exploration for REE mineralization  in  the  region,  however,  indicates  that  these  units  exhibit  relatively  high radiometric (anomalous  U  and  Th  values)  and  relatively high magnetic  (anomalous concentrations  of  magnetite)  signatures  that,  when  combined,  are  excellent  indicators  of mineralization.  Airborne and ground-based radiometric-magnetic surveys clearly outline the three mineralized belts (Section 9); overburden and treed areas obscure bedrock exposure of the mineralized belts in some areas.

High grade mineralization, characterized by Dy from 100 ppm to 400 ppm, is predominantly hosted by fine grained, layered to massive, pantellerite and Zr-enriched equivalents.  Lower grade mineralization, characterized by Dy from 20 ppm to 100 ppm, is predominantly hosted by fine-grained, mostly massive comendite and Zr-poor pantellerite.  Mineralized units are commonly interbedded with mafic to ultramafic volcanic units, quartzite, and locally derived volcanogenic sediments (Figure 7-2).

Most of the rare earth mineralization occurs in allanite and fergusonite; minor amounts of REE occur in chevkinite, monazite, bastnaesite, and zircon.  The majority of the light REE (i.e., La

<!-- image -->

to Sm) in the mineralization occurs in allanite, whereas the majority of the heavy REE (i.e., Eu to Lu) occurs in both fergusonite and allanite.

The RB commonly consists of non-peralkaline porphyritic feldspar-bearing units, mafic, and ultramafic volcanic rocks, non-peralkaline felsic volcanic units, comendite (peralkaline), and pantellerite (peralkaline).  Anorthosite suite units, including anorthositic gabbro and ultramafic volcanic rocks, always occur north (i.e., within 25 m) of the RB felsic volcanic units; all on the southern side of the Fox Harbour fault zone.  Individual highly mineralized units commonly range from less than one to five metres in thickness.  The RB hosts the Deep Fox deposit and several significant REE prospects with high grade REE mineralization including Fox Pond, Fox Valley, Fox Meadow, and Foxy Lady.  Medium to high grade mineralization at some of these prospects range from 10 m to 40 m in thickness (e.g., Deep Fox deposit and Fox Meadow prospect).  Low to high grade zones (comendite and pantellerite combined) are up to 100 m wide.

The MT Belt commonly consists of pantellerite, comendite, non-peralkaline rhyolite, and mafic to  ultramafic  volcanic  and  related  subvolcanic  units.    Individual  highly  mineralized  units commonly  range  up  to  one  metre  in  thickness.    This  belt  hosts  the  Foxtrot  deposit  and additional significant REE prospects in the area (e.g., Silver Fox and Fox Run).  Mineralization is  up  to  100  m  in  thickness  (comendite  and  pantellerite  combined)  at  the  Foxtrot  deposit; medium to high grade mineralization is up to 25 m in thickness, but typically averages 10 m to 14 m in thickness.

Lower grade REE mineralization is commonly found in the SB.  The SB commonly consists of predominantly comendite, minor mafic and pantellerite units, feldspar-bearing porphyry, and locally abundant volcanogenic sediments.  Low grade mineralization (comendite) commonly ranges from 10 m to 50 m in thickness.

## PROPERTY GEOLOGY

## MINERALIZATION

The Deep Fox deposit is located approximately 12 km east of the Foxtrot deposit and two kilometres northeast of St. Lewis in the RB of the FHVB (Figures 7-1, 7-2, and 7-3).  Near the Deep Fox deposit (Figure 7-2), the RB consists of, from north to south: 1) northern comendite; 2) anorthositic suite rocks consisting of anorthositic gabbro and associated volcanic rocks; 3) non-peralkaline  rhyolite;  4)  southern  comendite;  5)  mafic  and  ultramafic  volcanic  rocks;  6) pantellerite  with  interbedded  non-peralkaline  rhyolite  and  mafic  volcanic  rocks,  and  7)  a footwall  non-peralkaline  rhyolitic  ash-flow  tuff.    Minor  units  of  locally  derived  volcanogenic sediments,  mafic  volcanic  flows,  and  related  subvolcanic  units  and  pegmatites  occur throughout this sequence.  Most units generally dip 75° to 85° northerly; drill data indicates that  the  mineralized  zone  plunges  towards  the  northeast.    The  anorthositic  suite  and mineralized  units  form  a  prominent  east-west  trending  ridge  in  the  area.    Table  7-1  lists representative REE data for the major geological units within the Deep Fox deposit.

The comendite mineralization, which is approximately 15 m to 30 m in thickness, consists of individual  units  of  fine  grained,  commonly  less than  one  metre to two  metres in thickness, massive to poorly layered comendite.  Pantellerite is the most common lithology within the resource wireframes, exhibiting the highest grades (Section 14).  Medium grained to pegmatitic comendite fragments, commonly up to 10 cm, occur in localized areas.  Comendite commonly contains  trace  to  minor  magnetite,  exhibits  radioactivity  three  to  five  times  higher  than background levels, and contains lower amounts of REE (i.e., 20 ppm to 60 ppm Dy) and other incompatible elements relative to other mineralized units (Table 7-1).

<!-- image -->

The pantellerite mineralization (low-Zr pantellerite, pantellerite, and high-Zr pantellerite) is up to 42 m in thickness, consists of individual units of fine grained, commonly less than one metre to five metres in thickness, poorly to well layered pantellerite.  In the western portion of the deposit the pantellerite mineralization is up to 42 m thick but rapidly diminishes to 14 m thick to  the  western  edge  of  the  deposit;  medium  to  higher  grade  mineralization  thicknesses (pantellerite and high-Zr pantellerite) are reduced from 25 m thick to six metres thick over this same interval.  In the eastern portion of the deposit, the pantellerite mineralization occurs as three main units, separated by non-mineralized units (mafic volcanic flows, non-peralkaline rhyolite, and pegmatite) that are up to 31 m thick in aggregate.  The upper unit is up to nine metres thick but dominated by low-Zr pantellerite.  The middle and lower units are respectively up to 14 m and 11 m thick and dominated by more highly mineralized pantellerite and high-Zr pantellerite.

Pantellerite contains up to 10% magnetite and localized amphibole and pyroxene.  Magnetite is usually fine grained but may occur as porphyritic grains up to 4.0 mm across.  Pantellerite exhibits radioactivity from five to 40 times background.  Layering within the pantellerite units, observed as darker and lighter bands, is commonly defined by varying contents of magnetite. Medium grained to pegmatitic comendite and non-peralkaline rhyolite fragments, commonly up to 10 cm wide, occur in localized areas.  Pantellerite units are generally well mineralized, containing potentially economic concentrations of REE (i.e., 60 ppm to 400 ppm Dy) and other incompatible elements (Table 7-1).  Differences in average Zr values subdivide the pantellerite into  three  mappable  units:  Zr-poor  pantellerite  (5,000  ppm  to  10,000  ppm  Zr),  pantellerite (10,000 ppm to 15,000 ppm Zr), and Zr-enriched pantellerite (&gt;15,000 ppm Zr).  The Deep Fox deposit  comprises  predominantly  pantellerite  units;  comendite  units  are  generally  poorly mineralized.

Mafic volcanic units and locally derived sediments, commonly less than 0.5 m in thickness, occur between some individual mineralized units.  Thicker mafic units, up to 10 m in thickness, occur within the comendite unit and near the contact between the comendite and pantellerite units.  Mafic units commonly contain less than 300 ppm Zr and less than 10 ppm Dy.

Locally derived sediments consist of thin quartzite (&lt;20 cm) interbedded with thinly layered (&lt;30 cm) mafic and felsic bands.  Felsic bands consist of non-peralkaline rhyolite, comendite, low Zr pantellerite, or a mix of mafic and felsic volcanic units.

<!-- image -->

Ultramafic units, up to 25 m thick, occur within all non-peralkaline units and comendite at Deep Fox.  An ultramafic, mafic volcanic and non-peralkaline rhyolite flow mixed unit is commonly found in the hanging wall of the mineralized pantellerite zone.  The ultramafic units occur as fine to very fine grained flows with a distinctive texture.  Zr values commonly are less than 100 ppm and Dy values less than 4 ppm.

A major non-peralkaline rhyolite unit, up to 60 m thick, occurs in the hanging wall of the deposit. Several  units  of  non-peralkaline  rhyolite,  one  to  five  metres  in  thickness,  occur  within  the mineralized  zones,  particularly  in  the  eastern  part  of  the  deposit  where  they  commonly separate mineralized units (Figures 7-2 and 7-3).  They are commonly associated with low Zrpantellerite, pegmatite, mafic rocks, and locally derived sediments.  Non-peralkaline rhyolite is characterized by low Zr values (300 ppm to 600 ppm Zr), low Dy values (&lt;12 ppm Dy), and low mafic mineral concentrations (commonly less than five percent).

Faults, defined by the geology, magnetic anomaly offsets and topographic lineaments, divide the deposit into four major blocks, Deep Fox West Block, Deep Fox Central Block, Deep Fox East Block, and Deep Fox East Extension Block.  The observed faults are northerly to northeasterly striking, steeply dipping, faults with up to 20 m observed horizontal movement and 10 m to 100 m vertical movement observed in drill sections.

The vertical movement on the faults appears to have been partly responsible for changes along strike in the thickness of units, including the mineralization and the presence or absence of specific  units.    Change  in  the  thickness  of  mineralization  is  observed  across  all  block boundaries (Figure 7-2).  The western boundary of the Deep Fox West Block is interpreted to be the western edge of the Deep Fox Caldera; mineralized units diminish in size and wedge out at this boundary.  The eastern edge of the Deep Fox Caldera is marked by the eastern edge of the Deep Fox East Extension Block, where the mineralization lenses out.

The peralkaline mineralized units and spatially associated mafic-ultramafic, non-peralkaline rhyolite,  and  locally  derived  sedimentary  units  of  the  Deep  Fox  deposit  are  interpreted  to represent a subaerial bimodal sequence of volcanic and related volcanogenic sediments and subvolcanic  intrusions.    The  probable  mantle  derivation  of  the  peralkaline  and  mafic  to ultramafic rocks, the subaerial setting, and the occurrence of these units as a series of calderas in a narrow belt (the FHVB) over at least a 64 km strike-length suggest that these rocks occur

in a continental rift setting.  Modern analogues include Pantelleria Island, in the Mediterranean Sea, and the East African Rift.

## GENETIC MODEL

REE  mineralized  peralkaline  volcanic  rocks,  mainly  pantellerite  (Nuiklavik  Volcanic  Suite; Miller,  1993),  and  REE  mineralized  peralkaline  intrusive  rocks,  granites-syenites  (Strange Lake;  Miller  1996,  Miller  et  al.,  1996;  Two  Tom  Lake  syenite;  Miller  1987,  1988),  and undersaturated syenites (Red Wine Suite; Miller 1987 and 1988) occur elsewhere in Labrador and are of similar age (Miller et al., 1996).  U-Pb Zircon age determination at Foxtrot indicates the  FHVB  rocks  are  contemporaneous  (Haley,  2014).    In  all  examples,  peralkaline  rocks, hosting the REE mineralization, represent low volume late differentiates of high-level (crustal) magma chambers.  For intrusions, the mineralization occurs in late pegmatites, vein systems, or small volume intrusions at or near the top of the source magma chamber.  In the volcanic settings, the mineralization occurs as vent filling or near vent magma flows and/or ash flow tuffs.

The  exploration  program  at  the  Foxtrot  and  Deep  Fox  deposits  reveals  the  relationship between  peralkaline  volcanic  rocks,  vent,  or  near-vent  locations,  and  significant  REE mineralization.  The Foxtrot deposit is being used as a model (Foxtrot-like mineralization) for further exploration throughout the FHVB.  Data and field observations indicate that the Deep Fox, Fox Meadow, and Fox Pond prospects also occur in vent or near vent settings in the Road Belt of the FHVB (Figure 7-1).  The Fox Run prospect and Silver Fox prospect (Figure 7-1) likely occupy a similar site of REE mineralization in the MT Belt of the FHVB.

## 8 DEPOSIT TYPES

REE  and  rare  earth  metal  deposits  can  be  divided  into  two  main  classifications:  primary magmatic REE deposits and secondary REE deposits.   The  vast  majority  of  deposits  are primary magmatic and many of the secondary ones are proximal to REE-enriched primary magmatic sources.  Most magmatic deposits are related to mantle-derived magmas and/or magmatism associated with crustal rifting.  Metamorphic equivalents of these main categories are also known but not distinguished in this classification.

## PRIMARY MAGMATIC REE DEPOSITS

Primary  magmatic  deposits  can  be  subdivided  into  peralkaline  oversaturated,  peralkaline undersaturated, and carbonatite deposits.  Peralkaline deposits, both oversaturated (quartz bearing or quartz normative) and undersaturated (nepheline-bearing or nepheline normative) are mainly HREE-enriched, while carbonatite deposits are LREE-enriched; some carbonatite high-level  vein  systems  are  also  HREE-enriched.    Peralkaline  rocks  and  carbonatites  are known to occur in similar geological settings and can be spatially closely related.

These REE deposits are formed by concentration of REE and other incompatible elements (e.g., Zr, Nb, F, U, Th, Hf) in the upper portions of magma chambers.  These incompatible element-enriched  magmas  are  either  crystallized  in  place,  are  transported  to  locations proximal to the magma chamber, or are transported to surface and deposited as volcanic products.

Peralkaline oversaturated volcanic-hosted deposits are rare but known to occur (e.g., Foxtrot, Deep Fox, and Brockman deposits).  No undersaturated volcanic-hosted deposits have been recognized to date.

## PERALKALINE OVERSATURATED DEPOSITS

Peralkaline  oversaturated  deposits  are  commonly  characterized  by  HREE-enrichment  and complex REE-bearing minerals, such as fergusonite, allanite, zircon, monazite and xenotime, and unusual silicates such as gadolinite, kainosite,  and  gerinite.   REE-bearing  carbonates (e.g., bastnaesite) are less common in peralkaline-oversaturated deposits.

<!-- image -->

Peralkaline granites and syenites are the most common  REE-enriched peralkaline oversaturated deposits.  Mineralization is concentrated in the top of magma chambers and is either  crystallized  in  place  in  cupolas,  or  as  enriched  pegmatitic  vein  systems  and  related metasomatically-enriched rocks (e.g., part of Strange Lake Main Zone; Quebec/Labrador) or as  proximal  pegmatites/deposits  (e.g.,  Strange  Lake  B-Zone  and  part  of  Main  Zone; Quebec/Labrador).    Other  examples  include:  Bokan  Mountain  vein  systems  in  Alaska, HighREE Hills mineralized pegmatites and veins systems (e.g., Pesky Hill, HighREE Island) in the Port Hope Simpson district, and Round-Top Mountain disseminated low-grade mineralization  in  Texas.    Volcanic-hosted  equivalents  include  deposits  in  the  Fox  Harbour Volcanic Belt (e.g., Foxtrot, Deep  Fox),  Brockman  Volcanic  rocks  in  Australia, and mineralization in the Nuiklavik volcanic rocks of the Flowers River Igneous Suite (Labrador). Volcanic hosted mineralization occurs as felsic vent filling or near vent ash-flow tuffs/flows and spatially related subvolcanic pegmatitic equivalents.

## PERALKALINE UNDERSATURATED DEPOSITS

Peralkaline undersaturated deposits are commonly characterized by HREE-enrichment and eudialyte  (e.g.,  Norra  Karr,  Sweden;  Kipawa  Complex,  Quebec;  Red  Wine  Complex, Labrador), alteration products of eudialyte (Nechalacho - allanite, fergusonite, zircon; NWT, Canada) and other unknown complex Ca-Y silicates (e.g., Red Wine Complex, Labrador).

Nepheline- and eudialyte-bearing syenites are common host rocks for this kind of REE mineral deposit.    Volcanic  equivalents  of  this  kind  of  REE  mineralization  have  not  been  identified. Mineralization  occurs  as  pegmatite  vein  systems  and  related  rocks  (Red  Wine  Complex, Kipawa) and medium-grained zones within the upper portions of layered syenite intrusions (Norra Karr, Ilimaussaq, Red Wine Complex, Kipawa).

## CARBONATITE DEPOSITS

Carbonatite  hosted  deposits  contain  a  combination  of  REE-bearing  carbonates  (e.g., bastnaesite at Mountain Pass; California, Bear Lodge; Wyoming), monazite, xenotime, apatite, and other rare minerals.  The high level vein systems sometimes associated with carbonates contain  higher  concentrations  of  HREE  and  mostly  contain  predominantly  phosphates  like xenotime and monazite.  Vein system mineralization occurs at Lofdal (Namibia), Bear Lodge, Steenkampskraal (South Africa), and Brown's Range (Australia).

<!-- image -->

The majority of LREE, particularly La, Ce, Pr, and Nd, are mined from carbonatites in China (Bayan Obo Deposit) and Australia (Mt. Weld Deposit).  This mineralization occurs mostly disseminated in low volume magmatic phases of commonly large carbonatite plutons (e.g., Bear Lodge, Ashram).

Carbonatite  high-level  vein  mineralization  is  commonly  associated  with  large  carbonatite plutons (e.g., Loftdal, Bear Lodge).  High-grade mineralization, with similar characteristics but with  no  known  associated  plutons,  is  found  at  Brown's  Range  and  Steenkampskraal.    All represent small volume magmas probably originating from carbonatite magma chambers.

## SECONDARY REE DEPOSITS

Three types of secondary REE deposits have been recognized: 1) beach sands and related sedimentary  deposits,  2)  ionic  clay  deposits,  and  3)  in  situ  laterites.    These  deposits  are derived from weathering of REE mineral-bearing rocks.

## BEACH SAND DEPOSITS

REE-enriched  heavy  minerals,  commonly  zircon  and  monazite,  are  often  concentrated  in heavy mineral beach deposits.  These minerals are separated from the sands and sold as a by-product from beach sand deposits in India and elsewhere.  Consolidated beach sands and other clastic sedimentary units such as conglomerates can also contain significant quantities of REE-bearing heavy minerals (e.g., conglomerate in the Pele Mountain deposit, Ontario).

## IONIC CLAY DEPOSITS

Ionic-clay REE deposits are derived by surficial weathering of REE minerals.  Breakdown of REE minerals releases REE-bearing liquid species into the environment where clay particles absorb  them.    Several  regions  in  southern  China  (e.g.,  Jiangxi  Province)  and  Myanmar (Burma) contain HREE-enriched ionic-clay deposits.  These are mostly derived from REEbearing granites.

## IN SITU LATERITES

Surface  exposed  rocks  with  REE-bearing  mineralization  can  be  upgraded  by  weathering processes.  Two carbonatite-hosted REE deposits have been upgraded by surface weathering

<!-- image -->

processes.  One is the Bear Lodge Carbonatite (Wyoming) and the other the Araxa Carbonatite (Brazil).  Carbonatites weather easily in surface conditions.

## FOXTROT AND DEEP FOX DEPOSITS

The Foxtrot and Deep Fox deposits are examples of primary magmatic REE deposits; the mineralization being hosted in peralkaline oversaturated volcanic rocks.  Mineralization occurs mainly in zircon, allanite, and fergusonite.

## 9 EXPLORATION

## SUMMARY

Search Minerals began exploration in the Port Hope Simpson area in 2009, after acquiring 11 mineral licences via an option agreement with B and A Minerals Inc.  In the winter of 2009, Search  Minerals  conducted  an  Aeroquest  airborne  radiometric  and  magnetic  survey. Following  this  survey,  anomalous  areas  of  interest  were  outlined,  prioritized,  and  ground checked during the start of the 2010 field season.  An additional 47 mineral licences were staked, covering 864 km 2 .

Since the discovery of the Foxtrot deposit in 2010, extensive exploration has been completed in the Port Hope Simpson area for similar styles of mineralization ('Foxtrot-like').  Exploration in 2010-2015 consisted of ground magnetometer surveys, prospecting, mapping, lithogeochemical grab sampling, clearing, hand trenching, channel sampling with a portable circular saw, and diamond drilling.  The exploration program was conducted across the entire Fox  Harbour  Volcanic  Belt,  with  the  main  area  of  focus  being  the  Foxtrot  and  Deep  Fox projects, and the Fox Meadow prospect.  Search Minerals has also identified and carried out exploration work on numerous other prospects within the Port Hope Simpson REE district. The work on Foxtrot-like mineral prospects is summarized in Table 9-1.  Figure 9-1 shows the location of the Foxtrot deposit, the Deep Fox deposit, and other exploration prospects within the Port Hope Simpson REE district.

The  detailed  exploration  program  on  the  Deep  Fox  property  started  in  2014  with  detailed mapping and prospecting that led to the discovery channel (FDC-14-01) late in the season; this discovery was announced in early 2015.  An extensive channel sampling program was commenced  in  2015  and  consisted  of  16  channels  in  2015,  five  channels  in  2017,  four channels in 2018, and three channels in 2019.  The Phase I drilling program commenced in 2017 with three holes and was completed in 2018 with and additional 12 holes.  The Phase II drill program, consisting of eight holes, was completed in late 2018.  An Unmanned Airborne Vehicle (UAV) or drone detailed magnetic survey was carried out over the property in 2019. Search Minerals anticipates that a UAV Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) survey will be completed in late 2019.

## 2011 GROUND MAGNETOMETER SURVEYS

To better understand and characterize Foxtrot-like REE mineralization at surface, two detailed ground based magnetometer surveys were conducted in the area of Foxtrot and Deep Fox during the 2011 field season.  The survey completed over the main mineralized zone at Foxtrot was highly detailed, and a less detailed survey was completed outside the main zone to trace the location of the mineralized units beyond the Foxtrot deposit.  These surveys were used to plan  diamond  drilling  and  surface  channel  sampling  programs.    The  combined  ground magnetometer surveys are shown in Figure 9-2.

## UAV (DRONE) MAGNETIC SURVEY

A UAV magnetic survey was carried out over the Deep Fox property in 2019.  Although the survey is complete, results have not been received.  This survey will add more detail to the ground survey carried out in 2011 and will aid in directing subsequent drilling and channelling programs at Deep Fox.

## DEEP FOX CHANNEL SAMPLING

Search Minerals began surface channel sampling in the area in 2010 and continued through 2019.  Channel sampling focused on mineralized outcrops found using visual inspection as well as hand-held spectrometers in the area of the Foxtrot deposit, the Deep Fox deposit, and several other Foxtrot-like prospects in the district.

At  the  Deep  Fox  deposit,  Search  Minerals  collected  samples  from  31  surface  channels, totalling 889 m, in mineralized outcrops from 2014 to 2019 (Figure 9-3).  Channel sampling procedures are discussed in Section 11.  Table 9-2 summarizes several significant surface channel REE assay intervals taken at Deep Fox.

In RPA's opinion, the surface channel sampling conducted by Search Minerals has been an effective  exploration  technique  in  those  areas  where  outcrop  is  exposed  in  Fox  Harbour Mineralized Belt.

## 10 DRILLING

Search Minerals commenced a Phase I exploration drill program at the Deep Fox Project in Q4 2017.  The Phase I drill program, begun in 2017 (Cabo Drilling), consisted of three diamond drill  holes (DDH) totalling 473 m to a vertical mineralization depth of 50 m and 100 m; this program was postponed due to weather and equipment breakdowns.  This Phase I program was  completed  in  Q2/Q3  2018  by  drilling  contractor  Springdale  Forest  Resources  and consisted of 12 additional DDH totalling 1,948 m to a vertical mineralization depth of 50 m and 100 m.  The Phase II exploration drill program commenced in Q3/Q4 2018 and consisted of eight drill holes totalling 2,480 m to a vertical mineralization depth of 50 m to 200 m along a 500  m  strike  length.    The  drilling  area  focused  on  the  down  dip  extent  of  the  surface mineralization outlined by the channel programs.

Drill  hole collar positions were determined by Search Minerals' senior geological personnel and were located in the field by a Search Minerals geologist.  Drill holes were initially plotted using ArcGIS, and collar positions were staked using a hand-held global positioning system (GPS)  unit.    All  drill  holes  in  the  Deep  Fox  Project  were  surveyed  after  drilling  had  been completed to within ±0.60 m GPS positional accuracy, and 0.2° to 1.0° azimuth accuracy. Coordinates were recorded in UTM format according to the NAD83 datum, and elevations were recorded in metres above sea level (MASL).

All holes were drilled at an angle of 45° from the horizontal; the collar azimuth and dip were planned and checked by a Search Minerals geologist.  The drill hole was set with an extended foresight from the drill head, and the azimuth of this line direction was measured with a Brunton or Silva type compass.  The drill hole collar dip was set and measured with an inclinometer on the drill rods at the drill head.

Drill hole azimuth and dip measurements at varying depths in each drill hole were checked using a Reflex Gyro down-the-hole probe that uses a digital surface referenced microelectromechanical  system  (MEMS)  gyroscope  designed  for  magnetite  bearing  rocks. Drill  hole  collar  azimuths,  GPS  coordinates  and  elevations  were  obtained  using  the  Reflex Azimuth Pointing System (APS).

<!-- image -->

No significant deviation problems occurred during the drill programs at Deep Fox, most holes deviated less than five to ten degrees per 100 m from both azimuth and dip.  This did not affect true thickness calculations of the steeply dipping mineralized domains.

Sample length ranges from &lt;0.05 m to 2.50 m, with the majority being approximately 1.0 m. The true thickness of the mineralization is up to a 45 m wide package of felsic and mafic bands.

Table 10-1 summarizes the two phases of drilling on the Project.

Table 10-2 summarizes representative significant intervals from drilling Phases I and II for key rare earth metals.

Figure 10-1 displays the diamond drill hole locations from all phases of drilling.

## 11 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES, AND SECURITY

## SAMPLING AND SAMPLE PREPARATION

Two sampling methods have been used at the Deep Fox Project: diamond drilling and surface channel sampling.  Drilling on the Project occurred in 2017 and 2018 and channel sampling in 2014 and 2015 and in 2017 and 2018.

All sample preparation and core logging were carried out at the Search Minerals field house, which is located in St. Lewis, approximately 10 minutes by truck from the Deep Fox Project field area.  Drilling, core logging, and sampling operations were supervised by Dr. Randy Miller, P.Geo., VP of Exploration for Search Minerals.

The drilling, logging, and sampling procedures at the Deep Fox Project are similar to those used at Search Minerals' Foxtrot Project.  They were previously reviewed by RPA and RPA's contractor Benchmark Six Inc. (Benchmark Six) during their site visit to the Foxtrot deposit in 2011 (RPA, 2013 and 2016) and are summarized below.  The quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) protocols, procedures for ensuring the security of drill core and channel samples, integrity  of  chain-of-custody  for  samples,  and  accuracy  of  laboratory  analyses  all  met acceptable industry practices.

## DIAMOND DRILL CORE

Diamond drill core was placed into standard wooden core boxes and stacked at the drill site. Core boxes were transported by pick-up truck from the field area to the field house at least once a day where they were organized onto racks in the core shed.  Geologists log the core and mark assay sample intervals with wax crayon.  Intervals averaged one metre but were longer or shorter, at the discretion of the geologist, depending on the structural and lithological features present.  Drill core was logged manually, and the logs were subsequently entered into a digital database by Search Minerals staff.  All original paper drill logs are kept on file.

The drill core was split using the marked assay intervals; all splitting was done using a circular saw with a diamond tip blade.  One half of the core was placed in a sample bag and sent to the  laboratory  for  chemical  analyses  and  the  other  half  remains  in  the  core  box  for  future

reference.    For  each  interval,  one  sample  tag  was  placed  in  the  sample  bag  and  another sample tag was stapled to the bottom of the core box, under the core.  After the core had been split and sampled, the remaining core was placed back into core boxes and kept in the core shed.  All stored core boxes are affixed with an aluminum plate indicating the hole ID and the Interval contained within.  A list was made of all sample numbers and their corresponding hole ID, and from-to (interval) depths.

A selected piece from each mineralized and selected non-mineralized sample interval from the Deep Fox core was tested for magnetic susceptibility and density.  The magnetic susceptibility measurements  were  taken  with  a  portable  instrument.    Density  measurements  were determined with the standard gravimetric procedure that involves measuring samples on a scale in air and immersed in water.

The drill rig used during the 2017 and 2018 sampling programs was a Dura-lite 500 mounted on a tracked carrier and was operated by Springdale Forest Resources.  All core drilled during the Deep Fox sampling programs was NQ (47.6 mm) size.

## CHANNEL SAMPLES

Channel samples were taken from mineralized surface outcrop found using visual inspection as well as hand-held spectrometers.  The location of channel sampling was partly dictated by the location of surface outcrop.  A hand-held GPS unit was used for precise location control. Channel samples, 10 cm deep and 8 cm wide, were cut by gas-powered diamond saw from cleaned outcrops (surface weathering is removed) and placed into channel boxes to be logged and sampled by Search Minerals personnel (Figure 11-1).  Six centimetre thick sections were sent to the assay laboratory and a two centimetre thick section was stored in channel boxes for reference (Figure 11-2).  The channels were cut perpendicular to strike, pieced together, logged, and photographed to produce geological and geochemical sections.

Channel samples were logged, cut, and sampled according to the same procedure as the diamond drill core, described above.

## SAMPLE ANALYSES

Deep Fox sample bags were collected in large plastic bags, placed on a pallet, and wrapped with plastic film for transport by Search Minerals staff to Morneau trucking company in Goose Bay.  This trucking company transported these sample pallets to Actlabs in Ancaster, Ontario for sample preparation and analysis. Samples were analyzed using a lithium metaborate/tetraborate fusion with subsequent analysis by inductively coupled plasma (ICP) and ICP mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS).

Actlabs is an independent laboratory accredited according to both the ISO 17025 standard for testing and calibration laboratories, and the CAN-P-1579 standard, specific to mineral analysis laboratories.    In  2007,  Actlabs  became  accredited  to  NELAP,  an  American  laboratory accreditation program specifically for the environmental sector.

## SAMPLE SECURITY

Search Minerals employs strict security protocols with the handling of its samples.  Core is transported by truck only, both from the drill site to the field house and from the field house to the trucking company in Goose Bay.  The core is stored in the core shack, a detached structure with doors and locks, and is organized carefully, facilitating accessibility to all reference core. During logging, cutting, and sampling, drill core is always under the supervision of full-time Search Minerals staff.

In RPA's opinion, the sample preparation, analysis, and security procedures at the Deep Fox Project are adequate for use in the estimation of Mineral Resources.

## QUALITY ASSURANCE AND QUALITY CONTROL

RPA reviewed the results of Nd, Pr, and Dy and provides the following discussion on the QA/QC results for the Deep Fox Project.

## ACTLABS INTERNAL QA/QC

The resource estimate included in this report incorporates analytical results from 55 batches that were submitted to Actlabs from January 2015 to September 2015; in October 2017, and

<!-- image -->

from February 2018 to January 2019.  With each batch, Actlabs used three types of samples to monitor the accuracy and precision of their results: standards, blanks, and duplicates.

Blank  control  samples  allow  the  laboratory  to  monitor  cross  contamination  between  the samples.  While contamination can occur during the sample preparation and analysis stages, these blank control samples were limited to monitoring only the analysis stage.  It is normal industry practice to reject any batch whose results are more than five times the detection limit. Of the 64 blanks tested, no blank control sample had more than twice the detection limit for Nd, Pr, and Dy.

The standards allow the laboratory to monitor the accuracy of their results.  Eight or more different standards were used to test the accuracy of the REE data in each batch and no one standard alone covered the complete set of potentially economic elements.  At least six of these  standards  monitored  Nd,  Pr,  or  Dy,  the  most  important  REEs  within  the  Deep  Fox Project.  RPA reviewed the Nd, Pr, and Dy results of the various CRMs and found that nearly 100% of the results were within ±10% of their certified value.  This is generally accepted as a good result.

Duplicates allow the laboratory to monitor precision of its analytical results.  As with standards, it is normal industry practice to accept batches if 95% of duplicate samples fall within ±10% of their average.  RPA reviewed the internal duplicate results and found them acceptable.

In RPA's opinion, the internal QA/QC results demonstrate that the assay data have acceptable accuracy and precision.

RPA recommends that Search Minerals review the laboratory's internal QA/QC results and that batches that do not meet pre-set protocols be re-assayed.

## SEARCH MINERALS EXTERNAL QA/QC

In addition to Actlabs' internal QA/QC, the reliability of the analytical data was also monitored by Search Minerals' own external QA/QC program, using blanks, reference standards, coarse reject and pulp duplicates.  Rather than using CRMs, Search Minerals used material sourced locally for which no certified value had been established by round-robin analyses from multiple laboratories.  In this case, the average of all available results (where appropriate) was used as the reference value and percent error was calculated.

All  Search Minerals external QA/QC samples were inserted by Actlabs, using the following protocol:

- · Blanks and standards were inserted in each batch after the 15 th  or 35 th sample, and every 40 th sample thereafter.
- · Coarse duplicates were taken every 20 th  sample per batch.
- · Pulp duplicates were taken at a rate of approximately 10%.

Table 11-1 summarizes the insertion rate of QA/QC samples for all work completed on the Deep Fox Project to date.

TABLE 11-1   INSERTION RATES OF QA/QC SAMPLES Search Minerals Inc. - Deep Fox Project

| QA/QC Sample Type   | Insertion Rate   |
|---------------------|------------------|
| Blanks              | 2.5% 1           |
| Standards           | 2.5%             |
| Coarse Duplicates   | 5%               |
| Pulp Duplicates     | 10%              |

Note:

1. Includes only batches with blanks.

## BLANKS

Blank samples comprised of crushed, pulverized, and homogenized dolomite were inserted into the sample stream by Actlabs throughout the diamond drilling program, and in the last two batches of channel samples.  External blank material was not inserted into the sample stream of the first 26 batches of the channel sampling programs: Search Minerals had no material available.  A total of 101 blank samples were included in 31 batches, with an insertion rate of approximately 2.5%.  RPA reviewed the results for Pr, Ad, and Dy: A single Nd value plotted 10% above the threshold limit of blank samples, and all Pr and Dy values plotted below the established  threshold  limit.    In  RPA's  opinion,  cross  contamination  was  not  an  issue  for analyses at the Deep Fox Project.  RPA strongly recommends that Search Minerals include external blank sample in each batch sent to the laboratory

## REFERENCE STANDARDS

Search Minerals inserted two standards in each batch:  one high grade and one very low grade. The  120  low  grade  standards  effectively  acted  as  a  blank  sample  and  were  not  a  useful indicator of analytical accuracy.  The standard is sourced from an anorthosite unit found in Port

Hope Simpson area.  The high grade standard was sourced from another Search Minerals' REE project in the Fox Harbour area.  Details of reference standards used by Search Minerals are summarized in Table 11-2.

TABLE 11-2   SEARCH MINERALS REE REFERENCE STANDARDS Search Minerals Inc. - Deep Fox Project

| Standard    | Standard   | Standard   | Insertion  Rate   | Average Analytical Value   | Average Analytical Value   | Average Analytical Value   |
|-------------|------------|------------|-------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|
| ID          | Type       | Count      |                   | Nd  (ppm)                  | Pr  (ppm)                  | Dy  (ppm)                  |
| STND 423926 | High Grade | 134        | 2.6%              | 2,080                      | 555                        | 275/323 1                  |
| STND 415351 | Low Grade  | 120        | 2.4%              | 5.88                       | 1.67                       | 0.57                       |

Note:

The material for each standard was crushed, pulverized, and homogenized by Actlabs, which inserted these reference standards with every batch.

For Nd and Pr (LREEs), the vast majority of the standards plot within ±2 standard deviations (SD) (Figures 11-4 and 11-5), with the exception of batches A14-08632 and A17-09711, which show clear high biases.  The control chart for Dy is also characterized by a high biased result in batch A17-09711.  Additionally, after a two month pause in sample submittals in late 2018, there is a clear high bias in the Dy results for the remainder of the program.

RPA reviewed the laboratory's internal QA/QC results and the control charts of the low grade standard and found no failures, biases, or other dubious results.  In RPA's opinion, the Dy results for the high grade standard is due to either poor reference sample preparation (i.e., lack of homogenization) or poor standard sample collection when preparing for insertion.  Poor sample handling protocol is also the likely source of the high biases in batches A14-08632 and A17-09711.  The Dy control chart is shown in Figure 11-6, and RPA modified the control limits to account for the bias observed.

In RPA's opinion, preparation and insertion protocol for reference standards used by Search Minerals at the Deep Fox Project is highly suspect and should be thoroughly reviewed.  It is impossible to detect real trends or failures given the low confidence in the expected values for reference standards.  RPA recommends that Search Minerals either use commercial CRMs or

<!-- image -->

review the reference standard preparation procedures and implement procedures to monitor the results of the control samples, including threshold limits and trends to identify failures.

Figure 11-6 illustrates that a vast majority of results for the high grade standard plot within the ±10% range.  The results of the very low grade standard were not within ±10% of the average value but rather ranged from -50% to 150%, which is an acceptable range for a blank control sample, where the values for each of the elements are very close to detection limit.

Although there was no pre-established reference value for these external reference materials, they do document that the laboratory was able to stay within ±10% of the average grade.  RPA notes that the external reference material had Pr, Nd, and Dy grades that are similar to high grade mineralization at Deep Fox.  RPA recommends that a lower grade reference standard be obtained with grades typical of mineralization at or near the cut-off grade of the deposit and a reference standard that has a similar grade to typical Deep Fox mineralization.

## DUPLICATES

Search Minerals inserted both reject coarse duplicates (coarse duplicates), which were taken immediately after the first crushing and splitting step, and pulp duplicates, which are second splits of final prepared pulverized samples.  The coarse and pulp duplicate samples were taken by the laboratory at the request of Search Minerals at a rate of approximately 5% and 10%,

respectively.    Tables  11-3  and  11-4  summarize  the  basic  statistics  of  the  Pr,  Nd,  and  Dy duplicate pairs.

Overall,  there  were  246  coarse  duplicates  and  521  pulp  duplicates  were  taken  in  the  55 batches that comprise the drill hole and channel sampling programs at Deep Fox.  Of these, approximately 3% of pulp duplicates and 10% of coarse duplicates, did not fall within a ±10% band.  The samples that fell outside of the ±10% band were low grade: duplicate sample results with Pr, Nd, and Dy grades typical of those found at Deep Fox all had results well within ±10%.

In  RPA's opinion, the duplicates confirm the precision of the laboratory's analytical results. RPA  recommends  including  selected  half  core  samples  (field  duplicates)  in  the  duplicate sampling protocol.

<!-- image -->

## QA/QC SUMMARY

It  is  RPA's opinion that Search Minerals' QA/QC data for the drilling and channel sampling programs at Deep Fox are acceptable and demonstrate that the assay data have the accuracy and precision adequate for Mineral Resource estimation.

## RPA recommends the following:

- · QA/QC samples should be inserted into the sample stream by Search Minerals rather than the  analytical  laboratory.    RPA  notes  that  Search  Minerals  does  not  blind  the analytical  laboratory  to  blanks,  reference  standards,  or  pulp  duplicate  samples submitted for analysis.  Instead of identifying a QA/QC sample with a description or reference standard number, the sample should be inserted into the sample number sequence.
- · Current reference standards used on the Project are ineffective for detecting analytical bias or failures.  For future sampling programs at Deep Fox, Search Minerals should use commercial CRMs or work with the analytical laboratory to develop CRMs through round robin testing for which the grade has been established prior to its use.  Although three difference CRMs are recommended, at least one should have grades similar to typical REE mineralization at Foxtrot and another should have approximately the same grade  as  high  grade  mineralization.    RPA  also  recommends  a  third  standard  with grades typical of mineralization at or near the cut-off grade.  This would help identify any systematic bias or uncertainty in the laboratory results.
- · Resume the regular submission of blank material with regular drill core and surface channel samples.
- · Include  selected  half  core  samples  (field  duplicates)  in  a  check  assay  sampling protocol.
- · The analytical laboratory's internal and Search Minerals' field QC results should be reviewed for each sample batch submitted.
- · Establish what constitutes a QC failure and document appropriate follow-up actions.

## 12 DATA VERIFICATION

RPA reviewed the resource database that formed the basis for the Mineral Resource estimate presented in this Technical Report.  This includes results from the QA/QC program and assay certificates for drill hole and channel samples to a cut-off date of September 26, 2019.  In the opinion of RPA, the database is acceptable for Mineral Resource estimation.

## SITE VISIT

Katharine M. Masun, P.Geo., Senior Geologist, RPA, visited the site on August 27, 2015.  The site visit consisted of a complete tour of the premises, including the field office, the core logging shack, the core cutting shack, and the core storage facilities.  No logging, cutting, or sampling was occurring on the Project at the time, so the procedures could not be observed first hand.

The property  visit,  which  focused  on  the  Foxtrot  Project,  included  a  tour  of  the  Deep  Fox Project.  RPA inspected surface mineralization along most of the strike length, including the location of the 2014 and 2015 channel sampling at Deep Fox.

Field sampling procedures were verified by RPA and Rick Breger of Benchmark Six during a site  visit  to  both  the  field  house  and  Foxtrot  Project  site  in  October  2011.    Field  sampling procedures have not been modified for the Deep Fox Project.  During the visit, logging, cutting of  core,  and  sampling  procedures  were  observed  first  hand  and  the  site  visit  included observations of surface mineralization, including the location of the trenching and old drill hole collars.  Both RPA and Benchmark Six concluded that Search Minerals staff conducted their exploration and drilling activities to a standard that met or exceeded normal industry practices (RPA, 2013 and 2016).

## MANUAL DATABASE VERIFICATION

RPA  received  the  Deep  Fox  resource  database  as  Microsoft  Excel  files.    Collar,  survey, lithology, assay, and density data were reviewed.  Database verification was performed using tools provided within the Leapfrog Geo 4.5.2 software program and Microsoft Excel to check for potential issues including:

<!-- image -->

- · Sample length and overlap issues
- · Maximum and minimum lengths and assay grades
- · Negative assay values
- · Drill hole deviations
- · Gaps in assays/unsampled intervals
- · Assay and density outliers

RPA verified that the drill hole database matched the original Actlabs assay certificates.  This included a comparison of over 5,600 results in the resource database to 53 digital laboratory certificates of analysis, which were received directly from Actlabs.  A very small number of inconsistencies were identified.

As part of database validation, a visual check of the drill hole collar elevations and drill hole traces was completed with respect to a topographic surface.  A surveyed topographic surface was not (thus far) available for the Project; instead, RPA downloaded the Canadian Digital Surface Model (CDSM) with a 30 m resolution for the region from the Government of Canada website.  RPA observed that the drill hole collars were generally one to five metres above the topographic surface.  Although the drill hole collars and traces have been surveyed, channel samples  have  not.    Channel  'collar'  locations  have  been  recorded  with  a  hand-held  GPS without elevation information.  RPA adjusted the collar elevations to the CDSM surface and notes the uncertainty of the channel sample locations: source data had a targeted vertical accuracy of 16 m absolute error at 90% confidence (Mukul et al., 2017).  RPA recommends that Search Minerals obtain a topographic survey over the Project area so that drill hole collar elevations can be validated, and the channel sample elevations can be determined.  RPA further recommends that Search Minerals survey the channel sample locations.

## INDEPENDENT ASSAYS OF DRILL CORE

RPA did not collect samples from channels for independent assay during the 2015 Deep Fox site  visit.    Since  mineralization  at  Deep  Fox  is  Foxtrot-like,  in  RPA's  opinion  the  following discussion is relevant.

In 2011, Rick Breger, Director of Operations for Benchmark Six, on behalf of RPA, collected 28  samples  (22  drill  core  and  6  channel  samples)  at  the  Foxtrot  Project  for  independent analyses at SGS Minerals Services (SGS), Toronto.  REE analyses were performed using

<!-- image -->

lithium metaborate fusion and analyzed via ICP-MS.  SGS uses a quality management system that meets, at a minimum, the requirements for both ISO 9001 and ISO 17025.  Analyses were performed on the 22 drill core samples to check the accuracy of the REE analyses performed by Actlabs, and all 28 samples were used to determine density.  The REE check samples included were chosen according to the distribution of Dy seen on the Project across the three main lithological  units  and  ranged  in  Dy  grade  from  2.3  ppm  to  360  ppm.    Quality  control samples were also collected on two Search Minerals' pulp reference standards.

The agreement between analyses for Dy and Nd was shown to be acceptable and confirmed the presence of significant REE mineralization in the samples.  Samples were collected from the  three  major  lithological  units  on  the  Foxtrot  Project,  and  the  average  bulk  density measurements were used for resource estimation (RPA, 2013 and 2016).

RPA is of the opinion that database verification procedures for the Deep Fox Project comply with industry standards and are adequate for the purposes of Mineral Resource estimation

## 14 MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATE

## SUMMARY

RPA estimated Mineral Resources for the Deep Fox Project using all drill hole and channel sample  data  available  as  of  September  26,  2019.    Table  14-1  summarizes  the  estimated Mineral Resources based on a potential open pit mining scenario as of September 26, 2019. The cut-off value has been expressed as Net Smelter Return (NSR).  No Mineral Reserves have been estimated at the Project.

Notes::

- 1. CIM (2014) definitions were followed for Mineral Resources.
- 2. Mineral Resources were reported inside the pit shell at a pit discard NSR cut-off value of C$140/t.
- 3. NSR values were assigned to blocks using metal price and metallurgical recovery assumptions for each metal; also accounting for separation and transportation charges and royalties for the mixed REO product.
- 4. A minimum mining width of 2.0 m was used.
- 5. Bulk density is 2.81 t/m 3 .
- 6. Numbers may not add due to rounding.

RPA is not aware of any known environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, socio-economic, marketing, political, or other relevant factors that could materially affect the Mineral Resource estimate.

## RESOURCE DATABASE

RPA  was  provided  with  a  drill  hole  database  consisting  of  23  drill  holes  and  31  surface channels, totalling 4,507 m of drilling and 889 m of channel sampling.  All 54 holes/channels (5,396 m) were located within the estimated Mineral Resources.  Figure 14-1 shows the drill hole and channel traces in plan.

## GEOLOGICAL INTERPRETATION AND 3D SOLIDS

Resource wireframes were built to investigate geological and grade continuity and to constrain grade interpolation within the block model.  A Leapfrog Geo 4.5 vein system modelling tool was used to generate an interpretation of the mineralization at a nominal cut-off NSR value of C$140/t.

The Deep Fox deposit comprises three wireframes:  Hanging Wall (HW) Zone, Footwall (FW) Zone, and Deep Zone (Figures 14-2 and 14-3, Table 14-3).  A minimum thickness of two metres  was  applied.    The  zones  of  interpreted  mineralization  were  contiguous,  with  rare exceptions where narrow intercepts were expanded to achieve a minimum thickness where required,  and  assays  below  the  minimum  NSR modelling  value  were  included  to  maintain continuity.  At model extremities, the wireframes were extrapolated approximately 25 m beyond the last channel or drill hole intersection.  Continuity was checked using the level plans and in vertical cross sections.  All three wireframes are steeply dipping (80° to 85°), at an azimuth of approximately 275°.  The strike length of the HW and FW zones are approximately 620 m and 725 m and have been modelled to a depth of -60 MASL and -150 MASL, respectively.  The wireframes have been extended no more than 25 m below the deepest drill hole intercept and the  upper  surfaces  have  been  clipped  to the topography.   A  description of  each modelled wireframe follows:

- · Footwall  Zone: A  steeply  dipping  (80°  to  85°)  single  wireframe  solid  comprised predominantly of mineralized pantellerite, with a strike length of 725 m at an azimuth of  approximately 275°.  The unit has been modelled to a depth of -150 m, with an average thickness of 25 m, but ranges from 5 m to 40 m.  The central portion of the FW Zone reaches a thickness of nearly 30 m, at a depth of approximately -40 m.  The wireframe model narrows to approximately 5 m to the east and 13 m to the west.  Small lenses of mainly non-peralkaline rhyolite (NPR), mafic and ultra mafic rock, and weakly mineralized  comendite  and  pegmatite  intermingle  with  the  pantellerite.    Drill  hole intersections range from less than one metre to approximately five metres in thickness. Comendite is lower grade than pantellerite.  The top of the FW Zone wireframe solid has been clipped to topography.  The FW Zone is the main zone of mineralization.
- · Hanging Wall Zone: A narrower zone of mineralization located on the hanging wall side of the FW Zone, the HW Zone parallels the steep dip of the FW Zone.  The HW Zone comprises a single wireframe of predominantly mineralized pantellerite and low Zr-pantellerite,  with  a  strike  length  of  765  m  at  an  azimuth  of  approximately  285°. Similar to the FW Zone, small lenses of NPR, mafic and ultramafic rock, and weakly mineralized comendite and pegmatite intermingle with the pantellerite.  Approximately two to ten metres of mafic and non-peralkaline rhyolitic rocks separate the FW Zone from the HW Zone.
- · Deep Zone: A  small  zone  of  high  grade  pantellerite  has  been  intersected  on  the footwall side of the FW Zone.  A single wireframe constrains the mineralization, which is limited to two drill hole intersections, has been extended approximately 65 m along

<!-- image -->

strike, and the modelling is restricted from elevations -110 m to -200 m.  It has a near vertical dip at an  azimuth  of approximately  275°  and  thickness  ranges  from approximately seven metres to 15 m.

## STATISTICAL ANALYSIS

There are 15 elements that normally are classified as REEs:

- · La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb and Lu - all of the lanthanoids with the exception of promethium (Pm), which does not occur in nature.
- · Yttrium (Y), which is usually classified as a REE.

HREE include Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb, Lu, and Y.  LREE include La, Ce, Pr, Nd, and Sm.  TREE is the sum of HREE and LREE.  At Deep Fox, only seven payable REEs have been estimated into the block model: LREEs Nd and Pr, and HREEs Eu, Dy, Er, Lu, and Tb. The eight excluded REEs (Ce, La, Sm, Gd, Yb, Ho, Tm, and Y) do not contribute to the NSR value of the resource.

Some of the following discussion of statistical analysis focuses on three of these elements: Nd, Pr, and Dy.  The elements chosen have the greatest in situ value (grade × metal price) at Deep Fox.  Dy is the HREE with the greatest in situ value, and Nd is the LREE with the greatest in situ value.

Assay values located inside the wireframes, or resource assays, were tagged with mineralized zone domain identifiers and exported for statistical analysis.  Results assisted in verifying the modelling process.  RPA compiled and reviewed the basic statistics for Nd, Pr, and Dy, which are summarized in Table 14-4.

Figures 14-4 to 14-6 show histograms of Nd, Pr, and Dy for all assays used in the resource estimate.  The distributions show three prominent modes that correspond to two main rock types.  The lowest mode belongs to samples from the mafic volcanic units.  The two high grade modes belong to low-Zr pantellerite, and pantellerite-mafic mixed intervals (lower grade) and pantellerite (higher grade).

## CAPPING HIGH GRADE VALUES

RPA investigated the necessity for capping of high grade resource assays.  A review of the resource assay histograms, and top decile analysis performed for Nd, Pr, Eu, Dy, Er, Lu, and Tb showed that capping was not necessary.  This is confirmed by low coefficients of variation (Table 14-5).

## COMPOSITING

Assayed sample lengths range from 0.01 m to 1.69 m within the resource wireframe models. Only two samples have lengths greater than 2.0 m (Figure 14-7).  Given these distributions and considering the width of mineralization, RPA chose to composite to 2.0 m lengths.  The resource assays were composited starting at the first mineralized wireframe boundary from the collar and resetting at each new wireframe boundary.  Composites less than 0.25 m were removed from the database for resource estimation but used for variography.

Table 14-6 summarizes the Pr, Dy, and Nd statistics of the composite resource assay values. When compared to Table 14-4, the average grades are nearly the same and the coefficient of variation values have been reduced.

## VARIOGRAPHY AND INTERPOLATION PARAMETERS

There is a very strong correlation among all elements (Table 14-7), and RPA used a single variogram  model  for  the  LREEs  and  a  single  variogram  model  for  the  HREEs  for  grade interpolation.

RPA evaluated variography and prepared variograms using all available composited assays located within the resource domains with the Edge module in Leapfrog.  The nugget effect was established with the downhole variogram.  For both the LREEs and HREEs, the variogram was consistent with trends used for the resource wireframes and was oriented with the longest range in the down plunge directions, the semi-major parallel to the strike of the mineralization, and  the  shortest  range  was  observed  normal  to  the  plane  of  the  deposit.    Variography confirmed that  the  direction  of  maximum  continuity  is  the  down  plunge  direction  (X)  at  an azimuth of 285°, with a range of 170 m for LREEs and 125 m for HREEs.  The semi-major range (Y) is 120 m for LREEs and 85 m for HREEs, and perpendicular to the strike direction (Z), the range is approximately 8.0 m for LREEs and 12 m for HREEs.  Variograms are shown in Figures 14-8 and 14-9, and variogram model results are summarized in Table 14-8.

REE grades were interpolated using ordinary kriging (OK).  Variography was used to determine the search ellipsoid dimensions and global plunge, and variable orientation was applied using the resource domain wireframe (Figure 14-10).  The interpolation and search parameters are summarized in Table 14-9.

Notes::

- 1. Global plunge with a variable orientation applied to follow the structure of each resource domain (see Figure 14-10).

A single pass was used to interpolate LREE and HREE block grades for all resource domains. Interpolation was restricted by the mineralized wireframe models, which were used as hard boundaries to prevent the use of composite samples outside of the zones to interpolate block grades.  The single pass used 100% of the variogram ranges and was limited to a minimum of one and a maximum of eight composites per block, with a maximum limit of two composites used per drill hole.  Identical search ellipses were used for all LREEs and HREEs in all three resource domains.

## NSR CUT-OFF VALUE AND PRELIMINARY OPEN PIT SHELL

The depth and geometry of the interpreted mineralized domains at the Deep Fox deposit make it amenable to open pit methods near surface.  To fulfill the CIM requirement of 'reasonable prospects for  eventual  economic extraction',  RPA  prepared  a  preliminary  open  pit shell  to constrain  the  block  model  for  resource  reporting  purposes.    The  preliminary  pit  shell  was generated in Whittle software using a pit slope angle of 50°.

NSR factors were developed by RPA for the purposes of resource reporting.  NSR is the estimated value per tonne of mineralized material after allowance for metallurgical recovery and  consideration  of  terms  for  third-party  separation  and  refining,  including  payability  and charges.  The assumptions for metallurgical recoveries are based on metallurgical testwork carried out on Deep Fox samples (Search Minerals, 2017).

The net revenue of seven payable REEs was calculated and then divided by grade to generate an NSR factor for resource reporting.  These NSR factors represent revenue per oxide grade unit  (US$/kg  Dy2O3,  for  example),  and  are  independent  of  grade.    Key  assumptions  are summarized in Tables 14-10 and 14-11.

Note:

- 1. Open pit mining is reported at pit discard cut-off, which excludes mining costs

These  NSR  factors  were  applied  to  assay  grades  to  help  interpret  the  mineralized  zone outlines on drill sections, which were used to generate the mineralized zone wireframes.  A minimum NSR of C$140/t was used to select drill hole assay intercepts.  These intercepts were then interpreted on drill sections.

The NSR factors were used to calculate an NSR value (C$/t) for each block in the block model, which was compared directly to unit operating costs required to mine that block (Table 14-11). All classified resource blocks located within the mineralized wireframe domains and above the resource pit shell with NSR values greater than C$140/t were included in the open pit resource estimate.  All classified resource blocks located within the mineralized wireframe domains and outside of the resource pit shell were not included in the resource estimate.  Resource blocks within the pit shell exhibited good continuity within the wireframes.

In RPA's opinion, an NSR cut-off value of C$140/t (rounded) is suitable for an open pit mining scenario.

## BULK DENSITY

To convert volume to tonnes, a simplified lithological model, with the identical footprint as the block model, was created in Leapfrog with the following rock types: Comendite, Anorthosite, NPR, Pantellerite, and Mafic/Ultramafic (Figure 14-11).  A bulk density factor was assigned for each lithology  by  determining  the  mean  value  of  each  rock  type  from  bulk  density  testing

<!-- image -->

carried out on the drill core and channel samples by Search Minerals from 2014 to 2018.  Each block in the model was coded with the lithology rock type by majority rules.  Overburden was not  modelled  as  the  deposit  is  exposed  at  surface.    Resource  bulk  density  statistics  are summarized in Table 14-12.

## BLOCK MODEL

The Leapfrog block model is made up of 200 columns, 220 rows, and 80 levels for 3,520,000 blocks.  The model origin (lower-left corner at highest elevation) is at UTM Grid Zone 21N, NAD83 591,000 m E, 5,804050 m N and 135 m elevation.  The block model is not rotated, and each block is 5 m (x) by 2.5 m (y) by 5 m (z).  A whole block model is used, and resource domains and other geology codes are assigned by majority rules.  The block model contains the following information:

- · domain identifiers with mineralized zone and lithology;
- · estimated grades of seven payable REEs inside the resource domain wireframes;
- · NSR estimates calculated from block grades and related economic and metallurgical assumptions;
- · the percentage volume of each block within the mineralization wireframes;
- · tonnage factors, in tonnes per cubic metre, specific to each rock type;
- · the distance to the closest composite used to interpolate the block grade;
- · the number of composites used to interpolate the block grade;
- · the average distance to composite used to interpolate the block grade; and
- · the resource classification of each block.

## CLASSIFICATION

Definitions for resource categories used in this report are consistent with those defined by CIM (2014) and adopted by NI 43-101.  In the CIM classification, a Mineral Resource is defined as 'a concentration or occurrence of solid material of economic interest in or on the Earth's crust in such form, grade or quality and quantity that there are reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction.'  Mineral Resources are classified into Measured, Indicated, and Inferred categories, according to the confidence level in the estimated blocks.

RPA classified the Deep Fox Mineral Resource as Indicated and Inferred based on drill hole and surface channel spacing, the reliability of data, and geological confidence in the continuity of grade (Figure 14-12).  The overall geological continuity of the Deep Fox deposit is consistent in the plane of the mineralization.  The grade continuity is also consistent, with high grades confined to the pantellerite units, moderate grades in comendite and pegmatite, and low grade within mafic/ultramafic rocks.  The consistent nature of the mineralization, for both the grade

<!-- image -->

and geological continuity, would normally provide sufficient confidence to allow classification of most of the Mineral Resources as Indicated.

Composites located within the wireframes were plotted on an inclined south-looking section in the  dip  plane  of  the  mineralized  wireframes  and  reviewed  for  their  spatial  distribution  and spacing.    Where  RPA  deemed  that  the  spacing  was  insufficient  to  establish  grade  and geological continuity with confidence (generally &gt;50 m), the Mineral Resource was classified as Inferred.  In addition, only the start or 'collar' of the surface channel samples had a location coordinate taken by a hand-held field GPS.  No elevation data has been collected, or any additional location information for the channel samples, and confidence in the accuracy and precision  of  the  location  of  channel  samples  is  not  high.    For  this  reason,  RPA  classified shallow blocks within approximately 50 m of the surface as Inferred.

## BLOCK MODEL VALIDATION

RPA carried out a number of block model validation procedures including:

- 1. Visual comparisons of block NSR, Nd, Pr, Eu, Dy, Er, Lu, and versus composite grades.
- 2. Statistical comparisons of Nd, Pr, and Dy.
- 3. Comparison of the volumes of the wireframe models to the block model volume results.
- 4. Trend plots of block and composite NSR, Nd, Pr, and Dy
- 5. Comparison  of  Nd,  Pr,  and  Dy  block  and  composite  grades  in  blocks  containing composites.

Block model grades were visually examined and compared with composite grades in cross section and in elevation plans.  RPA found grade continuity to be reasonable and confirmed that  the  block  grades  were  reasonably  consistent  with  local  drill  hole  and  channel  sample assay and composite grades.

Grade statistics for Nd, Pr, and Dy assays, composites, and resource blocks were examined and compared for the resource wireframe models as shown in Table 14-14 and Figures 1413,  14-14,  and  14-15.    The  comparisons  of  average  grades  of  length  weighted  assays, composites, and blocks are reasonable in RPA's opinion.

## SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS

The open pit resources were reported using a C$140/t NSR cut-off value based on the metal prices in Table 14-10 and costs in Table 14-11.

Open Pit Mineral Resources at Deep Fox are not highly sensitive to the NSR cut-off value. Table 14-15 presents the grade and tonnage at various NSR cut-off values and Figure 14-16

illustrates the grade-tonnage curve for the Deep Fox

## 25 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS

The Project is located approximately 47 km east-southeast of Port Hope Simpson, Labrador, and approximately two kilometres northeast of St. Lewis, Labrador.  It is located in the Fox Harbour Volcanic Belt which also contains Search Minerals' Foxtrot deposit and numerous other REE prospects and targets.

A significant REE deposit has been delineated at the Project.  The majority of the high grade mineralization occurs  within steeply dipping packages  of  pantellerite. The  resource wireframes, which were interpreted at a nominal cut-off NSR value of C$140/t, consist of three steeply dipping zones:  Hanging Wall Zone, a higher grade and more extensive Footwall Zone, and a smaller, deeper high grade Deep Zone.  Pantellerite is the most common lithology within the resource wireframes.  Statistical analysis of the resource assays shows that there is a bimodal  distribution  of  REEs  within  the  Deep  Fox  deposit,  with  higher  grade  generally corresponding to the Footwall Zone and moderate grades corresponding to the Hanging Wall Zone.

The mineralization is steeply dipping (&gt; 80°), with a strike length of approximately 725 m at an azimuth of 275°.  The understanding of the Project geology and mineralization, together with the procedures for drilling, sampling, collection of data, assaying, and QA/QC carried out by Search Minerals have produced a drill hole database that is acceptable for Mineral Resource estimation, in the opinion of RPA.  Results from 54 drill holes and channels to September 26, 2019 have been used by RPA to estimate Mineral Resources.

The Mineral Resource estimate is reported on the basis of a possible open pit mining scenario using an NSR cut-off value of C$140/t.  RPA considers that open pit material with NSR values greater  than  C$140/t  meets  the  requirement  of  CIM  (2014)  that  Mineral  Resources  have reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction.

Open pit Indicated Mineral Resources are estimated to total 2.3 Mt at 403 ppm Pr, 1,486 ppm Nd, and 206 ppm Dy, and open pit Inferred Mineral Resources are estimated to total 3.9 Mt at 357 ppm Pr, 1,323 ppm Nd, and 181 ppm Dy.  The level of confidence in the data is not high enough to classify any resource as Measured.  Definitions for resource categories used in this report are consistent with those defined by CIM (2014) and adopted by NI 43-101.

There has not been a previous Mineral Resource estimate on the Project.

The Deep Fox deposit is open at depth.  Current drilling suggests that the resource shows good grade continuity with depth, with no notable decrease in grade down dip.

## 26 RECOMMENDATIONS

RPA has the following recommendations for the Deep Fox Project:

- · Continue diamond drilling on the Project to define the physical limits of the deposit. Further drilling should be completed to follow the high grade mineralization at depth down plunge below -100 m, and below the surface channel samples at the western part of the Deep Fox mineralized zones.
- · In order to bring the confidence level of the resource to Indicated:
- o Carry out infill drilling at the periphery of wireframes;
- o Complete  a  topographical  survey  over  the  deposit  and  survey  all  surface channels.
- · Resume the regular submission of blank material with regular drill core and surface channel samples.
- · Include selected half core samples (field duplicates) in the duplicate sampling protocol.
- · Work with an assay laboratory to develop CRMs with REE grades similar to those found at the Project.  Alternatively, commercial CRMs can be used.
- · Implement a QA monitoring system used to detect failed batches, and in turn, identify sample batches for reanalysis.
- · Continue exploration of high grade REE prospects in the area.
