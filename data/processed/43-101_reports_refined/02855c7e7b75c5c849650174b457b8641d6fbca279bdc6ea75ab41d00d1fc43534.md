## Executive Summary

On March 22, 2016,  the  Company  announced  a  name  change  from Western Lithium  USA  Corp. (WLC) to Lithium Americas Corp. (LAC or the Company) and the name of its Nevada-based wholly owned subsidiary  was  changed  to  Lithium  Nevada  Corp.  (LNC)  from Western  Lithium  Corp.  The name  of  the  Kings  Valley  project  was  changed  to  the  Lithium  Nevada  project.  The  reader  is reminded  that  in  this  report  any  reference  to  Western  Lithium  Corp.  (WLC)  or  the  Kings  Valley project, is in fact now Lithium Americas Corp. (LAC) and Lithium Nevada project.

The  LAC  News  Release  of  March  22,  2016  further  announced  that  the  Company  was  in  the process  of  preparing  an  updated  preliminary  feasibility  study  and  that  its  pre-feasibility  study completed in March 2012 was no longer current and the Company would no longer be relying on the study for its project development planning. This report is meant to act as a status update to the current state of LAC's Lithium Nevada project (the Project), and includes an NI 43-101 compliant resource statement for both the Stage I and Stage II deposits.

## Property Location, Description and Ownership

The Project is located in Humboldt County, Nevada, USA approximately 100 km north-northwest of Winnemucca; 70 km north from Winnemucca along US Highway 95 to Orovada and then 33 km west-northwest of Orovada on paved State Highway 293.

LAC owns the Lith, Beta, BPE, Neutron, Neutron Plus 1 and Neutron R claims that encompass five areas  of  lithium  mineralization.  These  five  areas  are  covered  by  approximately  2,500  federal unpatented claims over an area of approximately 15,233 hectares. The Project site has been the subject of various early stage exploration programs. However, there has been no mine development or production within the Project area boundaries, and therefore no mine workings or mill tailings are present on the property. There have been three areas of focus for the Lithium Nevada project as follows:  (i)  the  Stage  I  Lens  (formerly  PCD  Lens),  which  is  entirely  included  within  219  federal unpatented claims and covers an area of approximately 1,468 hectares (ha); (ii) the Stage II Lens (formerly the South Lens); and (iii) the organoclay operations.

## Geology and Mineralization

The  Lithium  Nevada  project  is  situated  within  the  south  end  of  the  McDermitt  caldera  located  in Humboldt County, Nevada. It lies within a well-preserved Miocene collapse structure in northwestern Nevada  near  the  southern  Oregon  border.  The  lithium  deposits  occur  within  sedimentary  and volcano-sedimentary rocks in the moat of  a resurgent caldera. The  extent and nature  of the host rocks is well documented and understood. Several lenses of mineralization have been identified in this region, though the focus of the Project is on the southern Stage I and Stage II Lenses.

The Stage I Lens is the southernmost and smallest of the mineralized lenses in the area. The lens is composed  of  an  approximately  3  to  5  m  thick  layer  of  alluvium  underlain  by  lithium-enriched interbedded claystones, ash-rich clays and ash layers up to 60 to 90 m thick in the northwest and southwest  ends  of  the  Project  area.  These  claystone-ash  layers  thin  in  the  middle  of  proposed potential, pit coinciding with faulting and a predominance of brown-black basalts. Interbedded basalts occur fairly shallowly in the northwest end of the pit and are found deeper in the southeast end. The lithium-rich beds with higher lithium concentrations (&gt;4,000 ppm) are generally found deeper in the deposit (below 30 m). The base of the deposit varies across the Project area averaging between 68 to 90 m and is marked by an obvious transition to an oxidized silicified claystone and ash layer.

Exploration drilling by LAC has resulted in identifying clay-rich sequences with lithium concentrations exceeding  those  in  previous  studies.  In  the  Project  area  clays  and  clay/ashes  are  disseminated throughout  the  deposit,  but  the  highest  lithium  concentrations  are  broadly  found  between  36  and 67 m below ground surface (bgs).

The  Stage  II  Lens  is  located  approximately  10  km  NNW  of  the  Stage  I  Lens,  the  southernmost lithium mineralized lens in the area.  The Stage II mineralized beds are comprised mainly of a dark green claystone,  at  times  intercalated  with  arkose  beds;  in  the  NE  region  of  the  modeled  area  a fanglomerate body is present. Lithium-rich beds are generally 10 to 60 m thick in most areas, and defined with Li grades greater than 1,500 ppm. Alluvium cover is variable, ranging from no cover at all to a maximum of about 6 m. At the Stage II Lens, the continuity of the mineralization has been confirmed by drilling at spacings at a nominal 200 m, with a smaller area drilled at about 40 m line spacings.

For  both  the  Stage  I  and  II  Lenses,  mineralization  consists  of  layered  beds  of  lithium-bearing clay-rich  volcaniclastic  sedimentary  rocks.  The  main  lithium-bearing  mineral  is  reported  to  be  a magnesium clay mineral that includes the Hectorite and Illite group. Hectorite, is a rare Li-Mg clay mineral  of  the  smectite  group.  The  beds  exhibit  very  good  geological  lateral  continuity  over kilometers, as shown by drill holes spaced on the order of 500 m. The thickness of mineralization varies from less than a meter to more than 90 m with typical intercepts of about 30 m. The extent of mineralization is well known.

A  report  entitled  Geochemical  Characterization  Program  (Tetra  Tech  2011),  summarizes  the x-ray diffraction  (XRD)  and  mineralogical  analysis,  showing  that  the  highest  lithium  concentrations are associated with the mineral illite, a non-expanding dioctahedral clay, which is the dominant clay mineral at deeper depths, about 36 to 60 m. The clay minerals at shallow depths (beginning at about 30 m bgs are identified as a smectite clay. At greater depths, the dominant clay mineral is identified as illite. A thin transition layer composed of a mixed illite/smectite exists between the two dominant clay minerals. This mineralogical work is based on using six drillholes all within the proposed pit.

## Deposit Type

To date, there are no analogous deposits in operation worldwide. The hectorite deposits at Hector, California have similar mineralogy, but the geological setting is significantly different.

These  deposits  are  believed  to  have  formed  by  hydrothermal  alteration  of  layered  volcaniclastic sedimentary  rocks.  What  is  not  clear  is  whether  the  alteration  was  essentially  syngenetic  with deposition of the sedimentary rocks or whether the alteration is a post depositional event. Additional work is required to resolve the origin of these deposits.

## Mineral Resource Estimate

## Stage I

In December 2010, LAC engaged Reserva International LLC (Reserva or Timothy Carew), to provide a  block-model  based  mineral  resource  estimate  for  the  Project.  The  current  mineral  resource estimate was developed with the LAC drillhole database available as of June  28, 2011. LAC has drilled and assayed 198 core holes, totaling 19,563 m. The resources are reported using a lithium cut-off  of  2000  ppm.  Lithium  carbonate  is  the  primary  product  with  potassium sulfate  and  sodium sulfate as by-products.

Volcaniclastic  moat  sedimentary rocks that contain lithium-rich claystone control the  Stage I Lens mineralization. Sectional interpretations (E-W and N-S) were generated from drill logs for alluvium, claystone  (moat  sediments),  volcanics  and  basalt,  a  silicified  unit,  and  bedrock.  Two  oxidation surfaces  were  also  interpreted,  one  just  below  alluvium  and  another  near  the  claystone/silicified interface.  Additionally,  a  series  of  faults  have  been  interpreted  based  on  the  drillhole  data  and incorporated into the geologic interpretation. The potentially economic mineralized estimation domain is the claystone. The alluvium and bedrock material have no lithium or potassium grades.

The mineral resources have been classified according to the CIM Standards on Mineral Resources and Reserves: Definitions and Guidelines ( May, 2014). Stage I Lens resources are shown in Table 1. SRK is of the opinion that at a nominal cut-off grade of 2,000 ppm (0.20%), the Stage I Lens has reasonable prospects for economic extraction by open-pit mining. Rounding errors occur in Table 1 and the contained metal does not account for mine or metallurgical recovery. To convert from Li% to Li  ppm, multiply the percent value by 10,000. The conversion factor from Li% to lithium carbonate equivalent (LCE) is 5.323. This factor is determined as follows:

## molecular weight Li2CO3 = (2 × 6.941) + (12.011) + (3 ×15.9994) = 5.323

molecular weight 2 x Li                              ( 2 × 6.941)

Notes:

- 1. Mineral resources are not mineral reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability. There is no certainty that all or any part of the mineral resource will be converted into mineral reserves.
- 2. Resources presented at a Li% 0.20 cut-off grade which was determined using the following economic assumptions: US$3.36  Li  carbonate/lb;  87.2%  metallurgical  recovery;  US$66/tonne  ore  processed;  US$2.75/tonne  material moved.

## Stage II

GeoSystems Internationsl (GSI) was engaged to complete a review of the exploration work on the Stage  II  area  of  the  Lithium  Nevada  project  and  has  developed  a  lithium  and  potassium  mineral resource estimate that conforms to Canadian National Instrument 43-101, Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects of the Canadian Securities Administrators.

The  resource  estimate  was  completed  by  Mr.  Mario  E.  Rossi,  CIM,  FAusIMM,  SME,  IAMG,  and Principal  Geostatistician  of  GSI.  Mr.  Rossi  is  an  independent  Qualified  Person  as  defined  by NI 43-101 by reason of education, affiliation with a professional association (as defined in NI 43-101) and past relevant work experience.

Table 2 presents the in-situ Li and K mineral resources for the Stage II Lens area, Lithium Nevada property, at a cut-off grade of 0.20% Li. The potassium (K) grade is considered a by-product of the Li

resource.  An  average  in-situ  dry  density  of  1.96  t/m 3   for  the  mineralized  volume  was  used  as tonnage factor.

GSI is of the opinion that the exploration potential exists at the Stage II Lens to increase the current resource estimate.

Notes:

- 1. Rounding errors may exist.
- 2. Contained metal does not allow for mine or metallurgical recovery. Tonnage factor used is 1.96 t/m . 3
- 3. Economic assumptions do not include any potassium credits.
- 4. Conversion factor from Li metal to lithium carbonate equivalent (LCE) used is 5.323. Economic assumptions for cut-off grade determination are: US$3.50 Li carbonate/lb; 60% metallurgical recovery; US$50/tonne ore processed; US$2.20/tonne material moved.

There are no known environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, socio-economic, marketing, and political  or  other  relevant  issues  that  may  materially  affect  the  resource  estimate.  Other  relevant factors that  may  materially  affect  the  resource  estimate,  including  mining,  metallurgical,  and infrastructure are well understood according to the assumptions presented in the Stage II Resource Estimate.

## Mineral Processing and Metallurgical Recovery

The 2012 prefeasibility study (Tetra Tech 2012) concluded that it would be necessary to perform a continuous small pilot scale operation in support of a feasibility study. Owing to this recommendation, LAC built a demonstration plant to prove the process and demonstrate continuous production for the manufacture of battery  grade  lithium  carbonate  from the  hectorite  clay.  LAC  contracted  with  URS and K-UTEC Salt Technologies (K-UTEC) to prepare a report titled: Western Lithium Demonstration Plant Basic Engineering Report, dated December 2013.

The demonstration plant was initiated in 2014. Preliminary results from the plant suggest a different cost structure and project economics than what was assumed in the prefeasibility study completed in March 2012 (Tetra Tech 2012). Furthermore, LAC has decided to re-evaluate the current process design criteria and consider changing the process design accordingly. LAC has determined that its prefeasibility study (Tetra Tech 2012) is no longer current and LAC will no longer be relying on the study for its project development planning.

Additional  work on mineral processing and metallurgical recovery is ongoing, with the objective of defining the correct processing requirements for the Lithium Nevada project. Future study updates will be required to incorporate the results of the ongoing work.

## Conclusions and Recommendations

The  resource  statements  presented  above,  and  in  further  detail  in  section  13  are  considered reasonable and NI 43-101 compliant. An updated review of the mineral processing and metallurgical recovery work is ongoing, and the results of this work will need to be updated and included in future resource statements. The effect of these results is not defined at this time.

## 2 Reliance on Other Experts

## 2.1 Mineral Tenure Property

In respect of the discussion regarding mineral tenure to the property set forth in Section 3, the qualified persons have relied entirety and without independent investigation, on the title opinion of Richard Harris, an  attorney  with  Harris  &amp;  Thompson,  dated  February  6,  2013,  as  updated  and  supplemented  by  the updated title opinion of Mr. Harris, dated April 28, 2014. The relevant sections of the report to which this applies are included in Section 3.

## 3 Property Description and Location

Disclosure regarding mineral tenure to the Lithium Nevada Property is based on the title opinion of Harris &amp;  Thompson,  Nevada,  counsel  for  LAC.  This  opinion  is  limited  to  Sections  3.1  through  3.4.  Qualified Persons have relied on that opinion entirely, without independent investigation.

## 3.1 Property Area and Location

The Lithium Nevada  Property comprises an area of approximately  15,233  ha  within  Humboldt  County, Nevada,  that  is  approximately  100  km  north-northwest  of  Winnemucca  and  33  km  west-northwest  of Orovada, Nevada (centered on 40°42°27.24'N Latitude, 118°3°26.81'W). Situated in a remote section of northern Nevada, the Lithium Nevada Property consists primarily of sparsely populated ranch land within, and surrounded by, Bureau of Land Management (BLM) lands on the northwest, western and southern sections of the McDermitt caldera. A small number of LAC's claims are located, and registered, in Miller County,  Oregon.  Five  areas  of  significant  lithium  mineralization  have  been  identified  on  the  Lithium Nevada Property - the Stage I Lens (PCD), Stage II Lens (South), Stage III Lens (South Central), Stage IV Lens (North Central), and Stage V Lens (North). To date LAC has focused its efforts on the Stage I Lens (formerly referred to as the PCD Lens), with limited work having been conducted at the Stage II Lens location. Figure 3.1 shows Project location and property boundary.

The Stage I and Stage II Lens, being approximately 1,468 hectares, and 2,431 acres, respectively, are situated:

- · with respect to the Stage I Lens, at the southern end of the McDermitt caldera in T44N, R35E within Sections 3,4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 16, and 17 and on the USGS Thacker Pass at 7.5 min quadrangle at an approximate elevation of 1,500 m; and
- · with respect to the Stage II Lens, in Township 45 North, Rangy 34 East, Sections 2 and 13; Township 46 North, Range 34 East, Sections 11 and 27.

## 3.2 Mineral Tenure

The underlying title to the Lithium Nevada Property is held through a series of unpatented mining claims (Ums). LAC holds its interests in the UMs indirectly through wholly-owned subsidiaries. UMs provide the holder with the rights to all locatable minerals on the relevant property, which includes lithium; however, this interest remains subject to the paramount title of the federal government who maintains fee simple title on the land.

The holder of an UM maintains a perpetual entitlement to the UM, provided it meets the obligations for UMs as required by the Mining Act. At this time, the principal obligation imposed on the holders of UMs is to pay an annual fee, which represents payment in lieu of assessment work required under the Mining Act. The annual fee of US$140.00 per claim is payable to the BLM in addition to a fee of US$10.50 per claim paid to the county recorder of the relevant county in Nevada (or, in a small number of cases, Oregon) where the UM is located. UM holders record annually an Affidavit and Notice of Intent to Hold.

An UM does not, on its own, give the holder the right to extract and sell locatable minerals, as there are numerous  other  regulatory  approvals  and  permits  required  as  part  of  this  process.  In  Nevada,  such approvals and permits include approval of a plan of operations by the BLM and environmental approvals. The Mining Act also does not explicitly authorize the owner of an UM to sell minerals that are leasable under the Mineral Lands Leasing Act of 1920, as amended (the MLLA), which includes potassium and sodium. The BLM is vested with a great deal of discretion in the management of the right to sell minerals governed by the MLLA, particularly where they represent a potential by-product to an economically viable mineral deposit governed by the Mining Act. LAC has initiated discussions with BLM to determine what, if any, contractual or regulatory approvals will be required to sell upgraded potassium sulfate and sodium sulfate as by-products to lithium production and to confirm LAC's priority to such approvals, but the matter has not been determined.

The  foregoing  UMs  are  located  in  Section  13,  T.  44  N.,  R.  34  E.;  Sections  1-24,  T.  44  N.,  R.  35  E.; Sections 5-8 and 17-18, T. 44 N., R. 36 E.; Sections 1-5, 8-17, 20-25, 27-28 and 34-36, T. 45 N., R. 34 E.; Sections 24-26, 30 and 35-36, T. 45 N., R. 35 E.; Sections 3-8, 16, 21, 29-32, T. 45 N., R. 36 E.; Sections 1-3, 5, 8-19, 21-28 and 34-36 T. 46 N., R. 34 E.; Sections 33 and 34, T. 46 N., R. 36 E.; Sections 1-4, 9-11, 13-16, 20-23, 25-29 and 32-35, T. 47 N., R. 34 E.; Sections 21-22, 27-29 and 33, T. 47 N., R. 36 E.; and Section 34, T. 48 N., R. 34 E., MDM.

The  UMs  have  been  located  in  accordance  with  applicable  state  and  federal  law,  and  are  valid  and defensible, with the exception of a single claim that is not material to any of: (i) the Stage I deposit; (ii) the Stage II deposit; or (iii) Lithium Nevada Property as a whole. Counsel has identified that LAC shares title to Moonlight #1 and Uravada 17-22 and 24.

## 3.3 Nature and Extent of Interest and Title

Lithium Nevada Corporation (LNC, formerly Western Lithium Corporation) is a Nevada corporation that is currently a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Canadian-based Lithium Americas Corp (LAC, formerly WLC). Pursuant  to  an  agreement  signed  on  December  20,  2007  between  Western  Energy  Development Corporation ('WEDC'), a subsidiary of Western Uranium Corporation, and WLC (which was then also a subsidiary of Western Uranium Corporation), WEDC leased to WLC the Lith and Neutron claims for the purpose of lithium exploration and exploitation (the 'Lease').

On March 22, 2016, the Company announced a name change from Western Lithium USA Corp. to Lithium Americas  Corp.  (LAC)  and  the  name  of  its  Nevada-based  wholly  owned  subsidiary  was  changed  to Lithium Nevada Corp. from Western Lithium Corp. The name of the Kings Valley project was changed to Lithium Nevada project.

The agreement granted LNC exclusive rights to explore, develop, and mine or otherwise produce any and all lithium deposits discovered on the claims, subject to royalty payments. The leased area, at that time, included the entirety of the Stage I and Stage II Lens and included 1,378 claims that covered over 11,000 ha. Lithium deposits to be exploited included, but were not limited to, deposits of amblygonite, eucryptite, hectorite, lepidolite, petalite, spodumene and bentonitic clays. Rights to all other mineral types, including base and precious metals, uranium, vanadium and uranium- or vanadium-bearing materials or ores were expressly reserved by WEDC.

The term of that lease agreement was 30 years and granted to LNC the exclusive right to purchase the unpatented mining claims comprising a designated discovery, subject to the royalty and other rights to be reserved  by  WEDC  and  subject  to  LNC  obligations  under  the  deed  to  be  executed  and  delivered  by WEDC on the closing of the option (PAEE URS 2010). In July, 2008, LNC ceased to be wholly-owned by Western Uranium Corporation and became an independent publicly traded company.

Effective  February  4,  2011,  Western  Uranium  Corporation,  WEDC,  LAC  and  LNC  entered  into  an agreement  for  the  purchase  by  LNC  from  WEDC  of  the  royalties  and  titles  for  the  Lithium  Nevada Property.

In March 2011, the parties completed the transaction for the sale by WEDC to LNC of the royalties and titles constituting all of the Lithium Nevada Property. As a result of this transaction, the existing lease and royalty  arrangements  between  the  two  companies  on  the  Lithium  Nevada  Property,  including  the  net smelter  returns  and  net  profits  royalties  on  any  lithium  project  that  the  company  developed,  were terminated. LAC holds, indirectly, control and full ownership of the Lithium Nevada Property mining claims and leases,  excluding  a  gold  exploration  target  (on  the  Albisu  property)  and  a  20%  royalty  granted  by WEDC to Cameco Global Exploration II Ltd solely in respect of uranium (the 'Uranium Royalty').

The UMs which are subject to the Lease authorize LNC to develop and mine minerals which are subject to location under the Mining Law of 1872, as amended. The Mining Law does not explicitly authorize the owner  of  an  unpatented  mining  claim  to  sell  minerals,  which  are  minerals  that  are  leasable  under  the Mineral Lands Leasing Act of 1920, as amended. LNC has initiated discussions with the BLM to determine the legislative and regulatory authority for its processing and sale of the potassium sulphate which will be a by-product of LNC's production of lithium which is a mineral locatable under the Mining Law of 1872. The matter has not been formally determined.

## 3.4 Royalties, Rights and Payments

In addition to the Uranium Royalty and those national, state and local rates identified in 3.3, the Lithium Nevada Property is subject to the following royalties, back-in rights, payments, and encumbrances:

- · Orion Mine Finance Fund I (f.n.a RK Mine Finance (Master) Fund II L.P.) has a gross revenue royalty on  the  Lithium  Nevada  Property  in  the  amount  of  8%  of  gross  revenue  until  aggregate  royalty payments equal US$22 million have been paid, at with time the royal will be reduced to 4.0% of the gross revenue on all minerals mined, produced or otherwise recovered. LNC can at any time elect to reduce the rate of the royalty to 1.75% on notice and payment of US$22 million to Orion;
- · R. McClintick and K. McClintick, Trustees of the Rick and Keel, E. McClintick Living Trust, hold a net smelter  return  royalty  of  1.5%  on  production  from  the  U  17-20  UMs.  The  royalty  provides  for  an advance payment of US$1,785 annually, which payments will be credited against royalty payments otherwise payable; and
- · Uravada  LLC  holds  a  net  smelter  return  royalty  of  3.0%  on  production  from  the  U  21-22,  24,  44, Uravada 23, 25-30, 46-56 (even), and 61-69 UMs. The royalty provides for an advance payment of US$50,000 annually, which payments will be credited against royalty payments otherwise payable.

## 3.5 Environmental Liabilities

Other than an accrued decommissioning obligation at the Stage I Lens of approximately US$170,000, no environmental liabilities are known to exist at the Lithium Nevada Property.

## 3.6 Permitting

The Stage I Lens has been the subject of various early stage exploration programs. However, there has been no historical mine development or production within the project area boundaries, and therefore no mine workings or mill tailings are present at the Stage I Lens. LAC holds a current exploration permit in good standing, and has done so in each year since 2006, and also holds all necessary federal and state permits and approvals to conduct exploration activities at the Stage I Lens.

A plan of operations (PoO) was submitted to the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the Nevada Division  of  Environmental  Protection  (NDEP)  in  May  2008  for  an  extensive  drilling  and  trenching exploration  program  to  further  delineate  the  resources  of  the  Stage  I  Lens.  That  action  included preparation  of  an  environmental  assessment.  A  revision  to  the  PoO  was  filed  in  November  2009  and approved in January 2010.

March 7, 2014, the BLM issued a DR and Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) for LAC's Lithium Nevada Mine Final EA.

On  May  1,  2014,  and  in  accordance  with  43  CFR  3809  Surface  Management  Regulations,  the  BLM authorized LAC to proceed with clay extraction according to its Final Plan of Operations and Reclamation Plan. On April 29, 2014, the NDEP Bureau of Mining Regulation and Reclamation (BMRR) concurrently approved LAC's Final Plan of Operations and issued a Final Reclamation Permit. On April 28, 2014, the MSHA assigned the Kings Valley Clay Mine operation an MSHA Mine Identification Number. On April 10, 2014, the Humboldt County Regional Planning Commission unanimously approved LAC's Conditional Use Permit, allowing the development of an open pit to extract clay.

LAC has documentation supporting its rights to the lithium mineralization within the Stage II Lens and that all appropriate permits for exploration have been obtained.

Development of the project would include on-site infrastructure development including the mine, process plant, tailings impoundments, and ancillary facilities. The project requires multiple permits and approvals from  regulatory  agencies  and  other  entities  at  the  federal,  state  and  local  levels.  Lithium  Nevada  has completed  baseline  studies  for  geochemistry,  vegetation,  wildlife  (including  extensive  studies  for  the Greater Sage-grouse), surface and groundwater quality and quantity,  wetlands  and  waters of the U.S.,

seep and springs; soils, cultural resources, noise, visual analysis, weather monitoring, and other issues specific  to  the  Lithium  Nevada  project  area.  The  collected  baseline  study  data  will  support  the  overall permitting  and  approval  process  for  the  proposed  project,  and  the  completion  of  the  required  National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) environmental study.

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) in September 2015 determined that listing the sage-grouse was not warranted under the Endangered Species Act. Concurrently, the BLM finalized their Land Use Plan Amendment (LUPA) that helps to conserve greater sage-grouse habitat. The BLM still considers the sage-grouse to be a special status species. The BLM Winnemucca District LUPA designates the Lithium Nevada Stage 1 Property as a Priority Habitat Management Area (PHMA) and also designates the Lithium Nevada Stages 2-5 Property as PHMA, but within a Sagebrush focal area (SFA). SFAs are more sensitive areas within the PHMAs. The BLM recently initiated steps to withdraw SFA-designated lands from location and entry under the United States mining laws, subject to valid existing rights. An immediate segregation, which lasts up to two years (with an option for a two year extension) until the Secretary decides whether to make the withdrawal permanent, prohibits the location of any new mining claims in the designated areas. Lithium Nevada has over 2,500 mining claims within and surrounding the Lithium Nevada project Stages 1-5, including those within the SFA, which have valid existing rights. Lithium Nevada anticipates that it will be  required  by  BLM  to  implement  varying  stages  of  mitigation  measures  for  sage-grouse  habitat throughout development of its Lithium Nevada property. Lithium Nevada understands that the BLM can impose conditions on access, project design, and periods of use where needed to limit impacts to sagegrouse habitat. Lithium Nevada understands that if it files notices of intent to operate or applications for plans of operation for Stages 2-5, BLM may require a validity exam for some or all of the mining claims associated with Stages 2-5. Further, due to the requirement of a validity exam in Stages 2-5 areas, there is a risk that development may be subject to time delays or restrictions or mitigation measures in order to address sage-grouse habitat protection that could compromise  the economic  viability of future development of the Lithium Nevada Property. It is SRK's understanding that LAC intends to continue to build  on  existing  partnerships  with  the  BLM,  Nevada  Department  of  Wildlife,  and  State  of  Nevada Sagebrush Ecosystem Technical Team to identify lasting conservation efforts and productive mitigation.

## 3.7 Other Factors or Risks

SRK is not aware of any other significant factors or risks that may affect access, title, or the right or ability to perform work on the property.

## 3.8 Conclusions

Based  on  information  provided  to,  or  researched  and  reviewed  by  SRK  as  a  part  of  this  NI  43-101 Technical  Report,  LAC  is  approved  by  the  BLM  and  the  NDEP  BMRR  to  conduct  mineral  exploration activities at the Lithium Nevada Property in accordance with PoO No. N85255.

As  discussed  above,  LAC  has  initiated  the  process  to  obtain  all  necessary  federal,  state  and  local regulatory agency permits and approvals for the proposed Project.

## 4 Accessibility,  Climate,  Local  Resources,  Infrastructure,  and Physiography

## 4.1 Accessibility

Access to the Stage I area of the project is via the paved US Highway 95, traveling approximately 70 km north from Winnemucca, Nevada, to Orovada and then heading west-northwest for 33 km on paved State Highway 293 toward Thacker Pass to the Project site entrance. On-site access is via several gravel and dirt roads established during the exploration phase.

Access to Stage II area of the project is also via U.S. Highway 95, 100 km north from Winnemucca to Orovada and then approximately 40 km WNW on paved State Highway 293 to the project area. On-site access is via numerous gravel and dirt roads, including the last 10 km from State Highway 293.

## 4.2 Climate

Northern Nevada has a high desert climate with cold winters (average minimum -3°C in January) and hot summers (up to 35-40°C). Snow is expected from October to May, although it often melts quickly. Other operations in northern Nevada operate continuously through the winter.

## 4.3 Local Resources

Because of the large-scale  mining  industry  in  the  Winnemucca  area,  local  resources  include  all  of  the amenities required for large-scale mining. The area is about 50 km north of the now depleted Sleeper gold mine and 100 km northwest of Twin Creeks, Turquoise Ridge and Getchell gold mines. Additionally, there are  several  other  gold  and  copper  mines  in  the  area  which  could  provide  potential  access  to  an experienced workforce and adequate support for mining operations. Most of the workforce may have to be sourced in Winnemucca because of the sparse population in the project area.

## 4.4 Infrastructure

The existing roads are maintained by the Nevada Department of Transportation and are in good repair. The roads are all-season roads but may be closed for short periods due to extreme weather during the winter season. The nearest railroad access is in Winnemucca.

Adequate electrical power is available and currently there is a 115 kV power line that passes through the property. Work during the 2012 study (Tetra Tech 2012) has determined this power source to be suitable for  meeting  the  project  electrical  demands  for  Case  1.  Water  rights  have  been  attained  by  LAC.  The results  of  an  independent  groundwater  study  conducted  by  Schlumberger Water  Services  USA  Inc.  in 2013 concluded that process water for the project would be sourced at the project site and from an off-site source  in  the  Quinn  River  Valley.  It  is  noted  that  additional  investigation  regarding  the  source  and availability of water resources is recommended.

There is sufficient space within the current Stage I Lens site to accommodate processing plant and mine support facilities, overburden placement site, TSF water diversions, and containments (see Figure 3.1).

## 4.5 Physiography

The  Project  site  sits  at  the  southern  end  of  Montana  Mountains,  with  its  western  border  at  the  divide between the Kings River Valley and Quinn River Valley. Vegetation consists of low lying sagebrush and grasslands. Elevation at the project site is approximately 1,500 m above sea level.

## 5 History

On March 22, 2016, the Company announced a name change from Western Lithium USA Corp. (WLC) to Lithium Americas Corp. (LAC) and the name of its Nevada-based wholly owned subsidiary was changed to Lithium Nevada Corp. from Western Lithium Corp. The name of the Kings Valley project was changed to  Lithium  Nevada project. The reader is reminded that in this report any reference to Western Lithium Corp. (WLC) or the Kings Valley project, is in fact now Lithium Americas Corp. (LAC) and Lithium Nevada project.

## 5.1 Exploration History

In  1975  Chevron  USA  began  an  exploration  program  for  uranium  in  the  sediments  of  the  McDermitt caldera which encompassed the entire caldera. Early in Chevron's program, the USGS, which had been investigating  lithium  sources,  alerted  Chevron  to  the  presence  of  anomalous  concentrations  of  lithium associated with the caldera. In 1978 and 1979 Chevron continued its focus on uranium, but added lithium to its assays, began a clay analysis program, and obtained samples for engineering work.

Results confirmed the high lithium concentrations contained in clays. From 1980 to 1987, Chevron began a drilling program which focused on lithium targets and conducted extensive metallurgical testing of the clays to determine the viability of lithium extraction. In 1985, Chevron undertook a resource estimate for a 0.25% Li cut-off.

From  late  2007  to  May  2008,  LAC  completed  drilling  37  core  holes  (4,861.98  m)  and  eight  reverse circulation  (RC)  holes  (1,798.63  m)  in  the  Stage  I  Lens.  LAC  performed  a  mineralogical  study  of  the mineralization in 2008 (Hudson, 2008). That study identified the presence of hectorite as well as bitumen in the deposit. LAC determined the density of six samples from the Stage I Lens.

## 5.2 Ownership History

Chevron  leased  many  of  the  claims  that  comprised  the  lithium  project  to  the  J.  M.  Huber  Corporation (Huber)  in  1986.  In  1991,  Chevron  USA  sold  its  interest  in  the  claims  to  Cyprus  Gold  Exploration Corporation. In 1992, Huber terminated the lease. It appears that Cyprus Gold Exploration Corporation allowed the claims to lapse and provided much of the exploration data to Jim LaBret, one of the claim owners  from  which  they  had  leased  claims.  Western  Energy  Development  Corporation  (WEDC),  a Nevada corporation, leased LaBret's claims in 2005, at which time LaBret provided WEDC access to the Chevron data and to core and other samples that were available.

Pursuant  to  an  agreement  signed  on  December  20,  2007  between  Western  Energy  Development Corporation  ('WEDC'),  a  subsidiary  of  Western  Uranium  Corporation,  and  LNC  (which  was  then  a subsidiary of Western Uranium Corporation), WEDC leased to LNC the Lith and Neutron claims for the purpose of lithium exploration and exploitation. This agreement granted LNC exclusive rights to explore, develop, and mine or otherwise produce any and all lithium deposits discovered on the claims, subject to royalty payments. The leased area, at this time, included the entirety of the Stage I Lens and included 1,378 claims that covered over 11,000 ha.

Lithium  deposits  to  be  exploited  included,  but  were  not  limited  to,  deposits  of  amblygonite,  eucryptite, hectorite, lepidolite, petalite, spodumene and bentonitic clays. Rights to all other mineral types, including base and precious metals, uranium, vanadium and uranium- or vanadium-bearing materials or ores were expressly reserved by WEDC. The term of that lease agreement was 30 years and granted to LAC the exclusive right to purchase the unpatented mining claims comprising a designated discovery, subject to

the royalty and other rights to be reserved by WEDC and subject to LAC's obligations under the deed to be executed and delivered by WEDC on the closing of the option (PAEE, URS 2010).

In  July,  2008,  LNC  ceased  to  be  wholly  owned  by  Western  Uranium  Corporation  and  became  an independent publicly traded company.

Effective  February  4,  2011,  Western  Uranium  Corporation,  WEDC,  LNC  and  LAC  entered  into  an agreement for the purchase by Western Lithium Corporation from WEDC of the royalties and titles for the Lithium Nevada mineral property.

In March 2011, the parties completed the transaction for the sale by WEDC to LNC of the royalties and titles constituting all of the Lithium Nevada mineral property. As a result of this transaction, the existing lease and royalty arrangements between the two companies on the Kings Valley property, including the Net Smelter Returns and Net Profits Royalties on any lithium project that the company developed, were terminated.  Lithium  Nevada  Corp.,  wholly  owned  by  Lithium  Americas  Corp.,  holds  control  and  full ownership of the Lithium Nevada property mining claims and leases, excluding a gold exploration target (on the Albisu property) and a 20% royalty granted by WEDC to Cameco Global Exploration II Ltd solely in respect of uranium.

## 5.3 Metallurgical Testwork

Metallurgical testwork was performed on samples from the project lithium deposit by various researchers. The following list outlines the investigators and their associated reports:

- · Chevron Research Company:
- o Hydrometallurgical Studies on Lithium Extraction of McDermitt Clays; Chevron Research Company, H. E. Kluksdahl, February 9th, 1982.
- o Recovery of Lithium from McDermitt Hectorite Clay; Chevron Research Company, D.A. Van Leirsburg, September 1982.
- o McDermitt Project Review; Chevron Research Company, March 24, 1983.
- · United States Bureau of Mines (USBM):
- o Lithium and Its Recovery from Low-grade Nevada Clays, United States Bureau of Mines Bulletin 691; L. Crocker, R.H. Lien and Others, 1988.
- · Hazen Research:
- o Extraction of Lithium from Hectorite Ore; Hazen Research Project 10677, Client Initiated Study Carried Out for LZC, Issued May, 2008.

The USBM bulletin discusses the USBM investigation for recovering a marketable lithium product from the montmorillonite-type clays of the McDermitt Caldera. Although this bulletin may not meet the standards of CIM, LAC believes the scientific basis of the report to be of sufficient quality to use as a starting point for establishing the metallurgical test program used in developing the process design.

## 5.4 Review of Chevron Research Company Test Work

In  the  1980's,  Chevron  Resources  undertook  considerable  metallurgical  and  processing  studies  to develop a procedure that could economically extract lithium from hectorite clay. Chevron experimented by improving the grade of the ore through upgrading techniques.

Chevron  then  tested  lithium  dissolution  procedures  which  included  dilute  sulfuric  acid  leach,  acid  pug followed by water leach, and ion exchange. Chevron concluded that the most economical method would

be to use the sulfuric acid pug followed by water leach method. The basis for selection included overall acid consumption and lithium recovery.

## 5.4.1 Sampling

The sample used for the testwork reported here is a drill core sample denoted MJB 80-20C by Chevron. The exact location of the drill hole was not apparent from the information provided.

## 5.4.2 Upgrading Testwork

Chevron Research Company ran studies that concluded that dry grinding followed by separation of the fines  coupled  with  upgrading  of  the  coarse  material  gives  the  best  overall  upgrading  of  the  ore.  The ground material was screened into three fractions; +100 #, -100 # +400 #, and -400.

The  -100  #/+400  #  fraction  from  the  grinding  tests  were  then  sent  to  an  oleic  acid  float  treatment  to reduce the amount of acid-consuming carbonate in that material along with upgrading the lithium content. The -400 # fraction from the grinding step was mixed with the concentrate from the oleic acid float tests to obtain a concentrate material for further testing.

Chevron found that the final concentrate contained 75% of the original weight of the material and had a lithium assay of 0.37%. The head assay for lithium was 0.34%. A positive result from these studies was the fact that the carbonate content in the concentrate was significantly lower than in the feed material. This aided in reducing overall acid consumption in the subsequent stages.

## 5.4.3 Acid Pugging, Curing and Water Leaching

The acid pugging stage of the process involved intimately mixing the ore with concentrated sulfuric acid at high solids content (55-67% weight/weight percentage, or w/w). The mixture was then allowed to cure so that  the  acid  reacted  with  the  ore.  The  cured  mixture  formed  a  solid  mass  which  was  ground  up  and leached to  solubilize  the  lithium.  The  best  results  showed  that  85%  of  the  lithium  was  extracted  while consuming 915 pounds of acid per ton of ore.

## 5.5 Review of Hazen Research Testwork

Hazen  Research  was  commissioned  by  LAC  to  examine  processing  options  for  the  Lithium  Nevada mineralization. Physical upgrading followed by sulfuric acid pugging, curing, and water leaching to extract lithium  were  studied.  Most  of  the  work  completed  was  derived  from  the  work  conducted  by  Chevron Research Company. A bench-scale laboratory study was conducted to examine lithium extraction from a composite sample with about 0.35% lithium prepared from drill core samples supplied by LAC.

## 5.5.1 Sampling

The composite sample prepared by Hazen for the work involving the upgrading and acid pugging was composed of drill core from hole WLC-10 from 40 to 100 feet with a head assay of 0.37% lithium.

## 5.5.2 Upgrading Testwork

Upgrading was designed to accomplish two goals: increase the lithium concentration while maintaining reasonable  lithium  recoveries  and  remove  a  substantial  amount  of  calcite  and  other  gangue  material which  would  otherwise  result  in  excessive  consumption  of  acid  in  subsequent  processing  steps.  The following physical processing steps were studied in the effort to achieve these goals:

- 1. Attrition or lightly grind the gangue material to disaggregate and liberate the clay. The goal was to keep the gangue relatively coarse.

- 2. Screen the material to remove the coarse gangue.
- 3. Use  elutriation  or  cylconing  to  separate  the  lithium-rich  clay  fines  from  the  coarser  gangue material, which is low in lithium.
- 4. Use fatty acid (oleic acid) flotation for calcite removal.

After optimizing the operating parameters, Hazen found that wet attrition is effective for liberating the clay fines from the mineralization. In one experiment, 82% of the lithium reported to 53% of the mass in a -10 micron (~500 #) fraction after attrition. The lithium grade almost doubled to 0.6%.

After  attrition,  Hazen  found  that  physical  separation  of  the  gangue  on  the  basis  of  particle  size,  or  by particle  size  and  flotation  for  calcite,  concentrates  the  lithium  and  rejects  calcite  and  other  gangue. Elutriation or another size classification method, such as cycloning, will separate the lithium-rich fines from the coarser gangue. Flotation with oleic acid was able to reduce the carbonate concentration to less than 0.5% (w/w) from 3.5 to 4%. Desliming after attritioning rejected over 90% of the carbonate but with higher lithium  losses.  When  upgrading  by  particle  size,  there  is  a  trade-off  between  lithium  recovery  and carbonate rejection.

In the course of the project, URS developed a flow sheet using the upgrading process from the Hazen Research study. This work was put on hold until trade-off studies could be completed against filterability and capital for filtration equipment.

## 5.5.3 Acid Pugging, Curing and Water Leaching

The fines from the upgrading work were dried and blended to make a composite. The composite assayed 0.72%  Li  and  0.72%  carbonate.  All  acid  pugging  and  leaching  experiments  were  performed  on  this composite.

The main variable examined in the acid pugging, curing, and water leaching work was acid dose, although variations in the amount of water added was also tried. In the laboratory procedure, water (if used) was added to dry clay in a porcelain mortar, followed by concentrated sulfuric acid. The mixture was worked with a pestle until homogeneity was achieved. The mixture was then covered and heated (cured) in an oven at 150°C for three hours. After curing, the solids were usually a dry hard mass. The solids were then lightly ground and water-leached for 30 minutes at 10% (w/w) solids. The lithium sulfate and other soluble sulfates dissolved in the leach.

It  was found that this process was effective in extracting lithium from the clay fines, but an acid dose of near 1150 lb acid per ton of mineralized material was required for 95% extraction. It was also revealed that extraction of lithium was nearly proportional to the acid dose. Overall results obtained by Hazen were consistent with those found by Chevron Research Company.

## 5.6 Historical Resource Estimates

The  information  in  this  section  was  excerpted  from  the  URS  report: NI43-101  Technical  Report Preliminary Assessment and Economic Evaluation, Kings Valley Project , Humboldt County, Nevada, USA , effective date December 31, 2009. In 1985, Chevron (Glanzman and Winsor, 1982) produced polygonal estimates of the Li resources on their properties at Lithium Nevada (Table 5.1). A cut-off grade of 0.25% lithium, minimum thickness of 1.52 m, and a minimum 9.0 ft% Grade x Thickness (GT) were used for the estimate. The tonnage factor used was 1.8 g/cm 3 .

Note  that  there  is  insufficient  information  available  with  respect  to  the  classification  of  this resource  estimate  to  enable  comparison  with  the  current  CIM  Definition  Standards  for  Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves (2014). This estimate is not, therefore, considered to be reliable, or to be relevant in terms of the amended report. A qualified person has not done sufficient work to  classify  the  historical  estimate  as  current  mineral  resources,  and  LAC  is  not  treating  this historical  estimate  as  current  mineral  resources.  The  estimate  is  included  here  for  historical purposes only.

*Mst = million short tons

There is no record indicating that Chevron considered potassium as a resource. From 1992 to 2005, there is no record of any activities on the project.

## 5.7 Previous Reserve Estimates

In  January  2012,  LAC  released  a  preliminary  feasibility  study  (PFS),  prepared  by  Tetra  Tech,  which declared a reserve. The PFS is believed to be reliable but is no longer relevant as LAC decided to reevaluate the current process design criteria and consider changing the process design accordingly. In a press release published on March 22, 2016, LAC has determined that its PFS (Tetra Tech 2012) is no longer current and LAC will no longer be relying on the study for its project development planning. The information stated here is for historical purpose only.

In establishing a mineral reserve, Tetra Tech referred to the mineral resource model prepared by Reserva (effective date June 28, 2011) described in Section 13 of this report, the PAEE (URS 2010), results from the K-UTEC process test report (August 2011) and the results of a geotechnical study published by AMEC (March  2011).  Tetra  Tech  confirmed  that  the  geologic  resource  model,  the  mining  and  the  processing approaches were adequate, relevant and justified for economic extraction. Additionally, Tetra Tech has established that the Project has a reasonable expectation to establish the necessary extraction facilities and  obtain  the  necessary  government  approvals.  Tetra  Tech  converted  the  mineral  resource  into  a mineral reserve using what it considered the economically minable part of the Measured and indicated Mineral Resource

Measured  and  Indicated  material  from  the  resource  model  were  converted  to  a  Proven  and  Probable mineral reserve for two cases, by applying the pit design for each. The Lerchs-Grossmann (LG) Gemcom Whittle™  Strategic  Mine  Planning  Software  (Whittle)  was  used  to  develop  the  pit  shells.  After  the  pit designs were complete, the grades for potassium and sodium from the 3-D blocks that are above the ore cut-off  are  reported  along  with  the  lithium  grade.  The  pertinent  parameters  used  in  the  3-D  LerchsGrossman open pit optimization program were as follows:

- o Pit slopes - 41 degrees
- o Mining cost (Overburden) - US$1.50/tonne
- o Mining cost (Other) - US$2.75/tonne

- o Mill cost - US$66.00/tonne of ore
- o Selling price of US$13.89/lb Li
- o Mining recovery - 95.0%
- o Process recovery - 87.2%

Tetra Tech calculated the breakeven mining cut-off, based on the parameters above, to be 0.23% Li. Two different pit shells  were selected from the family of economic shells that were generated by the Whittle program. At the request of LAC, a cut-off of 0.32% Li, which was slightly higher than the breakeven cutoff, was applied to the material within the shells in order to generate an average ore grade of 0.40% Li. Selection criteria were based on finding a shell that contained sufficient ore at the 0.32% cut-off to supply the mill for 20 years of production. For Case 1, this requirement was 13.8 million dry tonnes of ore. For Case 2, the requirement was 25.6 million dry tonnes of ore.

To check the validity of applying the higher cut-off within an optimized shell, a second Whittle optimization was performed in which a fixed cut-off of 0.32% Li was specified for ore. Two shells were chosen from this optimization that contained roughly the same amount of ore as was in the original Whittle shells at the 0.32% Li cut-off. The two newer shells appeared to be almost identical in size and shape to the previous two shells that were chosen as a basis for ultimate pit design. Furthermore, the average ore grade and strip ratios were nearly identical.

## 6 Geological Setting and Mineralization

## 6.1 Regional Geology

The Project in Humboldt County, Nevada, lies in the western and southern part of the McDermitt caldera complex (Figure 6.1), a Miocene volcanic feature that comprises a total surface area of about 30 km × 40 km.  On  the  basis  of  U.S.  Geological  Survey  publications  (e.g.,  Rytuba  and  Glanzman,  1979),  the caldera complex was considered to be formed of multiple nested calderas. More recently, the complex has been described as a single caldera formed during eruption of a zoned ignimbrite (Castor and Henry, 2000; Starkel and others, 2009).

Volcanic activity at the McDermitt caldera complex has yielded precise 40Ar/39Ar ages of 16.5 to 16.1 million  years  ago  and  was  characterized  by  extrusion  of  early  metaluminous  and  peralkaline  rhyolite, followed  by  eruption  of  a  voluminous  ignimbrite  with  peralkaline  rhyolite  to  metaluminous  dacite compositions (Castor and Henry, 2000, Starkel and others, 2009). After collapse, the central part of the caldera complex was the site of resurgence, and a moat-like lake formed between this resurgent dome and the caldera  walls.  The  lake  was  the  site  of  deposition  of  volcaniclastic  sediments  that  now  form  a nearly  continuous  ring  within  the  caldera  (Figure  6.1).  The  Lithium  Nevada  lithium  deposits  are  lensshaped bodies hosted by the moat sedimentary rock.

## 6.2 Local Geology

## 6.2.1 McDermitt Caldera

The Project deposits occur in a north-south zone that coincides with the western and southern part of the McDermitt caldera moat sedimentary rock.  The most southerly deposit, known as the Stage I Lens, is considered to be the primary target and is best defined. The Stage II to Stage 5 lenses lie to the north.

## 6.2.2 Stage I Lens

The Stage I Lens is largely beneath alluvial cover at Thacker Pass. It lies at relatively low elevations in moat sedimentary rocks that are thought to have been separated from the topographically higher deposits to the north by late down-to-the south normal faulting (Castor and Henry, 2000). Exposures of the moat sedimentary rocks at Thacker Pass are limited to a few drainages and isolated road cuts; therefore, the stratigraphic sequence in the deposit is primarily derived from core drilling.

The  moat  sedimentary  section,  which  has  a  maximum  drilled  thickness  of  about  160  m,  consists  of alternating layers of claystone and volcanic ash. The claystone comprises 40% to 90% of the section. In many intervals, the claystone and ash are intimately intermixed. The claystones are variably brown, tan, gray, bluish-gray and black whereas the ash is generally white or very light gray. Individual claystone-rich units may be recognized over lateral distances of more than 152 m although unit thickness can vary by as much  as  20%.  Ash-rich  layers  are  more  variable  and  appear  to  have  some  textures  that  suggest reworking.  All  units  exhibit  finely-graded  bedding  and  laminar  textures  that  imply  a  shallow  lacustrine depositional environment.

Surficial oxidation persists to depths of 15 to 30 m in the moat sedimentary rock. Oxidized claystone is brown, tan, or light  greenish-tan  and  contains  iron  oxide,  whereas  the  ash  is  white  with  some  orangebrown  iron  oxide.  The  transition  from  oxidized  to  unoxidized  rock  occurs  over  intervals  as  much  as 4.5 m thick.

The moat sedimentary section at Thacker Pass overlies intracaldera volcanic rock that has been logged as ash-flow tuff, flows and lahars. A zone of weakly to strongly silicified sedimentary rock, the Hot Pond Zone (HPZ), occurs at the base of the moat sedimentary section in nearly every drillhole in the Stage I deposit area. The HPZ rock is locally oxidized, and the underlying volcanic rock is generally oxidized.

Core from each drillhole has been carefully examined and drill logs have been prepared that record rock type,  color,  accessory  minerals,  textures  and  other  features  of  significance.  On  the  basis  of  core examination, 14 lithologic codes have been recognized (Table 6.1). The core has mostly been divided into sample  intervals  for  chemical  analyses  delineated  on  the  basis  of  lithology.  Figure  6.2  shows  a generalized interpretation of the lithology for core hole WLC-43 which is located roughly in the middle of the proposed mine pit area. For this interpretation, all the claystones (lithologic units 1-6) are combined into one lithologic unit.

Most of the moat sedimentary rocks drilled in the Thacker Pass basin contain anomalously high lithium contents (&gt; 100 ppm). Intervals that consist mostly of ash have lithium contents of less than  800  ppm whereas intervals dominated by claystone contain more lithium (&gt;1,000 ppm).  Many intervals have very high lithium contents (&gt;4,000 ppm).  Intervals with extreme lithium contents (&gt;8,000 ppm) occur locally.

There  is  no  change  in  lithium  content  across  the  boundary  between  oxidized  and  unoxidized  rock; however, the highest lithium grades generally occur in the middle and lower parts of the sedimentary rock section.

The lithium content of the Stage I Lens claystone can generally be predicted by the color and texture of the rock, as well as the amount of admixed ash. Intervals with the highest lithium grades (&gt;4,000 ppm) generally  contain  gray  to  dark-gray  or  black  claystone  with  less  than  10%  ash.  Intervals  of  bluish-gray claystone with low ash content have moderate lithium content (generally 2,500 to 3,000 ppm). Intervals of light  colored claystone (e.g., tan, light gray, greenish-tan) have lower lithium grades (generally 1,500 to 2,500  ppm).  Intervals  of  mixed  claystone  and  ash  are  common  and  have  variable  lithium  contents (generally 1,500 to 3,000 ppm) depending on the type of claystone and proportion of ash present.

## 6.2.3 Stage II Lens

The Stage II Lens is located approximately 10 km NNW of the Stage I Lens, the southernmost lithium mineralized  lens  in  the  area.  The  Stage  II  Lens  mineralized  beds  comprise  mainly  of  a  dark  green claystone, at times intercalated with arkose beds; in the NE region of the modeled area a fanglomerate body  is  present.  Figure  6.3  shows  an  example  of  a  Field  Log  from  hole  SP-3.  Lithium-rich  beds  are generally  10  to  60  m  thick  in  most  areas,  defined  as  interesting  Li  grades  as  greater  than  1,500  ppm. Alluvium cover is variable, ranging from no cover at all to a maximum of about 6 m.

LAC drilling shows that the average thickness of Li mineralization is thicker than that indicated by Chevron data, because, as was the Case in the PCD lens, some of the Chevron holes stopped in mineralization. Figure 6.4 shows a thickness map of the area, for lithium grades greater than 1,000 ppm.

## 6.2.4 Mineralogy

Clay in the Stage I Lens lithium deposit includes two distinctly different types on the basis of chemistry and  X-ray  diffraction  (XRD)  spectra.  Clay  with  XRD  spectra  that  are  indicative  of  smectite  occurs  at relatively  shallow  depths  (less  than  30  m  bgs)  in  the  Stage  I  Lens  deposit  (Castor,  2010).  Confirmed hectorite clay occurs elsewhere in the McDermitt caldera and has been documented by several authors (e.g., Odom, 1992; Rytuba and Glanzman, 1979). Drill intervals with high lithium contents (commonly &gt; 4,000  ppm)  contain  clay  that  yields  XRD  spectra  that  are  more  typical  for  illite  than  smectite  (Castor, 2010). An illite-type clay occurs at moderate to deep depths in the moat sedimentary section and locally occurs  in  intervals  that  contain  as  much  as  8,000  ppm  lithium,  higher  than  any  analyzed  hectorite.  A relatively  thin  layer of interstratified smectite-illite clay is found between the smectite and illite-type clay (Castor, 2010).

Other  minerals  in  the  Stage  I  Lens  deposit  claystone  include  calcite,  quartz,  K-feldspar,  plagioclase, dolomite, and fluorite. Pyrite and bitumen occur in the claystone below near-surface oxidized rock. Ash beds  in  the  Stage  I  Lens  deposit  contain  quartz  and  feldspar  with  local  analcime,  and  minor  clay  and pyrite.  Zeolite  minerals  are  typically  present  in  the  north  part  of  the  caldera,  but  analcime  is  the  only zeolite present in the Stage I Lens deposit (Glanzman and Rytuba, 1979).

No detailed mineralogical work has been conducted for samples from the Stage II drilling campaign.

## 6.2.5 Discussion

The regional geological setting of these deposits is quite well known and very well understood. The local geological setting and degree of local lithium grade variations are adequately known for the Stage I and Stage II areas to allow estimating the resources to the accuracy modeled by the resource classification applied.

## 7 Deposit Types

## 7.1 Description of Deposits

The information in this section was transcribed in part from the URS report: NI 43-101 Technical Report Preliminary Assessment and Economic Evaluation, Kings Valley project, Humboldt County, Nevada, USA, effective date December 31, 2009. The section was modified where appropriate by SRK.

The  Kings  Valley  deposits  are  part  of  a  small  group  of  lithium-rich  clay  minerals  known  as  illite  and smectite  and  include  hectorite  [Na0.3(Mg,Li)3Si4O10(F,OH)2].  Hectorite  was  named  for  its  first  known source, the Hector Mine, 55 km east of Barstow in San Bernardino, California. This is the only hectorite deposit  currently  known  to  be  in  production;  however,  other  small  producers  may  sporadically  mine hectorite. The production is used primarily for specialty clay products. Lithium is not extracted from the clays from Hector.

Harben and Bates (1984) suggest that the Hector deposits were formed when Pliocene tuff and volcanic ash  were  deposited  in  a  restricted  alkaline  lake  environment  on  and  adjacent  to  travertine  which  was forming by hot springs emanating along the fault. The tuff was initially converted to clinoptilolite (a zeolite mineral) which, then in turn, was altered to hectorite by hot springs waters rich in lithium and fluoride.

Although no work has been reported on the genesis of the Lithium Nevada deposits, the geology suggests that the deposits occur over the ring fracture zone of the caldera complex. Post volcanic intrusions along those  fractures  likely  powered  hydrothermal  cells  that  formed  the  deposits.  Hydrothermal  solutions ascended through the volcanic section along the ring fractures and other faults and passed through the volcanic section and into the lacustrine environment of the moat. These ascending fluids extracted lithium from  the  rhyolitic  ash  flow  tuffs  and  the  volcaniclastic  sediments  that  immediately  overlie  the  rhyolites. Glanzman and Winsor (1982) suggest that the fluids were deposited into the moat where a lithium-rich gel formed within the lake and precipitated as a stratabound, massive layer of Li-rich claystone. Thin intervals of volcaniclastic sediments were deposited below, within, and above this claystone. Another possibility is that the Li-bearing clays were the product of alteration of in situ, clay-rich horizons by the hydrothermal fluids as they traversed the geological column.

Additional work is required to determine the origin of these deposits. There are indications in some drill holes that the rocks are the product of nearby explosive volcanic eruptions, and that they have not been significantly transported by sedimentary processes.  These rocks are altered and locally contain elevated Li  which  suggests  that  the  rocks  were  deposited  and  then  altered  by  hydrothermal  fluids.  Fine-grained volcanic  and  volcaniclastic  material  was  converted  to  hectorite-bearing  clay  beds  by  that  hydrothermal event.

## 7.2 Basis of Exploration

The  sediments  within  the  Lithium  Nevada  deposits  host  a  relatively  large  concentration  of  lithium compared  to  most  other  sources.  Testwork  to  date  has  shown  that  extraction  from  the  deposit  is economically feasible. Exploration activities have defined the geology of the deposit, defined the orebody and  resulted  in  categories  developed  for  measured,  indicated  and  inferred  resources  for  the  Stage  I and II Lenses of this Project.

## 8 Exploration

## 8.1 Stage I

Prior to the 2010 drilling campaign, exploration consisted of geological mapping to delineate the limits of the sedimentary rocks within the moat and drilling to determine grade and location of mineralization. Most of the Project area has been surveyed by airborne gamma ray spectrometry, though this work was not done specifically to enhance lithium exploration (PAEE URS 2010).

Survey work was completed prior to 1980 under Chevron. A collar survey was completed by LAC for the 2007-2008 drilling program using a Trimble GPS. At that time the NAD 83 global reference system was used.  Comparing  LAC's  survey  work  with  that  done  by  Chevron  showed  near  identical  results  for  the easting and northings, elevations were off by approximately 3 m and were corrected in order to conform with earlier Chevron work (PAEE URS 2010).

Downhole surveys have been performed on selected holes drilled after WLC-24. Those surveys indicate that  holes  are  drilled  vertically  or  very  nearly  vertical  with  the  exception  of  hole  (WLC  58)  which  was intentionally drilled at 70 degrees from horizontal.

Exploration work that commenced in January 2010 focused on further refining the local stratigraphy and ore grades within the deposits. This work has been done in the form of systematic drilling and is covered in  detail  in  Section  9.1.  The drilling (sampling) to  date covers an area of some 50 hectares, measuring approximately 1000m EW x 500m NS.

In addition to drilling, LAC developed two test pits (WLT-01 and WLT-02) in January 2010. The purpose of trenching was to obtain large bulk samples for metallurgical testwork. Alluvium was removed via bulldozer and two 4.6 m trenches were dug into the clay deposits. A total of 15 samples were collected for assay. Intervals were selected to make a composite which would approximate the orebody. These composites were shipped to the Outotec GmbH facility in Germany for testwork

The topographic surface of the Project area was mapped by aerial photography dated July 6, 2010. This information was obtained by MXS, Inc. for LAC. The flyover resolution was 0.35 m. Ground control was established by Desert-Mountain Surveying, a Nevada licensed land surveyor, using Trimble equipment. Field  surveys  of  drillhole  collars,  spot-heights  and  ground-truthing  were  conducted  by  Mr.  Dave  Rowe, MXS, Inc., a Nevada licensed land surveyor, using Trimble equipment.

Reserva believes that the exploration techniques used were appropriate and that the extent and grade distribution of the deposit is reasonably well addressed. Although some sample bias was detected earlier RC and Sonic drilling, as described in Section 8, the vast majority (96%) of the drilling was core drilling. Based on observation of the field and  logging/sampling procedures,  the samples are considered to be representative and of reasonable quality. Based on geological logging data, the location and attitude of several faults that offset the base of the deposit were determined and incorporated into the overall model. The data are adequate at this stage to adequately define the local stratigraphy and grade of the deposit for mineral resource estimate purposes. However, more geological data and modeling may be required to optimize excavation and mining operating protocols.

## 8.2 Stage II

The information in this section is based in part on the corresponding section of the URS report: NI 43- 101 Technical  Report  Preliminary  Assessment  and  Economic  Evaluation,  Kings  Valley  project,  Humboldt County, Nevada, USA, effective date December 31, 2009.

Exploration on LAC's Stage II Lens deposit has consisted of geological mapping to delineate the limits of the moat  volcaniclastic sedimentary rocks and drilling to determine the grade and location of mineralization. Some, if not most, of the area has been covered by airborne gamma ray spectrometry, but those data are not pertinent to exploration for lithium. There is no record of other exploration in the area.

The Chevron database includes 283 core, RC, and rotary holes (25,781.8 m). Records indicate that 268 holes were drilled specifically to evaluate the lithium mineralization. The record is not clear, but it appears that of the 283 holes in the database, 223 are rotary holes (18,136.2 m), 52 are core holes (5,731.11 m) based on the 'c' suffix on drillhole names, eight are reverse circulation holes (1,798.62 m), two are sonic holes (153.7 m), and seven are PQ-size core holes for metallurgical samples (233.5 m). In addition to those  holes,  370  auger  holes  (902.5  m)  were  drilled.  The  reason  for  the  auger  holes  has  not  been determined.

Claim surveying for the Chevron holes was performed by Tyree Surveying Company, Albuquerque, New Mexico and Desert Mountain Surveying Company, Winnemucca, Nevada (Chevron, 1980). According to Chevron (1980) both companies used theodolites and laser source electronic distance meters to survey the claims. Records indicate that both companies surveyed drill collar locations and it is presumed that the same instrumentation was used for those locations. The reported error was within 0.1515 m horizontally and 0.303 m vertically.

Additionally, LAC has drilled to date 38 diamond drill holes in the Stage II Lens. Collar surveying for the Stage  II  Lens  drill  holes  was  conducted  by  LAC  using  a  Trimble  GPS.  The  NAD  83  global  reference system is used. LAC compared the locations of several points surveyed by Chevron and found that the easting and northing coordinates were more or less identical. The elevation, however, was found to have a systematic difference of 3.11 m. As a result, 3.11 m was subtracted from the GPS elevations to conform to the older surveys.

LAC surveyed the initial holes in the Stage II Lens campaign (SP-1, SP-2, SP-3, SP-4, SP-5 and SP-6); later,  after  drilling  had  been  completed,  holes  SP-12,  SP-14,  SP-21 and  SP-23 were also surveyed for down the hole deviations. LAC found that none deviated significantly from the vertical orientation. Prior work by LAC on the Stage I (PCD Lens) had indicated as well that there is little deviation of the holes from vertical, supporting the assumption of verticality of all other holes drilled in the Stage II area. GeoSystems International Inc. (GSI)  accepts  that the LAC  and  Chevron  holes  are  vertical  as  a  reasonable approximation, given the drilling conditions and the drill hole total depths.

GSI believes that the exploration techniques used were appropriate and that the extent and tenor of the deposits is reasonably well known. The data are adequate at this time to support inferred and indicated mineral resource categories, but additional drilling is required to adequately define the local stratigraphy and grade of the deposits in order to improve the confidence of the mineral resource estimate.

## 9 Drilling

## 9.1 Stage I

## 9.1.1 Type and Extent of Drilling by LAC

The Stage I Lens (formerly known as the PCD Lens) has been explored for minerals since the 1970s. Exploration began with a focus on uranium found in the area, but switched primarily to lithium in the late 1980s when Chevron still controlled the mining interests. LAC drilled 51 core holes between 2007 and 2009 to expand on the Chevron work. These holes were drilled with the primary aim of defining lithium occurrences in and the geology of the deposit. Table 9.1 lists a summary of the holes drilled. The 37 core holes (WLC-01 thru WLC-37) were drilled specifically for assay and lithologic information. The five reverse circulation  (RC)  holes  were  drilled  to  compare  drilling  techniques.  The  RC  method  proved  to  produce biased assay results in the Stage I Lens area so the method was abandoned. Seven PQ-sized holes were drilled with the intent to provide samples for metallurgical testwork. Two sonic holes were drilled to test the drilling procedure. It was determined that, while the sonic drill worked well, the geologic definition was not comparable  to  traditional  coring.  For  more  historical  information  on  drilling  refer  to  Section  5  of  this technical report.

LAC initiated a carefully designed drilling campaign which commenced in January 2010 with the goal of further defining measured and indicated resource categories for lithium. An additional 161 drillholes were drilled  (WLC-40 thru WLC-200). Figure 9.1 shows a plan view of drillholes in the Stage I Lens in UTM NAD 27 values. Only those drilled within the easting and northing extents on the map are shown; some drillholes to the north and east are not shown for simplicity.

The  latest  drilling  campaign  began  in  January  2010  and  concluded  in  June  2011.  All  core  was logged by a geologist on-site who recorded hole ID, easting, northing, elevation, total depth and a lithologic description.

Assays for drillholes  bored  prior  to  January  2010  (WLC-01-WLC-37) had  analytical  work  done  by American Assay Labs (AAL) in Nevada. The data from AAL's analytical work was not used in the model. These holes had assays for lithium repeated during the latest campaign. These re-assays, as well  as  all  subsequent  assays,  were  performed  at  ALS  Minerals  in  Reno,  Nevada.  The  assays included results for lithium, potassium and sodium and a suite of common elements of interest, while the  re-assays  were  analyzed  for  lithium  only.  Samples  selected  for  assay  were  chosen  by  the geologist based on lithology and color.

The drillhole  spacing  was  prescribed  by  the  geostatistical  methods  which  included  variography  to determine optimal spacing for inclusion in Inferred, Indicated and Measured categories. The geologic model  included  intervals  from  holes  WLC-01  thru  WLC-200  (excluding  WLC-180,  WLC-183  and WLC -185) and WSH-01 and WSH-02 for a total of 197 holes and a total length of approximately 18,500  m.  Chevron  drillholes  were  excluded  from  consideration  in  the  model.  Please  refer  to Section 13.

All drillholes included in the resource estimate were drilled essentially vertically (88.8 to 90 degrees) with the exception of one hole (WLC-58). All mineralization thicknesses recorded in boreholes are treated as true thicknesses.

All core  drillholes  were  drilled  using  standard  core  drilling  techniques  by  Marcus  &amp;  Marcus Exploration Inc.  Holes WSH-1 and WSH-2 were drilled by Boart Longyear Company with a sonic drill.    Core  was  stored  in  a  secure  workshop  while  being  processed  and  then  locked  in  CONEX containers or a warehouse after sampling was completed.

## 9.1.2 Accuracy and Reliability of Drilling Results

Based on field and core shack observations, the authors found no factors in the drilling techniques, core  recovery  and  sample  collection  procedures  that  would  materially  affect  the  accuracy  and reliability of the results. The procedures and methodologies are consistent with industry standards, and the data are considered to be acceptable for resource estimation purposes.

## 9.2 Stage II

The  information  in  this  section  is  based  in  part  on  the  corresponding  section  of  the  URS  report: NI 43-101 Technical Report Preliminary Assessment and Economic Evaluation, Kings Valley project, Humboldt County, Nevada, USA, effective date December 31, 2009.

## 9.2.1 Drilling

Cuttings  from  rotary  percussion  drill  holes  drilled  by  Chevron  in  1977  were  analyzed  for  lithium. Those holes  confirmed  the  presence  of  interesting  grades  of  lithium  hosted  by  a  massive,  green claystone within the moat sediment section.

Between 1979 and 1987 Chevron drilled a total of 34 rotary percussion holes, plus 227 core and RC holes for initial exploration, to develop lithium targets, and to conduct extensive metallurgical testing. These  holes  were  drilled  to  test  the  thickness  of  the  clays,  to  obtain  samples  of  the  clay  for engineering  analysis,  and  to  further  investigate  the  lithium  resource  potential.  Results  were encouraging with respect to the level and consistency of the lithium contained by the clays.

LAC has recovered and re-logged some of the historical core. Of the total 283 holes that appear in the  database,  227  have  lithium  assay  data.  There  are  indications  that  additional  six  holes  were drilled,  but  there are no locations for those holes. The record indicates that 213 rotary percussion and 15 core holes were drilled to test the lithium mineralization between 1980 and 1984. The drill and sampling procedures were standard for the industry at that time.

A total of 38 additional HQ (63.5 mm) diameter core holes were drilled by LAC in the Stage II Lens area during 2009 (Figure 9.2). Two of the Chevron core holes, MC-84-81C and MC-84-90C, were re-analyzed  by  LAC  during  the  2009  campaign,  and  thus  have  grades  for  all  four  elements  of interest, Li, K, F, and Na.

Core or diamond drilling provides better geological information and quality of sample compared to percussion  and  RC  methods.  SRK  agrees  with  previous  recommendations  that  only  core  drilling should  be  used  for  these  deposits.  Although  reverse  circulation  (RC)  drilling  can  reduce  drilling costs, at PCD RC drilling was shown to produce biased assay results. LAC did not drill any RC holes on the Stage II Lens.

## 9.2.2 Logging

Chevron  core  was  collected  from  the  drills  twice  a  day  and  descriptively  logged  by  geologists  at Chevron's  field  camp.    Chip  samples  from  rotary  drills  were  logged  at  the  drill.    Two  composite samples  were  collected  every  five  feet  and  bagged.  The  geologist  logging  the  hole  made  a  chip board at the drill site. The chip boards consisted of drill cuttings glued to a 1-inch x 4-inch board whose vertical  scale  was  1in  =  10ft.  Lithological  logging  of  both  core  and  chip  samples  stressed lithologic units, their contacts, mineralization, alteration and brecciation.

LAC core was collected at the end of each shift and transported back to the Orovada field office. Core  was  cleaned  and  logged  for  lithology,  oxidation,  alteration,  and  core  recovery.  All  core  was photographed with high resolution digital cameras, and the samples were stored in a lockable steel storage container.

## 10 Sample Preparation, Analysis and Security

## 10.1 Stage I

ALS Minerals (ALS) of Reno, Nevada, was used as the primary assay laboratory for the LAC Stage I Lens  drill  program.  ALS  is  an  ISO  9001:2000  certified  laboratory  and  an  ISO/IEC  17025-certified Quality Systems Laboratory, and participates in the Society of Mineral Analysts round-robin testing.

The quality assurance-quality control (QA-QC) protocols used during the Stage I Lens sampling and analytical  program  were  developed  by  Dr.  Barry  Smee  of  Smee  &amp;  Associates  Consulting  Ltd,  an international  specialist  in  QA-QC  procedures  who  is  familiar  with  the  requirements  of  NI  43-101. Mr. Timothy Carew evaluated the QA-QC procedures used during the program.

## 10.1.1 Sample Preparation

After the drilled core was brought to the core shed from the field, the boxes of core were logged, photographed,  cut  and  sampled  by  LAC  employees  and  consultants.  The  length  of  the  assay samples is determined by the geologist by lithology and averaged 1.46 m. The core was cut in half with diamond blade saws and the right half bagged for sampling. For duplicate samples, one half of the core is cut in half again and the two halves are bagged and sampled separately to test sampling and assay precision. Each sample was assigned a unique identification number to ensure security and anonymity. The samples were picked up by ALS in trucks that arrive from Winnemucca or were delivered to ALS in Winnemucca or Reno by WLC employees.

LAC  submitted  a  total  of  11,157  samples  from  the  Stage  I  area  to  ALS,  of  which  9,884  were mineralized samples. Randomly inserted in the sample stream were 1,273 QA-QC samples, which represent 11 % of the total assays. The QA-QC samples include blanks to test for contamination, high and low grade lithium standards to test for accuracy and duplicates to test for precision.

At ALS, the samples were dried at a maximum temperature of 60°C. The entire sample was then crushed with a jaw crusher to 90% passing a ten mesh screen. Nominal 250 gram splits were taken for each sample using a riffle splitter. This split is pulverized using a ring mill to 90% passing a 150 mesh  screen.  These  preparation  procedures  were  deemed  appropriate  by  Mr.  Carew  for  the mineralized material from the Stage I Lens.

A flowsheet documenting the sample preparation through to analysis is presented in Figure 10.1.

## 10.1.2 Analysis

Inductively  coupled  plasma  mass  spectroscopy  (ICP-MS)  combined  with  atomic  emission  plasma spectroscopy (ICP-AES) are used to provide sensitive analytical capability. This combination is used to  provide  high  precision  analyses  for  precious  metal  exploration  and  reconnaissance  programs. SRK deems these methods to be appropriate and applicable to the Stage I Lens drill samples.

Following  standard  four-acid  digestion,  ALS's  ME-MS61  analytical  package  initially  analyzes  the samples using ICP-AES to ensure that elevated metal concentrations were not present which would interfere  with  ICP-MS  analyses.  Along  with  a  full  geochemical  suite,  this  method  was  used  to analyze the three elements of commercial interest to the Project: lithium, potassium and sodium.

## 10.1.3 Density

LAC submitted 25 core samples from the Stage I Lens program to ALS for density determination. Density was measured by two methods: 24 samples were tested using the paraffin-coated method (ASTM Designation C914-95), while one sample was tested using the method described in ASTM C127- 04, a test for aggregate materials. Both are standard methods. The material was weighed, the weights  recorded  and  then  the  samples  were  dried  at  75º  C  for  24  hours.  The  dry  material  was weighed again and the weight recorded. A rock density test was then performed on the dry material using a wax immersion procedure. Table 10.1 shows the dry density values that were used in the resource model.

Table 10.1: Average Density Values Used in the Resource Model

| Lithology      |   Average of Density Determination  (tonnes per m )  3 |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Alluvium       |                                                   1.52 |
| Claystone      |                                                   1.79 |
| Basalt         |                                                   2.51 |
| Volcanic rocks |                                                   1.96 |

Note that dry density is the standard reference for density measurements for industrial minerals.

## 10.1.4 Quality Control

The QA-QC protocol included analyses of blank, duplicate and standard samples.

The QA-QC program was set up so that at least 10% of all samples were checks or tests against the laboratory  assays.  ALS  analyzed samples in  batches of 40,  with six of those samples being ALS standards and controls. In addition, LAC randomly inserted two standards (one low grade and one high grade lithium), one duplicate and one blank in every 34 samples. Approximately 12% of all LAC samples were QA-QC checks.

Adhering to the QA-QC program developed by Dr. Smee (2010), LAC identified a small number of assay  samples  from  ALS  that  were  below  the  criteria  established  within  acceptable  limits.  These QA-QC elements  included  core  sample  duplicates;  high  and  low  grade  standards  for  lithium  and blanks of dolomite. The pulps or coarse rejects of these 76 samples were re-tested and analyzed by ALS, including an average of 10 samples above and below the questionable result. ALS compiled reports and found that there were a few samples that were mislabeled by the lab.  Certificates were re-issued by the assay company to correct for the sample switches. Generally, the remaining QA-QC samples  delivered  assay  results  that  were  similar  to  the  original  results,  which  indicate  possible errors in sampling, handling and processing.  In total, 6% (76 of 1,273) of the QA-QC samples did not conform to the established criteria.

During  the  QA-QC  process  undertaken  by  LAC,  an  error  was  observed  in  the  high  grade  lithium standards where 17% of the standards had a higher ppm rate than was expected by three standard deviations  (SD).  ALS  began  using  a  new  higher  grade  lithium  standard  to  compensate  for  the

discrepancy. LAC re-assayed the highest 16 lithium values for drillholes WLC-01 through WLC-37 and WLC-40 through WLC-200. Similar samples were sent to both ALS Reno (for a blind repeat test) and Activation Laboratories (Actlabs), Ancaster, Ontario, Canada, for lithium analysis. Of the 16 reassays, 14 had lower and two had higher lithium values, with the largest difference being 11% less. The overall difference of the original and the repeat assay values for ALS was lower by 5%. The difference  between  the  ALS  re-assays  and  Actlabs  was  3%  lower.  Dr.  Smee  concluded  that  the overall  deposit  estimates  may  be  lower  by  at  most  2-3%,  which  is  considered  within  industry standards.

As an added QA-QC measure, Actlabs was chosen to run assays on duplicate pulps produced by ALS for comparison to ALS assay results. A total of 112 random pulp samples were sent to Actlabs in April 2011. The data analyzed by Dr. Smee was found to comply with industry standards, being within 3% of the assay values returned by ALS.

## Blank Samples

Blank samples composed of dolomite were used to check for possible contamination during sample preparation and analysis.  The dolomite was chosen because it is known to have low lithium content and is therefore a good indicator of contamination from one sample to another during crushing and assaying. The raw dolomite is not an established laboratory standard and was obtained from a mine in Winnemucca, Nevada. The warning limit of 100 ppm was determined by Dr. Smee as five times the average concentration of the blank of 20 ppm lithium. There were 314 blanks analyzed for the Stage I program or approximately 3% of the total number of assays sent for analysis. Sixteen blank samples reported anomalously high lithium. All non-conforming samples were submitted for re-run.

The practical detection limit for both ICP-MS and ICP-AES was reported at 0.2 ppm by the lab. Since the range of lithium values that LAC considers to be the low range of economic interest (1,000 to 2,000  ppm)  is  10  to  20  times  the  practical  detection  limit,  SRK  does  not  consider  this  to  be  a significant issue. Figure 10.2 shows blank assay results against lithium values represented on the y-axis. Non-conforming samples (i.e., those above the red 100 ppm limit line) were re-analyzed by ALS. These results were found to be accurate.

<!-- image -->

(Gray line indicates the warning limit for lithium)

Figure: 10.2: Lithium Concentration of Blanks

(Source: Tetra Tech, 2014)

Five  percent  of  the  blanks  (16  of  314  samples)  were  above  the  LAC  QA-QC  warning  limit.  The samples were re-run by ALS and, again, determined to be accurate values. High values may indicate contamination in the crushing process or an anomalously high concentration of lithium in the given sample.  SRK  considers  the  amount  of  contamination  suggested  by  the  blanks  analyses  to  be acceptable.

## Duplicate Samples

Pulp  samples  for  duplicate  analyses  were  prepared  in  an  identical  manner  as  the  non-duplicate samples. A total of 316 sets of duplicates were submitted 'blind' to ALS. The lithium concentrations for these duplicates are shown in Figure 10.3.

Duplicate samples provide information about the precision of the sampling and analytical procedure. Precision  can  be  estimated  by  calculating  the  average  relative  error  of  the  duplicate  pairs.  LAC considers the duplicate assay precision to be inaccurate if the average relative error between two duplicate samples is 500 ppm or more.

Twenty-two  outliers  (7%  of  the  duplicate  sets)  did  not  meet  the  relative  error  criteria  and  were re-examined by ALS. The re-analyzed values were within 5% of the original value.  Poor duplicate replication can indicate lack of precision in all phases of the sampling procedures. Potential causes include  errors  introduced  during  sampling  (i.e.,  mislabeled  sample,  splitting)  or  during  analytical testing.

Note:  The  heavy  blue  line  represents  1:1  equivalency.  The  thin  line  is  a  linear  regression  curve  that  shows  near  1:1 equivalency for all duplicate pairs.

Figure: 10.3: Lithium Content of Field Duplicates

(Source: Tetra Tech, 2014)

Overall, duplicates show good correlation to original samples.

## Standards

Two standards consisting of lithium-bearing clays from the Project area were used for the Stage I Lens drilling program: a low-grade standard (LG) with a certified value of 3,526 ppm lithium, and a high-grade standard (HG) with a certified value of 4,470 ppm lithium. These values were based on round-robin results from four analytical laboratories: Kappes, Cassiday &amp; Associates, Reno, NV; ALS Minerals,  Reno  NV;  Acme  Labs,  Vancouver,  British  Columbia,  Canada;  and  ActLabs,  Ancaster, Ontario, Canada.

To certify the low and high grade standards, a round-robin was completed in June 2010 in which ten standards of each grade were sent to six labs for testing. The resulting assays were analyzed and calculated to determine an average lithium, potassium, sodium and fluorine value for each standard. The results from two of the labs, seen as two clusters at bottom left in Figure 10.4 were discarded because  they  were  not  deemed  to  be  compatible  with  the  analytical  methods  employed.  The average of the four labs that gave similar analytical results was used to calculate the certified values.

Three hundred and nine LG and 320 HG standards, representing 6% of the entire sample program, were inserted randomly into the sample stream to evaluate analytical accuracy.  These standards were used in the Stage I Lens exploration work and show lithium data to be reasonably accurate. Figure 10.4 and Figure 10.5 show laboratory performance with respect to the two standards.

Note: As determined by four labs (round robin) on the left and by ALS on blind standards inserted in drill sample batches (lab data) on the right.

Figure: 10.4: High Grade Standard Results with Lithium Round Robin Data

(Source: Tetra Tech, 2014)

By identifying results that deviate more than three standard deviations (SD), ALS has developed inhouse controls to better evaluate the lithium samples. Figure 10.4 shows that the data was trending below the 3 SD line at the beginning of the program. By identifying these samples that deviate with the WLC QA- QC program and having ALS re-analyze them, the assays became more accurate. In the middle of the program, the assays began to drift above the +3 SD line. The upward drift has been corrected by introduction of a new higher grade lithium standard that ALS has recently inserted into their QA-QC program. The low grade lithium standard did not drift above and below the 3 SD lines because  the  lithium  ppm  of  the  standards  that  the  laboratory  used  was  close  to  LAC  lithium standards from the beginning.

## 10.1.5 Discussion of QA-QC

When samples that deviated from the accepted criteria were identified, these samples as well as a batch of 10 to 20 samples that are run before and after that sample, were re-analyzed to check for accuracy. Samples were re-analyzed using the pulps or coarse rejects that had been securely stored at  the  ALS  warehouses  in  Winnemucca  or  Reno.  Re-analysis  values  generally  reported  similar lithium ppm results compared to the original assay values with a margin of difference between zero and ±10%.

The LAC QA-QC program used standard samples obtained from the Project  area, duplicate pulp samples and laboratory  blanks  to  determine  the  precision  and  accuracy  of  the  laboratory  results. Dr. Smee monitored the data throughout the Stage I Lens drilling program. A final review of the data was performed by Dr. Smee on August 20, 2011 and he concluded: 'The Kings Valley analytical data appears to conform to the requirements of NI 43-101 Best Practices. The Li data is accurate and free from contamination. The sampling precision is within Industry Best Practices expectations.'

SRK reviewed the data and concurs that both the precision and accuracy of lithium analysis for the Stage I Lens are acceptable.

The total number of blank, duplicate and standard samples analyzed by the laboratory was 11% of the  total  samples  assayed.  There  are  additional  checks  that  are  being  recommended  for  future drilling programs. These include:

- · Check coarse duplicates (after first crush, usually -10 mesh material)
- · Send pulp and coarse duplicates to a second laboratory
- · Add a standard in the 1,500 to 2,500 ppm Li range (to ensure adequate accuracy around the presumed economic Cut-off grades)
- · Add of a potassium standard (obtained from the Stage I area)

Finally, SRK recommends that the protocols and procedures for QA-QC are compiled and made part of an  overall  QA-QC  document  for  the  Project,  to  include  field  sampling  practices,  sample preparation and assaying protocols, laboratory QA-QC and database validation.

## 10.1.6 Security

LAC stores core from their drill program in a secure core logging/sampling facility that is locked when authorized personnel are not present and until they are shipped to the assay laboratory.

LAC  security  employed  during  the  drilling  program  is  considered  adequate  and  meets  industry standards.  The  possibility  of  significant  tampering  with  samples  while  in  the  custody  of  LAC  was unlikely because of the amount of lithium required to significantly change the tenor of core or cuttings samples. SRK recommends that all future sampling programs employ an expanded sample security protocol  that  includes  formal  chain  of  custody  documentation.  The  security  procedures  should  be part  of  a  larger  QA-QC  program  to  ensure  consistent  practices  along  the  entire  sequence  of processes, from the field to the building of the electronic database.

## 10.2 Stage II

Most of the information presented in this section is based on the corresponding section of the URS report: NI 43-101 Technical Report Preliminary Assessment and Economic Evaluation, Kings Valley project,  Humboldt  County,  Nevada,  USA,  effective  date  December  31,  2009.  The  text  has  been standardized and updated for this report.

## 10.2.1 Sample Preparation - Chevron

Few records of sample preparation procedures exist for the project. Hand-written notes indicate that core was split and one-half was archived. The other half was crushed in a jaw crusher and then split 'until  a  single  representative sample bag' was obtained. The mass of the sample is not specified. The remainder of the split was retained in labeled bags.

Chip samples were split and one-half retained. The second split was prepared as above. The mass or granulometry of the final analytical split is not specified nor has AMEC located records of those data.

Details  of  crushing,  splitting,  and  pulverization  are  not  provided.  During  the  time  covered  by  this Cone  Geochemical  Inc.  (the  primary  analytical  laboratory)  routinely  dried  the  samples  at  120 o C, crushed to 10#, split 150 g minimum with a riffle splitter, and pulverized to 150 # with a steel ring and puck  mill  unless  otherwise  directed  by  their  customer.  There  is  no  record  of  variance  from  this procedure for these samples.

The record suggests that sample splitting and bagging was performed by Chevron employees and that the entire sample was sent to the analytical laboratory for final preparation and analysis. There is no indication in the record that company employees were involved with final sample preparation.

## 10.2.2 Sample Preparation - LAC

LAC used ALS Chemex (ALS) of Reno, Nevada as their primary assay laboratory for their Stage II Lens 2009 drill campaign.  ALS is  an ISO  9001:2000 certified  laboratory,  also  an  ISO/IEC 17025certified Quality Systems, and participates in the Society of Mineral Analysts round robin testing.

Sample preparation at ALS begins with drying the sample at a typical 110-120°C. Then, the entire sample is crushed with a roll crusher to 90% passing -6 #. A nominal 250 g split is taken using a riffle splitter, which is pulverized using a ring mill to 90% passing -150 #. These preparation procedures are deemed appropriate for the mineralized material from Stage II Lens.

## 10.2.3 Analysis - Chevron

Samples were analyzed for Li at Cone Geochemical, Inc. (Cone) and Skyline Labs, Inc. (Skyline) by dissolving  0.1  g  of  sample  in  boiling  HF-HNO3-HClO4  boiled  to  dryness.  The  residue  was  then dissolved in 6N HCl, diluted to 100 ml with H2O, and read on an atomic absorption spectrometer (AA).  This  four  acid  digestion  is  an  industry  standard  procedure.  Skyline  experimented  with  a number of other procedures, but the record indicates that they used the four acid digestion followed by AA determination as the primary analytical procedure. In most cases, Li was reported as ppm, but in some cases, Li2O was reported as percent. In the database, Li2O was converted to Li (ppm).

A small number of samples were analyzed for As, Sb, Au, Ag, Zn, Mo, and MgO. Arsenic, Antimony and  Au  were  determined  by  digestion  in  aqua  regia  followed  by  AA.  Mo,  Zn,  Ag,  and  MgO  were determined by four acid digestion followed by AA. These are standard analytical procedures.

There were no available certifications  for  Cone  and  Skyline  at  the  time  the  work  was  performed; however, both labs were well respected and widely used by the mining and environmental industries.

## 10.2.4 Analysis - LAC

ALS used Inductively  Coupled  Plasma  Mass  Spectroscopy  (ICP-MS)  combined  with  conventional atomic emission plasma spectroscopy (ICP-AES) to provide extended sensitivity analytical capability.  While  originally  designed  for  very  low,  geochemical  assays  for  metal  exploration  and reconnaissance programs, GeoSystems International Inc. (GSI) believes that these methods can be applied to the Stage II Lens samples.

After  a  4-acid  digestion,  ALS's  ME-MS61  analytical  package  initially  analyzes  the  samples  using ICP-AES to pre-screen them, ensuring that no elevated metal concentrations are present. Elevated metal concentrations (defined as &gt;1% of an individual base metal, or &gt;3% cumulative) cannot be introduced to a plasma mass spectrometer without causing cross contamination.   Samples showing elevated  metal  concentrations  are  not  analyzed  by  ICP-MS  but  will  only  have  ICP-AES  data reported.  Along  with  a  full  geochemical  suite,  this  method  was  used  to  analyze  three  of  the  four elements  of  interest  to  the  Stage  II  Resource  Estimate,  lithium,  potassium,  and  sodium.  Several other  elements were also analyzed and reported, but they are beyond the scope of this technical report.

Fluorine was analyzed with a specific fusion method, which uses sodium carbonate and potassium nitrate to solubilize it in an alkaline environment to prevent volatilization. The method was calibrated differently depending on the concentration: ALS's F-ELE81a method is used when the concentration of F is less than 20,000 ppm; F-ELE82a is used for F concentrations greater than 20,000 ppm. Both methods are standard for the industry.

## 10.2.5 Density

LAC submitted 26 core samples from the Stage II Lens to ALS Chemex in Reno Nevada for density determinations. Density was determined by two methods; 21 samples were tested using the paraffin coated method (ASTM Designation C914-95), while one other sample was tested using the method described  in  ASTM  C127-04,  test  for  Aggregate  materials.    Both  are  standard  methods.    The remaining 4 samples were lost due to disintegration when applying the wax coat or when hydrating.

The material received was weighed, the weight reported and then dried at 75°C for 24 hours. The dry  material  was  then  weighed  again  and  the  weight  reported.  A  rock  density  test  was  then completed on the dry material using a wax immersion procedure. Table 10.2 shows the in-situ dry density values used in the resource model.

Table 10.2: Density Data Used for Resource Estimation.

| Unit              |   Average Density Value (t/m )  3 |   Density Value used in  the  Resource Model |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Alluvial          |                              1.52 |                                         1.52 |
| Claystone Average |                              1.95 |                                         1.96 |
| Ash Average       |                              1.99 |                                         1.96 |
| Fang. Average     |                              1.91 |                                         1.96 |
| Silicified        |                              1.94 |                                         1.96 |
| Bedrock Average   |                              2.23 |                                         2.23 |

Density determinations were performed using standard procedures and are adequate for resource estimation.  GSI  recommends,  however,  that  additional  density  data  be  collected  during  the  next round of drilling.

## 10.2.6 Quality Control - Chevron

AMEC found four duplicate samples analyzed by Cone in the data provided. Those results suggest that the precision was adequate, but there are insufficient data to reach any meaningful conclusions.

Otherwise,  no  independent quality control measures were in place.  During this  time period, Cone normally analyzed a single duplicate sample and a single standard sample in each analytical batch, but those data were not routinely provided to their customers and are thus not part of the record of this project.

These are the only results that can be identified as quality control results. This is typical of the time period although it was normal to send a number of samples to a second laboratory specifically for check assays. Relative to current industry standards, quality control for the Chevron analytical work on this project was substandard. The results were verified by drilling three twin holes in the PCD lens and comparing Chevron grades to LAC grades (see Section 10.2.8).  Also, GSI compared globally the Chevron Li grades to the LAC grades globally for the claystone unit in the Stage II Lens, and found no significant differences.

## 10.2.7 Quality Control - LAC

Quality  assurance-quality  control  (QA-QC)  by  LAC  consists  of  standard  samples,  blank  analyses, and duplicate analyses. Duplicate analyses were performed on pulp samples at ALS. Those samples were prepared and analyzed in the same batch as the original sample.

## Blank Samples

Blanks  are  used  to  check  if  there  is  any  possible  contamination  during  sample  preparation  and analyses. There were 41 blanks analyzed for the 2009 Stage II Lens campaign, about 3% of the total number of assays sent for analysis.

There  are  some  slightly  anomalous  values  for  Li  when  a  practical  detection  limit  10  times  the nominal detection limit is defined, in this Case 20 ppm. This value is also very close to the average Li value of all 41 blank samples. Given the range of values for Li that are considered mineralized is 50 to 100 times the returned Li values, GSI does not consider this to be a significant issue. Figure 10.6 shows the results of the Lithium Blanks.

GSI concluded that the blank samples appear to indicate that there is little, if any, contamination in the analytical process, and considered results from the blanks to all be acceptable.

## Duplicate Samples

Duplicate samples were run from the same pulps as the original assay. They provide information about the precision of the analytical procedure. Precision can be estimated by calculating the relative error of the duplicate pairs:

Relative Error

<!-- image -->

The cumulative frequency of the relative error (RE) is generally calculated for samples containing more than 20 times the laboratory-reported detection limit. Samples near the detection limit tend to result in high relative errors due to their low values. The 80th and 90th percentile relative error are reasonable measures often used to estimate precision. Table 10.3 shows both RE percentiles for all samples and for the four elements of interest, Li, K, F, and Na.

Table 10.3: Relative Errors from duplicate samples, Stage II Lens LAC drilling.

| Element   | 80 th  Percentile RE (%)   | 90 th  Percentile RE (%)   |
|-----------|----------------------------|----------------------------|
| Li        | ±11.1%                     | ±13.1                      |
| K         | ±10.6%                     | ±14.2                      |
| F         | ±15.3%                     | ±19.5%                     |
| Na        | ±18.2%                     | ±22.2%                     |

Figure 10.7 shows the cumulative data frequency vs. RE for Li. GSI considers that the results from the duplicate samples are acceptable for Li and K, the two main economic drivers of the project; the precision of F and Na is lower than desired.

Sodium is not a major project driver, nor is the relative lack of precision of its samples (compared to the  other  elements)  expected  to  impact  project  economics.  In  the  Case  of  F,  it  does  impact metallurgical  processing.  GSI  believes  that  the  relative  low  precision  of  the  F  samples  is  more related to the use of different methods in the analysis. Also, as shown in Section 13.2, Li and F have a very strong positive correlation, which suggests that the F sampled values could be checked or calibrated stochiometrically from Li values. The strong correlation suggests that the only source of F appears to be the same hectorite clay.

## Standards

LAC used two standards from Li-bearing clays found in the project area, one whose accepted value is  3,379 ppm Li, and the other 4,217 ppm Li. Those standards were used in the 2009 exploration work of the Stage II Lens and show that the Li data are reasonably accurate. Figure 10.8 and Figure 10.9  show  the  laboratory  performance  with  respect  to  the  two  standards.  Note  that  there  is  only sample (G911056) that is significantly lower than the standard, which was sent to reanalysis.

## 10.2.8 Discussion of QA-QC

QA-QC for the Chevron data is substandard relative to current best practices. However; twin holes drilled by LAC at PCD largely confirmed the location and tenor of the mineralization; also, estimating the resources using ordinary kriging and the Chevron holes compared to the LAC holes only result in very  similar  estimates;  in  GSI's  opinion,  this  validates  at  least  globally  that  the  Chevron  data  are adequate to use for future resource work.

LAC QA-QC utilizes standard samples, duplicate samples, and blanks to check the precision and accuracy of the laboratory results. GSI believes that both the precision  and  accuracy  of Li and K analyses for the Stage II Lens is adequate. Likewise, the F and Na analysis are deemed adequate for resource estimation, although further improvements to increase data precision are suggested.

The total number of check samples analyzed by the laboratory was about 8% of the total samples assayed. There are additional checks that are being recommended for future drilling at the Stage II Lens,  including  checking  coarse  duplicates  (after  first  crush,  usually  -10  #  material);  and  sending pulp and coarse duplicates to a second laboratory. Adding also a standard in the 1,500 to 2,500 ppm Li range would allow ensuring adequate accuracy around the presumed economic cut-off grades, as well  as  adding  standards  for  K  and  F,  at  least,  all  from  moat  sediment  material  from  the  same McDermitt caldera.

Finally, GSI recommends that the protocols and procedures for QA-QC be written down and made part  of  an  overall  QA  document  for  the  project,  to  include  field  sampling  practices,  sample preparation and assaying protocols, laboratory QA-QC, and database validation.

## 10.2.9 Security

## Chevron

GSI is not aware of any security measures for samples from this project. Based on the time-frame in which  the  data  were  collected,  it  is  reasonable  to  suspect,  as  AMEC  did,  that  no  formal  security measures  were  in  place.  Because  Li  occurs  in  relatively  high  concentrations  and  the  generally unavailability of Li compounds that could be used to tamper with the samples, AMEC believed that tampering with the samples was unlikely, and GSI agrees that this conclusion also applies to Stage II Lens material.

## LAC

LAC stores core from their drill  program in a lockable core logging/sampling facility that is locked when no one is present. Samples are stored in a locked facility until they are shipped to the assay laboratory.

## Discussion

Security during the Chevron drill programs was typical for the time period. LAC security is adequate. The possibility  of significant tampering  with samples in the custody of Chevron or LAC is unlikely because of the amount of Li required to significantly change the tenor of core or cuttings samples. GSI  recommended  that  all  future  sampling  programs  have  a  rigorous  sample  security,  including formal chain of custody documentation. This document should be part of a larger QA-QC document, to ensure consistent practices along the entire sequence of processes, from the field to the building of the electronic database.

## 10.2.10 Qualified Person Statement

The  Qualified  Persons  are  of  the  opinion  that  the  sample  preparation,  security  and  analytical procedures for the drill data for Stage I and Stage II areas are adequate for the inclusion in resource estimation.

## 11 Data Verification

## 11.1 Stage I

## 11.1.1 Data Verification Procedures

For resource estimation purposes Mr. Timothy Carew compiled an assay and lithological database from assay compilations and summary geological logs supplied by LAC, in spreadsheet format. LAC maintains  a  tracking  chart  (Excel  spreadsheets)  that  is  used  to  match  analytical  data  from  ALS (provided electronically in the form of both Excel spreadsheets, and secured PDF assay certificates) to  the  intervals  logged  by  the  geologists,  and  referenced  to  duplicate  sample  tags  (Sample  ID) stapled  into  the  core  boxes.  LAC  also  maintains  a  master  chart  to  track  and  manage  QA-QC samples, the data provided to Mr. Carew was excerpted from this database. Mr. Carew obtained the certified  assay  certificates  for  a  sample  of  10%  of  the  assay  intervals,  chosen  at  random,  for comparison with the assay data imported into the resource database.  No discrepancies were noted in  this  comparison  exercise.  Only  a  relatively  small  number  of  inconsistencies  in  intervals  in  the import and data validation process were detected, which were well below 1% of the total intervals and were corrected with LAC.

## 11.1.2 Drill Core and Geologic Logs

Mr. Carew has reviewed the LAC drill core and logging procedures and found them to be adequate for  this  study.  Some  inconsistent  and  duplicate  geologic  codes  were  discussed  with  LAC  and rectified through the use of standard codes, both in ongoing logging and retroactive modification.

## 11.1.3 Topography

The topographic surface utilized in the estimate was provided by LAC in 3D DTM and contour format (DWG), and was based on aerial photography dated July 6, 2010. The flyover resolution was 0.35 m. Ground control  was established by  Desert-Mountain  Surveying, a Nevada licensed land surveyor, using  Trimble  equipment.  Field  surveys  of  drillhole  collars,  spot-heights  and,  ground  truthing  was conducted  by  Mr.  Dave  Rowe,  MXS,  Inc.,  a  Nevada  licensed  land  surveyor,  using  Trimble equipment. A comparison of surveyed collars to the topography DTM highlighted inconsistencies for a small number of collars, which were investigated and rectified in conjunction with Mr. Rowe.

## 11.1.4 Verification of Analytical Data

Mr. Carew has not undertaken any verification of analytical data in the form of independent samples.

## 11.1.5 Data Adequacy

Based  on  the  various  reviews,  validation  exercises  and  remedies  outlined  above,  Mr.  Carew concluded that the data provided was adequate for use in the resource estimate.

## 11.2 Stage II

Extensive  verification  work  was  undertaken  by  AMEC  (AMEC,  2008),  including  comparison  of lithological/assay  data  to  original  documentation,  and  independent  sampling  that  confirmed  the presence and general grade of the samples. Mr. Rossi (GSI) did not consider it necessary to repeat the process for the Stage II Lens, as it is part of the same deposit and it was surveyed using the same equipment and resulted in the same general conclusions with respect to the Chevron holes as

for Stage I Lens. Mr. Rossi (GSI) reviewed this information and concluded that the data for Stage II lens was adequate for the use in the resource estimate.

## 12 Mineral Processing and Metallurgical Testing

## 12.1 Stage I

## 12.1.1 Introduction

LAC has continued  process  development,  including  bench  and  pilot  size  programs  for  major  unit operations,  and  verification  for  lithium  extraction  from  the  Lithium  Nevada  clay  deposits  and advanced the previous work reported in the PAEE (URS 2010). The process was originally based on the USBM work in the McDermitt caldera reported in 1988. The metallurgical testwork commissioned by LAC for the 2012 prefeasibility study (Tetra Tech 2012) included programs specific to calcination and the evaporative crystallization process.

Following size reduction, the thermal ore preparation process involved calcining the ore mixed with anhydrite and dolomite to convert the silicates to sulfates for leaching. Recoverable metals included lithium, potassium and sodium. The calcine was leached in water recovering the sulfates to solution.

The wet recovery process included evaporation and crystallization stages to recover potassium and sodium as sulfates along with lithium as a carbonate, a material suitable for battery manufacture.

The 2012 prefeasibility study (Tetra Tech 2012) has concluded that it would be necessary to perform a continuous small pilot scale operation. Owing to this recommendation, LAC has proposed to build a  demonstration  plant  to  prove  the  process  and  demonstrate  continuous  production  for  the manufacture of battery grade lithium carbonate from the hectorite clay.  LAC contracted  with URS and K-UTEC Salt Technologies (K-UTEC) to prepare a report titled: Western Lithium Demonstration Plant Basic Engineering Report, dated December 2013.

The demonstration plant was initiated in 2014. The ongoing metallurgical testwork has determined that additional specific engineering work will be required to optimize the front end of the process to produce  a  clean  and  concentrated  lithium  brine  on  a  commercial  scale.  As  a  result  of  the  recent metallurgical  testwork  findings  and  technological  advancements  in  producing  lithium  compounds from brines, LAC has determined that its prefeasibility study completed in March 2012 (Tetra Tech 2012) is no longer current and LAC will no longer be relying on the study for its project development planning.

Section 12.3 provides a summary of the additional testwork, which has been done after the release of the 2012 prefeasibility study (Tetra Tech 2012).

## 12.1.2 Metallurgical Testwork

## Hazen

Hazen  Research,  Inc.  (Hazen)  in  Golden,  Colorado  was  contracted  by  LAC  to  continue  process development, define process parameters for calcining and Li2CO3 production, and adapt the process to semi-continuous operation.

The work was performed in two phases. Phase I explored bench-scale kiln operating parameters, investigated purification concepts including ion exchange, and provided recommendations for scaleup to a semi-continuous process. The objective of Phase II was to incorporate the results from the Phase I work and produce 1 kg of lithium carbonate.

## Phase I

Testwork was performed on samples of oxidized and unoxidized mineralized material from drillholes WLC-13 and WLC-20.

Twenty-eight rotary kiln experiments and accompanying leaches were performed to examine optimal temperature, residence time, gas environment, powdered versus pelletized feed and reagent blend ratios for lithium recovery.

Two fluid-bed calcining experiments were performed for comparison with rotary kiln results.

An investigation to identify a suitable ion exchange (IX) resin for purification of the Li2CO3 product was completed.

Two mineralogical evaluations were undertaken.

Results  were  reported  in  the  report  entitled  Phase  I  Lithium  Recovery  Pilot  Plant  Development, Hazen Project 11103-07, issued June 13, 2011.

## Phase II

The  samples  for  this  work  were  obtained  from  test  pit  WLT-02  located  in  the  south  end  of  the McDemitt caldera near the reserve defined in this study, (K-UTEC Sample, December 7, 2011).

Semi-continuous pilot calcination was conducted at 1000°C for 45 minutes on a mixture of one-part ore to 0.4 parts each of anhydrite and dolomite. Leaching was conducted at 90-95°C for a retention time  of  one  hour.  Ion  exchange  was  utilized  to  remove  calcium  from  the  brine.  Potassium  and sodium were evaporated to glaserite prior  to  Li2CO3  precipitation  with  Na2CO3.  Purification  of  the Li2CO3 was accomplished by repulping and CO2 dissolution, a step considered unnecessary in the final flowsheet.

## K-UTEC

Laboratory-scale testwork to verify and advance the LAC wet recovery process was performed at K-UTEC AG Salt Technologies, Sondershausen, Germany (K-UTEC). Three phases of work were commissioned by LAC: Phase One performed process verification on synthetic brine, Phase Two verified the Phase 1 work on calcined ore (by Outotec) from the deposit, and Phase Three provided design parameters, a mass balance and capital and operating cost estimates for the wet plant.

Based  on  the  K-  UTEC  test  results,  overall  recovery  of  the  metals  is  87.2%  Li,  77.7%  K  and 82.7% Na.

## CICITEM

LAC  engaged  Centro  de  Investigación  Científico  Tecnológico  para  la  Minería  (CICITEM)  at  the University  of  Antofagasta  in  Chile  to  develop  baseline  information  of  phase  diagrams  for  the crystallization  process  that  included  the  separation  of  sodium  and  potassium  sulfates  from  lithium sulfate.

The results of the CICITEM work are published in Potassium Sulfate Recovery Process from Li2CO3 'Barren Solution,' Without Addition of Potassium Chloride - Phase 1 of Test Work Program, dated July 27, 2010.

Additional flowsheet development is based on this testwork performed on simulated lithium barren solutions. A review of this testwork by URS suggests the flowsheet can be simplified to remove the acidification step following Li2CO3 precipitation.

## Outotec

Outotec  GmbH,  Oberursel/Frankfurt  am  Main,  Germany  (Outotec)  was  commissioned  by  LAC  to perform  advanced  granulating  and  calcining  tests  utilizing  a  laboratory  fluidized  bed  calciner. Additional  granulation  testwork  was  performed  confirming  the  ability  of  the  granules  to  maintain

integrity through the calcination process. The tests confirmed a fluidized bed unit is suitable for the WLC Kings Valley  process;  the  results  indicated  the  recovery  of  lithium  in  the  subsequent  leach circuit was seven points lower than that achieved utilizing a rotary calciner. LAC elected to advance the  project  incorporating  a  rotary  unit.  A  portion  of  the  calcine  generated  in  the  testwork  was forwarded to K-UTEC for the Phase II testing.

## 12.1.3 Other Factors

Confirmation of the required addition of anhydrite and dolomite per tonne of ore to achieve design product recovery is recommended for the next phase of the project.

Verification of the suitability of coal for direct-firing the calciner and quantification of the associated energy requirements is recommended for the next phase of testwork.

Analysis of the calciner off-gas from the coal-fired calcining tests is recommended to provide a basis for treatment requirements.

Identification of corrosive gases from the calcination process in the testwork to date suggests future work to quantify the content and volume of gas flows for materials selection in calcining equipment and gas-handling ductwork.

Confirmation of the revised flowsheet that does not incorporate the acidification step is recommended.

## 12.2 Stage II

LAC engaged KCA in 2009 to undertake experimental laboratory work with the goal of studying a thermal process for extracting lithium from lithium-bearing clays obtained from the Lithium Nevada deposit in Nevada. The basis of the testwork is derived from prior work completed by the USBM in 1988 and from the experience of KCA personnel.

The findings of the  KCA  testwork program were the basis for the process design criteria  and  are described in detail in Section 16 of URS' Technical Report:  NI 43-101 Technical Report Preliminary Assessment  and  Economic  Evaluation,  Kings  Valley  project,  Humboldt  County,  Nevada,  USA, effective date December 31, 2009.

Overall, the process originally proposed by the USBM to extract lithium from the lithium bearing clays described above was proven to be viable. The metallurgical samples taken seem representative of the material being tested. While KCA performed the metallurgical tests on material from the Stage I Lens, GSI believes that the previous USBM and the mineralogical similarities between the Stage I and Stage II lenses are a reasonable basis for assuming that Li-rich clays from the Stage II Lens could be beneficiated in a similar manner. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that this Stage II Lens  estimate  indeed  qualifies  as  a  resource.  However,  further  metallurgical  testing,  specific  to Stage  II  Lens  clays,  would  be  necessary  to  estimate  mineral  reserves  and  perform  economic analyses.

The  process  development  work  conducted  under  Stage  II  has  been  superseded  by  technologies advanced in the Stage I development program.

## 12.3 Post 2012 Technical Report Testwork

Additional  testwork,  which  has  been  done  after  the  release  of  the  2012  prefeasibility  study (Tetra Tech 2012), is summarized further in this section.

## K-UTEC

Lithium carbonate precipitation and purification with carbon dioxide were conducted at K-UTEC AG Salt Technologies,  Sondershausen,  Germany.  The  purified  brine  used  for  lithium  carbonate precipitation was generated during a pilot run by Kappes, Cassidy &amp; Associates (KCA) in Nevada, USA.

## IBUtec

Calcination pilot testwork has been successfully conducted at Hazen and KCA from 2010 to 2011. However, all of these runs were conducted in an indirect fire with electric rotary kiln. In a commercial plant,  it  is  common  to  use  a  direct  fire  rotary  kiln  with  natural  gas  or  coal.  In  order  to  confirm  the behavior  of  Lithium  Nevada  lithium  clay  in  a  direct  fire  kiln,  a  lab  testwork  and  pilot  run  were conducted  at  IBUtec  in  Weimar,  Germany  in  2013.  One-ton  of  representative  clay  material  was shipped to IBUtec for the testwork.

The lab testwork was conducted with a muffler furnace and Carbolite kiln, which is a semi batch kiln apparatus  and  more  compatible  to  a  rotary  kiln  than  a  muffle  furnace.  The  lab  testwork  was  to familiarize the material and check temperature-residence-time behavior and burnability of materials. The pilot runs were carried out using a direct heated kiln of 0.3 x 7 m with natural gas.

The  calcined  materials  were  leached  at  K-UTEC  in  Germany.  The  leaching  experiments  show  a maximum recovery for lithium of 91.5% with 89.7% K, and 90.2% Na at the design conditions. It was confirmed that the lithium clay material is able to be calcined in a direct fire kiln and get high lithium and potassium recoveries.

## Demonstration Plant

The demonstration plant  was  initiated  in  2014.  The  initial  work  consisted  of  detailed  engineering, procurement of equipment and installation of a 125 kg/day lithium carbonate facility at the K-UTEC site in Sondershausen, Germany. The objectives were to demonstrate the technical and economic viability  of  the  Lithium  Nevada  extraction  process  and  to  validate  the  design  parameters  and equipment for the Definitive Feasibility Study. The processing program was planned to run in three campaigns  at  two  sites  to  ensure  logistics.  A  dry  process,  which  consists  of  pelletizing  and calcination,  was  conducted  at  IBUtec  in Weimar,  Germany;  and  a  wet  process,  which  consists  of leaching, purification, evaporation/crystallization, precipitation, etc., was conducted at K-UTEC.

The  design is summarized  in  the  two volumes  of preliminary documentation  'Design  and Implementation  Planning  of  a  Pilot  Plant  to  Manufacture  Lithium  Carbonate  from  a  Hectorite Containing Ore' issued November 18, 2014.

A  total  of  80  super  sacks  of  the  oxidized  clay,  108  super  sacks  of  the  unoxidized  clay,  74  super sacks of dolomite, and 79 super sacks of anhydrite were shipped from Reno, Nevada to IBUtec in Weimar, Germany. All materials were ground to 100 mesh (150 µm) before shipping.

The  first  campaign,  which  focused  on  validating  the  design  and  equipment  performance  using oxidized clay was run during August 2014 to December 2014. The objective of the second campaign is to test the oxidized material commenced in early 2015 and is ongoing. The third campaign is to verify the suitability of the unoxidized material. Some modification of equipment will be done prior to the start of the third campaign to make the process more efficient.

The  results  from  both  the  first  and  second  campaigns  have  shown  the  process  is  viable.  Metal recoveries  for  Li, K  and  Na  all  equalled  or  exceeded  the  design  parameters.  High  purity  lithium carbonate and potassium sulfate were produced during the Demo plant campaign. A complete report containing detailed results will be issued by K-UTEC after the completion of the campaign.

## 13 Mineral Resource Estimates

## 13.1 Stage I

In June 2011 LAC engaged Reserva International, LLC (Reserva or Timothy Carew) to complete a resource estimate for the Stage I Lens within the Project, located in Humboldt County, Nevada. The resource estimate was made from a three-dimensional block model using commercial mine planning software (Gemcom GEMS™). The main estimated elements are lithium (Li) and potassium (K), but estimates were also made for sodium, magnesium, aluminum, calcium and iron, in addition to minor elements molybdenum, rubidium, strontium, chromium, titanium, arsenic and barium. The estimates are current as of May 31, 2016, the effective date of this section of the report.

Table 13.1 shows the total estimated resources for the Stage I Lens. SRK is of the opinion that, at a 2,000  ppm  (0.20%)  lithium  cut-off,  the  Stage  I  Lens  has  reasonable  prospects  for  economic extraction  by  open-pit  mining.  Lithium  carbonate  would  be  the  primary  product,  associated  with potassium and sodium as by-product. The resources are reported using a lithium cut-off.

- · Measured resources are in blocks estimated using at least three drillholes and five composites within a 100 × 75 m search radius in the horizontal plane and 10 m in the vertical direction.
- · Indicated  resources  are  in  blocks  estimated  using  at  least  two  drillholes  and  four  composites within a 200 × 150 m search radius in the horizontal plane and 20 m in the vertical direction.
- · Inferred resources are blocks estimated with at least three composites within a search radius of 300 m × 225 m in the horizontal plane and 30 m in the vertical plane.

The density values used in the model are shown in Table 13.3. See Section 10.1.3 for details on how density was determined.

Note that rounding errors may occur in Table 13.1 and that the contained metal does not account for mine  or  metallurgical  recovery.  The  conversion  factor  from  Li  %  to  LCE  (lithium  carbonate equivalent) is 5.323. This factor is determined from the proportion of lithium in the molecular weight of lithium carbonate (Li2CO3), as follows:

molecular weight Li2CO3 = (2 × 6.941) + (12.011) + (3 ×15.9994) = 5.323

```
molecular weight 2 x Li                        ( 2 × 6.941)
```

Notes:

- 1. Mineral resources are not mineral reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability. There is no certainty that all or any part of the mineral resource will be converted into mineral reserves.
- 2. Resources presented at a Li% 0.20 cut-off grade which was determined using the following economic assumptions: US$3.36  Li  carbonate/lb;  87.2%  metallurgical  recovery;  US$66/tonne  ore  processed;  US$2.75/tonne  material moved.

Mineral resources are sensitive to the cut-off grade selection. Table 13.2 lists the mineral resource for the Stage I area at various cut-off grades to demonstrate the sensitivity of the mineral resources at various cut-offs. The reader is cautioned that the grade and tonnages presented in these figures should not be misconstrued as a mineral resource statement.

Notes:

- 1. Mineral resources are not mineral reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability.
- 2. There is no certainty that all or any part of the mineral resource will be converted into mineral reserves.
- 3. The  base  case  cut-off  grade  (0.20%)  is  highlighted  in  these  tables.  Economic  assumptions  for  cut-off  grade determination are: US$17.88/lb Li; 87.2% metallurgical recovery; US$66/tonne processing; US$2.75/tonne mining

Table 13.3: Density Values used in the Stage I Lens Resource Model

| Lithology           |   Average  Density (t/m )  3 |
|---------------------|------------------------------|
| Alluvium            |                         1.52 |
| Claystone (average) |                         1.79 |
| Basalt              |                         2.51 |

All of the holes have been drilled vertically except for WLC-58 (-70 degree dip, 180 degree azimuth) and are assumed to not have deviated. LAC has checked this assumption with downhole surveys of 23 holes in the Stage I Lens. Results indicate very little deviation of vertical holes (minimum dip: -90, maximum  dip:  -88.2,  average  dip:  89.5)  and  support  the  assumption  of  verticality  for  previously drilled holes.

## 13.1.1 Geologic Model

Project limits and coordinates are in UTM NAD 27 easting northing and elevation values and are in meters. The block model geometry is summarized in Table 13.4. The  block size selected for the Stage  I  Lens  modeling  is  30m  ×  30m  ×  3m,  which  is  considered  reasonable  given  the  drillhole spacing and the fact that the block model represents open pit resources.

The drillhole database used for geologic modeling and resource estimation was closed on June 28, 2011. The last drillhole for which assay data was available was WLC-200. A total of 197 holes drilled by LAC (see Section 9, Drilling), and cores were assayed at ALS Labs and were used for estimation purposes. A plan view of the drillhole collars is shown in Figure 13.1 below. The average horizontal spacing of the drillholes varies from a nominal 180 m × 180 m, to 61 m × 61 m in the more closely drilled central portion of the deposit.

The Stage I Lens mineralization  is controlled by  volcaniclastic  moat  sedimentary rocks containing lithium-rich claystone. Sectional interpretations (for E-W and N-S transects) were generated by LAC from drill  logs  for  alluvium,  claystone  (moat  sediments),  basalt,  a  silicified  unit,  and  bedrock.  Two oxidation surfaces were also interpreted, one just below alluvium and another near the claystone/silicified interface. Additionally, a series of faults have been interpreted by LAC based on drillhole  data  and  were  incorporated  in  the  geologic  interpretation.    The  approach  taken  was  to develop a set of 3-D triangulated surfaces representing the topographic surface and the interfaces between  the  overburden,  claystone  and  volcanics/silicified  rocks.  A  fault  surface  was  created  in order to enhance the quality of interpretation. The volume (solid) between the modeled overburden and basement was treated as a single domain for estimation and resource reporting purposes. A 3-D perspective of the faulted basement surface and surface expression of the faults is shown in Figure 13.2.  The  surfaces  and  solids  were  used  to  code  the  block  model  by  lithology  domains  within GEMS™. A lithologic domain is a volume considered as a single entity for modeling purposes. All claystone  rock  types,  intercalated  ash  layers  and  occurrences  of  basalt  were  treated  as  a  single domain. Figure 13.3 shows an N-S cross section (looking west) with the interpreted domain surfaces shown; also illustrated in this figure is the topography and the drillholes color coded by the rock type codes. Reserva checked the consistency of the interpreted domain codes against LAC drillhole logs in section and plan and found it acceptable.

## 13.1.2 Assays

As of June 28, 2011 a total of 197 core holes had been drilled by LAC in the Stage I Lens. Assay data for these holes was used for estimating grade. Detailed and/or summary lithological logs were available for all holes and were used in the modeling of the lithological surfaces and domains. See Section 0 for a description of the core sampling process. The data was imported into the GEMS™ project database. The average length of the assay intervals was approximately 1.5 m.

## 13.1.3 Exploratory Data Analysis

The relationships among the assay values for the major elements (lithium, potassium) and among the  other  elements  of  interest  were  analyzed  by  constructing  a  correlation  matrix  of  the  data,  as illustrated in Table 13.6. Correlations greater than the absolute value of 0.5 are highlighted.

Lithium and potassium, with a correlation of 0.289, can be considered to be not strongly correlated. The strongest  correlation  for  both  Li  and  K  elements  is  with  the  minor  element  rubidium.  Lithium exhibits a moderate positive correlation (0.536) with magnesium and exhibits a negative correlation (-0.570) with aluminum. These correlations are related to the mineral composition. The moderate to strong correlations (both positive and negative) among the minor elements are not significant to the resource estimate.

A boxplot (Figure 13.4) generated with assay lithium values illustrates the variation in concentrations with respect to rock type.

Figure 13.5 illustrates that there is a distinct range of lithium values in the claystone rock types, with the  highest  values  occurring  in  the  carbonaceous  claystones.  These  relationships  are  consistent across the deposit. Lithium values in the intercalated ash layers and basalt are distinctly lower. It should  be  noted  that  the  high  maximum  value  exhibited  is  likely  due  to  differences  in  the interpretations made by various geologists during logging.

Although there are notable variations in the lithium content by rock type, it has not been possible to establish the lateral continuity of individual rock types at this time due to the nature of the deposit and  current  drillhole  spacing.  Given  the  additional  indication  that  bulk  mining  methods  would  be employed,  it  was  decided  to  treat  the  various  claystone  units  as  a  single  geological  domain  for modeling  purposes.  The  continuity  of  lithium grades  within this domain,  as  established  by variographic analysis, is considered to be reasonable, and is the basis for resource classification in compliance  with  CIM  Definition  Standards  (2014).  The  following  histograms  and  probability  plots (Figure  13.5,  Figure  13.6,  Figure 13.7,  and  Figure  13.8)  for  lithium  and  potassium  are,  therefore, based on all rock types.

## 13.1.4 Composites

Assay values were not capped prior to compositing because probability plots showed continuity and the domain composite coefficient of variation (CV; standard deviation/mean), was relatively low. The overall  CV  for  lithium  assays  was  0.627,  while  potassium  had  a  CV  of  0.487.  Figure  13.9  and Figure 13.10 show the histogram and probability plots of the lithium and potassium assay  values. High  grade  restrictions  on  composites  were,  however,  used  in  the  estimation,  as  detailed  in Section 13.1.6 below.

Down-hole compositing was done for 1.5 meter lengths. This length was chosen because it is onehalf the vertical block size of 3 meters. This limited the effects of smoothing in grade interpolation. The  composites  were  coded  by  back-tagging  against  the  rock  type  block  model  reflecting  the lithology domains. Since there a limited number of assays from the alluvial zone, composites with lithium  grades  start  at  the  bottom  of  the  alluvial  surface,  and  continue  down  to  the  last  assayed interval.  There  were  a  total  of  9,249  Li%  composites  and  9,541  K%  composites  within  the  main mineralized unit. The difference in count reflects a greater frequency of zero Li% intervals than for K%. A histogram and basic statistics of the claystone domain are shown in Figure 13.9 for lithium composite grades.

Figure 13.10 shows the corresponding histogram for potassium composite grades within the same domain.

## 13.1.5 Variography

With most mineral deposits, the measure of continuity for any given metal depends on the separation distance  between  points  of  measurement  and  the  direction  from  position  to  position.  Variability increases and correlation decreases with the sample-to-sample separation distance. When the rate of change in variability is dependent on the direction, the measure of spatial variability is described as  anisotropic  and  it  is  characterized  in  terms  of  an  ellipsoid  with  axes  of  anisotropy.  There  are several mathematical functions  that measure variability  in  space,  and  Reserva  elected  to  use  the correlogram,  which  is  a  variant  of  the  semi-variogram.  The  correlogram  was  probably  the  first measure of continuity (the converse of variability) developed. It measures the correlation coefficient between two sets of data, with values at the heads  and values at the tails of vectors with similar direction and magnitude. Multiple studies have found that the correlogram provides a stable estimate of  spatial  continuity.  For  ease  of  modeling,  the  correlogram  value  is  subtracted  from  one  and  is presented in a similar graphical form to the variogram. The variography was completed using Sage 2001®  software  and  1.5  m  composites.  Reserva  calculated  experimental  correlograms  with  30 degree  increments  in  the  azimuth  and  45  degree  increments  in  the  dip  direction  and  the  vertical direction. These correlograms were computed for lithium and potassium.

The correlograms were modeled with a nugget component and two nested spherical components, used in the resource estimation step. The lithium and potassium parameters used are tabulated in Table  13.7,  and  the  experimental  correlograms  and  fitted  models  for  the  directions  most  closely corresponding to the calculated average correlogram are shown in Figure 13.11.

## 13.1.6 Estimation

The resources were estimated using either ordinary kriging (OK) or inverse distance (power of two) interpolation, with estimation restricted to the claystone domain. Alluvium and bedrock material have no  lithium  or  potassium  grades.  A  block  model  was  defined  to  cover  the  volume  of  interest,  as detailed in Table 13.8 following:

Table 13.8: Block Model Geometry

| Axis         | Minimum   | Maximum   |   Block Size(m) |   # Blocks |
|--------------|-----------|-----------|-----------------|------------|
| X(East)      | 410,000   | 413,000   |              30 |        100 |
| Y(North)     | 4,616,800 | 4,618,600 |              30 |         60 |
| Z(Elevation) | 1,306     | 1,615     |               3 |        103 |

Lithium and potassium block grades were interpolated in three passes using the parameters detailed below. The three pass approach was used to ensure that an adequate number of well distributed samples  were  available  to  inform  most  blocks  and  to  reduce  the  smoothing  effect  inherent  in interpolation.

- -Pass 1:

```
Minimum # of samples 5 Maximum # of samples 8
```

Maximum # samples/hole 2 (Minimum # of holes = 3)

## -Pass 2 :

Minimum # of samples 4 Maximum # of samples 10

Maximum # samples/hole 3 (Minimum # of holes = 2)

## -Pass 3:

Minimum # of samples 3 Maximum # of samples 12

Maximum # samples/hole N/A

The search ellipsoids  used are as detailed  in Table  13.9. The search orientation is  based on the orientation of the second spherical component of the lithium correlogram.

Table 13.9: Search Ellipsoid Geometry (Lithium and Potassium).

| Pass   | Range (m)   | Range (m)   | Range (m)   | Azimuth/Dip (Deg)   | Azimuth/Dip (Deg)   | Azimuth/Dip (Deg)   |
|--------|-------------|-------------|-------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
|        | X           | Y           | Z           | X                   | Y                   | Z                   |
| 1      | 100         | 75          | 10          | 114/0               | 24/0                | 0/-90               |
| 2      | 200         | 150         | 20          | 114/0               | 24/0                | 0/-90               |
| 3      | 300         | 225         | 30          | 114/0               | 24/0                | 0/-90               |

The minor elements (aluminum, arsenic, barium, calcium, chromium, iron, molybdenum, magnesium, sodium and rubidium) were interpolated in a single pass, using inverse distance interpolation (power of three), and the Pass 3 search ellipsoid as shown in Table 13.9.

Although some sectional interpretations of the basalt occurrences were developed by LAC, it was difficult to correlate them and develop a physical 3D model of the rock type. A probabilistic approach using indicators was therefore developed, creating a basalt percent block model (attribute) that could be used to represent the occurrence of basalt and to dilute the lithium grades in the affected blocks, based on the proportion of basalt. This proportion was also used to calculate a weighted average density  for  the  blocks  affected.  The  primary  documentation  of  the  presence  of  basalt  is  in  the lithology  table,  and  this  data  was  used  to  assign  an  integer  code  (basalt  =  1,  non-basalt  =  0)  to composites in the claystone domain. These basalt indicators were interpolated into the block model using inverse distance cubed interpolation. The search parameters were based on basalt indicator variography. The interpolated block estimate in this Case is a value between 0 and 1 that represents the proportion of the block that is basalt.

As  indicated  above,  the  proportion  of  basalt  estimated  in  a  block  was  used  to  adjust  the  block element grades and density as in the following examples:

Adjusted Li% = Li% × (100% - Basalt%)

Adjusted Density = 1.79 × (100% - Basalt%) + 2.51 × Basalt%

Where  1.79  t/m 3   and  2.51  t/m 3   are  the  density  of  claystone  and  basalt  respectively.  The  basalt density of 2.51 t/m 3  is based on a single determination.

With respect to the interpolation of the main element lithium, there was some concern that grades in the vicinity of basalt occurrences (i.e., blocks with high basalt content) were lower than composites from areas with little or no basalt. This could possibly bias the estimation of blocks with high basalt content. The relationship between grade and basalt content was investigated. The basalt percentage was interpolated using indicator geostatistics.  The claystone composites were back-tagged with the estimated percentage of basalt. This composite basalt percentage was graphed against the lithium grades as illustrated in Figure 13.12.  The x-axis shows the basalt percentage where 1.0 is equal to 100%.

Figure 13.12: Claystone Composites, Lithium Grade vs Basalt

(Source: Reserva International, 2012)

A basalt percentage of 10% was selected as a threshold for differentiating two sub-domains within the claystone domain, composed of claystone blocks with a basalt percentage of &lt;10% and ≥10% basalt  respectively.  In  order  to  prevent  the  possible  bias  referred  to  above,  only  composites  with basalt percentages of &lt;10% were used when interpolating grades into blocks with &lt;10% basalt and, similarly, with composites with a basalt percentage of &gt;10% and blocks with &gt;10% basalt. Overall, blocks  with  a  significant  percentage  of  basalt  (≥  75%)  comprise  0.9%  of  the  model  blocks  with estimated  values.  Although  this  is  a  small  percentage,  the  basalt  is  still  accounted  for  in  the interpolation of grade values in blocks containing basalt as described above. High grade composites were spatially  restricted  at  the  time  of  lithium  and  potassium  grade  estimation,  which  means  that although the composites were used, their spatial influence was restricted with a smaller search. This allows the high grade value to be recognized, but prevents excessive smearing of these values. The definition  of  what  was  considered  'high  grade'  was  obtained  from  the  composite  cumulative frequency  plots  (Figure  13.7  and  Figure  13.9)  and  generally  corresponds  to  the  99%  or  higher percentile of the distribution. Table 13.10 shows the details of this restriction. The horizontal ranges used  were  selected  to  limit  the  influence  to  the  blocks  immediately  adjacent  to  the  sample.  The anisotropy and orientation of the restricted search ellipsoids are the same as for the full search, as tabulated in Table 13.9 (Search ellipsoid geometry).

Table 13.10: High Grade Restriction Parameters

| Variable   | High Grade Threshold   | Restricted Search (m)   |
|------------|------------------------|-------------------------|
| Li         | 0.65%                  | 42.5 × 42.5 × 2         |
| K          | 6.5%                   | 42.5 × 42.5 × 2         |

## 13.1.7 Model Validation

SRK completed  a  detailed  visual  inspection  of  the  resource  model  to  check  for  proper  coding  of drillhole  intervals  and  block  model  cells,  in  both  sections  and  plans.  The  coding  was  found  to  be correct. Grade interpolation was checked relative to drillhole composites and found to be reasonable.

SRK checked the block model estimates for global bias by checking the mean nearest neighbor (NN) estimate for lithium and potassium against model OK grade estimates. Mean grades were found to match very well. SRK also checked for local trends in the grade estimate by comparing the mean grade  estimate from the NN model and composites against the OK model in 100 m wide swaths through the model on Easting and Northing, and 50m high swaths for elevation. The average grade of all  the  interpolated blocks (OK and NN) and composites that fall in the swath is calculated and plotted to allow a local comparison of the sample and interpolated values. The block model behaves as expected and reproduces the general grade trends well, with some evidence of the smoothing common in interpolation procedures Figure 13.17 shows an example of a swath plot for lithium on NS sections. The pink line is the block model lithium average, the black line is the NN average and the green line is the composite average.

In summary, the lithium and potassium estimates are considered reasonable and show no marked anomalies, such as large deviations between the averaged values.

## 13.1.8 Mineral Resource Classification

The  mineral  resources  of  the  Stage  I  Lens  were  classified  consistent  with  the  CIM  Definition Standards (2014) incorporated by reference into the Canadian NI 43-101 as follows:

## · Inferred Mineral Resource

An Inferred Mineral Resource is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity and grade or quality  are  estimated  on  the  basis  of  limited  geological  evidence  and  sampling.  Geological evidence  is  sufficient  to  imply  but  not  verify  geological  and  grade  or  quality  continuity.  An Inferred  Mineral  Resource  has  a  lower  level  of  confidence  than  that  applying  to  an  Indicated Mineral Resource and must not be converted to a Mineral Reserve. It is reasonably expected that the  majority  of  Inferred  Mineral  Resources  could  be  upgraded  to  Indicated  Mineral Resources with continued exploration.

## · Indicated Mineral Resource

An Indicated Mineral Resource is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, grade or quality, densities, shape and physical characteristics are estimated with sufficient confidence to allow  the  application  of  Modifying  Factors  in  sufficient  detail  to  support  mine  planning  and evaluation  of  the  economic  viability  of  the  deposit.  Geological  evidence  is  derived  from adequately detailed  and reliable exploration,  sampling and testing and is sufficient to assume geological and grade or quality continuity between points of observation. An Indicated Mineral Resource has a lower level of confidence than that applying to a Measured Mineral Resource and may only be converted to a Probable Mineral Reserve.

## · Measured Mineral Resource

A Measured Mineral Resource is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, grade or quality, densities, shape, and physical characteristics are estimated with confidence sufficient to allow the application of Modifying Factors to support detailed mine planning and final evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit. Geological evidence is derived from detailed and reliable exploration,  sampling  and  testing  and  is  sufficient  to  confirm  geological  and  grade  or  quality continuity  between points of observation. A Measured Mineral Resource has a higher level of confidence  than  that  applying  to  either  an  Indicated  Mineral  Resource  or  an  Inferred  Mineral Resource. It may be converted to a Proven Mineral Reserve or to a Probable Mineral Reserve.

The mineralization of the Project satisfies sufficient criteria to be classified into measured, indicated and  inferred  mineral  resources.  Resources  are  tabulated  in  Table  13.1  and  the  criteria  are  listed below.

- · Measured resources are in blocks estimated using at least three drillholes and five composites within a 100 × 75 m search radius in the horizontal plane and 10 m in the vertical direction.
- · Indicated  resources  are  in  blocks  estimated  using  at  least  two  drillholes  and  four  composites within a 200 × 150 m search radius in the horizontal plane and 20 m in the vertical direction.

- · Inferred resources are blocks estimated with at least three composites within a search radius of 300 × 225 m in the horizontal plane and 30 m in the vertical plane.

Figure 13.18 shows an N-S cross section (looking west) at 411580E, illustrating the classification.

## 13.1.9 Risk

SRK is not aware of any environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, socio-economic, marketing, political, or other relevant factors that will materially affect the mineral resource estimate.

## 13.2 Stage II

LAC engaged GeoSystems International, Inc. to complete a resource estimate for the Stage II Lens area within the Lithium Nevada project, located in Humboldt County, Nevada. The resource estimate was made from a three-dimensional  (3D)  block  model  using  commercial  mine  planning  software, (MineSight®). The estimated elements are lithium, potassium, fluorine, and sodium, and are current as of May 15, 2010, the effective date of the estimates.

The  resource  estimate  was  completed  by  Mr.  Mario  E.  Rossi,  CIM,  FAusIMM,  SME,  IAMG,  and Principal  Geostatistician  of  GSI.  Mr.  Rossi  is  an  independent  Qualified  Person  as  defined  by NI 43-101 by reason of education, affiliation with a professional association (as defined in NI 43-101) and past relevant work experience.

Table 13.11 shows the total estimated resources for the Stage II Lens area using a nominal 0.2 %Li cut-off.  GSI  is  of  the  opinion  that  at  a  0.20%  lithium  cut-off,  the  Stage  II  Lens  has  reasonable prospects for economic extraction by open-pit mining. As with other areas within the Lithium Nevada project, lithium carbonate would be the primary product with potassium as a by-product. Therefore, the resources are reported in all cases using a Li cut-off.

Table 13.11: Mineral Resource Statement for the Stage II Lens as of May 15, 2010.

|-----------|----------------------|-----------|-------------------------|-------------|----------------------|------|------|
| Category  | Quantity   (000's t) | Li %      | LCE Quantity  (000's t) | K%          | Quantity   (000's t) | Na%  | F%   |
| Indicated | 95,000               | 0.27      | 1,365.3                 | 3.66        | 3,477                | 1.55 | 0.57 |
| Inferred  | 47,000               | 0.26      | 650.5                   | 3.83        | 1,800                | 1.43 | 0.58 |

Notes:

- 1. Rounding errors may exist.
- 2. Contained metal does not allow for mine or metallurgical recovery. Tonnage factor used is 1.96 t/m . 3
- 3. Economic assumptions do not include any potassium credits.
- 4. Conversion factor from Li metal to Lithium Carbonate Equivalent (LCE) used is 5.323. Economic assumptions for cut-off grade determination are: US$3.50 Li carbonate/lb; 60% metallurgical recovery; US$50/tonne ore processed; US$2.20/tonne material moved.

Mineral resources are sensitive to the cut-off grade selection. Table 13.12 lists the mineral resource for the Stage II area at various cut-off grades to demonstrate the sensitivity of the mineral resources at various cut-offs. The reader is cautioned that the grade and tonnages presented in these figures should not be misconstrued as a mineral resource statement.

Indicated resources are in blocks estimated using at least 2 drill holes, 6 composites, or 3 octants within  a  160  m  search  radius  in  the  horizontal  plane  and  16  m  in  the  vertical  direction.  A  later smoothing algorithm was used to avoid isolated blocks of indicated within inferred, or vice-versa; this algorithm defined indicated and inferred areas with a minimum 80 x 80 x 10 m volume.

The density values are derived from the Stage II Lens determinations. The average values obtained are shown in Table 13.13; the in situ dry density used for all mineralized material (moat sediments) is 1.96 t/m 3 .

The Stage II Lens estimate considers only a portion of what is known as the South Pod, centered in the area where the LAC drilling exists. While GSI chose not to interpolate grade into areas without

recent drilling,  neighbouring Chevron holes indicate that there is potential to increase laterally the estimated resource tonnage with further drilling.

The reader is cautioned that the cut-off below the base case highlighted in bold may not satisfy the reasonable prospect  for  eventual  economic  extraction  and  should  not  be  misconstrued  as  mineral  resources,  they  are  only stated here to demonstrate the sensitivity of the mineralization to various cut-off grades.

There are no known environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, socio-economic, marketing, and political  or  other  relevant  issues  that  may  materially  affect  the  resource  estimates.  Other  relevant

factors  that  may  materially  affect  the  resources,  including  mining,  metallurgical,  and  infrastructure are well understood according to the assumptions presented in the Stage II Resource Estimate.

The topography used is the Nad27 DEM sheet provided by LAC, which is deemed inadequate for feasibility-level studies. GSI recommends that LAC increase the certainty of the resource estimate through the following steps:

- 1. Completing metallurgical testwork specific to the Stage II Lens;
- 2. Define the importance of oxidized vs. un-oxidized material;
- 3. Obtain a fly-over digital topography of the Stage II Lens;
- 4. Prioritize infill drilling by the mining extraction sequence. Drill on a 160 m grid for indicated mineral  resources  and  a  80  m  grid  for  measured  mineral  resources.  These  suggested  drill  hole spacing could be checked and adjusted as further drilling is completed.

## 13.2.1 Geologic Model

Project  limits  and  coordinates  are  in  UTM  (m)  Easting  and  Northing  values,  and  the  block  model geometry is summarized in Table 13.14. Elevation is also in meters.  The Stage II Lens block size selected is 20 x 20 x 5 m, which is considered reasonable given the current drill hole spacing and that the block model represents open pit resources.

Table 13.14: MineSight Model Extent, UTM Coordinates (meters)

| UTM Coordinates (m)   | Minimum   | Maximum   |   Block Size (m) |   No. of Blocks |
|-----------------------|-----------|-----------|------------------|-----------------|
| Easting               | 404,000   | 410,000   |               20 |             300 |
| Northing              | 4,626,500 | 4,632,500 |               20 |             300 |
| Elevation             | 1,500     | 2,200     |                5 |             140 |

The  drillhole database  used  for  geologic  modeling  and  resource  estimation  was  closed  on December  31, 2009  with  the  last  hole  drilled  in  the  Stage  II  Lens,  SP-38.  The  Stage  II  Lens mineralization  is  controlled  by volcaniclastic moat sedimentary rocks containing lithium-rich claystone.  Sectional  interpretations  (approximately E-W and N-S) were generated by LAC from drill logs for alluvium, moat sediments  (claystone), fanglomerates, silicified unit, and bedrock. Also two oxidation surfaces were interpreted, one just below alluvium, and another near the claystone/silicified interface.  Additionally, a series of faults have been interpreted by LAC based  on drill hole data, and incorporated in the geologic interpretation.  These sectional  interpretations  were digitized and  transformed  into  strings, which  were  then  used  to create  surfaces  and  threedimensional solids in MineSight®.

The  surfaces and  solids were  used  to code  the block model  by  lithology domains  within MineSight®. The  percentage  of  each  block  within  each  unit  was  coded  in  order  to  capture  the mixtures of units at the interfaces. Table 13.15 summarizes the lithologic and oxidation units in the Stage II Lens geologic  model.

The  estimation  domains  were  derived  from  these  lithologic  units,  which  are  also  shown  in  Table 13.155. The  Li  grades  within the  oxidized  and  un-oxidized  claystones,  as  well  as  the  smaller fanglomerate/volcanics  did  not  warrant  separate  estimation  domains,  according  to  the  statistical analysis.

Table 13.15: Lithologic and Oxidation Units modeled in the Stage II Lens

| Unit                     |   Block Model Code |   Estimation Domain |
|--------------------------|--------------------|---------------------|
| Alluvial                 |                 10 |                  10 |
| Claystone Upper Oxidized |                 20 |                  25 |
| Claystone Un-oxidized    |                 30 |                  25 |
| Fanglomerates/volcanics  |                 40 |                  25 |
| Claystone Lower Oxidized |                 50 |                  25 |
| Silicified               |                 60 |                  60 |
| Bedrock                  |                 70 |                  70 |

Figure 13.19 shows a cross section with the interpreted geologic and oxidation units; also shown is the  topography and the drill holes annotated with histograms representing Li grades in ppm, looking north.  GSI  checked  the  consistency  of  the  interpreted  domain  codes  against  LAC  drillhole  logs  in section and  plan and found a reasonable match with the block domain coding.

## 13.2.2 Assays

A total of 51 drill  holes were used for estimating grade, 38 SP core holes drilled by WLC, and 13 older  Chevron  holes.  Only  2  of  the  13  older  Chevron  holes  (MC-84-81C  and  MC-84-90C)  have grades for the four estimated elements, since they were sent for re-analysis by LAC in 2009. The remaining 11 Chevron holes only have lithium grades.

The total  drilling  was  3,019.61  m,  of  which  2,150.87  m  were  drilled  by  WLC  (SP  holes),  and  the remaining  868.74  m  were  drilled  by  Chevron.  A  total  of  2,813.31  m  correspond  to  the  moat sediments  domains  (lithologies  2  through  5),  while  109.01  m  correspond  to  the  silicified  domain (lithology unit 60), and the remaining drilled meters to the alluvial or bedrock domains, which were not estimated.

Assay values were not capped prior to compositing because probability plots showed continuity and the domain composite coefficient of variation (CV; standard deviation/mean), was low. The overall CV for Li assays was 0.50, while potassium had a CV of 0.36. Figure 13.20 shows the histogram of all Li assay values. However, high grade restrictions on composites were used in the estimation, see below.

Fluorine values have the particularity of being derived from two different assaying methods, based on the F concentration of the sample. For samples with greater than 2% F, a variant of the Fusion method was used. This creates an artificial  discontinuity,  because  it  appears  that  values  that  are close to 2% F will tend to underestimate the F value, while values derived from the second assaying method will result in values that are higher than 2%. The end result is a relative deficiency of values around 2% F, which clearly appears artificial, see Figure 13.21. This issue needs to be addressed in future resource estimates and economic evaluations.

## 13.2.3 Composites

Assay values were composited into 1.5 m long down the hole composites and coded by lithology domains. Composites with less than 0.5 m in length were not used in grade interpolation. Because there  are  no  assays  from  the  alluvial  zone,  composites  with  Li  grades  start  at  the  bottom  of  the alluvial surface, down to the last assayed interval. There were a total of the 1,655 composites within the main mineralized unit, the claystone (moat sediment) domain, the histogram and basic statistics of which are shown in Figure 13.22. Figure 13.23 shows the corresponding histogram for potassium grades within the same domain.

## 13.2.4 Exploratory Data Analysis and Estimation Domains

In  addition  to  the  histogram  and  basic  statistics  described  above,  other  histograms,  cumulative frequency plots, and conditional mean plots were completed for all 4 elements. All CVs for each of the domains were low, so that in all cases ordinary kriging can be used in grade interpolation.

Histograms  and  probability  plots  for  each  of  the  lithology  units  suggest  that  there  is  little  grade variation  from  one  unit  to  the  next.  In  the  Case  of  the  claystone  unit  (moat  sediments),  oxidation does not appear to impact the grade distribution; and the fanglomerate unit also has significant Li mineralization, with slightly lower grades compared to the claystone.

The  only  unit  that  was  separated  from  the  claystone  was  the  thin  silicified  unit  laying  over  the bedrock  that  clearly  shows  a  drop  in  grade.    With  more  drilling,  it  may  be  possible  for  WLC geologists to identify a higher-grade population domain within the moat sediments, probably in the form of thin layers of clays enriched in hectorite, relative to their surroundings. It was not necessary to do so for grade interpolation at this time.

Scatterplots  and  conditional  mean  plots  assess  the  degree  of  correlation  between  variables. Conditional mean plots were done based on lithium grade classes only. These plots are similar to scatterplots, except that they show the average of each secondary variable corresponding to each Li grade class. They provide an indication of the correlation between two variables by synthesizing the scatterplot  cloud.  Figure  13.24  shows  the  potassium  mean  grades  conditional  to  lithium  grade ranges. The correlation between the two is excellent, and suggests that the only source of F in this deposit is the same Li-rich hectorite clay; if this assumption could be verified, prediction of F grades at the time of mining would be easier.

Figure 13.25 shows the scatterplot for the same variables composites in domain 25 (claystone). The linear  correlation  coefficient  between  the  two  is  0.94;  note  that  for  the  higher  Li  grades,  there appears to be an additional kick on F. Compare to Figure 13.26, which shows the scatterplot for Li-K; note that the correlation is negative, which is also observed in the conditional mean plots and the resource grade tonnage curves: higher Li grades generally mean lower K grades.

Technical  Reference  G  presents  the  additional  cumulative  frequency  plots,  scatterplots,  and conditional mean plots obtained for Li, K, F, and Na.

## 13.2.5 Variography

Variography graphically shows the spatial variability of an attribute. For the Lithium Nevada project, variography was completed using Sage 2001® software. GSI calculated experimental correlograms with  30°  increments  in  the  azimuth,  45°  increment  in  the  dip  direction,  and  the  vertical  direction. These correlograms were computed for all 4 elements. The correlograms were modeled and used in the resource estimation step.

## 13.2.6 Estimation

The  reported  estimate  is  an  ordinary  kriging  (OK)  based  on  estimation  domains.  The  main mineralized estimation domain is the claystone, with a small fanglomerate unit and a silicified unit just above bedrock carrying medium-range Li grades. Alluvium and bedrock material have no Li or K grades.

Two passes (outside in) were used for OK grade estimation. The first pass was used to estimate blocks  with  more  local  information,  searching  out  to  what  approximately  meets  the  indicated classification  criteria.  The  second  pass  was  to  fill  the  claystone  envelope.  Composite  and  blocks were matched on domain code, although Domain 60 composites (silicified) were used to estimate claystone material, but no claystone composites were used to estimate the silicified domain.

High grade composites were spatially restricted at the time of estimation, which means that although the composites were used, its spatial influence was restricted to a smaller radius. The definition of

what was considered 'high grade' was obtained from the cumulative frequency plots, and generally correspond to the 99% or higher percentile of the distribution. Table 13.16 shows the details of this restriction.

Table 13.16: High grade restrictions.

| Variable   | High grade threshold   | Restricted search radii   |
|------------|------------------------|---------------------------|
| Li         | 5,000ppm               | 14 x 14 x 14 m            |
| K          | 6.5%                   | 14 x 14 x 14 m            |
| F          | 3.5%                   | 14 x 14 x 14 m            |
| Na         | 1.8%                   | 14 x 14 x 14 m            |

Figure 13.27 and Figure 13.28 show an N-S cross sections and plan view respectively through the Li OK  block  models  looking  north.  Figure  13.29  and  Figure  13.30  show  the  corresponding  cross sections  and  plan  view  of  the  K  OK  block  models  looking  north.  The  models  are  shown  using contoured values, and the figures can be zoomed into for more clarity. Red contours are Li grades greater than 3,000 ppm.

Note how the better potassium grades tend to be lower in elevation, compared to good Li grades. It appears that the lower claystone are richer in potassium than the upper horizons, while the opposite is true for Li, with better grades closer to the surface. This behavior explains the negative correlation found in drill holes between Li and K and discussed above.

## 13.2.7 Model Validation

GSI  completed  a  detailed  visual  inspection  of  the  model  to  check  for  proper  coding  of  drillhole intervals  and  block  model  cells,  in  both  sections  and  plans.  The  coding  was  found  to  be  correct. Grade interpolation was checked relative to drillhole composites and found to be reasonable.

GSI checked the block model estimates for global bias by checking the mean nearest neighbor (NN) estimate for Li and K against model OK (ordinary kriging) grade estimates. Mean grades were found to match very well. GSI also checked for local trends in the grade estimate by comparing the mean grade estimate from the NN model against the OK model in swaths through the model on easting, northing,  and  elevation.  The  block  model  behaves  as  expected  and  reproduces  well  the  general grade trends. Figure 13.31 shows an example of a swath plot for Li on N-S sections. The red line is the block model Li average, the black line the NN average, and the dotted line the number of blocks (second Y axis) used in the average.

In addition to the nearest neighbour (NN) model, an Indicator-modified OK (IMOK) model was run on Li  to  check if there were any opportunities to separate out dilution and increase grade. The IMOK model  confirmed  the  OK  estimate,  being  very  similar  in  tonnage  and  grade  above  cut-off.  The similarity of both models confirms a very good grade continuity of Li grades and suggests that, with current drilling density, there are few if any opportunities to separate out lower grade material.

In  summary,  the  Li,  K,  and  Na  estimates  are  thought  to  be  robust  and  show  no  anomalies.  The potassium grade drops slightly for higher Li averages, which is somewhat unexpected, considering that  it  is  behaving  differently  than  what  was  observed  for  the  PCD  lens.  The  F  model  is  also internally  consistent  with  the  data  and  parameters  used  in  the  estimation,  but  is  believed  to  be under-representing the population around 2% F due to the assaying issue discussed elsewhere.

## 13.2.8 Recommended Drill Spacing

GSI  verified  the  prior  recommendation  made  by  AMEC  for  the  Stage  I  Lens  using  the  same methodology for the  Stage  II  Lens.  AMEC  used  the  statistical  criterion  that  yearly  ore  production grade and tonnage should be known at least to ±15% with 90% confidence in order to fall in the indicated mineral resource category. The criterion for measured mineral resources is ±15% with 90% confidence for quarterly production.

Unfortunately, this criterion is sensitive to small changes in production rates, as well as dependent on whether the material sent to plant annually comes from a single or multiple mining fronts. GSI ran the confidence limits test for the Stage II Lens using the same estimated annual production rate of 5,000  tons  per  day,  i.e.,  the  assumption  is  that  the  plant  will  be  fed  entirely  with  South  material. Applying both the results of this test, as well as practical experience and criteria derived from the correlogram models and the current drill hole spacing, the recommended nominal drill spacing for measured mineral resources and indicated mineral resources are:

1. Measured mineral resources: 80 × 80 m; and

2. Indicated mineral resources: 160 × 160 m

## 13.2.9 Mineral Resource Classification

Mineral resources of the Stage II Lens were classified consistent with the CIM Definition Standards incorporated by reference into NI 43-101. The mineralization of the project satisfies sufficient criteria to  be  classified  as  an  indicated  mineral  resource  and  inferred  mineral  resource.  Resources  are tabulated in Table 13.11 and the criteria listed below.

- · Indicated  mineral  resource:  For  a  block  to  be  classified  as  an  indicated  mineral  resource, interpolated blocks had to have at least two drill holes within 160 m distance from its centroid, with  a  minimum  of  6  composites  that  result  a  grade  greater  than  or  equal  to  0.20  Li%,  and reasonable prospects for economic extraction.
- · Inferred  mineral  resource:  For  a  block  to  be  classified  as  an  inferred  mineral  resource, interpolated blocks had to be within the resource envelope drawn around the LAC holes, which include  some  Chevron  core  holes.  In  addition,  the  blocks  have  to  be  within  320  m  in  the horizontal plane, and 32 m in the vertical plane of the nearest drill hole, with a minimum of three composites that result in a grade greater than or equal to 0.20 Li%, and reasonable prospects for economic extraction.
- · There are no measured mineral resources at this time in the Stage II Lens area.

There are no known environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, socio-economic, marketing, and political  or  other  relevant  issues  that  may  materially  affect  the  resource  estimates.  Other  relevant factors  that  may  materially  affect  the  resources,  including  mining,  metallurgical,  and  infrastructure are well understood according to the assumptions presented in the Stage II Resource Estimate.

## 14 Mineral Reserve Estimates

There are no current mineral reserves to declare on the project.

## 15 Adjacent Properties

Apart  from  the  other  mineralized  lenses  on  the  Lithium  Nevada  project,  there  are  no  adjacent properties that bear on the lithium properties and there are no nearby operating mines. Several gold mines are in operation several tens of miles to the  southeast and  are mentioned to  illustrate  that mining permits are possible in the area. In the past century, a large mercury mine operated to the northeast  of  the  lithium  properties.  To  the  west  of  the  lithium  properties,  uranium  and  gold  were produced from small mines in the past century. Those properties are being actively explored, but there is no current production.

The Huber Pit at the north end of the lithium mineralized trend is operated sporadically and possibly a  few  tens  of  tons  of  material  are  produced  per  year,  but  production  generally  occurs  in  a  short period every two or three years.

## 16 Interpretations and Conclusions

## 16.1 Stage I

## 16.1.1 General

LAC holds control and ownership of the Lithium Nevada property mining claims and leases within the boundaries of  this  study.  LAC  is  approved  by  the  BLM  and  the  NDEP  BMRR  to  conduct  mineral exploration activities at the project site.

This report documents the status of the project, and includes mineral resource statements for Stage I and  Stage  II.  Additional  metallurgical  testwork  has  been  performed,  and  this  data  needs  to  be incorporated in future studies.

## 16.1.2 Geology

The  Lithium  Nevada  deposits  occur  in  a  north-south  zone  that  coincides  with  the  western  and southern  part  of  the  McDermitt  caldera  moat  sedimentary  rock.  Lithium  mineralization  occurs  in lithium-bearing claystone minerals observed in thick, apparently continuous accumulations.

Most  of  the  moat  sedimentary  rocks  drilled  in  the  Thacker  Pass  basin  contain  anomalously  high lithium contents (&gt; 1000 ppm). Intervals that consist mostly of ash have a lithium content of less than 800  ppm  whereas  intervals  dominated  by  claystone  contain  more  lithium  (&gt;1,000  ppm).  Many intervals  have  a  very  high  lithium  content  (&gt;4,000  ppm).  Intervals  with  extreme  lithium  contents (&gt;8,000  ppm)  occur  locally.  There  is  no  change  in  lithium  content  across  the  boundary  between oxidized and unoxidized rock; however, the highest lithium grades generally occur in the middle and lower parts of the sedimentary rock section.

## 16.1.3 Process

The metallurgical testwork conducted after the previous NI 43-101 Technical Report (Tetra Tech 2014), and further studies to refine the process and recoveries need to be included in future project studies.

## 16.2 Stage II

## 16.2.1 Geological Setting

The Lithium Nevada deposits occur within sedimentary and volcano-sedimentary rocks in the moat of a resurgent caldera. The extent and nature of the host rocks is well documented and understood. At the present time, five areas of significant lithium mineralization have been identified: Stage I Lens (PCD), Stage II  Lens (South), Stage III Lens (South  Central), Stage IV Lens (North Central), and Stage V Lens (North). In each of these areas hectorite, a lithium-bearing clay mineral occurs in thick, apparently continuous accumulations.

## 16.2.2 Tenure

Based on the records provided, GSI concludes that LAC has documents that support their claim to the rights to the lithium mineralization and that they have documents showing that all appropriate permits for exploration have been obtained.

## 16.2.3 Deposit Type and Mineralization

There are no analogous deposits in operation worldwide. The hectorite deposits at Hector, California have  similar  mineralogy,  but  the  geological  setting  is  significantly  different.  The  Lithium  Nevada deposits are believed to have formed by hydrothermal alteration of layered volcaniclastic sedimentary rocks.

Mineralization consists of layered beds of lithium-bearing clay-rich volcaniclastic sedimentary rocks. The beds exhibit very good geological continuity over kilometers with drill spacings on the order of 500m. The thickness of mineralization varies from less than a meter to more than 90m with typical intercepts of about 30m. The extent of mineralization is well known.

## 16.3 Risks

SRK is  not  aware  of  any  significant  risks  and  uncertainties  that  could  be  expected  to  affect  the reliability or confidence in the resource estimate presented herein.

## 16.4 Opportunities

The Project area is host to a variety of specialty clays that could be recovered and marketed. These clays include bentonite and higher-value clays for cosmetics. Processing of these clays to recover and produce saleable products is straightforward; however, a resource defining the amount of these clays has not been completed, precluding inclusion of the potential revenue from this study.

## 17 Recommendations

## 17.1 General

SRK  recommends  that  LAC  continues  to  investigate  the  Lithium  Nevada  project,  specifically  the following recommendations for the Project should be considered.

## 17.2 Topography

Improving the topographic map currently available, since its level of detail is insufficient for pre- and feasibility engineering work. Estimated cost: US$60,000. This work would be completed as a single phase.

## 17.3 Metallurgical Testing

SRK  recommends  incorporating  the  results  of  the  recent  metallurgical  testwork  in  future  project studies, to advance the project and potentially define a mineral reserve.

## 17.4 QA-QC

Costs to add these QA-QC protocols to the Project are included in general costs.

- · Site specific standards should be produced for the Lithium Nevada project from materials found in  the  project  area.  These  standards  should  cover  the  expected  grade  ranges  for  Li,  F,  Na, and K.
- · A routine insertion of coarse duplicates (-10 #), in addition to the standards, pulp duplicates, and blank  samples  to  monitor  accuracy,  precision  and  contamination.  GSI  also  recommends  that check samples be sent to a second laboratory.
