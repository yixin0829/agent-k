PEG  Mining  Consultants  Inc.  (PEG)  was  commissioned  by  Carpathian  Gold  Inc.  ('Carpathian')  to provide an independent Mineral Resource Estimate and Technical Report for the Rovina Valley Project ('RVP') located in the Golden Quadrilateral Mining District of the South Apuseni Mountains in westcentral Romania, approximately 300 km northwest of the city of Bucharest, the capital city of Romania.

The  Rovina,  Colnic  and  Ciresata  Porphyry  deposits  are  the  principal  exploration  targets  on  the Property, with their locations defining a north-northeast trend.   The Rovina Porphyry is the northernmost  with  the  Colnic  Porphyry  lying  approximately  2.5  km  south  of  the  Rovina  Porphyry,  and  the Ciresata Porphyry approximately 4.5 km south of the Colnic Porphyry

The resource estimate was completed in conformance with the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum ('CIM') Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve definitions referred to in the National Instrument ('NI') 43-101, Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects. It also involved the preparation of a Technical Report as defined in the NI 43-101 and in compliance with Form 43-101 F1. This report represents the first time reporting of the Ciresata deposit and update of the May 24th, 2007, NI 43-101 compliant resource estimate for the Rovina and Colnic deposits by AMEC Americas Limited ('AMEC').

This  new  resource  estimate  by  PEG  incorporates  the  late  2007  and  2008  drilling  results  that  were available as of April 08th, 2008 for Rovina and as of October 15th, 2008 for Colnic and Ciresata.

Mr.  Pierre  Desautels,  P.Geo.  Principal  Resource  Geologist  of  PEG  served  as  the  independent Qualified Person responsible for preparing the Mineral Resource Estimate and Technical Report. Mr. Desautels visited the property,  accompanied by Randy Ruff, Carpathian's Executive Vice President, Exploration, between August 26th and August 30th, 2008.

The  Rovina  Property  consists  of  one  Exploration  Licence  (the  Rovina  Exploration  Licence,  Number 6386/2005  for  Au-Ag-Cu)  centered  at  approximately  latitude  46°07'  N  and  longitude  22° 54'  E  or 515,000 N and 340,000 E using the 'Stereo70' projection of the Romanian National Geodetic System. Carpathian  owns  100%  of  Ore-Leave  Capital  (Barbados)  Limited,  which  in  turn  owns  100%  of Carpathian Gold Limited (BVI) that owns 100% of SAMAX Romania SRL, which owns 100% of the Rovina Exploration License.

Year-round principle access to the property is on paved two-lane highway to the historic gold mining town of Brad followed by secondary paved roads eastward for 7 km, which pass through the town of Criscior and onward to the village of Bucuresci within the property.

On a regional level, the majority of the mineral deposits in the Romanian-Hungarian region are located in  the  Carpathian  Fold  Belt;  an  arcuate  orogenic  belt  which  is  part  of  a  much  larger  belt  extending westward  into  Austria  and  Switzerland  and  south  into  Serbia  and  Bulgaria.  These  belts  developed during the late Cretaceous and Tertiary, following closure of the Tethys Ocean, due to the collision of continental  fragments  of  Gondwana  with  continental  Europe  and  the  related  subduction  of  small, intervening  oceanic  basins.  The  development  of  the  Carpathian  Fold  Belt  was  accompanied  by widespread igneous activity, including a suite of late Cretaceous to early Eocene acidic to intermediate

08CARP0100\_REP00

intrusive and extrusive rocks, known as 'banatites'.   These rocks are believed to have formed early stages of subduction and are host to several Cu-Mo-Fe Porphyry and skarn deposits.

The Apuseni Mountains represent a somewhat 'isolated massif' with the Carpathian Fold Belt.  The southern portion of the Apuseni Mountains, where the Apuseni-Rovina Property is located, consists of a  complex area of Palaeozoic (and older) metamorphic rocks, Mesozoic ophiolites and sedimentary rocks and Tertiary igneous and sedimentary rocks.

On a local level, the property covers a sequence of Neogene-aged subvolcanic intrusive rocks, which in other parts of the Golden  Quadrilateral, host epithermal  and  porphyry-style mineralization. Carpathian's exploration programs have identified Au-rich porphyry systems (the Rovina, Colnic and Ciresta deposits) hosted by these Neogene subvolcanic intrusives. The Rovina and Colnic porphyry deposits lie within a northeastern volcanic outlier of the 8-10 km diameter, Neogene-aged, Brad-Barza volcanic  field. The  Brad-Barza  volcanic  field  is  well  known  for  hosting  high-grade  gold  veins  with historic gold production dating back to the Roman period (ca. 2000 yrs ago).   The Ciresata porphyry, 4.5 km south of Colnic, lies within the eastern part of the Brad-Barza volcanic field.

The main mineralized targets on the Rovina Property are the Rovina Cu-Au porphyry, Colnic Au-Cu porphyry and the Ciresata Au-Cu porphyry.   Porphyry deposits in general are large, low- to mediumgrade deposits  in  which  primary  (hypogene)  sulphide  minerals  are  dominantly  structurally-controlled and which are spatially and genetically related to felsic to intermediate porphyritic intrusions.

The  mineralized  porphyries  at  Rovina,  Colnic  and  Ciresata  display  moderate  to  intense  potassic hydrothermal altered cores, and strong quartz stockwork veining.  The Au-Cu mineralization manifests as stockworks  and  disseminations  centered  on  porphyritic, subvolcanic-intrusive complexes  of hornblende-plagioclase diorites.  These porphyries would classify as gold-rich, especially Ciresata and Colnic, and contain many of the features common in gold-rich porphyries ie dioritic, calc-alkaline stock associated and abundant magnetite alteration.  Oxidation is restricted to the uppermost few metres of the prospect and no significant oxide cap or supergene enriched horizons have been encountered to date.

All routine sample preparation and analyses of the Carpathian samples are performed by ALS Chemex Romania  (ALS),  Laboratory  (lab)  in  the  town  of  Gura  Rosiei  (where  the  Rosia  Montana  Project  is located), about 45 minutes drive northwest of the project area. A comprehensive Quality Assurance/Quality  Control  ('QA/QC')  program  involving  the  use  of  coarse  blanks,  standards  and duplicates has been instigated following recommendations by AMEC in 2006 and 2007.   The current QA/QC programs meet or exceed standard industry practices.

Prior to mineral resource estimation, PEG conducted data verification consisting of a site visit and a database audit. The assay data was thoroughly validated covering 16% of the entire database with a total  of  27%  coverage  for  the  2007-2008  data  not  previously  validated  by  AMEC.  PEG  found  the database to be acceptably accurate and error free to be used in mineral resource estimation.

Preliminary  metallurgical  testwork  was  initiated  at  SGS  Lakefield  Research  (Lakefield)  in  the  third quarter of 2006 and consisted of flotation testwork for copper and gold, and cyanide leaching for gold on samples from the Rovina and Colnic deposits.  The test work results indicate that a saleable copper concentrate can be made with gold reporting to the concentrate.   Additional testwork is underway on samples from the Ciresata deposit. Results are not yet available at the effective date of this report.

Mineralogical  (Qemscan)  indications  to  date  are  that  the  Ciresata  samples  may  be  metallurgically similar to Colnic.

PEG  has  estimated  the  Mineral  Resource  for  each  of  the  Colnic,  Rovina  and  Ciresata  porphyry deposits, utilizing approximately 62,700 m of diamond drill hole data from the 2006, 2007 and 2008 drilling campaigns.

The Rovina resource estimate comprises measured, indicated and inferred resources reported as CuAu mineralization with a base case cut-off grade of 0.30% copper equivalent ('Cu eq').   For Colnic, resource  estimate  comprises  of  measured,  indicated  and  inferred  resources  reported  as  Au-Cu mineralization  with  a  base  case  cut-off  grade  of  0.45  g/t  gold  equivalent  ('Au  eq').   At  Ciresata  the resource comprises of inferred mineralization only with a base case cut-off grade of 0.70 g/t Au eq.

The  base  case  cut-off  grades  chosen  for  each  respective  deposit  were  determined  by  giving consideration to the characteristics of each deposit, envisioned mining methods, approximate mining and milling costs derived from internal studies as well as comparable porphyry-type deposits, results from early metallurgical test work and the reasonableness to be potentially economic.

As  of  September  30,  2008,  the  effective  date  of  the  resource  estimate,  weighted  average  results indicate  the  Rovina  Valley  resources  contain  193.1  million  tonnes  in  the  Measured  and  Indicated categories grading at 0.49 g/t gold and 0.18% copper. The Inferred category totals 177.7 million tonnes grading at 0.68 g/t gold and 0.17% copper using base case cut-offs of 0.45 g/t Au eq. for the Colnic deposit,  0.70  g/t  Au  eq.  for  the  Ciresata  deposit  and  for  0.30%  Cu.  eq.  for  the  Rovina  deposit.  The equivalency formula describe in detail in Section 17.9 of this report uses a gold price of US$675 per ounce and a copper price of US$1.80/lb with metallurgical recoveries not taken into account.

The  following  tables  1-1,  1-2  and  1-3  summarize  the  Mineral  Resources  for  each  of  the  deposits utilizing the respective base-case cut-off grades using a gold price of US$675 per ounce and a copper price of US$1.80/lb with metallurgical recoveries are not taken into account.

It  is  recommended  that  Carpathian  carry  out  a  work  program,  dominately  consisting  of  35,000  to 40,000  m  of  diamond  drilling  (results  driven)  to  further  delineate  the  deposits,  more  specifically  the Ciresata deposit.   The drilling program is required to upgrade the inferred resources to the measured and indicated category as well as test the continuation of the mineralization at Ciresata which is still open.   This drilling program would also include drilling for bulk samples from each deposit for further metallurgical test work that will be required for prefeasibility - feasibility studies.   Prior to undertaking this drilling program a Preliminary Economic Assessment should be completed which will assist in the ultimate design and specific requirements of the work program.  Carpathian should also continue with its environmental base line and social impact programs.  The appromate requirement for this aggresive work program is US $12 million.

## 4.1 Location

The Rovina Exploration  Property  is  located  in  the  Golden  Quadrilateral  Mining  District  of  the  South Apuseni Mountains in west-central Romania, approximately 300 km northwest of the city of Bucharest, the  capital  city  of  Romania,  and  140  km  east-northeast  of  the  city  of  Timisoara  (Figure  4-1).   The Carpathian  Property  comprises  the  Rovina  Exploration  License  and  lies  in  the  Judetele  (County) Hunedoara, a part of the Development Region of Transylvania.  The property is apporoximately 25 km north of the small city of Deva, which is the administrative center for the county, and 7 km west of the town of Brad for which mining has played an important role (Figure 4-2).  The Golden Quadrilateral has a long history of gold mining which predates the Roman occupation through several periods of activity to the results of modern exploration efforts which have defined two other advanced stage gold projects; Rosia  Montana  (Gabriel  Resources)  and  Certej  (European  Goldfields).   From  the  Rovina  License, Rosia Montana is approximately 25 km northeast and Certej is 17 km southeast.

The Property is centered at approximately latitude 46°07' N and longitude 22° 54' E or 515,000 N and 340,000 E using the 'Stereo70' projection of the Romanian National Geodetic System.  Elevations on the Property range from 300 m above sea level to 940 m above sea level.

The  Rovina,  Colnic  and  Ciresata  Porphyry  deposits  are  the  principal  exploration  targets  on  the Property, with their locations defining a north-northeast trend.   The Rovina Porphyry is the northernmost  with  the  Colnic  Porphyry  lying  approximately  2.5  km  south  of  the  Rovina  Porphyry,  and  the Ciresata  Porphyry  approximately  4.5  km  south  of  the  Colnic  Porphyry  (Figure  4-3)   Carpathian  has termed these three deposit the Rovina Valley Project (RVP).

## 4.2 Property and Title in Romania

The following summary on property and title in Romania is summarized from an English translation of Mining Law 85/18.03.2003 by the National Agency for Mineral Resources (NAMR) (http://www.namr.ro/legi/engleza/legea\_minelor.pdf).

The General Mining Law of Romania came into effect in 1998 and was amended in 2003.  The scope of  the  law  is  to  ensure  maximum  transparency  in  mining  activities  and  fair  competition  without discrimination  between  operators,  depending  on  the  property  type  and  the  origin  of  the  capital. Subterranean  and  above  ground  mineral  resources  located  within  Romanian  territory,  within  the continental shelf and in Romania's Black Sea economic area, are part of the state's public property. The law defines and regulates different categories of exploration and mining activities, from early stage sampling  and  prospecting  to  formal  exploration  and  finally  commercialization,  exploitation,  and processing.

No exploration or mining activity can be legally carried out without an appropriate permit.   Under the terms  of  the  1998  Mining  Law,  all  companies  seeking  an  exploration  licence  in  Romania  must approach NAMR.  NAMR was established in 1993 and is responsible for administration of the country's mineral licenses as per defined in the Mining Law.

The rights  granted  by  an  exploration  or  exploitation  licence  are  exclusive  to  the  holder,  chargeable, defensible against third  parties  and  are  transferable  with  the  consent  of  NAMR.   Applicants  are  not automatically granted surface rights and these must be acquired from the existing owner through sale, land exchange, rental, expropriation, concession, association or other process, as allowed by law (see Section 4.3.3).

Foreign  operators  must  set  up  a  permanent  subsidiary  in  Romania  within  90  days  of  obtaining  any mining license, and the subsidiary needs to be maintained throughout the period of operation.

There  are  three  types  of permits  available for exploration and  mining  activities in Romania: Prospecting, Exploration and Exploitation, as described in the following sections.

## 4.2.1 Prospecting Permit

The Mining Law defines prospecting as the performance of studies on the surface of a site required to identify  the  possible  existence  of  an  accumulation  of  mineral  resources. In  order  to  obtain  a Prospecting Permit, a company must make a request to NAMR, which must issue a Prospecting Permit within 30 days of receipt of the request.  The minimum areal extent for a Prospecting Permit is 45 km2 and the permit is valid for a maximum three-year period.  The Prospecting Permit is non-exclusive, and therefore  does  not  guarantee  that  the  applicant  will  be  granted  the  rights  to  the  exploration  or exploitation of any mineral resources located within the licence area.

Prospecting  Permit  holders  must  pay  annual  land  fees  equal  to  250  RON/km2  (approximately US$90/km2).   This land fee may be adjusted for currency inflation. The titleholder of the Prospecting Permit must present annual reports to the NAMR documenting the work completed and the results.

## 4.2.2 Exploration Licence

The  Mining  Law  defines  exploration  as  including  all  operations  and  studies  conducted  to  identify, evaluate and determine the optimal technical and economic conditions necessary to exploit a particular mineral deposit.   The Exploration Licence is valid for a maximum period of five years, with a renewal right  of  three  years  and  provides  the  holder  with  an  exclusive  right  to  carry  out  operations  within  a perimeter of at least 10 km2 (1,000 ha).

Exploration  licences  are  granted  using  national  coordinate  system  ('Stereo  70')  to  define  areas generally with north-south- and east-west-oriented boundaries.  A 2003 amendment to the mining law removed the obligation to reduce the size of the licence by 50% after Year 2, and an additional 25% (from  the  initial  size)  after  Year  4. Exploration  Licence  holders  must  pay  annual  land  fees  to  the Romanian government  equal  to  1000  RON/km2  (approximately  US$350/km2).   This  fee  is  doubled after two years and increases fivefold after four years, and may be adjusted for currency inflation.   In addition, the applicant must submit an appropriate financial guarantee for environmental rehabilitation as set out in an environmental rehabilitation plan.

Proposed  yearly  work  programs  must  be  filed  with  the  NAMR;  also  half-yearly  and  annual  reports documenting the work completed, and the results must be submitted.   The holder of an Exploration License has the exclusive right to apply for an Exploitation License within the property boundary.

## 4.2.3 Exploitation Licence

The Romanian Mining Law defines exploitation as including all operations executed at the surface, and beneath it, for the extraction, treatment and delivery of mineral resources. An Exploitation Licence is granted  at  the  discretion  of  NAMR  and  can  be  awarded  to  an  Exploration  License  holder  through directed negotiations or, on the basis of a public offer in the case of no current Exploration License. Prior to receiving an Exploitation Licence, the successful party must submit:

- a feasibility study for the mining operations
- an environmental impact assessment (EIA) and environmental audit
- a minimum investment and development plan
- a remediation plan to remedy any environmental damage caused by mining operations
- a social impact statement and a social mitigation plan.

Holders  of  an  Exploitation  Licence  must  pay  annual  land  fees  of  25,000  RON/km2  (approximately US$9,000/km2)  of  terrain  subject  to  exploitation  at  surface  or  underground.  This  land  fee  may  be adjusted for currency inflation.   In addition, a royalty must be paid to the State budget equal to 4% of the value of the polymetallic and/or precious metals mineral resources extracted from a particular site, and is payable quarterly.  This royalty was increased from 2% to 4% during 2007.

According to  Carpathian,  the  Exploitation  Licence  holder  is  also  subject  to  profits  taxation,  which  is represented by a flat-rate profit tax of  16%.   After-tax profits can be repatriated.   Mining companies may be entitled to government investor incentives if the region in which they intend to operate from is declared a 'Disadvantaged Zone'.  A Disadvantaged Zone is any region in Romania in which:

- One industry dominates the local economy by employing 50% of the work force.
- The mining industry predominates and has experienced significant closures.
- More than 25% of the local work force has been laid off.
- Local unemployment is at least 25% higher than the national level.

Once an area has been designated as a Disadvantaged Zone, Romanian companies and individual investors operating within a zone are entitled to at least one of a range of entitlements.   Entitlements relevant to the mining industry would be:

- a 10 year profits tax of 6% for companies which export products
- exemption  of  all  fees  associated  with  re-zoning  of  agricultural  land  for  industrial purposes
- access to a special development fund.

In order to qualify for the incentives, the Romanian companies must be formed after the declaration of a Disadvantaged Zone and be headquartered and conduct their production activities within the zone. Investments  must  also  be  newly  instituted. The  status  of  a  Disadvantaged  Zone  is  effective  for between 3 and 10 years.   Recent changes to the Disadvantaged Zone benefits apply to companies

which begin production after July, 2002 in which the 10-year profits tax exemption is modified.   The new law (#345/2002) applies to companies that export products in which profits are taxed at a flat rate of 6%.  The Property encompassing the Rovina and Colnic Deposits occurs within an area declared as a Disadvantaged Zone (pers. comm. Dino Titaro, 2006).

Mining companies are exempt from duty on imports of assets that are required for mining equipment, if the equipment is not manufactured in Romania (pers. comm. Dino Titaro, 2006).

Carpathian  owns  100%  of  Ore-Leave  Capital  (Barbados)  Limited,  which  in  turn  owns  100%  of Carpathian Gold Limited (BVI) that owns 100% of SAMAX Romania SRL, which owns 100% of the Rovina Exploration License.

## Rovina Agreement

The  Rovina  Property  was  acquired  by  Carpathian,  through  their  wholly  owned  subsidiary  Samax Romania S.R.L., on 27 April 2004 as a one year non-exclusive prospecting permit covering 102.3 km2. Following an initial exploration campaign, Samax applied for an Exploration Licence, and following a public  tender  and  application  process,  was  officially  awarded  100%  interest  in  the  Rovina  License (covering  9,351ha)  on  August  29  2005,  for  a  period  of  four  years.   A  three  year  extension  can  be applied for, extending the Rovina Licence expiry to August 2012.  The license is in the third-year work program and as such the Annual Exploration Licence Tax is approximately 2,000 RON (US$715).

Carpathian has informed PEG that minimum exploration commitments for the first contractual years (August 2005 to August 2007) have been met and exceeded. In excess of US$19.0 M has been spent

on the Property since April 2004 to September 30, 2008. Carpathian has also informed PEG that the work commitment for August 2007 to August 2008 contractual year also been met and exceeded.

At anytime during the valid period of the exploration licence Carpathian may apply to convert any part of the licence to an Exploitation Licence.   Upon any production, Carpathian must pay a 4% royalty to the Romanian Government, as described above.  PEG has been informed by Carpathian that there are no underlying payments or encumbrances to third-person parties relating to the Rovina Property above and beyond the government requirements.

PEG relies on the terms and the land tenure documentation supplied by Carpathian and Carpathian's lawyers  and  has  not  reviewed  the  mineral  titles  or  agreements  to  assess  the  validity  of  the  stated ownership.

## 4.3.3 Surface Rights

Carpathian does not hold any surface rights on their Rovina Property.   Romanian law does not vest surface  rights  with  mineral  rights  and  any  proposed  development  requires  the  developer  to  either purchase the surface rights or enter into an appropriate agreement with the surface rights owners to have access to the Property.  According to Romanian Mining Law, upon conversion of their Exploration Licences to an Exploitation status Carpathian has the right to legally acquire these rights through one of the following processes:

- sale
- land exchange
- rental
- expropriation
- application
- association with an existing owner
- other process allowed by law

Surface rights over the Rovina, Colnic, and Ciresata deposits are held by numerous individual local landowners  and  the  state  forestry. Exploration  activities  that  result  in  surface  disturbance  require permission from the surface rights owners in addition to the required government permits.  Carpathian has  informed  PEG  that  signed  Civil  Contracts  for  temporary  surface  rental  are  in-place  with  all landowners where drilling activity has occurred.  These contracts also contain a rehabilitation promise from Carpathian and are signed by the landowner and notorised when the rehabilitation is complete and has met their approval.   This rehabilitation is above and beyond what is required from the local government bodies.

## 4.3.4 Permits

The  Romanian  Mining  Law  requires  applicants  of  exploration  licences  to  submit  an  appropriate financial guarantee for environmental rehabilitation, as set out in an environmental rehabilitation plan; however a more detailed environmental impact assessment ('EIA') or social impact statement is not required.   All exploration activities that cause surface disturbance (i.e. trenching, drilling, and access development) require permitting under an Urbanisation Certificate ('UC') which serves as a template

08CARP0100\_REP00

for various government agency approvals.  The UC has been approved for Carpathian's drill programs and includes approvals from various government agencies who administer surface waters, archaeology,  forestry,  and  the  local  community  mayors.   The  environmental  baseline  study  that  is underway is over and above the legal exploration permitting requirements but is being implemented to monitor Carpathian's exploration activities.  In addition, the baseline information will form a good basis to complete the EIA and related social studies at a later date.

Once  the  exploration  phase  is  complete,  and  Carpathian  requests  the  Licence  to  be  converted  to Exploitation status, additional environmental and social studies must be completed.

PEG is not aware of any other permits that are in place, or may have been applied for to advance the project or whether there are any outstanding issues with permits that may be held by other parties that may affect future activities on the Property.

## 4.4 Environmental and Socio-Economic Issues

The Golden Quadrilateral Mining District has a long history of mining and contains areas with extensive mining disturbance.  State owned and subisidised mining operations were closed in 2007 after a long period  of  declining  investment  in  operations  resulting  in  legacy  environmental  issues  and  high  unemployment.   The  Rovina  property  lies  just  east  of  the  Brad-Barza  sub-mining  district  which  was operated by the State until closing in 2007.  On the Rovina Property, there are no previous state-owned mining operations with previous activity restricted to exploration utilising drilling and limited underground  gallery  excavations. Previous  surface  disturbance  is  restricted  to  exploration  gallery waste dumps at the Rovina deposit from State exploration in the 1980's and several widely spaced exploration galleries - presently collapsed - in the Colnic deposit area from the 19th century.   Under the Romanian regulation, Carpathian does not assume environmental liability for any of the previous exploration activities.

Carpathian  has  informed  PEG  that  in  August,  2006,  Carpathian  retained  the  services  of  Ecoterra S.R.L.,  based  out  of  Baia  Mare,  Romania  to  direct  a  baseline  environmental  study  over  the  area covering  the  Colnic  and  Rovina  Deposits,  about  25  km2  in  extent.   This  baseline  study  serves  to document  any  pre-existing  exploration  surface  disturbance,  surface  water  flows  and  thier  pH-eH conditions, and local weather data collection.   Carpathian intends to expand this study to include the Ciresata deposit area.

Carpathian has informed PEG that an archaeology baseline study directly over the Rovina, Colnic, and Ciresata deposits was commisioned and completed in late 2008.   This study was completed by the Romanian Center for Culture and Archeology, Deva with the final report pending.  Preliminary results of this  study through personal communication with Carpathain staff indicates no findings were made of archelogical  or  cultural  significance. These  baseline  studies,  while  not  an  exploration  permitting requirement, will be applicable toward an EIA study which is required for application for an Exploitation License.

There  are  several  small  rural  villages  within  the  boundaries  of  the  Property.   State-operated  mines were the dominant employer in the area prior to closure in 2007.  Replacement jobs in the local areas have not  been  developed  and  un-employment  is  high.   Many  of  the  local  residents  are  engaged  in sustenance agricultural  activities  or  have  left  the  area  seeking  employment.   Although  there  are  no

08CARP0100\_REP00

houses recorded in the direct vicinity of the Rovina, Colnic and Ciresata Deposits, isolated houses and farms occur within 1,000 m south of Colnic and within 980 m east of Rovina (the village of Rovina).

Carpathian  has  informed  PEG  that  as  part  of  it's  stakeholder  engagement  approach  it  is  currently active in community partnership programs and project-communication programs with the surrounding communities  as  well  as  assisting  in  the  funding  of  small  basic  infrastructure  improvements  for communities in the vicinity of the Colnic and Rovina Deposits.  In addition, Carpathian maintains close contact with the local mayor and villagers as part of their community relations efforts.

Romanian  Government  environmental  regulations  include  the  1995  Environmental  Protection  Law. The major provisions set out in the environmental code include the following:

- principles and strategic elements that are the basis of the laws
- right to access information on environmental quality
- right to information and consultation on the sitting of industrial facilities as set out in the Law on Environmental Impact Assessment
- implementation of environmental impact assessments, the results of which are to be made available to the public
- establishment of liabilities regarding environmental quality rehabilitation
- management regime for dangerous substances, hazardous waste, chemical fertilizers, and pesticides
- protection against ionizing radiation and safety of radiation sources
- protection of natural resources and biodiversity conservation
- prompt action and reporting when accidental pollution occurs
- prerogatives  and  responsibilities  of  the  environmental  protection  authorities,  central and local authorities, natural and legal persons
- right to appeal to the administrative or judicial authorities.

Following the cyanide spill from the Aurul Mine in the Baia Mare Mining District (northern Romania) in 2000,  environmental  concerns  relating  to  mining  activities  in  Romania  and  their  potential  transboundary  impacts  have  been  heightened.   The  major  areas  of  environmental  concern  include  soil erosion  and  degradation,  water  pollution,  air  pollution  in  the  south  from  industrial  effluents,  and contamination of Danube delta wetlands.   The European Union (EU) has reviewed mining practices and developed criteria for responsible mining which are included in the 'EU Mining Waste Directive'. This directive came into force in April 2006.  Romania became a full member of the EU on January 1st, 2007 and has adopted the EU Mining Waste Directive in 2008. This Directive allows the use of cyanide in  mineral  processing  providing  defined  concentration  levels  of  cyanide  in  tailings  management facilities are met.

In Romania, environmental activism in the form of non-governmental organisations (NGOs) is present and  mainly  dependant  on  international  organisations. Although  several  thousand  non-government organisations are registered, only about 100 are active.

The  following  has  been  extracted,edited  and  updated  where  appropriate  from  the  2007  Technical Report previously  prepared  by  AMEC Americas Limited ('AMEC') entitled Rovina-Apuseni Property, Romania Technical Report on Resource Estimation on the Colnic and Rovina Deposits, May 24, 2007.

## 5.1 Accessibility

Romania has a network of mostly two-lane highways which service all regional cities and the capital city Bucharest.   These highways also provide access to the major port city of Constanta on the Black Sea and westward to the border with Hungary and onward to western Europe.  The principle access to the  property  is  on  paved  two-lane  highway  to  the  historic  gold  mining  town  of  Brad  followed  by secondary paved roads eastward for 7 km which pass through the town of Criscior and onward to the village of Bucuresci within the property.  This road provides the principal access to the Rovina, Colnic, and Ciresata deposits.

The  western  boundary  of  the  Rovina  Licence  is  located  less  than  a  kilometre  east  of  the  town  of Criscior  (population  about  3,000),  where  Carpathian's  field  exploration  office  is  located.   The  Colnic Deposit is about 4 km from the town and the access road passes through the center of the mineralized zone.   The  Rovina  Deposit  is  located  about  2.5  km  to  the  north-northwest  of  Colnic,  and  can  be accessed by continuing along the same road and then turning off on to a 4-wheel drive track, for 1.4 km.  The track climbs roughly 170 m in elevation, and leads to the mineralized zone. Alternatively, this track can be walked in about 20 minutes.  The turn-off to the Ciresata Deposit is located 1.7 km east of the field office in Criscior on the paved road to the Colnic deposit.  From this turn-off, an improved dirt road heading south up the drainage called Garzii Valley for 3.3 km leads to the Ciresata deposit.

Access to other portions of the Rovina Licence is via various paved and gravel roads, tracks suitable for 4-wheel drive vehicles, or along footpaths.

The city of Timisoara has the nearest international airport to the Property with most regularly scheduled commercial flights from various European destinations. The flying time from Milan, Italy to Timisoara is about  one  and  three-quarter  hours. The  cities  of  Cluj-Napoca  and  Sibiu,  northeast  and  east respectively  from  the  property  (at  equi-distance  relative  to  Timisoara  from  the  property)  have  less frequent international connections.   Access to the Property by road is possible year round, however short periods of blockage are possible in the winter due to snow, especially in the higher areas of the Apuseni Mountains.

Distances and approximate driving times for the various segments from Timisoara are summarized in Table 5-1 and shown on Figure 4-2.   The driving time for the 193 km trip by car from the airport at Timisoara to the Carpathian field office in the town of Criscior (west of the Rovina Property) is three to four hours.

Table 5-1 Road Access from Timisoara to the Rovina Licence

| Route                                      |   Km | Driving Time   | Road Conditions                              |
|--------------------------------------------|------|----------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Timisoara to Deva (Carpathian main office) |  155 | 2.5 hours      | paved highway; moderate condition            |

## 5.2 Climate

The climate in the region is regarded as mild temperate-continental.  Generally the winter months are from  December  to  March,  and  snow  is  common  though  accumulation  is  typically  less  than  30  cm. Mean winter temperatures are around -3°C to -5°C; however periods of severe temperatures (as low as -20°C) can occur.   Although exploration can continue year-round in this part of Romania, occasional heavy snowfalls can hamper access for short periods during the winter months.

Springtime temperatures of 5'C to 10'C can start in early April, but patchy snow cover can last until mid-May in the forested areas.  The summer months, from June to September, have temperatures that range from 10'C to 20'C with rare maximum highs near 35°CThe typical annual precipitation is 800 to 1,100 mm.

## 5.3 Local Resources and Infrastructure

The modern primary infrastructure in Romania was principally developed during socialist/communism period which ended with the revolution in December 1989.   Electrical power generation and national grid, rail and highway networks were developed.  As example, power generation is typically from large coal and/or natural gas fired generating plants with rail-supply of coal and power distribution through modern high-tension grid.   Certain aspects of Romanian infrastructure have been neglected over the past two decades and include modernisation of highways and civic construction projects.  Since joining the EU in January 2007, infrastructure improvements have focused on building modern international highways, improving natural-gas distribution networks and civic sewage-treatment facilities.

The Golden Quadrilateral, where the Rovina Property is located, has a long history of mining activity. The  mining  areas  in  Romania  have  developed  infrastructure  to  provide  electrical  power,  highway transport, and rail transport.

The towns of Deva (pop. 80,000) and Brad (pop. 17,000) are the closest major centres to the Rovina Licence and are, respectively, about  one hour,  and 20 minutes drive from the Colnic Deposit.   The town of Zlatna (pop. 9,500) is situated approximately 30 km east of the property.  Many of these towns have  a  long  association  with  the  mining  industry,  dating  from  various  state-run  operations,  most  of which are now closed.  In August 2006 the Brad-Barza Mine that had been operated by Minvest Deva in Criscior closed operations, resulting in significant additional unemployment in the area.   Locally the unemployment is high, around 50%.  Although the local towns can provide the most basic mining and exploration needs for the early stages of exploration and project development (including accommodation  and  labour  requirements,  food,  communication  services  and  other  supplies),  the

majority of mining related equipment and services for more advanced projects must be obtained from Timisoara (pop.340,000) or Bucharest (pop. 2.5 M) or other locations in Europe.

Scattered small rural settlements exist on the Property, comprising subsistence agricultural activities, mostly on the gentler low-elevation slopes, and in the river valleys.

The nearest electrical power source to the Deposits is in the town of Criscior (Gura Barza, adjacent to the  Brad-Barza  Mine  processing  plant),  located  approximately  5  km  to  the  southwest. A  6  MW transformer  plant  is  connected  to  a  regional  high-tension  power  line  and  provides  electrical  power, principally for the Brad-Barza Mine and domestic and small industry use in the vicinity.

Most locations on the Property have cellular phone service, except in valleys where signals may be blocked.   Most  nearby  towns  have  line  telephone  service,  most  of  which  is  capable  of  international calls.

The closest rail line is a narrow gauge line which links the 5 MW generated power plant in Criscior and the town of Brad which has standard gauge rail connection to the national network.   This line would likely require some degree of upgrading to be useful; however it could be a useful link to access the principal rail lines in Romania and eventually provide access to deep water ports at Constantza and Galatz in eastern Romania on the Black Sea (approximately 475 km direct distance from Colnic).

The most significant source of surface water in the Rovina Licence in the vicinity of the Colnic, Rovina and Ciresata Deposits is the Bucuresci River (south of Conic) and its tributaries.  This river flows west to  the  Crisul  Alb  River  at  Criscior,  thereafter  flowing  westward  to  eventually  cross  the  RomaniaHungary border and discharge into the major Tisza River.  The Tisza River flows into Serbia and joins the Danube River just north of Belgrad; the Danube eventually enters the Black Sea within Romania territory.   Within the property area, smaller year-round creeks have provided an adequate supply for historic drilling programs.

## 5.4 Physiography, Flora and Fauna

The Property is located in the southern Apuseni Mountains, which are mostly gently rolling with some abrupt slopes and cliff forming rock exposures.   The highest peaks in the vicinity of the Property are Duba Peak (969 m above sea level), Coasta Mare Peak (786 m above sea level), and Cornetel Peak (695 m above sea level).

In the areas of the Rovina, Colnic, and Ciresata deposits, the terrain is hilly to mountainous with access through relatively gently sloped narrow valleys with moderately steep slopes to rounded ridges.   The minimum and maximum elevations ranges for each of the deposits are: Colnic 350m to 540; Rovina 500m to 680m; and Ciresata 420m to 480m.

The  Property  is  mostly  forested  with  deciduous  forests  (beech  and  oak)  and  occasional  conifers, particularly at higher elevations.

Wildlife on the Property includes deer, fox, and wild pigs.  Local streams on the property are not known to have fish.

## 6.1 Summary

Mining has played a significant role in the history of the Southern Apuseni Mountains and has been traced back to pre-Roman times (~2,000 years).   Initially gold production came from alluvial deposits and high grade veins from various locations, including Rosia Montana, Baia de Aires, Zlatna, Brad and Sacaramb.   No accurate production records exist from this period however it is believed that around 1,000 t of historical gold production has come from the region, most of which came from the Golden Quadrilateral.

The exploration history on the Rovina Property, and particularly on the Colnic, Rovina and Ciresata Deposit areas, can be divided into the following six work phases:

- local prospectors and miners (19 th century)
- Romanian government (1960s)
- Minexfor-Deva (mid 1970s to 1997)
- Rio Tinto (1999 to 2000)
- Minexfor-Deva (2000 to 2003)
- Carpathian (2004 to present)

Note, Minexfor-Deva is the local Romanian state exploration company.

## 6.2 Local Prospectors and Miners (19th century)

The first recorded exploration in the area dates back to the 19th century and was focused on Au-Ag vein-style mineralization.   A total of 17 documented underground galleries were excavated within the Colnic Porphyry alteration halo (see Figure 6-1).   Few records exist which accurately document their extent; however according to Carpathian no significant production was recorded and most of the veins were reportedly determined to be sub-economic.

Figure 6-1

Colnic Deposit - Compilation of Historical Work

<!-- image -->

## 6.3 Romanian Government (1960s)

In  the  1960s,  three  additional  galleries,  Colnic,  Ursoi  and  Mihai,  were  completed  by  the  Romanian government within the alteration footprint of the Colnic Porphyry.  The Ursoi tunnel was approximately 500  m  in  length  and  reportedly  intersected  46  north-trending  veins,  eight  of  which  were  tested  by crosscuts.  Veins were recorded as 3 cm to 1.5 m in width (mainly around 20 cm) and mineralized with pyrite and traces of sphalerite, chalcopyrite, and covellite, in a gangue of calcite, clay, and rare quartz.

In  addition,  many  of  the  previously  excavated  galleries  from  the  19th  century  were  re-opened  and sampled.  Unfortunately all of these tunnels are now collapsed and no longer accessible.  Carpathian has  obtained  some  underground  assay  data  for  the  Colnic  and  Ursoi  tunnels  and  has  incorporated these data into the exploration database.

The Romanian Government initiated porphyry exploration in the South Apuseni Mountains in the earlymid 1970s.  This work included airborne geophysics (magnetics) and surface sampling which led to the discovery of the Rosia Poieni porphyry deposit, located 27 km northeast from the Colnic Porphyry and 3 km from the Rosia Montana gold deposit.  This deposit has been mined by the State mining company and is presently active on a limited basis. To date, Rosa Poieni remains the largest single-porphyry deposit in Romania with 2003 resources stated as 350 Mt grading 0.36% Cu and 0.29 g/t Au (Milu et al.  2003).  It  is  not  known  as  to  how  the  mineral  resources  are  reported  as  to  whether  they  are Measured,  Indicated  or  Inferred  categories  or  if  they  are  CIM  or  JORC  compliant.   This  project  is currently being privatized.

## 6.4 Minexfor-Deva (mid 1970s to 1997 and 2000 to 2003)

Following  discovery  of  the  Rosia  Poieni  deposit,  regional  work  by  the  Romanian  State  exploration company,  Minexfor-Deva  (Minexfor),  identified  the  Colnic  and  Rovina  areas  as  prospective  for porphyry Cu mineralization.   In the mid-1970s, Minexfor drilled a 650 m deep vertical hole at Colnic (drill  hole  F-2;  see  Figure  6-1)  targeting  a  magnetic  high  anomaly  identified  from  the  Romanian Government's airborne survey.   Only a summary log was provided to Carpathian, which documents weakly anomalous Cu grades (averaging 400 ppm) between surface and 240 m depth and stronger anomalies (averaging 1,000 ppm) from 240 m to 650 m depth.  There are no gold analyses.

In  1974  Minexfor  initiated  a  diamond  drilling  program  at  the  Rovina  Deposit  (referred  to  as  the Bucuresci-Rovina Property in historical documents) to test the extent of the porphyry-style mineralization.   Over the next ten years, 34 holes totalling 23,119 m were drilled and sampled for Cu and intermittently for Au, Ag, Pb, Zn, Mo, Fe, and S.  Holes were vertical and averaged 680 m in depth. Details of the drilling are provided in Section 11.   In addition to the drilling, two levels of underground galleries were excavated in the form of grid patterns through the mineralized porphyry body to provide channel sampling and underground drilling stations (Figure 6.2).

In  1976  and  1977  IP/resistivity,  natural  polarization,  and  gamma  ray  geophysical  surveys  were reportedly completed by the Romanian government at Colnic.  The surveys were done over ten northsouth-oriented lines, spaced 200 m apart; however results have not been provided to Carpathian.

In 1982 Minexfor returned to the Colnic Deposit area to complete 500 m of trenches and surface pits, 500 m of exploration tunnels, and approximately 3,550 m of core drilling.  The drilling consisted of four

wide-spaced drill holes (FA, FB, FD, FF) located to the north and east of Carpathian's current drilling (see Figure 6-1).   These holes were vertical and drilled to depths ranging from 490 to 1,200 m.  Only summarized details of these holes were provided to Carpathian; however reportedly long intervals of weakly to moderately anomalous Cu grades (230 ppm to 710 ppm) were intersected, starting at depths generally greater than 300 m.  There are no gold analyses.

Additional magnetic and gamma ray geophysical surveys were completed by Minexfor during 1983 to 1984, together with a soil geochemistry survey.  Carpathian did not receive any of the results of these surveys.   From 1986 to 1987, Minexfor briefly explored the Rugina intrusive-sediment contact-related prospect.   Rugina  is  defined  by  anomalous  values  of  lead  and  zinc  from  surface  sampling  and  is located approximately 500 m to the northeast of Colnic.   Carpathian has indicated that to the best of their knowledge this prospect was never drill-tested.

Figure 6.2: Underground portal now collapsed at Rovina

<!-- image -->

In 1986, after ten years of drilling at the Rovina Deposit and development of underground access  (see above)  a  resource  estimate  for  copper  was  completed. Carpathian  purchased  this  data  from  the NAMR.  As the resource is not CIM-compliant, and has been superseded by the resource estimate that is the subject of this report, it is not included in this section.

In  2000,  Minexfor  returned  to  the  Colnic  Deposit  and  completed  additional  trenching  and  rock sampling, followed by eight core holes (F7 to F9 and F14 to F18) totalling 1,100 m (see Figure 6-1). These holes were drilled at angles ranging from vertical to almost horizontal in the area of Carpathian's current drilling and intersected stockwork-style mineralization.   Gold values appear to be in a similar range as those reported by Carpathian, but copper was not assayed by Minexfor.   Two of the holes

(F14 and F15), were drilled to the south and returned only weak Au anomalies.  No additional work was reported by Minexfor subsequent to this drilling.  Carpathian purchased the paper drill logs with assay results  of  this  program  from  the  NAMR. Some  of  this  drill  core  was  preserved  and  Carpathian reviewed available core.   The  core  was  not  in  good  condition,  however,  key  mineralization  features were observed.

In  2002-2003, Minexfor completed a diamond drill program in Valea Garzii within the Ciresata area. Six vertical drill holes were completed for 1,200 m of drilling to a maximum depth of 200 m.   One of these  holes,  F-4,  contained  anamolous  Au-mineralization  increasing  with  depth;  copper  was  not assayed.  Carpathian purchased the paper drilling logs with assays of this program from the NAMR.

## 6.5 Rio Tinto (1999 to 2000)

In 1999, Rio Tinto was granted a non-exclusive prospecting permit by the Romanian government over an  area  covering  approximately  24  by  30  km. This  area  included  the  current  boundaries  of Carpathian's  Rovina  Licence.   Subsequent  to  the  completion  of  a  reconnaissance-style  exploration program in December of that year, Rio Tinto applied for and was granted an Exploration Licence over this same area.  A more detailed exploration program commenced, comprising:

- regional stream sediment geochemical sampling
- grid soil geochemical sampling
- rock chip sampling over selected target areas
- helicopter-borne magnetic/radiometric survey (Furgo Airborne Corp., Canada)

The exploration work by Rio Tinto identified several targets within their license, however, the license was  relinquished  ahead  of  schedule  after  only  one-year  of  exploration.   Carpathian  purchased  Rio Tinto's final exploration report from the NAMR.

## 6.6 Carpathian (2004 to present)

## 6.6.1 Rovina Licence

The Rovina Property was acquired by Carpathian's wholly owned subsidiary, Samax Romania SRL, on 27  April  2004  as  a  one  year  non-exclusive  Prospecting  Permit.   That  year,  Carpathian  completed property-wide reconnaissance sampling and mapping with a focus on known prospects.  Following this work,  Carpathian  applied  for  an  Exploration  License  and  following  an  open-public  tender  and application process, was officially awarded the Rovina License (covering 9,351 ha) on August 29, 2005 for a four-year tenure.

Carpathian geologists had recognized the potential for significant Au-Cu porphyry mineralization in the licence area.   Initially, reconnaissance-style rockchip sampling of porphyry-style altered outcrops and road cuts highlighted the Au-Cu mineralization of the Colnic porphyry.   Historical data was purchased from  the  State  and  computerized  into  GIS  and  drilling  software  for  analysis.   Initial  field  programs focused  on  the  newly  recognized  Au-Cu  mineralization  at  Colnic  and  the  previously  known  Cu mineralization  at  Rovina  utilizing  channel  sampling  of  mineralized  outcrops  and  mapping.   Results indicated the presence of a wide zone of potassic-altered Au-Cu mineralization at Colnic not previously

08CARP0100\_REP00

recognized as a porphyry due to low copper contents and unfamiliar alteration.   Sampling at Rovina indicated  the  presence  of  significant  gold  associated  with  copper  mineralization  that  had  not  been previously recognized.   Field programs were focused on the immediate Colnic and Rovina areas as well as wide ranging reconnaissance exploration in surrounding areas comprised of geologic mapping and sampling at 1:5000 scale and soil geochemistry grids.  At the deposit scale, detailed mapping and rock-chip  and  channel  sampling  of  all  available  outcrops  was  completed. In  addition,  ground magnetometer  surveys  and  I.P.-Resistivity  surveys  were  completed  over  the  prospect  areas. In addition to defining the detailed surface signatures of the Colnic and Rovina porphyry prospects, this work located addition target areas with one of these targets, the Zdrapti prospect located approximately 2 km west of Rovina, was later drill-tested.  These drill results confirmed the presence of porphyry-style alteration  and  mineralization  but  contained  only  anomalous  levels  of  gold  and  copper.   Most  of  the generative exploration work was completed during 2005-2006 with much of this work concurrent with drilling programs.

Carpathian field programs in 2007 focused in the Garzii Valley within the Ciresata area, approximately 4  km  south  of  Colnic,  initially  with  geologic  mapping  and  sampling.   This  was  followed-up  with  soil geochemistry, ground magnetometer and I.P-Resistivity surveys.   Sampled surface outcrops resulted in mostly  non-anomalous  Au-Cu. The  recognition  of  a  zoned  porphyry-suite  of  alteration  and geophysical signature led to drilling which discovered 'blind' Au-Cu porphyry mineralization 50 - 150 m below the surface.  In total approximately 34 square kilometres of ground magnetometer surveys were completed over the Property along with 24.55 line kilometres of I.P. ground surveys.  Over 19 square kilometres of soil geochemistry surveys have also been completed on the property.

Drilling commenced on the Property in February 2006 and as of the date of the report, a total of 181 diamond drill holes had been completed for over 71,375 m.  Of this total, 89 drill holes for 29,618 m has been drilled on the Colnic Deposit, 67 drill holes for 31,704 m on the Rovina Deposit and 16 drill holes for  7,382  m  on  the  Ciresta  Deposit.   Additionally,  11  drill  holes  for  2,671  m  has  been  drilled  on  the Zdrapti Prospect.

In 2007 Carpathian began working on a mineral resource estimate for the Colnic and Rovina porphyry deposits.  Only the drilling completed during 2006 was incorporated into this mineral resource estimate which included 49 drill holes (15,714 m) from the Colnic Deposit and 17 drill holes (8,435 m) from the Rovina Deposit.   This resource estimate involved 3-d geologic modelling of lithologies and alteration types  to  determine  and  constrain  interpolation  domains. Independent  consultants  to  Carpathian, AMEC Americas Limited ('AMEC'), completed this initial NI 43-101 compliant Resource Estimate on May 29, 2007 for both the Rovina and Colnic deposits (Report file on SEDAR).   For both porphyry deposits, the reported Mineral Resource estimates were confined to a Whittle4x generated conceptual pit shell  to  determine  the  amount  of  potentially  mineable  open  pit  mineralization  using  various economic  assumptions.  The  Colnic  resource  estimate  was  divided  into  gold-copper  ('Au-Cu') mineralization (with block model Cu grades greater than 500 ppm) and gold ('Au') only mineralization (with  block  model  Cu  grades  less  than  500  ppm).  The  Rovina  resource  estimate  was  comprised entirely of Cu-Au mineralization.

The results of the 2007 mineral Resource Estimate by AMEC is shown Table 6-1 which summarizes the  estimated  in-pit  mineralization  for  each  of  the  Colnic  and  Rovina  porphyry  deposits;  with  Colnic comprised of Indicated and Inferred Mineral Resources reported at a base-case gold equivalent ('Au Eq.') cut-off grade of 0.4 g/t Au Eq. and Rovina comprised of Inferred Mineral Resources reported at a

08CARP0100\_REP00

base-case copper equivalent ('Cu Eq.') cut-off grade of 0.25% Cu Eq..   The base-case cut-offs were determined  from  assumed  economic  parameters  such  as  mining  and  milling  costs  of  comparable porphyry-type deposits and metal recoveries based on early-stage testwork.   This mineral Resource Estimate is superseded by the current Resource Estimate completed in November 2008 and discussed in detail in Section 17 of this report.

## Deposits and Prospects

The  focus  of  Carpathians  work  has  been  on  the  generative  exploration  for  drill  targeting  and  drill definition of the Colnic, Rovina, and Ciresata Porphyry Deposits.   The Colnic and Rovina deposits lie 2.5 km apart in the northern part of the property, with the Ciresata deposit occurring 4.8 km south of Colnic (See Figure 4-3).  One additional prospect was drill tested, the Zdrapti prospect 2.5 km west of Rovina.   Generative exploration has been carried out in the vicinity of the above deposits and at two secondary prospects, Cordurea and Valisoara, in the south part of the property (see Figure 4-2).   In addition, Carpathian has purchased all available historical data (described above) and computerized much of this into a GIS database.

## Colnic Porphyry Deposit

In  addition  to  detailed  geologic  mapping  (1:1000)  and  rock-chip  and  channel  sampling  of  outcrops, which led to the discovery of this deposit in 2006, the following work has been completed:

## Ciresata Porphyry Deposit

Carpathian  field  exploration  programs  began  to  focus  on  the  Ciresata  area  in  2007. Following generative exploration programs and drilling, the Ciresata deposit was discovered in early 2008 with Au-Cu mineralization occurring 50-100 m below the surface.  In addition to detailed geologic mapping (1:1000) and rock-chip and channel sampling of outcrops (barren on the surface) the following work has been completed:

- Included in 20 sq-km soil geochemistry survey (200x100m)
- Included in 24 sq-km ground magnetic survey (50x50m stations)
- Covered  by  3  traverses  of  IP  Pole-Dipole  geophysical  survey  totalling  4.2  line  km testing to a maximum depth of 180 m.

- Assay  analysis  of  half-core  on  a  mostly  metre-by-metre  basis,  detailed  geologic logging.
- Porphyry-style  alteration  intercepted  with  only  anomalous  Cu-Au  mineralization  for example:  Drillhole RZD-2 with 12 m (starting at 31 m downhole) with 0.08 g/t Au and 0.12% Cu.   Drillhole RZD-4 with 8 m (starting at 8 m downhole) with 0.30 g/t Au and 0.12% Cu.

Cordurea, and Valisoara-Porcurea Prospects:

These prospects are located in the southern portion of the Rovina Licence and were briefly explored by Carpathian  during  2006  through  various  surface  and  underground  sampling  programs,  stream sediment and soil sampling surveys and geological mapping.  These prospects are considered to be at an early stage of exploration.

## 7.1 Regional Geologic and Metallogenic Settings

The majority of the mineral deposits in the Romanian-Hungarian region are located in the Carpathian Fold Belt; an arcuate orogenic belt which is part of a much larger belt extending westward into Austria and Switzerland and south into Serbia and Bulgaria as shown in Figure 7-1 along with the age of the mineralization  in  braket.   These  belts  developed  during  the  late  Cretaceous  and  Tertiary,  following closure  of  the  Tethys  Ocean,  due  to  the  collision  of  continental  fragments  of  Gondwana  with continental  Europe  and  the  related  subduction  of  small,  intervening  oceanic  basins  (Alderton  and Fallick, 2000).

The  development  of  the  Carpathian  Fold  Belt  was  accompanied  by  widespread  igneous  activity, including  a  suite  of  late  Cretaceous  to  early  Eocene  acidic  to  intermediate  intrusive  and  extrusive rocks, known as 'banatites'.  These rocks are believed to have formed early stages of subduction and are  host  to  several  Cu-Mo-Fe  Porphyry  and  skarn  deposits. A  series  of  much  more  extensive Neogene volcanic and subvolcanic rocks are subdivided into three main groups (Alderton and Fallick, 2000):

- Early Miocene acidic tuffs and ignimbrites
- Mid Miocene  to Pliocene calc-alkaline stratovolcanoes
- Pliocene to Pleistocene alkaline volcanic rocks.

The Apuseni Mountains represent a somewhat 'isolated massif' with the Carpathian Fold Belt.   This setting is typical of most gold (-Cu) porphyry deposits worldwide (i.e. Cajamarca Belt, Peru; Maricunga Belt,  Chile;  Cordillera  Central  of  Luzon,  Philippines;  Sillitoe,  2000). The  southern  portion  of  the Apuseni  Mountains,  where  the  Apuseni-Rovina  Property  is  located,  consists  of  a  complex  area  of Palaeozoic  (and  older)  metamorphic  rocks,  Mesozoic  ophiolites  and  sedimentary  rocks  and  Tertiary igneous  and  sedimentary  rocks.   Magma  genesis  in  this  area  is  interpreted  to  be  associated  with extension within a strike slip regime in the Carpatho-Pannonian realm (Milu et al. 2003), which created pull  apart  basins.   Intersections  of  these  with  major  east-west  and  northeast-trending  pre-Laramian tectono-magmatic  lineaments  and  northwest-trending  Laramian  lineaments  are  believed  to  have concentrated areas of increased Tertiary volcanic and metallogenic activity (Balintoni 1994; Rosu et. al. 1997, 2000a in Milu et. al. 2003).

<!-- image -->

Regional  dating  studies  from  various  locations  within  the  Apuseni  Mountains  indicate  that  several Neogene calc-alkaline volcanic centres, representing three main episodes of volcanism, were active between  c.  15  Ma  and  1.6  Ma  (Rosu  et.  al.,  2004  in  Manske  and  Hedenquist,  2006).   Volcanism commenced in the east of the Apuseni Mountains (Rosia Montana-Bucium and areas adjacent to the Brad district), moved westward (into the Zarand basin), and then back eastward (Baia de Aries, Zlatna, Sacaramb and Deva areas) to the final phase at Uroi, see Figures 7-2 and 7-3.

The  first,  explosive,  episode  at  c.  15  Ma,  is  poorly  developed,  and  is  represented  by  rhyodacite  to dacitic tuffs that are interbedded with marls and deep sea pelagic sediments (Cioflica et. al. 1996 and Rosu et. al. 2000b in Milu et al. 2003).   The second episode (14.8 7.4 Ma) is calc-alkaline intrusiverelated,  and  represented  by  dacite,  associated  with  some  andesite  extrusive  activity. The  third episode, at c. 1.6 Ma, consists of deposition of trachyandesites (Milu et. al. 2003).

Different volcanic products have been described for the episodes, such as lava or extrusive domes, flows,  pyroclastic  and  volcano-sedimentary  deposits,  in  addition  to  intrusive  bodies  (dikes,  domes, microlaccolithes), that partly represent the rooted area of the volcanoes, as well as a large variety of intrusive breccias (e.g. Borcos in Borcos and Vlad, 1994; Tamas, 2002).   The volcanoes have been described  as  calderas,  stratovolcanoes,  simple  or  composite  volcanoes  and  extrusive  domes  (e.g., Ianovici  et  al.,  1969,  Berbeleac,  1975).   Generally,  the  volcanoes  preserve  less  than  a  third  of  their superstructure, as they were affected by an intense erosion activity such as in the Sacaramb area, but some domes, like Caraci and Cetras, have retained an original morphology (e.g., Borcos in Cioflica et al., 1973).

A variety of  mineral  deposits types  are present  in  the  Golden  Quadrilateral  area,  including  porphyry copper, epithermal veins (low-sulphidation, and less commonly high-sulphidation), breccia pipes and replacement bodies.

The first two volcanic-intrusive episodes are associated with the majority of the metallogenic activity. The first, mid-Miocene episode resulted in Au-Ag epithermal mineralization, such as that of the Rosia Montana  deposit  (Manske  and  Hedenquist,  2006). The  second,  mid-to  late  Miocene  episode,  is represented by Au-Ag (Te) epithermal mineralization (e.g. Sacaramb, Stanija, Baia de Aries), Pb-ZnCu (Au-Ag) mineralization (e.g. Troiuta, Coranda, Hanes) and porphyry Cu (Au-Mo) mineralization (e.g. Rosia Poieni, Deva, Bolcana and presumably Colnic and Rovina; Milu et al. 2003).

The porphyry deposits and occurrences in the South Apuseni Mountains were first recognized during the 1970s-1980s and were interpreted as being centred on shallow subvolcanic intrusions, which are cupolas on the roofs of deep-seated dioritic intrusions (Milu et. al. 2003).

## 7.2 Rovina Property Geology

The Rovina Property occurs within the defined Golden Quadrilateral Mining District located just east of the Brad-Barza sub-district, and near the northern end of the Sacarimb-Brad volcanic belt (see Figure 7-4).  The Property covers a sequence of Neogene-aged subvolcanic intrusive rocks, which in other parts of the Golden Quadrilateral, host epithermaland porphyry-style mineralization.   Carpathian's exploration programs have identified Au-rich porphyry systems (the Rovina, Colnic and Ciresta deposits) hosted by these Neogene subvolcanic intrusives.

## 7.2.1 Colnic-Rovina-Ciresata Area

The  Rovina  and  Colnic  porphyry  deposits  lie  within  a  northeastern  volcanic  outlier  of  the  8-10  km diameter, Neogene-aged, Brad-Barza volcanic field.   The Brad-Barza volcanic field is well known for hosting high-grade gold veins with an estimated historic gold production of 13 Moz. dating back to the Roman  period  (ca.  2000  yrs  ago).   The  Ciresata  porphyry,  4.5  km  south  of  Colnic,  lies  within  the eastern part of the Brad-Barza volcanic field.

The basement stratigraphy and volcanic rocks of the Rovina-Colnic-Ciresata area is regionally similar to that of the Brad-Barza volcanic field (Figure 7-4 and 7-5).  The basal sequence  comprises an upper Cretaceous  flysch,  locally  termed  the  'Strate  de  Piriul  Izvorului'.   This  unit  consists  of  tightly-folded siltstones, wackes, and thin interbeds of shale.  The regional trend of fold axes is northwest-southeast with  some  folds  being  overturned,  which  results  in  southwest-dipping  axial  planes  (Romania  State Geology Map, 1:50,000 scale).

Unconformably overlying this unit are a series of Neogene-aged, intermediate composition, subhorizontal  volcaniclastics  and  flows  which  have  limited  aerial  extent.   Common  in  the  area  are Isolated  bodies  of  massive  plagioclase-amphibole  -  pyroxene  -  biotite  andesites  (the  'Andesite  tip Barza') which are mapped as subvolcanic intrusive (Figure 7-5).

Lava flows and subvolcanic intrusives from the Rovina-Colnic area cover an arcuate shaped belt that is approximately 7 km long and about by 2-3 km wide (see Figure 7-5).  The porphyry mineralization at Rovina  and  Colnic  is  hosted  by  porphyritic  hornblende-plagiclase  -  quartz  -  pyroxene  diorites (Damian, 2006 in Ruff, 2006).  These are interpreted as subvolcanic intrusives.  At Ciresata, porphyry mineralization is hosted in hornblende-plagioclase-quartz diorites and hornfelsed Cretaceous sediments (Damian, 2008).

Mapped  phyllic  alteration  haloes  at  Rovina,Colnic  and  Ciresata  occur  in  subvolcanic  hornblende feldspar porphyries, volcaniclastic units, and locally, in Cretaceous sediments.

The Valea Morii Cu-Au porphyry deposit within the Barza magmatic complex, located just outside the Rovina  Exploration  License  (Figure  7-4),  has  age  dates  ranging  from  11.41  Ma  to  11.30  Ma (Kouzmanov et al., 2006).   Age dates on proximal barren andesite intrusions cover a wider range of dates,  which  both  pre-date  and  post-date  mineralization,  at  12.44  Ma,  11.87  Ma,  and  10.95  Ma (Kouzmanov et al., 2006).

Geological mapping, coupled with ground magnetic surveys by Carpathian in the Rovina-Colnic area, indicate the presence of late-stage hornblende-feldspar porphyries with primary magnetite occurring within the alteration halo of the Colnic porphyry system at the Cornetel Peak.  These are interpreted to represent post-mineralization intrusives.   Thus, based on present data, mineralization is bracketed by the basal volcaniclastic unit at Rovina and the post-mineral subvolcanic intrusives at Colnic, and may be of a similar age to the Valea Morii porphyry mineralization, i.e. about 11.4 Ma.

## 7.2.2 Rovina Deposit Geology

## Geology Summary

Copper-gold mineralization at Rovina is hosted in multiple composite plagioclase-hornblende porhyritic subvolcanic  intrusives.   This  mineralization  reaches  the  surface  and  is  exposed  in  one  location  as outcrops in the Baroc valley drainage over approximately 300 m (Figure 7-6).   The remaining sparse and  scattered  outcrops  are  phyllic-altered  fragmental  volcanics  and  porphrytic  volcanics  which comprise a mapped phyllic alteration halo of 1000 x 600m.  The mineralized porphyries are cylindrical and  vertical  with  mineralization  extending  up  to  600  m  below  surface. At  least  three  mineralized porphyries  are  recognized,  the  main  porphyry  (Rovina  Porphyry)  intrudes  (or  is  surrounded  by)  a brecciated  porhyritic  unit.   This  breccia  unit  is  locally  mineralised  and  is  interpreted  as  an  intrusive magmatic breccia (IMB) carapace to an upper-level intrusive.  The last, post-mineral stage of intrusive activity, is the emplacement of a phreato-magmatic breccia complex which cuts earlier porphyry units and is  grade  destructive.   Surface  geology  (Figure  7-6)  and  two  cross  sections  through  the  Rovina porphyry (Figures 7-7, and 7-8) are shown below  Plan map locations for the cross-sections are shown in Figure 11.4.

Multiple  inter-mineral  intrusive  phases  into  the  Rovina  porphyry  have  been  recognized  with  features such as breccia clasts of intense stockworked porphyry within later, less intense stockwork porphyry. Example  is  porphyry  B  intruding  the  axial  position  of  the  Rovina  Porphyry  as  shown  in  Figure  7-9 clearly illustrating a contact between the younger inter-mineral Porphyry B and the older Porphyry C (Rovina  Porphyry).  Intense  stockwork  veining  in  the  Porphyry  C  contrasts  against  the  moderate stockwork  veining  in  Porphyry  B  in  the  upper  section  of  the  core. These  multiple  events  lead  to complex  and  overprinting  stockwork  veining  and  alteration  features  and  likely  resulted  in  grade enhancements.

Alteration types recognized that are associated with mineralization include an early potassic (bitotie +/K-spar), magnetite (several events), and magnetite-propylitic (termed MACE, with magnetite, chlorite, epidote).  The MACE alteration oftem overprints the earlier potassic alteration.  Phyllic alteration occurs around the margins of the mineralised porphyries.

Petrographic description samples from the Rovina porphyry indicates a variably potassic and magnetite altered  plagioclase-hornblende  porphyry  is  host  to  disseminated  and  veinlet  controlled  chalcopyrite (Table  7-1).   Five  different  porphyries  have  been  interpreted  at  Rovina  and  a  list  of  major  lithologic units and logging codes is shown in Table 7-2.    A list of alteration types and logging codes is shown in Table 7-3.  Several alteration types are recognized with mineralization mainly associated with the early potassic  and  locally  overprinting  MACE  alteration. See  Table  7-4  for  an  interpreted  alterationmineralization paragenesis.

## Lithology and logging unit descriptions Rovina

The detailed logging protocol of Carpathian has differentiated the major lithologic units into subunits based  primarily  on  textural  features  and  cross-cutting  mineralization  features  in  the  case  of  intermineral porphyries.

## Overburden (OB - 600)

The completely oxidized colluvium, alluvium, residual soil and weathered rock occurring at the top of most drill holes.

## Glamm Breccia (GBX - 610)

The glamm breccia (phreatomagmatic breccia) tends to have distinct/sharp cross-cutting contacts with the surrounding wallrocks.  This unit is generally polylithic containing sand to cobble scale rounded to angular  clasts  of  mineralized  and  barren  porphyry,  previously  formed  breccia  phases,  and  vein fragments. This  unit  appears  to  have  formed  post  mineral  and  aside  from  minor  carbonate+/basemetal mineralization present locally it has not been cross-cut by mineralized quartz or sulphide veins or overprinted by earlier potassic or MACE alteration.  Most of the gold and copper mineralization occurring  within  the  glamm  breccia  is  restricted  to  clasts  of  strongly  veined  porphyritic  wallrock  that have been incorporated into this unit close to the margins of the breccia pipe.  The matrix of the glamm breccia is generally chlorite-clay enriched giving the unit a characteristic pistachio green to light grey (bleached)  colour. The  margins  of  clasts  have  also  been  affected  by  this  alteration  resulting  in bleached rims.   Four texturally distinct sub-categories of glamm breccia have been recognized in drill core.

Crystal Rich Glamm (XGBX - 611) -This rock type was previously logged as a late (post mineral) fine to medium grained feldspar-amphibole porphyry because of its homogeneous, porphyritic appearance. It  has  been  interpreted  here  as  an  early,  crystal  rich  phase  of  the  glamm  breccia  unit  due  to  its ubiquitous occurrence within this unit, similarities in the style and intensity of chlorite-clay alteration, and complete lack of mineralized veining and potassic/MACE alteration.  Crystal rich glamm generally contains 5-7 modal percent 2-3mm feldspar and 5-7 modal percent, 2-3mm mafic phenocrysts within a

much finer grained chlorite-clay enriched matrix.  This unit is generally cross-cut by thin glamm breccia shoots and clasts of crystal rich glamm are common within younger glamm breccia phases.  Locally a weakly developed lamination has been observed that may indicate a genetic relationship with the more strongly banded laminated glamm breccia described below.  This rock type is generally unmineralized.

Laminated Glamm (LGBX - 612) -This rock type is characterized by a pervasive flow banding that consists  of  sub-parallel,  commonly  irregular  laminations  defined  by  composition  and  grain  size variation.   Previously laminated glamm breccia was included as part of the matrix rich glamm.   It has been  distinguished  here  due  to  its  porphyrytic  appearance  which  resembles  the  crystal  rich  glamm described above.   This unit may also be cross-cut by matrix or clast rich glamm breccia shoots and clasts of this rock type are common within younger glamm breccia phases.  This rock type is generally unmineralized.

Clast Rich Glamm (CGBX - 613 ) -This rock type is generally poorly sorted containing angular to subrounded  clasts  of  strongly  altered/mineralized/veined  porphyry,  barren  porphyry,  previously  formed breccia  phases,  and  vein  fragments  within  a  pistachio  green  to  light  grey  (bleached)  chlorite-clay enriched  matrix. Close  to  the  margins  of  the  breccia  pipe  clast  rich  glamm  breccia  may  contain significant copper/gold mineralization within clasts of mineralized wall rock that have been incorporated into the breccia unit.   Where mineralized clasts do not occur clast rich glamm breccias are generally unmineralized. Clast-dominated  glamm  breccias  grade  into  and  are  interfingered  with  matrix dominated  breccias  suggesting  that  these  two  rock  types  may  be  related. The  Glamm  breccias possibly represent the marginal facies to matrix dominated breccia shoots.

Matrix  Rich  Glamm  (MGBX  -  614) -The  matrix-dominated  glamm  breccia  is  finer  grained,  better sorted,  and  more  comminuted  than  the  clast  rich  glamms  described  above.   The  rock  is  generally macroscopically  structureless  and  has  a  pistachio  green  to  light  gray  (bleached)  colour  due  to pervasive chlorite-clay enrichment.   Where mineralized clasts do not occur this rock type is generally unmineralized.

## Amphibole-Feldspar Porphyry (Porphyritic Diorite - 620, 630, 640, 650, 660)

The majority of the veining, mineralization and alteration in the Rovina deposit is hosted by a series of medium  to  coarse  grained  amphibole-feldspar  porphyry  stocks. These  units  generally  contain approximately 7-10 modal percent 3-12 mm black green euhedral prismatic hornblende porphyrocrysts and  15-20  modal  percent  1-4  mm  white/colourless  subhedral-blocky  prismatic,  zoned  plagioclase phenocrysts within fine granular to aphanitic groundmass.  The various porphyry stocks at Rovina (PA, PB,  PC,  PD,  PE)  were  identified  as  separate  intrusive  phases  using  a  combination  of  observations including the alignment of phenocrysts adjacent to intrusive margins, truncation of quartz veins within older porphyry phases cross-cut by younger ones, and the incorporation of quartz vein fragments and quartz veined xenoliths within younger porphyry phases that have been emplaced into older, previously veined phases.   Decrease in phenocryst size and sudden changes in grade and alteration type were also  considered  when  distinguishing  between  earlier  and  later  porphyry  intrusions. Within  each porphyry unit finer grained (621, 631, 641, 651, 661) and coarser grained (622, 632, 642, 652, 662) end-members  were  identified  during  logging  as  well  as  intervals  displaying  magmatic  foliation  or lamination (623, 633, 643, 653, 663) .

In total five amphibole-feldspar porphyry stocks were identified at Rovina including (from youngest to oldest)

Porphyry A (660) - North West (Baroc Valley) Porphyry (Late-mineral)

Porphyry E (620) - Potassic-Silicic Porphyry (Late-mineral)

Porphyry D (630) - Baroc Valley Porphyry (Late-Intermineral)

Porphyry B (650) - Intermineral Porphyry (Intermineral)

Porphyry C (640) - Rovina Porphyry (Early-mineral)

Intrusive Magmatic Breccia (IMB - 670)

The intrusive magmatic breccia is a pre-mineral clast bearing unit that appears to form the host rocks to the mineralized porphyry stocks at Rovina.  This unit generally has a complex texture and contains sub-angular  to  rounded  igneous  and  sedimentary  rock  fragments  within  a  fine  grained  granular  to porphyritic  matrix.   This  unit  is  affected  by  early  potassic  and  MACE  alteration  and  is  cross-cut  by mineralized quartz and sulphide veining.   Where this unit is strongly altered margins of clasts are be poorly  defined  giving  the  rock  a  clotty/spotted  appearance. Intervals  displaying  well  developed magmatic foliation are common within this unit suggesting that it may be part of a pre-mineral diatreme breccia or sub-volcanic intrusion that subsequently became the host to the mineralized porphyry stocks at  Rovina.  In  addition  to  the  rock  type  described  above,  two  texturally  distinct  sub-categories  of intrusive magmatic breccia have been recognized in drill core.

Laminated  Intrusive  Magmatic  Breccia  (LIMB  -  671) -This  unit  consists  of  restricted  intervals  of moderately  to  strongly  laminated  intrusive  magmatic  breccia. Lamination  is  generally  defined  by clotty/discontinuous sub-parallel layers of magnetite-amphibole-chlorite +/- sulphide alteration within a much  finer  grained  matrix. These  zones  generally  grade  into  and  out  of  more  typical  intrusive magmatic breccia.

Xenolith  Rich  Porphyry  (XIMB  -  672) -Intervals  of  clast  poor  intrusive  magmatic  breccia  with  a spotty/porphyrytic  texture  also  occur  locally.   These  intervals  generally  grade  into  and  out  of  more typical intrusive magmatic breccia.

## Flysch Sediment (SED - 680)

A locally laminated unit of very fine-grained mudstone to fine-grained sandstone was intersected to the south  of  the  Rovina  porphyry  in  RRD-38. This  rock  type  appears  to  host  the  intrusive  magmatic breccia unit described above.   Adjacent to the contact with the intrusive magmatic breccia described above this unit may be strongly fractured and biotite and/or sericite/clay enriched becoming dark brown to pale grey/beige in colour.  Fracture controlled pyrite +/-silica may also occur within altered intervals.

Breccia (BX - 690)

Poorly defined intervals of early to syn-mineral (possibly orthomagmatic) brecciation occur within all of the described porphyry phases at Rovina.   These breccias included zones of monolithic (692) wall rock  breccia  and polylithic  (693) brecciation  that  may  have  formed  in  response  to  magmatic  fluid discharge from intermineral or late mineral porphyry phases.  Intrusive breccias that appear to form a

sheath  around  intermineral  and  late-mineral  porphyry  stocks  have  also  been  observed.   In  general these units are affected by the similar alteration and stockwork intensity as the surrounding rocks.

## Post Mineral Dyke (LD - 700)

Weakly altered, unmineralized late mineral intrusions (dykes) have also been identified locally within the Rovina deposit.  However, overall post mineral dykes are not common.

Oxidation (FeOx - 41)

Rusty orange-brown limonite, goethite, red-brown hematite, and white clay enriched oxidation.

## Propylitic Alteration (PR - 42)

Propylitic  alteration  within  the  Rovina  deposit  is  not  widespread  and  is  generally  restricted  to  late intrusive dykes and post-mineral breccias (i.e. Glamm Breccias).  Propylitic alteration is generally light green to pistachio  green  in  colour  and  characterized  by  a  mineral  assemblage  containing  abundant chlorite-carbonate-clay and pyrite.  Aside from minor carbonate+/-basemetal +/-gold bearing veins that may be present locally, propylitic altered rocks are generally poorly mineralized.

## Propylitic Alteration within Glamm Breccia (GM - 35)

The matrix of clast rich and matrix rich glamm breccias is generally light green to pistachio green in colour  and  characterized  by  a  propylitic  mineral  assemblage  containing  abundant  chlorite-claycarbonate. Propylitic  alteration  has  also  resulted  in  bleaching  of  the  margins  of  wallrock  clasts occurring within this unit.

## Clay-Sericite-Pyrite-Quartz-Carbonate Alteration (CSPQ - 44)

To simplify the current alteration model phyllic  alteration  (PH  -  33) and transitional  phyllic  alteration (TRPH  -  43) occurring  peripheral  to  mineralized  parts  the  Rovina  deposit  and  less  significant structurally  controlled argillic alteration  (A  -  36) and  basemetalcarbonate  alteration  (CC  -  37) occurring  along  lithological  contacts  and  within  fractured/faulted  zones  throughout  the  deposit  were correlated  together  as  clay-sericite-pyrite-quartz  carbonate  alteration  (CSPQ). CSPQ  alteration  is characterized by a dominant assemblage of clay-sericite-quartz-pyrite that is generally consistent with the low grade peripheral parts of the Rovina deposit.  Approximately 5-15 vol.% pyrite generally occurs within  this  alteration  type  as  3-7  mm  clusters  of  fine-grained  aggregates,  disseminated  grains,  and within  mm-scale  fractures.  CSPQ  alteration  is  typically  light  grey,  greenish  grey,  to  pinkish  grey  in colour.

## 'MACE' Alteration (MACE - 30w, 30m, 30i)

Magnetite-amphibole-chlorite-epidote rich alteration (MACE) also containing K-feldspar, quartz, titanite, anhydrite and carbonate appears to be associated with the highest grade intervals within the Rovina deposit.   It  is  common for rocks within the Rovina deposit to have been potassically altered prior to becoming overprinted by MACE alteration.  Therefore, where MACE alteration is less intense the rock generally has a brownish-green to pinkish-green colour and a mineral assemblage consisting of biotiteamphibole-chlorite-magnetite-quartz-pink  K-feldspar  and  sulphides  (cpy-py). Pink,  fine-grained  Kfeldspar  is  more  common  is  this  alteration  type  then  in  purely  potassic  alteration. Where  MACE alteration is pervasive it is texturally destructive, generally giving the rock a dark green to light green colour.   The MACE alteration assemblage is typically associated with magnetite stringers and clots, a well  developed  quartz-sulphide  vein  stockwork,  and  significant  fine-grained  disseminated  cpy-py-mt mineralization.

## Potassic Alteration (PT - 31w, 31m, 31i)

Potassic alteration is the most widespread alteration type occurring within the Rovina deposit.  Potassic alteration  is  generally  associated  with  a  mineral  assemblage  that  includes:  biotite-magnetite-quartzpink  K-feldspar  +/-trace  green  amphibole  and  chlorite.  The  alteration  minerals  occur  as  finely disseminated  grains  in  the  groundmass  of  the  rock  and  as  granular  aggregates  of  'ratty'  biotitemagnetite +/- sulphides (cpy-py). Very fine irregular stringers of magnetite are also associated with this alteration  type.  The  amount  of  pink-coloured  K-feldspar  and  amphibole/chlorite  can  vary  greatly. Within the Rovina deposit it is common for potassic alteration to grade into or become overprinted by 'MACE' alteration through a gradual increase of the amount of amphibole, chlorite and epidote present in the alteration assemblage.

## Potassic-Silicic Alteration (PTSI - 3139)

Potassic-Silicic alteration is characterized by a lack of magnetite and an intense reddish brown to pale pinkish  brown  colour  which  distinguishes  it  from  the  darker  brown  colour  of  potassic  alteration.  At Rovina  this  alteration  type  is  defined  by  the  assemblage  of  reddish-brown  coloured  biotite-  pink  Kfeldspar-quartz-epidote-chlorite and sulphides (py-po-mo-cpy).   Sulphides occur as fine disseminated grains within the groundmass and within quartz-sulphide veins. The potassic-silicic alteration at Rovina is similar to the deep-seated Colnic potassic core and is characteristically of a low grade.

## Silicic Alteration (SIL - 39)

Silicification is characterized by pervasive bleaching and quartz enrichment +/- minor epidote-chloriteclay +/-pyrite.  Silicification generally gives the rock a light grey colour and increased hardness. Pyrite occurs  as  fine  disseminated  grains  and  grain  aggregates  within  the  groundmass  and  within  quartz veins. In some places this alteration type appears to be related to potassic-silicic alteration described above.

## Discussion

Within the Rovina deposit it is common to observe more than one overprinting alteration phase within a given interval of drill core.  In the drill logs, the mineral assemblage and intensity of each alteration type has been recorded, highlighting the dominant alteration type within each logged interval.  The dominant alteration type was then assigned to one of 18 logging codes which were used to create the current alteration  model. Considering  this  small  and/or  isolated  intervals  of  alteration  occurring  within  an otherwise homogeneous zone of a different dominant alteration type were not broken out as separate units during interpretation.

To simplify the current alteration model argillic, phyllic, transitional phyllic, and carbonate-clay alteration were grouped together as clay-sericite-pyrite-quartz  alteration  (CSPQ).   All  of  these  alteration  types appear to have formed late locally overprinting earlier alteration phases.    Aside from localized copper and gold mineralization occurring within some carbonate-basemetal veins, these alteration types are not associated with significant mineralization.

The  initial  intrusion  of  the  Rovina  porphyry  (PC)  into  the  intrusive  magmatic  breccia  (IMB)  was followed by widespread potassic alteration within the Rovina porphyry and pervasive MACE alteration within  the  surrounding  breccia  package. Peripheral  to  the  Rovina  porphyry  MACE  and  potassic alteration  were  replaced  and  locally  overprinted  by  phyllic  alteration  forming  an  extensive  quartzsericite-pyrite halo.

Intrusion of the inter-mineral porphyry (PB) into the Rovina porphyry (PC) was followed by weak MACE alteration within the inter-mineral porphyry and more intense overprinting MACE alteration within the hosting Rovina porphyry.   MACE alteration appears to be most strongly developed within the Rovina porphyry adjacent to the northern margin of the inter-mineral porphyry.   In this strongly altered zone overprinting MACE alteration is texturally destructive and pre-existing potassic alteration minerals are rarely preserved.  Further from the intrusive centre, overprinting MACE alteration decreases in intensity eventually becoming secondary to the underlying potassic alteration.

Intrusion of the potassic-silicic porphyry (PE) was followed by pervasive potassic-silicic alteration within this  intrusion.   However  the  potassic-silicic  alteration  occurring  within  PE  appears  to  have  had  little visible effect on the surrounding wallrocks.

At Rovina all intrusive rock types have been cross-cut by post-mineral glamm breccias.  Subsequent to their formation the glamm breccia dykes appear to have focused late, low-temperature fluids resulting in pervasive propylitic alteration of crystal rich and laminated end-members.  Propylitic alteration within the glamm breccia has also affected the matrix to clast-rich and matrix-rich glamms and the margins of wallrock clasts.

Tectonic shattering and brecciation adjacent to intrusive contacts and glamm breccia shoots is often associated  with  structurally  controlled  argillic  alteration  and/or  minor  carbonate-basemetal  veining. Late, low temperature argillic alteration has also affected the upper parts of glamm breccia dykes and the intrusive magmatic breccia occurring to the south of the Rovina porphyry.

In the southwest, the Baroc Valley porphyry (PD) is associated with a MACE altered core grading into potassic alteration closer to the porphyries margins.   The Northwest (Baroc Valley) porphyry (PA) is associated  with  a  very  weak  propylitic  to  unaltered  core  grading  into  potassic  and  potassic-silicic alteration closer to its margins.  Overprinting potassic-silicic alteration and silicification occurs within the Baroc Valley porphyry and intrusive magmatic breccia package adjacent to the eastern and southern margins of PA.

The upper parts and margins of the Baroc Valley porphyry and the Northwest (Baroc Valley) porphyry have been overprinted by retrograde phyllic and/or argillic alteration which becomes more extensive to the  southwest. Intrusive  magmatic  breccia  occurring  in  this  area  has  also  been  pervasively  claysericite-pyrite-quartz enriched.

## 7.2.3 Colnic Deposit Geology

## Geology Summary

Gold-copper mineralization at Colnic is hosted in multiple composite plagioclase-hornblende porhyritic subvolcanic intrusives.  This mineralization reaches the surface in the Rovina Valley and is exposed in outcrops and road-cuts in the valley bottom over a distance of approximately 400 m.   The remaining sparse and scattered outcrops are phyllic-altered porphyritic volcanics and Cretaceous sediments, and propylitic altered hornblende andesites.  The Colnic deposit has a large phyllic alteration halo covering 2000  x  1700  m. Two  mineralized  porphyry-centers  comprise  the  bulk  of  the  Colnic  deposit;  one occurring  in  the  Rovina  Valley  (Colnic  Porphyry)  which  partially  outcrops,  and  a  second  center approximately 200 m southeast on 'F-2' Hill (F-2 Hill Porphyry).  The mineralised porphyries are lobate with a wider horizontal dimension then vertical extent.   These bodies intrude mostly older pre-mineral intrusive and locally in the northeast Cretaceous flysch sediments.  At Colnic, and especially for the F-2 Hill Porphyry, much of the wall-rock is a clastic unit of igneous composition with several facies ranging from  flow-laminated  silty  textures  to  zenolithic  porphyry  which  is  interpreted  to  be  an  intrusive magmatic breccias complex (IMB) related to the emplacement of the porphyry as a marginal carapace. Locally this unit is altered and mineralised close to it's contact with the porphyry which is shallow-east dipping on F-2 Hill.

The Colnic Porphyry is more intensely mineralized than the F-2 Hill porphyry and is complicated by an interpreted  series  of  northeast-striking  and  subvertical  inter-mineral  dikes  and  breccias. These intermineral dikes and breccias may have been important for grade enhancements in this area, and the Rovina Valley Porphyry is interpreted to be older than the F-2 Hill Porphyry.  Surface geology (Figure 7-10) and two cross sections through the Rovina porphyry (Figures 7-11, and 7-12) are shown below. Plan map locations for the cross-sections are shown in Figure 11.3.

At  Colnic,  overprinting  alteration  is  a  very  common  feature. Phyllic  alteration  overprint  on  Au-Cu mineralised  potassic  alteration  is  a  prevalent  especially  in  the  Colnic  Porphyry.  Alteration  types recognized  that  are  associated  with  mineralization  include  an  early  potassic  (bitotie  +/-  K-spar), magnetite (several events), and magnetite-propylitic (termed MACE, with magnetite, chlorite, epidote). Phyllic alteration occurs around the margins of the mineralised porphyries.

Petrographic description samples from the Colnic porphyry indicates a variably potassic and magnetite altered  plagioclase-hornblende  porphyry,  commonly  overprinted  by  phyllic  alteration,  is  host  to disseminated  and  veinlet  controlled  chalcopyrite  (Table  7-5). In  addition,  minor  occurrences  of sphalerite and pyrrhotite are observed in core and petrography.

Four different porphyries have been interpreted at Colnic and a list of major lithologic units and logging codes  is  shown  in  Table  7-6.   A  list  of  alteration  types  and  logging  codes  is  shown  in  Table  7-7. Several alteration types are recognized with mineralization mainly associated with the early potassic and  locally  overprinting  MACE  alteration.   See  Table  7-8  for  an  interpreted  alteration-mineralization paragenesis.

## Lithology and logging unit descriptions Colnic

## Basement Sediment (SED-13)

Sedimentary  rocks  occur  along  the  northeastern  margin  of  the  Colnic  deposit  hosting  the  satellite porphyry and breccia package and the garnet-bearing porphyry described below.  This unit is made up of laminated very fine-grained mudstone to fine-grained sandstone.  Adjacent to the satellite porphyry the sediments may be strongly fractured and biotite and/or sericite-clay enriched becoming dark brown to  pale  grey/beige  in  colour. Quartz  stockwork  veining  and  minor  copper  mineralization  may  be associated with altered sediments locally.

## Cornitel (Wallrock) Porphyry (WR-POR-14)

A coarse-grained porphyry containing 7-12 modal percent 5-10mm black-green amphibole phenocrysts and  17-26  modal  percent  2-3mm  white  to  colourless  plagioclase  phenocrysts  within  an  aphanitic groundmass  occurs  to  the  north,  south,  and  west  of  the  Colnic  deposit.   This  unit  is  generally  not veined or mineralized and is overprinted by pervasive phyllic to transitional alteration.

Intrusive Magmatic Breccia (IMB-8)

At  Colnic  the  mineralized  porphyry  stocks  are  enveloped  by  a  heterogeneous  package of  clast  rich, laminated and brecciated porphyry similar to the IMB unit described in the Rovina deposit.   This unit generally has a complex texture and contains sub-angular to rounded igneous rock fragments within a fine grained granular to porphyritic matrix.   Intervals displaying well developed magmatic foliation are also  common, especially adjacent  to  the  margins  of  the  F2-Hill  porphyry.   At  Colnic  the  IMB  unit  is believed to represent a pre-mineral sub-volcanic intrusion that subsequently  became  host  to mineralized porphyry stocks.

## Amphibole-Feldspar Porphyry

Much of the veining, mineralization and alteration at Colnic is hosted by a series of fine- to coarsegrained  amphibole-feldspar  porphyry  stocks  and  dykes.   However,  correlation  of  the  various  earlymineral, inter-mineral, late-mineral, and post-mineral intrusions is complicated by the fact that cross-

cutting porphyry phases are similar in composition, internally heterogeneous, and can be extensively brecciated, especially at their margins.   Alteration associated with subsequent intrusions also masks intrusive  contacts.   However,  using a  combination  of  abrupt  changes  in geochemistry and alteration intensity  and  contact  relationships  observed  while  logging  and  re-logging  drill  core  eight  distinct intrusive phases have been identified at Colnic.  In general the coherent porphyry stocks contain 7-12 modal  percent  1-6mm  black-green  amphibole  phenocrysts  and  17-26  modal  percent  1-2mm  (3mm max) white to colourless plagioclase phenocrysts within an aphanitic groundmass, however within each unit variations in phenocryst content and grain size are common.

The  following  eight  phases  of  amphibole-feldspar  porphyry  intrusion  and  brecciation  have  been identified at Colnic including from oldest to youngest:

- Colnic Porphyry and Breccia Package - C-POR-5 (Early-mineral)
- Deep Coherent Colnic Porphyry Stock - CD-POR-6 (Early Inter-mineral)
- Late-Mineral Porphyry Dykes and Breccias - LM-POR-7 (Inter-mineral)
- F2-Hill Porphyry and Breccia Package - F2-POR-4 (Inter-mineral)
- Garnet Bearing Porphyry - G-POR-12 (Late-mineral)
- Satellite Porphyry and Breccia Package S-POR-11; S-IMB-9; S-BX-10 (Late-mineral)
- Post Mineral Porphyry Stock - PM-POR-3 (Post-mineral)
- Post Mineral Porphyry Dykes - LD-1 (Post-mineral)

Colnic Porphyry and Breccia Package (C-POR-5) This unit represents the earliest intrusive phase at Colnic and is the most important host to quartz stockwork veining, alteration, and mineralization in this area. A significant component of the Colnic Porphyry package is made up of breccia (orthomagmatic and/or intrusion related).   The remainder appears to consist of a heterogeneous package of mediumgrained feldspar-amphibole porphyry; however several episodes of overprinting alteration and intense quartz stockwork veining make identification of primary textures within this unit difficult.

In  drill  holes  RCD-4,  RCD-9,  RCD-10,  RCD-39,  RCD-51,  RCD-73,  and  RCD-82  intervals  of  microdiorite have been identified within the Colnic porphyry unit.   In general these zones are fine-grained, weakly altered and lack the pervasive quartz stockwork veining characteristic of the rest of the Colnic porphyry package.   In general, the micro-diorite shoots are extensively brecciated.   Where coherent bodies  of  micro-diorite  occur  it  is  generally  dark  grey  to  green/brown  in  colour  and  contains  15-17 modal percent +/-1mm amphibole and 25-30 modal percent 0.2-0.6mm plagioclase crystals within an aphanitic groundmass.   In RCD-10, RCD-51 and RCD-73 the micro-diorite is cross-cut by a series of sheeted  quartz-sulphide  veins  that  may  be  related  to  a  moderate  increase  in  the  copper  and  gold grades within this unit.

Within the Colnic porphyry package all drill holes containing micro-diorite, with the exception of RCD-4, occur  on  cross-section  1000N. In  the  current  model  these  intervals  are  believed  to  represent  a volumetrically restricted steeply dipping shoot of finer-grained igneous rock emplaced into the Colnic porphyry package at a late stage in its development.   Although the grade within micro-diorite shoot is typically lower than in the surrounding rocks it does contain moderate copper and gold mineralization. For simplicity in the current interpretation the micro-diorite has not been modeled separately from the Colnic porphyry package.

Deep  Coherent  Colnic  Porphyry  Stock  (CD-POR-6)  This  unit  occurs  in  the  deep  parts  of  crosssections  940N,  1000N,  and  1050N  and  consists  of  a  coherent  medium-grained  feldspar-amphibole

porphyry  intrusion  that  has  been  overprinted  by  pervasive  reddish/brown  potassic  K3  alteration. Intrusive breccias are commonly associated with the margins of this unit.   The deep coherent Colnic porphyry appears to have been emplaced into the older Colnic porphyry package sometime after its formation, and has subsequently been cross-cut by the northeast-southwest striking late-mineral dykes and breccias described below.

Late-Mineral Porphyry Dykes and Breccias (LM-POR-7) -Several thin (generally 5 to 15 metre thick) north-northeast  to  northeast  striking  steeply  southeast  dipping  (65-85  degrees)  amphibole-feldspar porphyry dykes and breccia zones have been identified within the Colnic porphyry package outcroping on  the  northern  side  of  the  Rovina  Valley  and  in  holes  drilled  on  cross-sections  940N,  1000N,  and 1050N.    The dykes and breccia zones are believed to have formed at a late stage in development of the Colnic deposit within a structural corridor running parallel to the Rovina valley.  As a consequence the  late  dykes  and  breccias  cross-cut  both  the  Colnic  porphyry  package  and  the  deep  coherent porphyry and are responsible for many of the sharp grade breaks occurring in holes drilled in this area. In  addition  to  having  unique  geochemistry,  the  late-mineral  dykes  have  been  identified  in  drill  core using  a  number  of  observations  including  the  alignment  of  phenocrysts  adjacent  to  dyke  margins, truncation of quartz veins, the presence of quartz vein fragments and quartz veined xenoliths within the dykes, and a general decrease in phenocryst size, quartz stockwork veining and alteration intensity within  the  dykes  relative  to  the  surrounding  rocks. Intrusion  related  brecciation  is  also  commonly associated with the margins of these units.

F2-Hill  Porphyry  and  Breccia  Package  (F2-POR-4)  The  F2-Hill  porphyry  package  consists  of  a heterogeneous  assemblage  of  fine-  to  medium-grained  feldspar-amphibole  porphyry,  micro-diorite shoots, and orthomagmatic and intrusion related breccias that occur to the south of the Colnic porphyry package beneath F2 hill.   These rock types appear to be related and together form the host to the alteration, quartz stockwork veining, and mineralization in this area.

Garnet  Bearing  Porphyry  (G-POR-12)  A  laminated,  garnet  bearing,  medium-grained  feldsparamphibole  porphyry  stock  occurs  to  the  east  of  the  F2-Hill  porphyry  in  contact  with  the  basement sediments.  Locally weak to moderate quartz veining and K3 alteration occurs within this unit however it is not mineralized.

Satellite  Porphyry  and  Breccia  Package  (S-POR-11;  S-IMB-9;  S-BX-10) -  A  coherent  medium-  to coarse-grained  feldspar-amphibole  porphyry  stock  (11)  associated  with  moderate  quartz  stockwork veining, K3 alteration and weak to moderate copper mineralization occurs to the northeast of the Colnic porphyry package.  The position of this unit appears to be controlled by the northwest trending contact between  the  intrusive  magmatic  breccia  and  basement  sediments.   A  package  of  intrusive  breccia (similar to the IMB unit described above) is closely associated with the emplacement of the satellite porphyry stock and has been modeled as S-IMB (9).  Cross-cutting zones of matrix- to clast-supported breccia  containing  strongly  veined  K3+A  (potassic  overprinted  by  argillic)  altered  sediment  and porphyry  fragments  have  also  been  identified  in  association  with  the  satellite  porphyry  stock  and modeled separately as S-BX (10).  However these three units may be related.

Post  Mineral  Porphyry  Stock  (PM-POR-3)  A  post-mineral,  propytically  altered,  medium-grained porphyry stock has been identified within the F2-Hill porphyry on cross-sections 670N and 740N.

Post  Mineral  Porphyry  Dykes  (LD-1)  Post  mineral,  propytically  altered,  medium-grained  feldsparamphibole porphyry dykes have also been identified within the Colnic deposit.   These dykes may be related to the post mineral stock described above.

## Chubby's Fault (FLT-2)

Chubby's fault is a roughly north-northwest to northwest trending zone of fractured rock, gouge and fault breccia generally associated with intense argillic alteration.

## K3 Alteration

At  Colnic  potassic  (K3) alteration is  the  most  common alteration type identified in drill  core and thin section. K3  alteration  is  generally  associated  with  pervasive  biotite  or  K-feldspar  alteration  of  the groundmass  accompanied  by  quartz,  magnetite,  and  disseminated  sulphides  (pyrite,  pyrrhotite, chalcopyrite).  In porphyritic rocks mafic phenocrysts are generally replaced by granular aggregates of 'ratty'  biotite,  magnetite and sulphides while K-feldspar commonly replaces plagioclase phenocrysts. Depending on whether biotite or K-feldspar is more abundant K3 altered rocks will have a dark brown or reddish-brown to pink colour respectively.

Within the Colnic deposit potassic alteration is best developed within the F2-Hill porphyry and the deep coherent Colnic porphyry units.   The late-mineral dykes are also commonly associated with potassic alteration.

## K2 Alteration

At Colnic it is common for K3 alteration to grade into or become overprinted by K2 alteration through a gradual increase of the amount of chlorite, magnetite, epidote, and actinolite present in the alteration assemblage.  K2 alteration is generally most strongly developed adjacent to micro-fractures and veins containing  magnetite-quartz-chlorite+/-actinolite  and  sulphides  (pyrite,  chalcopyrite).   K2  alteration  is generally associated with chloritisation of biotite, the replacement of plagioclase by epidote and calcite, and a much more intense development of magnetite, followed by pyrite and chalcopyrite.   Where K2 alteration is pervasive it is generally texturally destructive giving the rock a dark green to light green colour.  Where K2 alteration is less intense the rock has a brownish-green to pinkish-green colour and a mineral  assemblage  consisting  of  biotite-chlorite-magnetite-K-feldspar-quartz-epidote-calcite  +/actinolite and sulphides (cpy-py).

## K Alteration

The alteration occurring within the Colnic porphyry package is characteristically complex consisting of patchy zones of K3 overprinted by K2 alteration, which in turn is overprinted by structurally controlled phyllic alteration.   In addition rocks occurring adjacent to late- and post- mineral breccias, faults, and fractured zones have been affected by low temperature argillic alteration.  The general term K is used here to describe an alteration package consisting of variable amounts of K2, K3, phyllic, and argillic alteration typically associated with intense quartz stockwork veining.

## TRPH Alteration (Transitional Phyllic)

Transitional phyllic alteration is used to describe intervals where phyllic alteration partially overprints K2 or K3 alteration.  Transitional phyllic alteration is most commonly observed in the F2 hill area.

## PH Alteration (Phyllic)

Phyllic  alteration  is  characterized  by  a  dominant  assemblage  of  sericite-quartz-pyrite+/-clay  that  is generally  consistent  with  the  low  grade  peripheral  parts  of  the  Colnic  deposit.   Approximately  5-15 modal  percent  pyrite  generally  occurs  within  this  alteration  type  as  3-7  mm  clusters  of  fine-grained aggregates, disseminated grains, and within mm-scale fractures.  Phyllic alteration is typically pale grey to pinkish grey in colour.

## P Alteration (Propylitic)

Propylitic alteration is characterized by the assemblage of chlorite-carbonate-epidote.   This alteration type  is  most  commonly  observed  within  the  post-mineral  stock  and  dykes  and  as  more  pervasive alteration within the wallrocks outside of the phyllic alteration halo.

## K3+A Alteration (Potassic-Argillic)

Potassic-argillic  alteration  has  been  used  to  describe  alteration  associated  with  the  brecciated  parts (10)  of  the  satellite  porphyry  package  in  which  the  matrix  and  margins  of  K3  altered  sediment  and porphyry clasts have been overprinted by argillic clays.

## A Alteration (Argillic)

Argillic  alteration  generally  occurs  in  association  with  late  fractured/faulted  zones  such  as  Chubby's fault and overprints all earlier alteration types.  Argillic alteration is characterized by an assemblage of white clays (illite-smectite), quartz and pyrite.  Pyrite generally occurs as coarse, euhedral crystals.

## 7.2.4 Ciresata Deposit Geology

## Geology Summary

Ciresata contains the highest average gold grades in the Rovina valley Project and is presently less extensively  drilled  that  the  Rovina  and  Colnic  porphyries.   Gold-copper  mineralization  at  Ciresata  is hosted equally in a Neogene subvolcanic 'neck' and adjacent hornfelsed Cretaceous sediments.  The subvolcanic  intrusion  is  a  relatively  coarse-grained  hornblende-plagioclase  porphyry  with  contacts arching outward toward the surface resulting in a funnel-shaped intrusion.   Mineralization occurs as a broad quartz-pyrite-chalcopyrite-stockwork  zone  apparently centered  on  the narrow deep part of  the intrusive 'neck' and does not reach the present surface, occurring at 50 - 150 m depth.  The subvolnic intrusive  contains  minor  occurrences  of  ortho-magmatic  breccias  becoming  more  common  upward toward the surface.  Four late-post mineral stage dykes (&lt;40 m wide), cut the deposit often associated with more intense stockwork mineralization along their margins.

Surface  mapping  by  Carpathian  recognises  a  zoned  suite  of  porphyry-style  alteration  ranging  from magnetite  alteration  (magnetite  stringers)  in  the  core  outward  to  potassic,  phyllic  and  propylitic  in  a predominant  cover  of  volcanic  rocks.   The  magnetite  alteration  zone  results  in  a  positive  magnetic anomaly.  Results from outcrop sampling have weakly anamolous to nil gold and copper mineralization. Surface geology (Figure 7-13) and a cross section through the Ciresata porphyry (Figures 7-14) are shown below.  Plan map location for the cross-section is shown in Figure 11.5.

Alteration types associated with mineralization include a pervasive early potassic (bitotie +/- K-spar), magnetite  (several  events)  and  a  much  less  common  magnetite-propylitic  (termed  MACE,  with magnetite, chlorite, epidote).  This alteration occurs in both the hornblende-plagioclase porphyry and in hornfelsed sediment though more prominent in the former.   Phyllic alteration occurs as a halo around the  mineralised  zone  (1000  x  1500  m)  and  overprints  the  upper  part  of  the  deposit  (Transitional Phyllic). Typically,  quartz-pyrite-chalcopyrite  stockwork  intensity  correlates  well  with  gold-copper grade.

Petrographic  description  samples  from  the  Ciresata  porphyry  and  mineralised  hornfels  indicates magnetite  is  prevalent  in  both  the  potassic  alteration,  comprised  of  biotite  and  k-feldspar,  and  in chalcopyrite veining (Table 7-9).

The Ciresata geologic model is relatively simple due to early stage drilling and more simple geology compared to Colnic and Rovina.  A single mineralizing porphyry is differentiated which has mineralized the  hornfesed  wall-rock.   A  list  of  major  lithologic  units  and  logging  codes  is  shown  in  Table  7-10. Alteration associated with mineralization is predominantly potassic with minir MACE.  A list of alteration types and logging codes is shown in Table 7-11.

## Lithology Units at Ciresata

Due to  the  relatively  early-stage  of  drill  definition  at  the  Ciresata  deposit  and  the  apparently  simple intrusive history, fewer lithlogic logging and modelling units have been defined compared with Colnic and Rovina.  Descriptions of this units are provided below.

Table 7-10 Major lithologic units and logging codes for Ciresata.

|                                    |   Code | Name                                    | Description/location                                                                                                           |
|------------------------------------|--------|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Ciresata  mineralised  porphyry    |     64 | Early-Mineral Por. EM-P (early-mineral) | Principal mineralized porphyry, funnel- shaped intrusion; coarse-grained  hornblende-plagioclase porphyry                      |
| Ciresata  wall-rocks               |     68 | Basement Sediment (SED)                 | Folded Cretaceous sediments,  hornfelsed near the contact zone with  EMP where it becomes an important  host to mineralization |
| Ciresata  late- mineral  intrusive |     62 | Late-Mineral Porphyritic Dykes (LM-P)   | Amphibole-plagioclase porphyry, <40 m  thick, weakly mineralised though  contacts zones can have intense veining               |

## Overburden (OB - 60)

The completely oxidized colluvium, alluvium, residual soil and weathered rock occurring at the top of most drill holes.

## Basement Sediment (SED - 68)

The basement sediments at Ciresata are made up of laminated very fine-grained mudstone and minor fine-grained  sandstone  however  in  many  cases  the  intensity  of  overprinting  alteration  has  obscured original textures.  Altered sedimentary rocks have been intersected in most of the drill holes completed at Ciresata and host the early and late mineral intrusions that make up the Ciresata porphyry complex. Sedimentary rocks occurring adjacent to the intrusive bodies are generally strongly stockworked and biotite-magnetite-quartz-pyrite-chalcopyrite  enriched  becoming  dark  brown  in  colour.   These  altered and veined sediments contain some of the most intense veining and highest Au-Cu grades at Ciresata. Distal  to  the  intrusions  the  sediments  become  light  grey/beige  in  colour  and  quartz-sericite-pyrite enriched (phyllic alteration) and are typically unmineralized.

## Early-Mineral Porphyry (EM-P - 64)

The early-mineral porphyry at Ciresata is a coarse-grained porphyritic intrusion containing 7-12 modal percent  5-10mm  black-green  amphibole  phenocrysts  and  17-26  modal  percent  2-3mm  white  to colourless  plagioclase  phenocrysts  within  an  aphanitic  groundmass. This  unit  appears  to  form  a roughly funnel shaped sub-volcanic neck in the central part of the Ciresata deposit that becomes subhorizontal and flow like to the north, east, south, and west.   The early-mineral porphyry is commonly associated with intense quartz stockwork veining, pervasive potassic alteration, and significant Au-Cu grades. However,  within  this  unit  mineralization  and  alteration  are  variable  becoming  less  well developed  at  higher  EL's. This  suggests  that  the  early-mineral  porphyry  was  not  the  source  of mineralization in this area.

At  Ciresata  poorly  defined  heterogeneous  zones  of  clast  rich,  laminated  and  brecciated  porphyry, similar to the IMB unit described in the Rovina and Colnic deposits, occasionally occur within the early-

mineral porphyry unit, becoming more common at higher EL's.  This rock type typically has a complex texture  and  contains  sub-angular  to  rounded,  strongly  altered  (clotty)  'clasts'  within  a  granular  to porphyritic matrix.  Intervals displaying magmatic foliation have also been observed.  Intervals of 'IMB' generally grade into more typical early-mineral porphyry.  In the current interpretation this unit was not broken out and modeled as a separate lithology.

## Late-Mineral Porphyry (LM-P - 62)

Three significant  sub-vertically  dipping  north-south  to  northwest  striking  amphibole-feldspar  porphyry dykes and associated intrusion related breccia zones have been identified within the Ciresata porphyry package.   In general these dykes are &lt; 40 metres thick and have been modeled as a separate rock type  in  the  current  interpretation.   The  dykes  have  a  similar  texture  and  mafic  content  to  the  earlymineral porphyry but appear to contain a higher percentage (typically &gt; 30 modal percent) of 1-3mm plagioclase  phenocrysts.   The  dykes  and  breccia  zones  appear  to  have  formed  at  a  late  stage  in development  of  the  Ciresata  deposit  and  as  a  consequence  are  responsible  for  many  of  the  sharp grade  breaks  occurring  in  holes  drilled  in  this  area. Near  the  surface  the  late  mineral  dykes  are generally light green to grey in colour and chlorite-clay-magnetite-epidote (propylitic alteration) or claysericite-pyrite-quartz  (phyllic  or  argillic  alteration)  enriched,  however  at  deeper  EL's  the  late-mineral dykes are overprinted by pervasive potassic alteration.  In some cases significant Au-Cu mineralization occurs within the wallrocks adjacent to the dykes margins however the late-mineral dykes themselves are generally weakly mineralized.

## Breccia

Poorly defined intervals of early to syn-mineral (possibly orthomagmatic) brecciation occur within all of the lithologies described at Ciresata.   These breccias included zones of monolithic wall rock breccia and  polylithic  brecciation  that  may  have  formed  in  response  to  magmatic  fluid  discharge  from  latemineral porphyry phases.  Intrusive breccias that appear to form a sheath around early and late-mineral porphyry  intrusions  have  also  been  observed. In  general  these  units  are  affected  by  the  similar alteration and stockwork intensity as the surrounding rocks and were not modeled separately.

## Total Oxidation (TOX - 41)

Rusty orange-brown limonite, goethite, red-brown hematite, and white clay enriched oxidation.

## Potassic Alteration (PT - 31)

Potassic  alteration  is  the  most  common  alteration  type  occurring  within  the  Ciresata  deposit  and effectively  outlines  the  maximum  extent  of  Au-Cu  mineralization  in  this  area.   Potassic  alteration  is generally associated with a mineral assemblage that includes: biotite-quartz +/-k-feldspar +/-magnetite and  pyrite &gt;chalcopyrite. The  alteration  minerals  occur  as  finely disseminated  grains  in  the groundmass  of  porphyritic  and  sedimentary  rocks  and  as  granular  aggregates  of  'ratty'  biotitemagnetite +/- sulphides after mafic phenocrysts in the porphyries. This mineral assemblage gives the rock a dark brown to reddish brown colour.

Within  the  Ciresata  deposit  elevated  Au-Cu  grades  are  closely  associated  with  biotite-magnetite enrichment and intensely developed quartz-magnetite-pyrite-chalcopyrite stockwork veining within the early-mineral porphyry and in a broad halo extending into the adjacent sedimentary rocks.

## MACE Alteration (MACE - 30)

MACE  alteration  is  defined  by  an  assemblage  of  quartz-magnetite-amphibole-chlorite  +/-epidotecarbonate-pyrite-chalcopyrite. It is  common  for  rocks  to  have  been  potassically  altered  prior  to becoming overprinted by MACE alteration.  Therefore, where MACE alteration is less intense the rock generally has a brownish-green to pinkish-green colour and a mineral assemblage consisting of biotite-

amphibole-chlorite-magnetite-quartz-pink K-feldspar and sulphides (cpy-py).  Where MACE alteration is pervasive it is texturally destructive, generally giving the rock a dark green to light green colour.   The MACE  alteration  assemblage  is  typically  associated  with  magnetite  stringers  and  clots,  a  well developed  quartz-sulphide vein stockwork, and  significant fine-grained disseminated  cpy-py-mt mineralization.

## Transitional Alteration (TRPH - 43)

Transitional alteration is the most common alteration type effecting porphyritic rocks in the upper parts of all 12 holes completed at Ciresata.  This alteration type is characterized by the selective replacement of  mafic  phenocrysts  by  clotty  zones  of  chlorite-magnetite-epidote-carbonate  and  a  more  pervasive clay-sericite-quartz-pyrite  enrichment  of  the  groundmass.   Magnetite  stringers  and  clots  and  weakly developed quartz-sulphide veining are also commonly associated with this alteration type however AuCu grades are generally low.

## A Alteration (Argillic)

Argillic  alteration  generally  occurs  in  association  with  late  breccia/fault  zones  and  carbonate  filled fractures and overprints earlier alteration types.  Argillic alteration is characterized by an assemblage of white clays (illite-smectite), quartz and pyrite.  Pyrite generally occurs as euhedral crystals.

## PH Alteration (Phyllic)

Phyllic  alteration  is  characterized  by  a  dominant  assemblage  of  sericite-quartz-pyrite+/-clay  that  is generally consistent with the low grade peripheral parts of the Ciresata deposit.   Approximately 5-15 modal  percent  pyrite  generally  occurs  within  this  alteration  type  as  3-7  mm  clusters  of  fine-grained aggregates, disseminated grains, and within mm-scale stringers.  Phyllic alteration typically has a pale grey  to  pinkish  grey  colour  within  porphyritic  rocks  and  a  pale  grey-beige  colour  within  sedimentary rocks.

- * To simplify the current interpretation phyllic alteration and argillic alteration were modeled together as quartz-sericite-pyrite +/-clay alteration.

## P Alteration (Propylitic)

Propylitic alteration is characterized by the assemblage of chlorite-carbonate-epidote-magnetite.   This alteration type is most commonly observed within and adjacent to the upper parts of the late-mineral dykes.

## Discussion

The best Au-Cu mineralization at Ciresata occurs within the potassic alteration envelope and one deep zone  of  MACE  dominant  alteration  noted  between  512  and  633.65  metres  in  RGD-08.   Within  the potassic  alteration  envelope  the  highest  grades  in  drill  holes  RGD-1,  RGD-7,  and  RGD-8  are associated with the contact between the early-mineral porphyry and basement sediments.   The latemineral porphyry is only weakly mineralized and appears to have formed at a late stage in development of the Ciresata deposit.   This unit is consequently responsible for sharp grade breaks in many holes.

However, in  several  drill  holes  (i.e.  RGD-3,  RGD-5,  and  RGD-7)  the  wallrocks  adjacent  to  the  latemineral dykes are strongly Au-Cu enriched.

From the observations above it would appear that the early-mineral and late mineral porphyry units at Ciresata  closely  bracket  mineralization  in  this  area,  but  may  not  have  been  the  source  for  this mineralization.   Further  drilling  in  this  area  will  be  designed  to  test  this  hypothesis  and  identify  the source intrusion.  However, for the time being it is possible to characterize mineralization at Ciresata by understanding the contact relationships between the early-mineral porphyry, basement sediments, and late-mineral dykes as they occur within the potassic alteration halo.

The principal targets on the Rovina Property are related to the porphyry copper-gold mineral deposit model. Porphyry  deposits  in  general  are  large,  low-  to  medium-grade  deposits  in  which  primary (hypogene)  sulphide  minerals  are  dominantly  structurally-controlled  and  which  are  spatially  and genetically related to felsic to intermediate porphyritic intrusions (Kirkham, 1972).   The large size and structural  control  (e.g.,  veins,  vein  sets,  stockworks,  fractures,  'crackled  zones'  and  breccia  pipes) serve to distinguish porphyry deposits from a variety of deposits that may be peripherally associated, including skarns, high-temperature mantos, breccia pipes, peripheral mesothermal  veins, and epithermal  precious  metal  deposits.   Secondary  minerals  may  be  developed  in  supergene-enriched zones  in  porphyry  Cu  deposits  by  weathering  of  primary  sulphides. Such  zones  typically  have significantly  higher  Cu  grades,  thereby  enhancing  the  potential  for  economic  exploitation  (Sinclair, 2006).

Porphyry deposits are the world's most important source of Cu, Mo and Re, and are major sources of Au, Ag and Sn; significant by-product metals include W, In, Pt, Pd and Se.  They account for about 5060% of world Cu production (Sinclair, 2006).

Porphyry  deposits  occur  throughout  the  world  in  a  series  of  extensive,  relatively  narrow,  linear metallogenic provinces.  They are predominantly associated with Mesozoic to Cenozoic orogenic belts in western North and South America and around the western margin of the Pacific Basin, particularly within  the  Southeast  Asian  Archipelago. However,  major  deposits  also  occur  within  Palaeozoic orogens  in  Central  Asia  and  eastern  North  America  and,  to  a  lesser  extent,  within  Precambrian terranes (Sinclair, 2006).

Porphyry  deposits  are  large  and  typically  contain  hundreds  of  millions  of  tonnes  of  mineralization, although they range in size from tens of millions to billions of tonnes.   Grades for the different metals vary considerably but generally average less than 1%.  In porphyry Cu deposits, Cu grades range from 0.2%  to  more  than  1%  Cu;  Mo  content  ranges  from  approximately  0.005  to  about  0.03%  Mo;  Au contents range from 0.004 to 0.35 g/t Au; and Ag content ranges from 0.2 to 5 g/t Ag.   Re is also a significant  by-product  from  some  porphyry  Cu  deposits.   Some  Au-rich  porphyry  Cu  deposits  have relatively  high  contents  of  Pt-group  elements  (PGE)  (Mutschler  and  Mooney,  1995;  Tarkian  and Stribrny, 1999 in Sinclair 2006).

Copper grades in porphyry Cu-Au deposits are comparable to those of the porphyry Cu subtype, but Au  contents  tend  to  be  consistently  higher,  averaging  between  0.2  to  2.0  g/t  Au. Sillitoe  (2000) suggested that porphyry Cu deposits should contain &gt;0.4 g Au/t to be called Au-rich.  However, Au is an important co-product at grades as low as 0.2 g/t Au.  Although the number of deposits in this class is limited, deposits such as Grasberg in Indonesia, with a resource greater than 2.5 billion tonnes grading 1.1% Cu and 1.04 g Au/t (Freeport-McMoRan Copper and Gold Inc., Annual Report 2000), indicate that porphyry Cu-Au deposits can contain significant Au as well as Cu resources (Sinclair, 2006).

## 8.1 Gold (- Copper) Porphyries

Most gold-rich porphyry intrusives consist of a series of both pre- and post-mineralization intrusions. The pre-mineralization  intrusions  are  generally  equigranular  in  texture  and  genetically  related  to  the porphyry  stock,  and  often  intrude  along  the  shoulders  of  the  pre-mineralization  intrusion. Postmineralization dikes and plugs and diatremes are also commonly associated.   Various hydrothermal breccias occur as early orthomagmatic (strong K-silicate altered) and/or late phreatic and phreatomagmatic varieties.

Copper and gold grades in the early orthomagmatic breccias may be substantially higher than in the surrounding  porphyry  rocks,  while  later  breccia  types  are  generally  of  sub-economic  grade.   Large (&gt;0.5  km  wide)  low-grade  or  barren  diatreme  breccias  and  minor  pebble  dikes  often  conclude  the evolution of gold-rich porphyry systems (Sillitoe, 2000).

Most gold-rich porphyry systems consist of varying quantities of six principal alteration types, namely Ca-Na silicate, K-silicate (potassic), propylitic, intermediate argillic (sericite-clay-chlorite), sericitic, and advanced argillic.  Both Colnic and Rovina display characteristics of several of these alteration types.

Gold mineralization in gold-rich porphyry systems is typically associated with the K-silicate alteration phases, and A-type quartz veining.   Economically-mineralized zones commonly form upright cylinders or  bell-shaped  zones. Intermediate,  sericitic  and  advanced  argillic  zones  can  also  host  economic grades  of  copper  and/  gold,  but  less  frequently  than  the  K-silicate  zone. The  mid-parts  of  many porphyry deposits correlate with the highest gold grades, often as high as double that in upper parts. Gold is generally fine grained (&lt;20µm, and often &lt;100µm).   In pyrite-rich Au porphyry deposits, gold strongly  correlates  with  the  pyrite;  while  in  pyrite-poor  deposits,  gold  is  commonly  associated  with chalcopyrite or bornite (Sillitoe, 2000).

Porphyry  deposits  with  average  gold  grades  &gt;0.4  g/t  Au  can  be  generalized  as  'gold-rich'  (Sillitoe, 2000).  Most gold rich porphyries have gold grades less than 1 g/t Au, however a few are richer.  Gold grades returned from the recent drilling at Colnic tend to average in the range of 0.8 g/t to 1.2 g/t Au, classifying it near the upper end of the scale.   Copper grades have averaged around 0.1 to 0.2% Cu. At these Cu/Au ratios (Sillitoe, 2000), Colnic falls under the classification of a true Au-Cu porphyry.

The main mineralized targets on the Rovina Property are the Rovina Cu-Au porphyry, Colnic Au-Cu porphyry  and  the  Ciresata  Au-Cu  porphyry.   These  targets  align  along  a  north-northwest  trend  with Rovina  on  the  north,  Colnic  in  the  center,  and  Ciresata  to  the  south,  and  have  been  termed  by Carpathian as the Rovina Valley Project (RVP) which has received the bulk of Carpathian's exploration work.  Resource Estimates have been completed on these porphyries and is the subject of this report detailed in Section 17.  The Ciresata porphyry, discovered by Carpathian in 2008, has the least amount of  drilling  completed. Exploration  work  by  Carpathian  identified  the  Zdrapti  porphyry  prospect, approximately 2.5  km  west-southwest from Rovina, which  was drill-tested revealing only anomalous Cu-Au  grades. Additional  known  targets  include  the  Cordurea  and  Valisoara-Porcurea  epithermal prospects in the southern-part of the property.  These have not been advanced to the drilling stage by Carpathian and are not covered in detail in this report.

The  mineralised  porphyries  at  Rovina,  Colnic  and  Ciresata  display  moderate  to  intense  potassic hydrothermal altered cores, and strong quartz stockwork veining.  The Au-Cu mineralization manifests as stockworks  and  disseminations  centered  on  porphyritic, subvolcanic-intrusive complexes  of hornblende-plagioclase diorites.  These porphyries are would classifiy as gold-rich, especially Ciresata and Colnic, and contain many of the features common in gold-rich porphyries ie. dioritic, calc-alkaline stock  associated  and  abundant  magnetite  alteration  (Sillitoe,  2000).   No  significant  porphyry-related epithermal or skarn mineralization has been identified with only minor occurrences of gold - silver, lead and zinc in narrow epithermal veins within the phyllic alteration halo at Colnic.

Each  of  the  Rovina,  Colnic  and  Ciresata  porphyries  share  many  basic  geologic-mineralization attributes. These  include  association  with  similar  composition  subvolcanic  intrusives  and  similar alteration suites, however, they do exhibit quite different Au-Cu grade tenors and Au:Cu ratios.   The Rovina porphyry contains the highest Cu-grades with typical 1:1 Au:Cu ratio (g/t Au: %Cu) whereas Colinic has a higher Au:Cu ratio with Ciresata having the highest Au-grades.   Rovina demonstrates a time-space evolution toward higher gold grades hosted in the late-stage axial intrusion of the 'pencil shaped' porphyry B (see Figure 7-7) as shown by selected drillhole intersections in Table 9-1.   While each of these porphyries do have some differential geologic features (Table 9-1), it is not certain if the Au-Cu grade tenors are related to conditions at the site of mineral deposition, or inherited from uppercrustal magma chamber processes.

Geometry of the mineralization and host-porphyries is different for each of the deposits.  At Rovina, the host porphyries are generally cylindrical and vertical with vertical mineralization extent up to 600 m.  At Colnic, the porphyries are lobate with mineralization decreasing with depth to approximately 300 m and a phyllic-altered cap locally preserved.  Both Rovina and Colnic porphyries intrude extensive igneousmagmatic  breccia  carapaces  whereas  Ciresata  mineralization  is  centered  on  a  relatively  narrow subvolcanic 'neck' with a significant amount of mnieralization hosted in adjacent hornfelsed sediments.

The lithology, alteration, and mineralization controls at each of these deposits has been interpreted on the basis of detailed logging of 62,700 m of drill core from 155 drill holes by Carpathian.  Ciresata is at an early stage with only 15 drill holes completed.  Further drilling at Ciresata will undoubtedly increase the definition of the geologic model and evaluate the full potential of this area.  Detailed studies on vein

paragenesis and deposit genesis have not yet been undertaken at the RVP.  Mineralization at each of the deposits is described below.

## 9.1 Rovina Deposit Mineralization

The Carpathian drilling  programs  over  the  area  of  the  Rovina  Porphyry  cover  approximately  350  m (northwest) x 600 m (northeast) in the main area and 300 m (northeast) in the southwest extension in the Baroc Valley.   A total of 31,422 m of core drilling (66 holes) have tested the mineralization to a maximum vertical depth of about 600 m in the main zone.   Drilling was on-going during the geologic modelling for the resource estimate described in Section 17, and thus only drill holes up to RRD-54 are included in the current estimate (53 drill holes for 26,194 m).   This drilling has defined porphyry-style mineralization over the main porphyry area of approximately 350 m (northwest) x 600 m (northeast) with  mineralization  starting  from  the  surface  in  Baroc  Valley. Drilling  in  late  2007  and  early  2008 extended  porphyry-style  mineralization  to  the  southwest  in  Baroc  Valley  over  a  distance  of  350  m (northwest) x 300 m (northeast).  In the main zone, most of the drill holes are vertical, whereas in the Baroc Valley extension all drill holes are inclined. The majority of drill holes have intersected varying degrees of porphyry-style mineralization, ranging in grade from 0.1 to  1.0 g/t Au and 0.01 to 0.7% Cu over  down  hole  lengths  ranging  from  10  to  550  m,  with  typical  intersection  lengths  of  400  m. In general,  the  highest  copper  and  gold  grades  (0.4  to  0.6  g/t  Au  and  0.4  to  0.6%  Cu)  appear  to  be concentrated  in  a  zone  below  Baroc  Valley  in  the  main  porphyry  (Rovina  Porphyry  C)  from  surface vertically  to  a  depth  of  500  m.   Approximately  150  m  southeast  of  this  zone  is  a  vertical  column  of higher  gold  grade  (0.4  to  1.2  g/t  Au  and  0.15  to  0.25%  Cu)  associated  with  the  late-mineral  axial intrusion of a 'pencil' shaped porphyry (Porphyry B) extending from the surface to to a depth of 550 m. Copper and gold grade decrease to the southwest in the Baroc Valley Porphyry (0.1 to 0.3 g/t Au and 0.1  to  0.25%  Cu). Grades  shells  shown  in  Figures  9-3,  and  9-4  illustrate  spacial  geometry  and

distribution  of  grade  at  Rovina.   Unlike  the  mineralization  at  Colnic  and  Ciresata,  at  Rovina  a  postmineral  phreato-magmatic  breccia  complex  (Glamm  Breccia)  locally  cuts  through  all  mineralized porphyry units and is grade destructive to variable degrees (See Figures 7-6, 7-7, 7-8 for Geology).

Gold-copper mineralization is associated with pyrite-chalcopyrite-magnetite occurring in veinlet stockworks and as finely disseminated grains.  Oxidation is restricted to the uppermost few metres with exception a small area in Baroc Valley at the Rovina Porphyry where weathering oxidation is 15 - 25 m deep  within  the  Cu-Au  mineralization. In this area  secondary  copper  minerals  malachite  and chrysocolla are observed in the weathering zone and minor occurrences of supergene copper minerals (Chalcocite)  occur  below  the  weathering  zone,  typically  associated  with  short  drill  hole  intervals  of elevated copper grades.

Deposit-scale controls to mineralization is the localisation of the principal hornble-plagioclase porphyry intrusion (Rovina Porphyry PC) which is elongate in a northwest direction measuring approximately 600 m northwest x 350 m northeast.  This porphyry has vertical contacts over at least 600 m and apparently terminates northward in the northeast trending Baroc Valley zone.   Lower-grade Cu-Au mineralization extends  down  the  Baroc  Valley  zone  to  the  southwest  to  include  the  Baroc  Valley  Porphyry  as  a satellite to the main Rovina porphyry.   This intrusive geometry suggests possible northwest structural control  for  emplacement  of  the  Rovina  Porphyry  intersecting  a  northeast  structural  zone  controlling emplacement of the Baroc Valley Porphyry (See Figure 7-6 for geology map and Figure 9-2 for Baroc Valley grade distribution).  A similar oriented structural intersection is interpreted for the Colnic deposit.

At Rovina, two early-stage magmatic-fluid alteration events are recognized (PT, MACE, and a locally occurring magnetite-only alteration).   Higher grades of Au-Cu mineralization are best developed and associated  with  broad  zones  of  intense  quartz-sulfide  stockwork  veining  (up  to  70%  of  rock  mass). Stockwork veining intensity typically correlates with alteration intensity and in higher-grade zones, such as in the Baroc Valley area, intense stockwork veining with overprinting MACE alteration obscures all primary  rock  textures. The  earliest  Cu-bearing  assemblage  is  observed  in  both  early  magnetitebearing veinlets-stringers and disseminated in the rock mass and consists of magnetite + chalcopyrite + bornite + minor pyrite.   Cross-cutting veinlets indicated multiple fracturing and hydrothermal pulses. Seventeen  vein  types  have  been  recognised  with  5  types  most  common  with  Au-Cu  mineralization (Table  9-2). These  vein  types  include  hairline  magnetite  stringers,  quartz-veins,  quartz-magnetitesulphide veins, quartz-sulphide veins, banded quartz-sulphide veins.

Intense MACE alteration is common in the higher-grade zones with a pervasive disseminated mineral assemblage; quartz&gt;&gt;&gt;magnetite&gt;cpy&gt;py&gt; amphibole and/or chlorite +/- epidote, +/- k-feldspar. Most of the high-grade intervals are hosted in the early porphyry (Rovina Porphyry PC), generally coincident along the vertical margins of late intermineral stocks (Porphyry B) which themselves are also host to mineralization, but to a lesser extent (See photo of contact example in Figure 7-9). The geometry of one high-grade zone is a 200 x 400 m lens apparently extending along the northeast trending Baroc Valley orientation (Figure 9-1, and 9-2).

In comparison with Colnic (Section 9.2) at Rovina, stockwork intensity more consistently correlates with Cu-Au grade and is coincident with intense MACE alteration.   In addition, Rovina does not show an intensive phyllic overprint related to late-stage quartz-stockwork as seen on the upper part of the Colnic Porphyry.

At Rovina, the bulk of Carpathian's drilling in the main Rovina Porphyry are vertical holes to test the significant vertical depth of mineralization (locally &gt;500 m).  The strong vertical control to mineralization is related to porphyry and inter-mineral porphyry contacts.  To confirm these contacts, in late 2007 and early  2008,  Carpathian  drilled  5  inclined  holes  which  confirmed  and  better  defined  these  vertical contacts.

Carpathian routinely assays for Zn, Pb, and Ag in addition to Au and Cu.   At Rovina, the gold-copper mineralization contains patchy zones with anomalous zinc ranging from 25 to 2000 ppm with a typical average of 150 ppm.  Minor occurrences of late-stage epithermal breccia fills and veins, commonly at contact zones, contain elevated Zn+Pb - Cu in minerals sphalerite, galena, and chalcopyrite. These occurrences can contain up to 1% Zn and lesser Pb-Cu.

Molybdenum  mineralization  is rarely observed  in drill core within quartz-molybdenite veinlets. Worldwide,  other  Au  and  Au-Cu  porphyries  tend  to  be  deficient  in  molybdenum,  however  when present,  it  tends  to  concentrate  as  a  halo  to  the  copper-gold  core  (Sillitoe,  2000).  Carpathian  has assayed  on  a  very  limited  basis  for  Mo  at  Rovina  with  assay  results  to  date  being  insignificant (averaging &lt;5 ppm to 20 ppm Mo), however, a localised enrichment of Mo cannot be ruled out pending further  Mo  assay checks.   Silver has  been regularly assayed by Carpathian and grades to date are typical of porphyries worldwide; values are generally very low throughout (averaging &lt;1 ppm to 2 ppm) and probably do not constitute economic mineralization.

A full list of drill hole intersections from Rovina is shown in Appendix 1A.  Drill hole collar data is shown in Appendix 1B.

It  is  PEG's opinion that the level of understanding of the geology, structure and mineralization of the Rovina Porphyry has advanced to an adequate level to support resource estimation.

## 9.2 Colnic Deposit Mineralization

The Carpathian drilling programs over the area of the Colnic Porphyry, covering approximately 700 m (northwest) x 600 m (northeast) with some nearby satellite targets drilled as well.  A total of 29,325 m of core drilling  (87  holes)  have  tested  the  mineralization  to  a  maximum  vertical  depth  of  about  400  m. This drilling has defined porphyry-style mineralization over an area of approximately 600 m (northwest) x 400 m (northeast) with mineralization starting from the surface in Rovina Valley.  The majority of drill holes have intersected varying degrees of porphyry-style mineralization, ranging in grade from 0.3 to 1.3 g/t Au and 0.01 to 0.18% Cu over down hole lengths ranging from 10 to 350 m, averaging around 140 m.  In general the highest copper and gold grades (0.8 to 1.2 g/t Au and 0.1 to 0.2% Cu) appear to be concentrated from surface (The Colnic Porphyry in the Rovina Valley) to a vertical depth of about 200 m, below which alteration remains strong but grades drop off (0.3 to 0.5 g/t Au and generally &lt;0.1 % Cu).   Grades  shells  shown  in  Figures  9-3  and  9-4  illustrate  special  geometry  and  distribution  of grade at Colnic.

Gold-copper mineralization is associated with pyrite-chalcopyrite-magnetite occurring in veinlet stockworks and disseminated.  Oxidation is restricted to the uppermost few metres of the prospect and no significant oxide cap or supergene enriched horizons have been encountered to date.

Deposit-scale  controls  to  mineralization  are  the  localisation  of  two  hornblende-plagioclase  porphyry centers;  the  Colnic  Porphyry  and  the  F-2  hill  Porphyry.   The  Colnic  porphyry  occurs  in  the  Rovina Valley, elongate parallel to the northeast trending valley over approximately 400 m x 200 m wide.  This is  interpreted  as  the  older  porphyry  and  it's  upper  part  contains  the  highest  grades  at  Colnic.   The center of the F-2 hill porphyry complex occurs approximately 150 m southeast of the Colnic porphyry. Interpreted  structural  controls  on  the  emplacement  of  these  porphyrys  are  the  northeast  trending Rovina Valley (as suggested by an inter-mineral dyke and breccia swarm in the upper part of the Colnic Porphyry)  and  the  northwest  striking  Chubbys  Fault/fracture  zone  (a  brittle  post-mineral  structure, however, maybe a re-activated older structure as evidenced by a spacial minieralisation association at depth).  See Figures 7-6, 7-7 and 7-8 from geology map and cross sections.

At  Colnic,  three  early-stage  magmatic-fluid  alteration  events  are  recognized  (K3,  K2,  and  a  locally occurring  magnetite-only  alteration). Gold-copper  mineralization  at  the  Colnic  porphyry  is  best

developed within K2 and K3 potassic alteration of quartz diorite porphyry (see Table 7-7), in particular where  multidirectional  stockwork  vein  intensity  is  highest. The  earliest  Cu-bearing  assemblage  is observed  in  both  early  quartz  veins  and  disseminated  in  the  rock  mass.  It  consists  of  magnetite  + chalcopyrite  +  bornite  +  minor  pyrite. Cross-cutting  veinlets  indicated  multiple  fracturing  and hydrothermal  pulses.   Sixteen  vein  types  have  been  recognized  from  detailed  core  logging  with  5 principal  types  associated  with  Au-Cu  mineralization  (Table  9-3).   Overprinting  alteration  events  can obscure earlier events, and is particularly noted in parts of the higher-grade upper Colnic Porphyry (in Rovina  Valley)  where  phyllic  alteration  associated  with  intense  late-stage  quartz  -  pyrite  stockwork veining.   In some cases Au-Cu mineralization occurs in K2 alteration (rarely in K3 alteration) without any apparent stockworking.

Locally veins occur as sheeted zones; however, the predominant occurrence and appearance in core is as multidirectional stockworks.  To evaluate mineralization controls in the upper Colnic Porphyry, which is elongate in the northeast direction and parallel to the angled drill holes of Carpathian, 7 orthogonalangled drill holes were completed in late 2007 (See Drill hole plan map in Figure 11-3).   This drilling was instrumental in defining the late-mineral dyke and breccia swarm parallel to the northeast trending Rovina  Valley.   As  part  of  this  orthogonal  drilling  program,  a  structural  study  on  oriented  core  was undertaken on four of these orthogonal drill holes.  Drill core was oriented using the spear technique for marking bottom of core.   Confidence limits were assigned based on precision of core marks between runs where core-breaks could be aligned (as core quality is good, this was quite common).  A total of 1,140  confident  structural  measurements  were  taken  of  which  639  represent  mineralization-related

veinlets.  Results indicate a general multidirectional orientation of veinlets with a slight bias northwestsoutheast strike.

Carpathian routinely assays for Zn, Pb, and Ag in addition to Au and Cu.   At Colnic, the gold-copper mineralization contains anomalous zinc ranging from 150 to 600 ppm with an approximate average of 300 ppm.  A zone of elevated zinc + gold mineralization has developed predominantly in or proximal to the transitional phyllic alteration zone (TRPH).  Grades in this zone range from approximately 0.1 to 3 g/t Au and 300 to 5,000 ppm Zn.  The Zn-Au zone is interpreted to represent deposition of remobilized Zn  and  Au  from  a  collapsing  phyllic-potassic  alteration  front.   The  more  acidic,  H2S-bearing  fluids associated with the phyllic alteration (PH) may have dissolved gold, and re-precipitated the element at the rock-composition redox contact with the magnetite-rich porphyry-style mineralization (K2 and K3). In some cases, the contact zone between the phyllic and mineralized potassic zone grades from pyrite to pyrrhotite to magnetite representing a possible sulphidation front.  Proximal to, and within Chubby's fault/fracture zone, Zn mineralization appears to be related to late-stage quartz-carbonate veinlets.

Molybdenum mineralization is rarely observed in drill core within quartz-molybdenite veinlets typically in the deeper zones of K3 alteration.   Carpathian has assayed on a limited basis for Mo, including has some samples selected by visual observation of molybdenite in drill core.   Worldwide, other Au and Au-Cu porphyries tend to be deficient in molybdenum, however when present, it tends to concentrate as a halo to the copper-gold core (Sillitoe, 2000).  Carpathian Mo assay results to date at Colnic have been insignificant (averaging &lt;5 ppm to 20 ppm Mo), however, a localised enrichment of Mo cannot be ruled  out  pending  further  Mo  assay  checks.   Silver  has  been  regularly  assayed  by  Carpathian  and grades to date are typical of porphyries worldwide; values are generally very low throughout (averaging &lt;1 ppm to 2 ppm) and probably do not constitute economic mineralization.

A full list of drill hole intersections from Colnic is shown in Appendix 2A.  Drill hole collar data is shown in appendix 2B.

It  is  PEG's opinion that the level of understanding of the geology, structure and mineralization of the Colnic Porphyry has advanced to an adequate level to support resource estimation.

## 9.3 Ciresata Deposit Mineralization

The Carpathian drilling program over the area of the Ciresata Porphyry is the least advanced in the RVP and 15  widely-spaced  drill  holes  (7,173  m)  covers  approximately  430  m  (northwest)  x  500  m (northeast).  This drilling has tested  the mineralization to a maximum vertical depth of 325 m below the surface (-100 m RL) with 50 - 150 m of barren rock on the surface.   This drilling has defined a bellshaped body of porphyry-style mineralization of approximately 350 m (northwest) x 400 m (northeast) at depth with several drill holes ending in good mineralization due to drill-rig depth limitations.  All drill holes  are  inclined. Twelve  drill  hole  intersected  varying  degrees  of  porphyry-style  mineralization, ranging in grade from 0.1 to  5 g/t Au and 0.01 to 0.6% Cu over down hole lengths ranging from 53 to 516 m, with average intersection length of 255 m.  In general, the highest gold and copper grades (0.8 to 2.0 g/t Au and 0.15 to 0.3% Cu) occur in the core of the mineralised body and are locally controlled by margins of late-mineral dykes.  Four vertical, relatively narrow dykes (&lt;40 m thick), cut through the porphyry body.  Mineralization is equally hosted in the 'funnel-shaped' hornblende-plagiclase porphyry and adjacent hornfelsed Cretaceous sedments.   Grades shells shown in Figures 9-5 illustrate spacial geometry and distribution of grade at Ciresata.

Gold-copper mineralization is associated with magnetite-pyrite-chalcopyrite occurring in veinlet stockworks and as finely disseminated grains.  Weathering oxidation is restricted to the uppermost tens of metres and thus does not effect the deeper Au-Cu mineralization.

At  this  early  stage  of  drilling,  the  limits  of  the  mineralization  are  not  fully  defined,  however,  with  the present  level  of  knowledge,  porphyry  mineralization  appears  to  be  centered  on  the  'neck'  of  the subvolcanic hornblende-plagioclase porphyry.  The late-mineral dyke swarm in the porphyry body strike north-south to north-northeast, however, prospect-scale data (ie. soil geochemistry, see Figure 10-2) suggest possible mineral extensions to the west-southwest.

- At  Ciresata,  an  early-stage  magmatic-fluid  alteration  event,  potassic  (PT)  is  recognized  with  less extensive overprinting magnetite-propylitic (MACE).  At Ciresata, magnetite is a predominant alteration mineral and barren surface outcrops in the core exhibit magnetite alteration as veinlet stringers.

The broad outline of potassic alteration correlates well with the outer limit of mineralization in both the horfels and porphyry host.  Higher grades of Au-Cu mineralization in the core of the porphyry body at near contacts with dykes and hornfels, are best developed and associated with broad zones of intense quartz-magnetite-pyrite-chalcopyrite stockwork veining (up to 80% of rock mass).  Other important vein types recognized are thick (1 - 10 cm) banded quartz-pyrite-chalcopyrite veins (commonly associated with higher gold grades) and magnetite-chalcopyrite stringers.  Cross-cutting veinlets indicated multiple fracturing and hydrothermal pulses.

Carpathian routinely assays for Zn, Pb, and Ag in addition to Au and Cu.   At Ciresata, Zn is weakly anomalous with assay values ranging from 35 - 2000 ppm and average 170 ppm in the mineralization. Lead and Ag are not significant.  Late-stage epithermal Pb-Zn mineralization has not been observed as opposed to the limited occurrences at Rovina and Colnic.  Molybdenum has been assayed on a limited basis, with two mineralised drill holes analysed.   Results from 670 samples range 2.5 - 121 ppm Mo with an average of 20 ppm Mo which is not considered significant.

A full  list  of  drill  hole  intersections  from  Ciresata  is  shown  in  Appendix  3A.   Drill  hole  collar  data  is shown in Appendix 3B.

It  is  PEG's opinion that the level of understanding of the geology, structure and mineralization of the Ciresata  Porphyry,  while  at  an  early  stage,  can  support  resource  estimation. Further  drilling  will enhance geologic controls to mineralization and better define grade distribution.

## 1 0 . 0 E X P L O R A T I O N

Most of the exploration on the Property has been performed by three companies: Minexfor between 1974 and 1998, and again in 2001, Rio Tinto from 1999 to 2000, and since 2004, Carpathian.   Earlystage exploration focused on property-wide target generation and was dominated by soil and stream sediment geochemical surveys, and regional airborne geophysical programs, undertaken in conjunction with surface and underground geological mapping, trench sampling, and detailed ground geophysical programs.

The three deposits that have been discovered on the Property are Rovina, Colnic and Ciresata with the majority of the recent work by Carpathian focusing on these areas.

As  a  follow-up  to  the  early  stage  work,  Minexfor  tested  various  geophysical  anomalies  and  surface defined targets at the Colnic Deposit area (14 core holes totalling 4,740 m) and the Rovina Deposit (34 holes totalling 23,119 m).  They also tested the Ciresata Prospect, located approximately 4.5 km south of Colnic with six wide-spaced core holes totalling 1,200 m.

Carpathian commenced core drilling at the Colnic Deposit in February 2006.   As of the date of this report, 66 holes totalling 31,422 m have been drilled at the Rovina Deposit, 87 holes totalling 29,325 m drilled at the Colnic deposit, and 15 holes totalling 7,173 m at the Ciresata Deposit.

The drill programs are described in detail in Section 11 of this Report.

Specific details of previous early-stage programs (Minexfor and Rio Tinto) are not well documented. Carpathian has purchased available documentation for the Minexfor and Rio Tinto work stages.

Various exploration techniques have been utilized during the exploration stages, which are described below.

## 10.1 Coordinates and Datum

Coordinates used by Carpathian, Rio Tinto and Minexfor are in the 'Stereo70' grid system, which is the official coordinate system used in Romania.  The exploration licences registered with NAMR are also in this  grid  system. Capathian  utilises  the  Stereo  70  system  which  is  compatible  with  standard  GIS software  packages.   When  GPS  surveys  are  used,  UTM  Datum  WGS  84  zone  35  coordinates  are converted to Stereo 70.

## 10.2 Geographic/Grid Control

## 10.2.1 Minexfor (1975 to 2000)

There is no documentation of the grids constructed by Minexfor; however it is believed that Colnic and Rovina grids  were used as a basis for soil sampling, geophysical surveys, geological mapping, and drilling. All  maps,  sample  locations  and  drill  hole  collars  are  registered  and  reported  in  Stereo  70 coordinate system.

08CARP0100\_REP00

## 10.3 Rio Tinto (1999 to 2000)

Rio Tinto established grids for soil surveys over four separate prospects within the present Carpathian property as shown in Table 10-1.

Table 10-1 Rio Tinto Grids

| Licence   | Prospect            | Area (ha)   | Grid Spacing                       | Purpose          | Range of Au  Values (g/t)   |
|-----------|---------------------|-------------|------------------------------------|------------------|-----------------------------|

|           | Ciresata            | 1,120       | 200x100m and 200x200m in southeast | 500 soil samples | 0 to 0.11                   |
|           | Valisoara- Porcurea | ~180        | Irregular                          | 139 soil samples | 0 to 0.27                   |

Note: License is the present Carpathian Property; Rio Tinto had a much larger License.

All grids (except at Valisoara-Porcurea) were oriented north-south, and were designed mainly for soil geochemical sampling, see Section 10.7.2.  There is no documentation in the data regarding how the grids were surveyed and whether they were physically marked on the ground.

## 10.3.1 Carpathian (2004 to Present)

Carpathian  established  five  grids  as  shown  in  Table  10-2. These  grids  formed  the  basis  of  soil sampling surveys and ground geophysical surveys.  These grids are generally of temporary nature with only baselines marked with monuments.  Subsequent geological mapping and channel sampling were located  with  government  topographic  maps,  compass  and  tape  surveys,  and  hand-held  GPS  units without the utilization of a base station.

## 10.4 Topography

## 10.4.1 Minexfor (1975 to 2000) and Rio Tinto (1999 to 2000)

There is no reference in the available documents defining the source for the topographic base used by both  Minexfor  and  Rio  Tinto. Presented  topographic  maps  are  presumed  to  be  from  standard government published maps.

## 10.4.2 Carpathian (2004 to Present)

The  locations  and  elevations  of  all  geological  mapping,  channel  samples  and  drill  hole  collars  are plotted  on  1:5000  scale  government  topographic  maps  with  10  m  elevation  contours.   Locations  of isolated  surface  samples  are  obtained  through  use  of  hand-held  GPS  units  with  detailed  surface samples and drill-hole collars located utilizing compass and tape surveying.  Carpathian has utilized a professional  contract  survey  company  (Belevion  Geo-Topo  SRL)  to  complete  and  regularly  update topographic  surveys  over  Rovina,  Colnic,  and  Ciresata  using  a  total-station  instrument.   In  addition, drill-hole  collars  and  access  roads  are  surveyed  by  Belevion. Locations  for  all  data  are  in  the Romanian 'Stereo70' grid coordinates.

## 10.5 Geological Mapping and Related Studies

## 10.5.1 Minexfor (1975 to 2000) and Rio Tinto (1999 to 2000)

Geologic  mapping  completed  by  previous  exploration  groups  on  the  property  is  limited  or  not  well documented.  From Minexfor, some prospect-scale geology maps have been obtained by Carpathian. Exploration reports from Rio Tinto indicates no geologic mapping was completed beyond reconnassaince-style investigations.  Work by other groups on the property , prior to Carpathian, is not well documented.

## 10.5.2 Carpathian (2004 to Present)

Carpathian has completed both regional reconnaissance mapping programs at a scale of 1:5,000 over most of the Licence and more detailed mapping at a scale of 1:1,000 over the main prospects.

Carpathian did not physically establish a grid for the mapping and sampling program but used existing topography maps and hand-held GPS units for control.

The geological work carried out by Carpathian geologists and contractors includes the following:

- Colnic/Rovina Deposits: 1:1,000 scale geology covering an area of 3.9 km 2 focusing on the immediate Rovina and Colnic target areas. Mapping  was  completed  by independent contractor Steve Presimeyer from A.C.A. Howe International Ltd. in 2005 and re-mapped by Carpathian Geologist Jim Stemler in 2006.
- Ciresata Deposit: 1,000 scale geology covering an area of 4 km 2 in the Ciresata area. Mapping  was  completed  by  independent  contractor  Steve  Presimeyer  from  A.C.A. Howe International Ltd. in 2005 and re-mapped by Carpathian Geologist Jim Stemler in 2007.
- Rovina Licence:  1:2,000 scale geology mapping targeting ground magnetic anomalies within  a  24  km 2 area  in  the  Northern  part  of  the  Rovina  License.  Mapping  was completed by independent contractor Steve Presimeyer from A.C.A. Howe International Ltd. in 2006. and re-mapped by Carpathian Geologist Jim Stemler at 1:5000 scale in 2007.
- Mapping of drill roads at Rovina and Colnic at 1:1000 scale.  Completed by Carpathian geologist in 2008.

Much of the relevant data resulting from this work is reported in Sections 7 and 9 respectively, of this report.

## 10.6 Remote Sensing and Satellite Imagery

## 10.6.1 Carpathian (2001 to Present)

In  July  2002,  Carpathian  purchased  1:100,000  scale  Satellite  LandSat  TM  imagery  from  HME Partnership Ltd, Kent, U.K., which cover the entire 'Golden Quadrilateral'.   These data are integrated into a GIS database and have been used to aid in the structural interpretation of the Property and for alteration mapping.

## 10.7 Geophysics

## 10.7.1 Airborne Magnetics/Radiometrics

## Rio Tinto

In 1999, Rio Tinto completed a helicopter-borne magnetic/radiometric survey (flown by Fugro Airborne Corp.  out  of  Canada)  over  an  area  approximately  24  by  30 km.   The  area  covered  by  the  survey included both the Colnic and Rovina Porphyries, which were located in the northeastern portion of the Rio Tinto permit.

The  airborne  survey  was  completed  on  east-west-oriented,  150  m-spaced  lines  using  a  helicopter elevation of 60 m and a sensor elevation of about 35 m.   Total survey length was 3,995 line km.   In 2005,  Carpathian  purchased  the  digital  TIFF-format  images  for  this  survey  from  Rio  Tinto.   Seven images  were  provided,  including  potassium,  thorium,  uranium,  total  magnetic  field,  reduced-to-pole, analytical signal, and first vertical derivative, but no original raw data.   The reduced-to-pole magnetic image revealed a 5 km long arc-shaped zone of magnetic highs and lows, bordered to the west by a strong magnetic low anomaly.  The low corresponded to the outer western ring of a circular feature with an 8 km radius.

## 10.7.2 Ground Geophysics

The Romanian government had reportedly completed IP/resistivity, natural polarization and gamma ray geophysical surveys at Colnic in 1977-1978.  Those surveys were apparently completed on ten northsouth lines, spaced 200 m apart.  No additional information is available on these surveys.  Those 30year old data have been superseded by recent Carpathian work.  Additional magnetic and gamma ray geophysical  surveys  were  completed  by  Minexfor  during  1983  to  1984.   Carpathian  did  not  receive copies of any of the results of these surveys.

In June 2006, Carpathian commissioned Belevion SRL from Bucharest to complete a ground magnetic survey totalling 480 line kilometres and covering a 24 km2 area over the Colnic and Rovina Deposits.

The survey consisted of east-west-oriented, 50 m spaced lines, with individual stations spaced at 50 m along each line.  A summary report prepared by Belevion staff included a total field image.  Carpathian has since had the raw data re-processed and interpreted to evaluate reduced to pole and anaylitical signal  features  for  interpretatation.   The  results  of  the  survey  are  shown  on  Figure  10-1  and  show several prominent, strongly positive, anomalies.

In  October  2007,  Carpathian  commissioned  Belevion  SRL  from  Bucharest  to  complete  a  ground magnetic survey over the Ciresata area.  This survey covers 10 sq-km at a 50 m x 50 m grid spacing. Carpathian is presently using the total field maps provided Belevion for interpretation.

The known porphyries of Rovina, Colnic, and Ciresata demonstrate a 'bulls-eye' feature resulting from a magnetic porphyry core and a surrounding magnetic low possibly relating to magnetite-destructive retrograde  phyllic  alteration. Geological  mapping  by  Carpathian  and  magnetic  anomaly  'ground truthing' indicates the presence of several magnetic units including lava flows and volcaniclastic rocks and subvolcanic intrusives with primary magnetite.   Several anomalies are present within the coupled magnetic  high  and  adjacent  low  of  the  'bulls  eye'  pattern. Carpathian  has  completed  several  soil geochemistry surveys over target areas in the north part  of  the  property.   Soil  geochemistry  results coupled with magnetic anomalies are used for guiding field reconnassaince and mapping programs. This  method  resulted  in  the  identification  subcropping  potassic  alteration  with  associated  copper mineralization  at  the  Zdrapti  Prospect  and  was  instrumental  in  discovering  Ciresata.   As  part  of  an alteration mapping program at Ciresata, the prominent high-magnetic anomaly was found to be caused by  intense  magnetite  alteration.   Subsequent  work  by  Carpathian  has  shown  this  to  be  the  barren magnetite altered cap to the Ciresata mineralization 50 - 150 m below the surface (Figure 10-2).

In  September  2006,  Carpathian  contracted  Belevion  SRL  to  complete  an  I.P./resistivity  survey over the Rovina, Colnic and Zdrapti target areas based on magnetic signature and the occurrence of  known surface mineralization and early-stage drilling results.   The objective of these surveys was to provide drill-targeting guidance for the definition of the targets (Figure 10-2).   In May 2008, Carpathian  contracted  Belevion  SRL  to  complete  I.P./resistivity  survey  over  the  Ciresata  target area  following  encouraging  intial  drilling  results. This  survey  was  centered  on  the  barren magnetitic anomaly.

The surveys utilized a IPC7-2.5kW SCINTREX transmitter, and an IPR12-SCINTREX receiver. Measurements were collected every 20m along lines of length variable from 1000 to 1500 m.  The theoretical  depth  penetration  of  the  surveys  varies  from  180  m  to  310  m  (Table  10-3).   The  IP survey layout and interpretation to date of the results from the Rovina survey were performed by an  independent  consulting  geophysicist  Paolo  Constantini,  who  has  visited  the  projects  and advised on line orientation.  A 3-d Interpretation of the results from the Rovina and Zdrapti surveys was completed.  At Colnic and Ciresata, Carpathian has utilised pseudo-sections of inverted data and interpreted by Belevion.  The results fro Ciresata were inconclusive likely due to limited depth penetration.

## 10.8 Geochemistry

## 10.8.1 Stream Sediment Sampling

Rio Tinto (1999 to 2000)

Rio Tinto reportedly completed a program of reconnaissance stream sediment sampling over several drainage basins as shown in Table 10-4.

Table 10-4 Rio Tinto Stream Sediment Sampling

| Prospect           |   Number of Samples | Range of Grades  (Au g/t)   |
|--------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------|
| Colnic             |                  24 | 0 to 1.04                   |
| Ciresata           |                  13 | 0 to 0.43                   |
| Cordurea           |                  33 | 0 to 0.65                   |
| Valisoara-Porcurea |                   8 | 0 to 7.78                   |
| Total              |                  78 |                             |

No details were provided regarding sample collection methodology, sample size, or preparation.   Rio Tinto  followed-up  this  first-stage  work  with  soil  geochemistry  and  rock-chip  sampling  in  all  these drainage  basins  with  exception  of  Cordurea. Further  work  by  Carpathian  has  superseded  these results.

## 10.8.2 Soil Geochemical Sampling

## Rio Tinto (1999 to 2000)

Rio Tinto reportedly completed a program of grid soil sampling over three separate grids as described in Section 10.3.2.  Few details were provided regarding sample collection methodology, sample size or preparation.

At the Ciresata Prospect, a soil geochemistry survey covering 11.2 km2 was completed at a spacing of 200 by 100 m, widening to 200 by 200 m on the southeast part of the grid.   Results from this survey defined partly-coincident Au (&gt;10 ppb), Cu (&gt;25 ppm) and Mo (&gt;2 ppm) anomalies.  In addition, over a prominent magnetic anomaly from geophysical data, there are coincident Au-Cu-Mo soil anomalies that  cover  an  area  of  about  1,200  by  600  m.   Within  this  anomaly,  Minexfor  reportedly  drilled  four vertical diamond drill holes (see Section 11.2.3).

Rio Tinto's soil geochemical grid at Colnic covered an area of approximately 1.2 km by 1.4 km and lines  were  oriented  north-south,  spaced  200  m  apart  with  sampling  stations  every  100  m.   In  the western  part  of  the  grid,  line  spacing  is  100  m.  Soil  samples  were  sieved  to  minus  80  mesh,  and analyzed by OMAC Laboratory in Ireland for Au and a 45-element suite using ICP-OES.

Results of the Rio Tinto soil survey, as compiled by Carpathian, show an irregular 700 m (east-west) by 500 m (north-south) weak molybdenum anomaly (&gt;2 ppm Mo), centered on the Colnic porphyry. Coincident with this is an arc-shaped, (north-south) gold anomaly (&gt;50 ppb Au), which extends over 600 m and continues as a weaker anomaly (&gt;30 ppb Au), 500 m further to the southeast (see Figures 6-1 and 7-6).  Additional linear, north- to north-northwest-trending gold anomalies occur approximately 750 m east of the Colnic porphyry, but these may correlate with gold-base metal veins that have been explored by the Romanian government on the periphery of the Colnic alteration zone.

Rio Tinto also completed a soil geochemistry survey over a broad area from Ciresata southward to Hategani  (partly  outside  of  Carpathian's  property).   This  survey  covered  11,20  sq-km  at  a  sample spacing  of  200  m  (N-S)  x  100   m  (E-W)  with  500  saples  collected.   Within  the  present  Carpathian

property, this survey contains 3 weak gold anomalies with the largest anamoly occurring in the Garzii Valley  area  partly  coincident  with  the  presently  known  buried  Ciresata  Au-Cu  mineralization.   This anomaly is 10 - 50   ppb Au covering 800 m by 400 m.   This anomaly is partly coincident with a Cu anomaly of &gt;25 ppm.  Several copper anaomalies were defined, however, some of these are related to basic volcanic.

At  the  Valisoara-Porcurea Prospect,  several  spot-anomalies  of  Au  and  basemetals  were shown but have not been analysed in any further detail by Carpathian.

## Carpathian

In  May  2007,  Carpathian  initiated  a  soil  geochemical  survey  over  the  northern  part  of  the  Rovina licence.  The survey grid covered an area of 20 km2 over the Rovina, Colnic and Zdrapti prospects on a 200 m (east-west) x 100 m (north-south) grid.    In addition, infill grids were completed in selected areas with the larger grid.  Results highlight coincident Au-Cu - Mo anamolies over the known porphyry deposits of Rovina and Colnic with a series of satellite gold anomalies within the broad phyllic alteration halo  at  Colnic  (Figure  10-1). Additional  anomalies  occur  at  the  Zdrapti  prospect  and  other  areas. Carpathian conducted field-follow-up comprised of mapping and sampling of these and other magnetic anomalies within the grid.

Carpathian conducted a geochemistry re-survey of the Ciresata area at a closer grid spacing than the Rio Tinto survey and to provide better sampling and anaylitical control.  Results from Carpathian's 100 m x 100 m geochemistry survey highlight a Au + Cu anomaly extending west 300 m from the known porphyry mineralization.

## 10.8.3 Rock Chip Sampling

## Rio Tinto (1999 to 2000)

Rio Tinto collected 153 rock chip samples at the Colnic, Cordurea, Valisoara-Porcurea, and Ciresata Prospects, as shown on Table 10-5.  This limited reconnaissance-level work has been superseded by surface exploration work subsequently completed by Carpathian.

Table 10-5 Rio Tinto Rock Chip Sampling

| Prospect           |   Number of  Samples | Range of Grades  (Au g/t)   |
|--------------------|----------------------|-----------------------------|
| Colnic             |                  133 | 0 to 1.24                   |
| Cordurea           |                    2 | 0.03 to 0.24                |
| Valisoara-Porcurea |                    4 | 0.01 to 0.27                |
| Ciresata           |                   14 | 0.01 to 0.21                |
| Total              |                  153 |                             |

## Carpathian Surface Rock Sampling

Carpathian geologists have collected 882 surface rock samples form the Rovina property as part of reconnassaince  mapping,  prospect  mapping,  and  detailed  mapping  campaigns. These  samples include  chip-channel,  chip,  float,  waste-dump,  and  discarded  old  core  as  sample  types.   Geologist

descriptions  include  sample  type,  geology  description,  map  location  and  are  entered  into  a  GIS database.  A tabulation of surface rock sampling by prospect for the Rovina property is shown in Table 10-6. This includes 168 channel-chip samples from outcrops at Colnic for a cumulative 519 m; and 71 channel-chip samples from Rovina for a cumulative 270 m collected during the period October 2004 to May  2006. Geologic  description  and  assay  results  from  these  samples  highlighted  outcropping porphyry Au-Cu mineralization that subsequent drilling has defined as the Rovina and Colnic porphyry deposits.   These  samples  have  not  been  used  in  Resource  Estimation  due  to  the  extensive  drilling completed, but do provide surface evidence of the respective porphyry mineralization.

Carpathian Underground Rock Chip Sampling

In  2005  Carpathian  completed  a  program  of  underground  channel  chip  sampling  at  the  Cordurea Prospect.   Sampling was in the Petru and Pavel Galleries and included 138 individual channels over 372 m of galleries.  Details regarding this sampling program are provided in Section 7.4.2.  Although a few  anomalous  results  were  returned,  in  general  sample  results  were  disappointing. Of  the  139 samples collected only six had assays greater than 0.5 g/t Au and three greater than 1 g/t Au.

## 10.8.4 Drill Core Sampling

## Minexfor

Details  regarding  Minexfor  drill  core  sampling  programs  are  very  poorly  documented  and  are  not discussed in this report. None of the Minexfor core is in a usable format and most has been dumped in heaps adjacent to the Rovina Deposit.

## Rio Tinto

Rio  Tinto  did  not  report  any  drilling  activities  in  their  exploration  reports  filed  with  the  NAMR  and subsequently purchased by Carpathian.

## Carpathian

Carpathian has collected 68,227 samples of half-core, all of which were assayed for Cu, Au, Pb, Zn and  Ag. The  sampling  methodology  and  analytical  results  are  discussed  in  Sections  12  and  13, respectively.

## 10.9 Drilling

## 10.9.1 Minexfor

A  total  of  5,300  m  of  core  drilling  in  13  holes,  was  was  drilled  at  the  Colnic  Deposit. Drilling  is discussed in more detail in Section 11.

## 10.9.2 Carpathian

A total of   71,375 m of core drilling in 181 holes was completed on the Colnic, Rovina and Ciresata Deposits, and the Zdrapti Prospect.

Drilling is discussed in more detail in Section 11.

## 10.9.3 Mineralogical and Petrographic Studies

Carpathian commissioned a number of petrographic studies in 2006, 2007 and 2008 on hand specimen and drill core samples from Dr Georghe Damian, at North University, Baia Marie, Dr Robin Armstrong of the Natural History Museum, in London, UK, and from Jim Clarke, Cygnus Consulting Inc. Montreal, Canada.  Samples were examined for lithology, alteration, paragenetic sequences and mineralization. Results of the studies were provided as detailed descriptions and photo-micrographs in report format (Damian, 2006 in Ruff, 2006, and Armstrong, 2006 in Ruff, 2007a).

## 1 1 . 0 D R I L L I N G

Approximately 100,788m of drilling has been completed on the Property since 1975. Most of the drilling has been concentrated on the Colnic, Rovina and Ciresata Deposits (34,359 m, 54,823 m and 8,935 m, respectively);  however  smaller  reconnaissance  programs  have  been  drilled  by  Carpathian  at  the Zdrapti Prospect.   A summary of all drilling is provided on Table 11-1.   Locations of the historical drill holes  at  the  Colnic,  Rovina  and  Ciresata  Deposits,  are  shown  on  Figures  6-1,  11-1,  and  11-2, respectively.   The Carpathian drilling at Colnic, Rovina and Ciresata are shown on Figures 11-3, 11-4 and 11-5, respectively.

## 11.1 Historical Minexfor Drilling

## 11.2 Rovina Deposit

Few details  of  the  historical  drill  programs  completed  by  Minexfor  at  Rovina  are  available.  All  core samples from previous campaigns has been dumped in heaps near the Rovina Deposit and therefore cannot be re-sampled.   The most significant program was completed at the Rovina Deposit between 1974 and 1986.

Minexfor drilled 34 core holes ranging in depth between 515 m and 1,108 m (average depth 680 m) totalling 23,119 m (see Table 11-2).   All holes were collared vertically and nominally spaced between 60 and 90 m along seven east-northeast-oriented, 100-m spaced grid lines.  Drilling was very slow and averaged about 5 m per day over a 12 year period.

Carpathian was provided with paper copies of simplified drill logs showing generalized lithology and alteration and 15 m composite assays for Cu, which were reportedly derived from 1 m assays.   Gold was only sporadically reported on the drill logs as 15 m intervals, reportedly derived from an average of 5 m composited samples.   The drill logs also contain sporadic results of Ag, Pb, Zn, Mo, Fe and S along  with  occasional  specific  gravity  measurements. The  header  of  each  log  also  recorded  the average recovery for the hole.  Collars were reported to be surveyed on a 3-decimal accuracy.

## 11.2.1 Colnic Deposit

Between 1975 and 2000 Minexfor drilled 14 holes totalling 4,740 m at the Colnic Deposit (see Table 11-3).   Few details were provided to Carpathian regarding this drilling campaign.  Most of these holes were drilled in the area of Carpathian's current drilling at Colnic and ranged in depth from 100 to 1,200 m and averaged around 340 m.  Most holes were very wide spaced (100 to 500 m) and no specific grid pattern was used for the drilling.  Holes were restricted to an area covering approximately 2,000 m by 800 m, targeting geophysical and surface geological targets.

The first hole drilled in the area (diamond drill hole F-2) was drilled in 1975 and was the first hole to intersect porphyry style mineralization at Colnic (see Figure 6-1).  The hole was collared vertically and continued to a depth of 650 m. This hole gives the name to the hill hosting the central-eastern part of the Colnic deposit (F-2 hill).

Note: there could be an additional 3 holes in the vicinity of Colnic, named S2, F-12 and F-13, which remain poorly documented and as such locations are uncertain.

Only  a  summary  log  was  provided  to  Carpathian,  which  documents  weakly  anomalous  Cu  grades (averaging 400 ppm), between 0 and 240 m depth and stronger anomalies (averaging 1,000 ppm) from 240 m to 650 m depth.  Apparently gold was not analyzed.

Several  years  later,  in  the  mid-1980s,  Minexfor  drilled  core  holes  FA,  FB,  FD,  and  FF,  which  were wide-spaced and located to the north and east of Carpathian's current drilling (see Figure 6-1).  These holes were collared vertically, and continued to depths ranging from 490 to 1,200 m.  Only summarized details  of  these  holes  were  provided  to  Carpathian;  however  long  intervals  of  weakly  to  moderately anomalous Cu grades (230 ppm to 710 ppm) were reportedly intersected, starting at depths generally greater than 300 m. Gold was apparently not analyzed in these holes.  For the holes drilled in 1975 and the early 1980s, Carpathian received only generalized descriptions of the drill logs.

In 2000, Minexfor completed eight additional core holes at Colnic (F7 to F9 and F14 to F18), totalling 1,100  m  (see  Figure  6-1). These  holes  were  drilled  at  angles  ranging  from  -5° and  -72° and  at azimuths ranging between 235° to 288°, except for one hole drilled at an azimuth of 99°.   The holes were  all  in  the  vicinity  of  Carpathian's  current  drilling  and  intersected  porphyry-style  mineralization. Gold values appear to be in a similar range to those reported by Carpathian, but copper grades were not  included  in  the  data  provided  to  Carpathian.   Two  additional  holes,  to  the  south  (F14  and  F15), returned only weak Au anomalies.   No additional work was reported by Minexfor subsequent to this drilling.   Carpathian purchased the drill log data with assays reported in paper format which showed generalized lithology and alteration and 1 m assays for Au and Ag.    Copper, Pb, and Zn were only sporadically reported on the drill logs.

Collars  were  surveyed  based  on  the  3-decimal  accuracy  of  the  collar  coordinates  in  the  database; however the survey methodology was not documented.

## 11.2.2 Ciresata Prospect

Between 2002 and 2003, Minexfor drilled six core holes totalling 1,200 m at the Ciresata Prospect (see Table  11-4  and  Figure  11-2),  approximately  4.5  km  south  of  Colnic.   Few  details  were  provided  to Carpathian regarding the drilling campaign.  No specific grid pattern was adhered to for the drilling, and holes were generally wide-spaced and presumably targeted geophysical anomalies. Hole lengths were all recorded as 200 m.

Carpathian purchased this data from the NAMR comprised of paper drill logs of geology and reported Au assay results.  Carpathian computerised this data for use in a drill-hole software.  Few anomalous results  were  reported,  except  for  weak  scattered  anomalies  ranging  between  0.25  and  0.68  g/t  Au throughout hole F4.   The final 16 m of the drill hole (184 m to 200 m, the end of the hole) yielded a length-weighted average of 0.39 g/t Au.  Only occasional Cu analyses were completed and reported.

## 11.3 Carpathian Drilling

## 11.3.1 Colnic Deposit

Carpathian commenced drilling at Colnic on February 7, 2006.  As shown on Figure 11-3, drilling has been performed on 11 nominally southwest-oriented (235'), 30 to 85 m spaced sections, over an area of approximately 700 m (northwest) by 600 m (northeast).  Appendix 2B summarizes the holes drilled by  Carpathian.  Appendix  3C  summarizes  the  significant  drill  intercepts  reported  by  Carpathian. Carpathian applied an approximate 0.5 g/t Au cut-off to generate these intervals.

Core drilling at Colnic has been undertaken by SC Genfor S.R.L., a Romanian-based contractor, using track-mounted GNK 850, RB-57, and RB-58 drill rigs with depth capabilities of around 600 m.

Core diameter is  generally  HQ  (62.3  mm),  and  some  holes  continue  to  depths  of  400  m  using  this diameter core.   Holes are reduced to NQ (48 mm) core diameter at depths ranging between 95 and 400 m, as required.   Currently, 63% of the drilling is with HQ diameter, and 37% is with NQ.   Once drilled,  core  is  removed  from  the  core  barrel  by  the  drillers,  washed,  and  placed  in  galvanized-steel core boxes.

These  boxes  could  cause  some  very  low-level  Zn  contamination;  however  given  the  grade  tenors reported  for  this  element,  this  should  not  present  any  issues  for  future  resource  estimations. In general, the core-handling procedures at the drill site appeared to be very good.

All boxes are clearly identified with the hole number, metres 'from-to', and box number written with a permanent marker on the front.  Individual drill runs are identified with small wooden blocks, where the depth (m) and hole number are recorded.   Unsampled core is never left unattended at the rig; boxes are transported to the core logging facility in the town of Criscior (approximately 5 km from the site) several times a day under a geologist's supervision.  Core is transported in open boxes in the back of a truck.

Most holes are inclined -50' to -70' and oriented at 220' to 235', although 8 holes have been collared vertically. Holes have been drilled to depths ranging between 100 and 550 m, and average around 330 m.

Downhole surveys are systematically conducted at approximately 50 m intervals along each hole using a single-shot Kodak instrument or using a Reflex EZ-Shot system.

In general, core recoveries obtained by the drilling contractor have been very good, exceeding 97%, except in localized areas of faulting or fracturing.

After  completion  of  each  hole,  the  collars  are  surveyed  by  tape  and  compass  method  and  GPS. Carpathian has contracted a surveyor to routinely survey the collar positions using a Total Station.  Drill holes are left open, a piece of PVC pipe is inserted into the hole, and the hole is marked with a cement monument showing the hole number.

All diamond core from the current drilling campaign is stored in a secure location at the field office in Criscior or surrounding area.  The new core is in very good shape; it is split with a diamond saw, and stored in sturdy galvanized steel core boxes on steel racks in an enclosed core shed or outside in a covered core storage yard.   The adjacent core-logging room is large and well-lit, with electric lighting and a concrete floor.  There is a facility for two diamond core saws in a room adjoining the core shed.

Due to the high average recoveries, PEG did not exclude any intervals from the database for use in exploratory data analysis (EDA), compositing, and interpolation as part of resource estimation.

## 11.3.2 Rovina Deposit

Carpathian's current drilling program at the Rovina Deposit commenced on May 26, 2006.  Drilling has been performed on 12, nominal southeast-oriented (150° ), 55 to 85 m spaced sections, over an area of approximately 550 m by 700 m (see Figures 11-4 and 7-6).

Appendix 1B summarizes the holes drilled by Carpathian.  Appendix 1A summarizes the significant drill intercepts reported by Carpathian.   Carpathian applies an approximate 0.5 g/t Au cut-off to generate these intervals.

Core drilling at the Rovina Deposit was undertaken by SC Genfor S.R.L, a Romanian-based contractor, using a Warman-1000 rig and a Longyear 45 rig, both with depth capabilities of around 600 m.   Core

08CARP0100\_REP00

drilled  at  the  Rovina  Deposit  is  collared  using  HQ  diameter  and  reduced  to  NQ  at  depths  ranging between 132 m and 286 m.  Currently, 40% of the drilling is with HQ diameter and 60% is with NQ.

Most  of  the  holes  were  collared  vertically  and  drilled  to  depths  ranging  between  100  and  599  m, averaging  about  490  m. Downhole  surveys  are  systematically  conducted  at  approximately  50 m intervals along each hole using a Reflex EZ-Shot system.   Due to the presence of magnetic minerals (magnetite and pyrrhotite) in the alteration assemblages indicate that the results of the surveys should be interpreted with care.

In general, core recoveries obtained by the drilling contractor have been very good, exceeding 97%, except in localized areas of faulting or fracturing.

All collar locations  have  been  surveyed  using  a  Garmin  hand-held  GPS  unit  and  Carpathian commissioned a detailed topographic survey of the Property in November 2006, during which time all drill hole collars were resurveyed.

All of the core collection steps were found to be very similar to those noted at the Colnic Deposit. Good on-site procedures have been maintained by the drilling contractors.

Due to the high average recoveries, PEG did not exclude any intervals from the database for use in exploratory data analysis (EDA), compositing, and interpolation as part of resource estimation.

## 11.3.3 Ciresata Deposit

Carpathian's  drilling  program  at  the  Ciresata  Deposit  commenced  on  December  2007.  Drilling  has been performed on 8 nominal northeast-oriented (50°) 50 to 110m spaced sections, over an area of approximately 400m by 600 m (see Figure 11-5)

Appendix 3B summarizes the holes drilled by Carpathian.  Appendix 3C summarizes the significant drill intercepts reported by Carpathian.   Carpathian applies an approximate 0.5 g/t Au cut-off to generate these intervals.

Core  drilling  at  the  Ciresata  Deposit  was  undertaken  by  SC  Genfor  S.R.L,  a  Romanian-based contractor, using mainly an RB-57 rig and a Longyear 45 rig, with depth capabilities of around 300m and  600  m  respectively. Core  drilled  at  the  Ciresata  Deposit  is  collared  using  HQ  diameter  and reduced to NQ at depths ranging between 108 m and 301 m.  Currently, 35% of the drilling is with HQ diameter and 65% is with NQ.

## 11.3.4 Zdrapti Prospect

Carpathian's  current  drilling  program  at  the  Zdrapti  Prospect  began  in  January  2007,  and  11  holes totalling  2,671  m  have  been  drilled  to  test  sub-cropping  potassic  alteration  with  a  coincident  ground magnetic anomaly.

Core drilling  at  the  Zdrapti  Prospect  has  been  carried  out  by  SC  Genfor  S.R.L,  a  Romanian  based contractor, using an RB-57 drill rig capable of depths up to 300 m.  Core diameter is generally HQ and some holes continue to depths of 400 m using this diameter core.  Holes are reduced to NQ at depths

08CARP0100\_REP00

ranging between 100 and 110 m as necessary.  Currently, 40% of the drilling (to the end of hole RZD4) is with HQ diameter, and 60% is with NQ.

In general, core recoveries obtained by the drilling contractor have been very good, exceeding 97%, except in localized areas of faulting or fracturing.

The results of the drilling generally show only anomalous copper and gold grades over short down hole intervals of a few metres.

## 11.4 Carpathian Downhole Surveys

Carpathian corrects all azimuth reading by adding 4°E to the magnetic azimuth read by the downhole instrument  to  account  for  magnetic  declination. PEG  reviewed  the  downhole  survey  files  prior  to resource estimation to check for abrupt azimuth or dip changes that may suggest the presence of false deviations from magnetic interferences or inappropriately collected readings.

## 11.5 Carpathian Dry Bulk Density Measurements

Carpathian  has  collected  840  specific  gravity  measurements  from  drill  programs.  A  total  of  412 samples  have  been  collected  from  Rovina,  368  samples  have  been  collected  from  Colnic  and  60 samples have been collected from Ciresata.   Samples for specific gravity determination are taken at downhole intervals of between 10 m and 50 m.  The samples are sent to the ALS Laboratory at Gura Rosiei where all samples are dried, coated in a thin layer of lacquer or shellac before the samples are weighed in air (W1) and in water (W2).  The specific gravity is calculated using the following formula:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

The volume of shellac  or  lacquer  is  too  small  to  significantly  affect  the  density  determination  so  no correction is required.

The rock types found at are generally non-porous and therefore the specific gravity determinations are representative  of  the  in-situ  bulk  density  of  the  rock  types,  and  sufficient  for  resource  estimation purposes.

## 12.1 Introduction

Sampling programs on the Property by Carpathian have included soil, rock chip and drill core samples. All of the Carpathian sampling was performed by Carpathian personnel or contractors.

No  documentation  of  sampling  methodology  was  provided  for  exploration  by  Minexfor  or  Rio  Tinto; however it is reported that some of Rio Tinto's samples were analysed at OMAC Laboratory in Ireland. Given  that  no  information  is  available  for  these  programs,  the  sampling  methods  used  by  these companies are not discussed in this section.

## 12.2 Soil Sampling Procedures

A total of 2,536 soil samples were collected and analyzed from five separate programs. Soil sampling covers  20  sq  km  of  the  Northern  part  of  the  Rovina  licence  over  the  Rovina,  Colnic  and  Zdrapti mineralization  (see  Figure  10-1).  Sampling  spacing  is  200mX100m  in  the  East-West  direction  and North-South  direction  respectively.  Infill  soil  sampling  over  grids  spaced  100m  by  100  m  were completed  over  the  Rovina  deposit  and  the  South-East  part  of  the  Colnic  deposit  to  help  identify mineralization extension. In the Southern part of the licence, the Ciresata prospect has been covered by a soil  grid  extending  over  9  sqkm  with  sample spacing ranging from 100m by 100m to 100m by 200m. An additional 2 sq km soil grid covers the Cordurea prospect.

Samples were collected as follows:

- Each sample location was determined by GPS reading over a UTM grid.
- Only the B horizon (typically 20 to 25 cm deep) was sampled; a sample of about 1 kg, free  of  debris,  and  with  as  little  pebble  and  organic  matter  as  possible,  was  put  in canvas bag, labelled with a alpha-numeric code, and sent to the sample preparation facility (see Section 13.2.1).

## 12.3 Channel Chip Sampling Procedures

Carpathian collected approximately 1020 surface rock samples on the main prospects in the property (see Table 12-1)

Channel samples and channel chip samples were collected as follows:

- The geologist selects the sampling area and marks out the boundaries of the channel sample with spray paint on the outcrop.  Channels are usually 10 cm wide and 1 m to 5 m in length.   Prior to collection, the samplers are instructed to remove the upper 5 cm of weathered material.
- Sampling is undertaken with a chisel and hammer by systematically collecting chips to depths of 2 cm to 3 cm and occasionally down to 5 cm, along the channel length.  Both chips and fines are collected in cotton-cloth bags.   A field sample number is assigned and the bag is marked with a permanent marker with the sample number.   Samples generally range between 3 to 10 kg.  An aluminium tag is fixed to the starting point of each sample and if  a  continuous  series  of  samples  are  collected,  a  spray  paint  line marks the start and end points.
- The sample's grid coordinates (UTM Zone 34 Northern Hemisphere, WGS84 datum) are  determined  with  a  hand-held  GPS  unit  and  recorded  manually  along  with  a geological  description,  date  of  sampling,  sampler's  name  and  other  relevant  data. These  data  are  transferred  into  a  Microsoft  Excel  spread  sheet  called  'Sample Inventory'.
- The sample bags are packed into fiberene shipping bags (approximately 60 kg), sealed with wire, and stored in a secure location at the Carpathian field office in Criscior until a load is assembled for shipping.   The shipment is delivered by a Carpathian employee directly to the ALS Chemex Laboratory in Gura Rosiei. Carpathian Drill Core Sampling Procedure

## 12.3.1 Logging Procedures

Since February 2006, Carpathian has drilled approximately 71,742 m of core in 183 drill holes at the Colnic, Rovina and Ciresata Deposits and Zdrapti Prospect.  A total of 68,227 half-core samples have been collected along with 1,927 twin quarter-core samples as part of the QA/QC program (see Section 13.1).  A  total  of  840  specific  gravity  samples  have  been  collected;  368  samples  from  Colnic,  412 samples from Rovina and 60 from Ciresata.

Upon  arrival  at  the  core  shed  the  core  is  subject  to  the  following  core  logging  procedures  by Carpathian:

- Quick review.
- Core photography.
- Geotechnical logging.
- Sampling: the geologist marks a cutting line, and marks the sample intervals
- Core  cutting:  with  a  diamond  saw,  following  the  line  marked  by  the  geologist.  Both halves  of  the  core  are  returned  to  the  box  in  their  original  orientation  ready  for  the geologist to review and to transfer to sample bags.
- Sample bagging: half-core samples are always collected from the left side of the core, properly  identified  with  inner  tags  and  outside  marked  numbers. Sample  bags  are immediately sealed and stored in a secure facility in Criscior.  Samples are delivered by Carpathian personnel directly to the ALS Chemex Laboratory in Gura Rosiei when a full shipment is ready.
- Geological logging, and logging forms include: header information, lithology description and coding, graphic log, structural description and angle to core axis, alteration (coded on a 1 to 4 scale), veining intensity (coded on a 1 to 5 scale), mineralization, a general description and assay interval.
- Assay data entry: the assay results are imported directly from the file provided by the laboratory, into the Access database and into the Micromine database, by two different technicians thus creating two independent databases.
- Drill log  data  entry:  coded  data  are  introduced  into  the  Access  and  Micromine database.

At the completion of the logging process, the boxes are returned to the core racks.

## 12.4 Review of Logging Procedures

During  the  January  2007  site  visit  by  AMEC,  they  reported  and  documented  those  portions  of  12 selected drill holes from Colnic (8 drill holes) and Rovina (4 drill holes) were examined.  The following table lists the holes reviewed by AMEC (Table 12-1).

Table 12-1 Carpathian Drill Core Intervals Reviewed by AMEC

Following  recommendations  in  AMEC's  previous  technical  report  (Cinits,  2006b),  Carpathian  has increased  the  amount  of  detail  in  the  core-logging  and  re-logged  all  of  the  drill  holes  from  the  first Carpathian drill campaign using new logging forms.  Existing drill-logs were checked against drill core and AMEC concluded that in general, the core-logging by Carpathian was found to be accurate and with sufficient detail to be  utilized for resource  estimation. AMEC  also  made  a  number  of recommendations at that time, which are detailed in their 2007 Technical Report.

## 1 3 . 0 S A M P L E P R E P A R A T I O N , A N A L Y S E S A N D S E C U R I T Y

Currently all routine sample preparation and analyses of the Carpathian samples are performed by ALS Chemex Romania (ALS), Laboratory (lab) in the town of Gura Rosiei (where the Rosia Montana Project is located), about 45 minutes drive northwest of the project area.  Between 1997 and the end of 2005, the lab was operated by Analabs, an Australian-based company which at the time was part of the SGS Group. SGS  is  an  internationally  recognized  organization  that  operates  over  320  laboratories worldwide and has ISO 9002 certification for many of their laboratories.   The Analabs laboratory was installed  as  a  dedicated  facility  for  Gabriel  Resources'  Rosia  Montana  Project  during  their  resource definition  stage. At  the  start  of  2006,  SGS  pulled  out  of  the  management  role  of  the  lab  due  to decreased activity.  The lab name changed to ROM Analize S.R.L. (ROM Analize), and for the first half of 2006 was run as a privately-operated independent lab, managed by Hidi Francis.

In  September 2006, ALS Chemex purchased ROM Analize and now manages the operation of the laboratory. There was a transition period until ALS Chemex analytical methods were adopted, and the change from ROM Analize to ALS Chemex is formally considered in this document as of 28 November 2006.   ALS Chemex is an internationally recognized organization that operates 38 laboratories in 16 countries worldwide, and has ISO 9002 certification for many of their laboratories.

All rock and drill samples since Carpathian acquired the Rovina Proprty have been submitted to this laboratory, either under the management of Analabs, ROM Analize, or ALS Chemex.

## 13.1 Carpathian Sample Preparation

## 13.1.1 Sample Preparation for Soil Samples

Soil samples from Carpathian's Rovina Property soil program were prepared by the laboratory at Gura Rosiei.  The samples were logged, weighed, and dried before sieving to -80 mesh.  Both size fractions were retained.  Subsequently the sieved -80 mesh fraction was pulverized to 85% passing 75 micron or better.  A 100 g portion of the final prepared samples was then shipped to the ALS Chemex laboratory in Vancouver, Canada.

## 13.1.2 Sample Preparation of Rock Chip and Drill Core Samples

All  rock  chip  and  core  samples  are  prepared and analyzed at the ALS Chemex laboratory.   For the 2007 Technical Report by AMEC, they visited the lab on January 23, 2007 and briefly reviewed the sample preparation and analytical protocols.  According to the AMEC report, all equipment, laboratory procedures and QA/QC protocols were established by SGS and ALS and the lab was deemed to be well-equipped and the staff well-trained.   The lab can process about 3,000 samples per month from various  clients,  although  the  maximum  capacity  is  reportedly  between  700  and  800  per  day.   Most weighing  and  data  measurements  are  automatically  recorded,  reducing  the  possibility  of  data  entry errors.

The laboratory has one large drying oven with automatic temperature control, one jaw crusher, and six 5 kg capacity LM5 pulverisers.  Each of these has forced air extraction and compressed air for cleaning the crushers and pulverisers.

The preparation protocol for Carpathian samples is as follows:

- coding: an internal laboratory code is assigned to each sample at reception
- weighing: all samples are weighed
- drying: the samples are dried at 105'C for as much as 24 hours
- crushing: the entire sample is crushed to obtain nominal 85% at 5 mm (from February 2006 to July 2007); from August 2007 to present day the entire sample is crushed to obtain nominal 85% at 2 mm.
- pulverization:  from  February  2006  until  October  17  2006,  the  entire  sample  was pulverized for 6 to 11 minutes to achieve better then 85% passing 75 microns.  A 150 to 200 g sample was collected from the pulveriser. From October 23 2006, until July 2007, 1 kg split of the 5 mm crushed samples was pulverised to achieve better then 85% passing 75 microns. From August 2007 to present day, 1 kg split of 2 mm crushed samples is pulverised to achieve better then 85% passing 75 microns.
- storing and submitting: The coarse rejects, pulps and pulp rejects are stored on site for 30 days and then returned to Carpathian.

Wet sieve checks are conducted regularly by ALS Chemex (every 15 to 20 samples).   Local sterile rock, and occasionally pure feldspar, is passed through the crushers and the pulveriser to clean the equipment every five samples on average.

In addition to the sieve tests, ALS Chemex completes the following QA/QC protocols during the sample preparation:

- pulp blank: 1 inserted every 50 samples
- Certified  Reference  Material  (CRM):  2  inserted  every  50  samples  (5  CRMs  in  use ranging between 0.76 and 5.12 g/t Au)
- pulp duplicates: 1 every 12 samples
- pulp re-assay: 4 every 40 samples.

The ALS Chemex uses coarse pure feldspar is used as a coarse blank.

All  pulps  are  automatically  labelled  with  the  job  number,  sequence  number,  and  sample  number. Duplicate samples are returned to Carpathian along with the other pulps, but are in a different coloured bag (black as opposed to brown).

## 13.2 Carpathian Sample Analysis

## 13.2.1 Sample Analysis for Soil Samples

During the Carpathian soil sampling program in 2007 and 2008, a total of 2536 samples were analysed at ALS Chemex in Vancouver for gold and 35 other elements using the following analytical methods:

- Au  analyses  by  a  fire  assay  method  (method  Au-ICP21)  followed  by  an  ICP-AES reading with a 1 ppb detection limit
- 35  element  suite: analyzed  by  ICP-AES  after  aqua  regia  digestion  (method  MEICP41).

## 13.2.2 Sample Analyses of Rock Chip and Drill Core Samples

Since February 2006, Carpathian has drilled approximately 71,742 m of core in 183 drill holes at the Colnic, Rovina and Ciresata Deposits, and the Zdrapti Prospect. A total of 68,227 half-core samples have been collected (up to the end of September, 2008) together with 1,927 twin quarter-core samples as part of the QA/QC program.

ROM Analize was the principle laboratory for all Carpathian exploration and drilling programs.  At ROM Analize,  for  gold  analysis  approximately  50  g  of  the  pulp  was  weighed,  with  automatic  digital  data capture of the results to a computer.  For base metals, approximately 0.40 g of pulp was weighed on a separate scale, with similar automatic data capture to the computer.  All samples were assayed for Au by 50 g Fire Assay with AAS finish (0.01 g/t detection).  Base metals, Cu (2 ppm detection), Pb (3 ppm detection), Zn (2 ppm detection), and Ag (1 ppm detection) were analysed by AAS methods using an aqua regia digestion.   A Varian SpectrAA AAS instrument was used for Au and Cu readings while a separate instrument was used for Ag and other base metals.

During  this  time  period,  ALS  Chemex  in  Vancouver  was  the  secondary  laboratory  used  for  check assays.   The samples were assayed for gold by 50g Fire Assay with AAS finish (0.001 g/t detection, method code AA24).   Base metals were analysed by an AAS method (method code AA45) using an aqua regia digestion.

After ALS took over the operation of the laboratory at Gura Rosiei, the analytical method changed to the  ALS  methods  of  AA26  (50g  fire  assay  for  gold)  and  AA45  for  base  metals.   The  same  Varian SpectrAA AAS instrument was used for Au and Cu readings while a separate instrument was used for Ag and other base metals.

During this period, the OMAC Laboratory was used for check assays.  The samples were assayed for gold by 50g Fire Assay with AAS finish (0.01 g/t detection), method A4).  A 45 element suite including base metals was analysed by an ICP-AES method using an aqua regia digestion.

Both  primary  and  secondary  laboratories  reported  the  results  digitally  to  Carpathian  via  email  and submit signed paper certificates.  General turn-around varied from approximately three days to several weeks.  PEG briefly reviewed certificates from the primary laboratories while on site, and completed an audit of these against the digital database prior to resource estimation.

## 13.3 Carpathian Current Drilling Program

Carpathian's drilling programs at the Colnic, Rovina and Ciresata Deposits have used exclusively core drilling methods.   Recovery, on average has been in excess of 97% and all core has been split and sampled on 1 m intervals.

In May 2006, AMEC reviewed Carpathian QA/QC program and recommended some adjustments be made in order to monitor various essential elements of the sampling-assaying sequence, in an effort to control or minimize any possible errors (Cinits, 2006b).  These elements included:

- sample collection and splitting (sampling variance, or sampling precision);
- sample preparation and sub-sampling (sub-sampling variance, or sub-sampling precision; contamination during preparation);
- analytical accuracy, analytical precision and analytical contamination;
- reporting (clerical or data transfer) accuracy.

Starting in early July 2006 Carpathian adjusted the QAQC protocols and incorporated most of AMEC's recommendations.   AMEC's review in 2007 of the QA/QC program indicates that a much improved program was put into place and continue until through the 2007-2008 drill program.

Carpathian QA/QC program since January 2007 consist of

- Pulp duplicate,   3 % of the 36,789 assayed core samples;
- Core Twin samples, 3 % of all 36,789 assayed core samples;
- Coarse blank samples, 3 % of all 36,789 assayed core samples;
- Pulp blank samples, 3 % of all 36,789 assayed core samples;
- Coarse Rejects, 2.6% of all 36,789 assayed core samples;
- Gold standard reference material, 3.4% of of all 36,789 assayed core samples;
- Copper standard reference material, 2.2% of all 36,789 assayed core samples.

Since August 2007 ALS Chemex (Romania) splits the core samples after crushing to 85% passing 2 mm.

## 13.3.1 Summary of the 2006 QA/QC Results by AMEC

Until 22 November 2006, Carpathian used ROM Analyze as primary laboratory and ALS Chemex as secondary laboratory.   Based on the QA/QC review conducted on the 2006 Rovina Apuseni drilling program, AMEC concluded that:

- The sampling precision for Au and Cu during the last portion of the 2006 exploration campaign (July-November 2006) was satisfactory. The sampling precision prior to July 2006 was not assessed;
- Because the entire sample was pulverised during the period February to October 2006, sub-sampling variance at ROM Analize was not assessed, nor required.  For the period October to 28 November 2006 when the core samples were split at the 85% passing 5 mm crushing stage, the sub-sampling variance was found to be adequate;
- Analytical precision for Au and Cu at ROM Analize during the last portion of the 2006 campaign  (July-November  2006)  was  satisfactory,  although  various  sample  mix-ups appear  to  have  occurred.   Analytical  variance  prior  to  July  2006  was  not  assessed. However, on the basis of the partial results, and as a result of the evaluation of the

- check  samples,  AMEC  infers  that  the  analytical  precision  is  likely  to  be  within acceptable limits;
- The  Au  analytical  accuracy  at  ROM  Analize  was  within  the  acceptable  ranges. Although  Carpathian  did  not  include  Cu  CRMs  on  the  batches,  as  a  result  of  the evaluation of the check samples AMEC concludes that the Cu analytical accuracy at ROM Analize was also satisfactory;
- In spite of the original insufficiencies of the QA/QC program implemented at the Rovina Apuseni project, AMEC is of the opinion that the Au and Cu assays of the 2006 drilling exploration  campaign  are  sufficiently  precise  and  accurate  for  resource  and  reserve estimation purposes.

## 13.3.2 Summary of the Late 2006-Early 2007 QA/QC Results by AMEC

Starting from 28 November 2006, Carpathian used ALS Chemex (Romania) as primary laboratory and OMAC (Ireland) as secondary laboratory.

On  the  basis  of  the  QA/QC  review  conducted  on  the  Colnic  and  Rovina  drilling  program  that  was completed during late 2006 to May 2007, AMEC concludes that:

- The sub-sampling sampling variance for Au and Cu was satisfactory;
- The analytical variance for Au and Cu at ALS Chemex was satisfactory, although some sample mix-ups appear to have occurred;
- The  Au  and  Cu  analytical  accuracies  at  ALS  Chemex  were  within  the  acceptable ranges;
- No significant cross-contamination for Au and Cu was detected during preparation and assaying at ALS Chemex during the Late 2006-2007 exploration campaign;
- The Au and Cu assays of the Late 2006-2007 drilling exploration campaign at Rovina are  considered  to  be  sufficiently  precise  and  accurate  for  resource  and  reserve estimation purposes.

AMEC  recommended  the  implementation  of  the  following  measures  during  the  continuation  of  the exploration at the Colnic and Rovina Deposits:

- Carpathian  must  investigate  the  source  of  pulp  sample  mix-ups  that  appear  to  have occurred;
- Carpathian should revise the sample preparation procedure to include a crushing to a finer  particle  size  (85%  passing  10  mesh)  and  splitting  the  samples  after  this  size reduction rather than at a particle size of 5 mm.

## 13.3.3 PEG Review of the Late 2007-2008 QA/QC Results

## Core Twin Samples

PEG created a set of control charts for the analysis of 1108 twin samples collected between Feb 08, 2007 and Sept 09, 2008.

08CARP0100\_REP00

For gold the X-Y chart shows 2 outliers with a good distribution around the parity line. The R2 value of the linear regression after excluding the outliers was high at 0.93. The percentile rank chart for data pairs with an average of 0.2 g/t or greater shows 70% of the core twin are within - 30%. The average of the gold relative percent difference plotted by submission number shows 13 batches where the relative percent difference is  is between - 10% and -20%, 3 batches exceeded - 20% and none exceeded 30%. No trend was observed over time.

For copper the X-Y chart shows 3 outliers with a good distribution around the parity line. The R2 value of the linear regression after excluding the outliers was high at 0.96. The percentile rank chart for data pairs with an average of 0.05% or greater shows 95% of the core twin are within - 30%. The average of  the  copper  relative  percent  difference  plotted  by  submission  number  shows  6  batches  where  the relative percent difference is between - 10% and -20%. 1 batch exceeded - 20% and none exceeded - 30%. No trend was observed over time.

PEG  considers  these  results  as  acceptable  for  twin  core  samples  considering  the  moderate  gold nugget component of the deposits.

## Coarse Rejects

A  total  of  959  coarse  reject  twin  samples  collected  between  Feb  08,  2007  and  July  02,  2008  were analyse through a series of control charts.

For gold the X-Y chart shows 2 outliers with a good distribution around the parity line. The R2 value of the linear regression after excluding the outliers was high at 0.96. The percentile rank chart for data pairs with an average greater than 0.2 g/t shows 65% of the coarse duplicate are within - 20%. The average of the gold relative percent difference plotted by submission number shows 17 batches where the relative percent difference is between - 10% and -20%, 12 batches between - 20% and - 30% and 3 exceeded - 30%. A slight trend was observed over time where the relative percent difference between the original minus duplicate is negative meaning that the duplicate value return a higher gold grade than the original.

For copper the X-Y chart shows 1 outliers with a good distribution around the parity line. The R2 value of the linear regression after excluding the outliers was high at 0.98. The percentile rank chart for data pairs with an average greater than 0.05% shows 97% of the coarse duplicate are within - 20%. The average  of  the  copper  relative  percent  difference  plotted  by  submission  number  shows  11  batches where the relative percent difference is between - 10% and -20%, 0 batch between - 20% and - 30% and 2 exceeded - 30%. No trend was observed over time although the frequency distribution of the copper regression residuals shows a slight negative displacement from the normal distribution.

Table 13-1 Duplicate Summary: 2006 Campaign

| Sample Type             | Element   |   Number of Samples |   Number of outliers |
|-------------------------|-----------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Twin Samples            | Au        |                1108 |                    3 |
|                         | Cu        |                1108 |                    3 |
|                         | Au        |                 959 |                    2 |
| Coarse Reject duplicate | Cu        |                 959 |                    2 |
|                         | Au        |                1105 |                    4 |
| Pulp Duplicates         | Cu        |                1105 |                    0 |

PEG  considers  that  despite  the  slight  trend  observe,  these  results  as  acceptable  for  resource estimation.

## Pulp Duplicates

A total of 1105 pulp duplicates collected from December 04, 2006 to September 03, 2008 were analyse through a series of control charts.

For gold, the X-Y yielded 4 outliers with a good distribution around the parity line with low scattering of the  data.  The  relative  percent  difference  plotted  against  the  average  of  the  pulp  duplicate  shows  a slight  negative  trend.  The  percentile  rank  chart  for  data  pairs  with  an  average  of  0.2  g/t  or  greater shows 62% of the gold pulp duplicates are within - 10%. Target for pulp duplicates is to have 90% of the population within 10%. PEG suggests Carpathian to investigate the size of the pulp sample (too small?) or the coarseness of the grind (too coarse?). A slight trend was observed (Figure 13.2) starting in  April  2008  where  the  relative  percent  difference  between  the  original  minus  duplicate  is  negative meaning that the duplicate value return a higher gold grade than the original.

Figure 13.2 Gold pulp duplicate pairs showing a slight negative trend from March 2008 to the end of the exploration program.

Gold Pulp duplicate pairs

<!-- image -->

For copper, the X-Y chart yielded 0 outliers with a very low scattering of the data pairs around the parity line.  The relative percent difference plotted against the average of the pulp duplicate does not show any trend. The percentile rank chart for data pairs with an average of 0.05 g/t or greater shows 81% of the copper pulp duplicates are within - 10%. The slight trend observe for gold was not mirrored for the copper pulp duplicate.

## Standard reference material (SRM) samples

A  total  of  1281  SRM  were  analysed  from  Feb  08,  2007  to  August  18,  2008.  During  this  period, Carpathian used four gold only standard purchased from Rocklabs, 3 copper only standard purchased from  Geostats  Pty  Ltd.  and  three  gold,  copper  standard  purchased  from  the  Canadian  Resources Laboratory. For evaluation of the CRMs, PEG prepared gold and copper control charts for each.

For  gold,  result  of  the  analysis  of  1281  standard  samples  indicated  the  Rocklab  samples  returned values consistently below the best line 4 out of 4. The Canadian resource standard returned assays consistently above the best line 2 out of 3. With the exception of the RockLab SE29, there were few failures exceeding - 3 time standard deviation. A summary of the characteristics and performances of the CRMs is presented in Table 13-3.

Table 13-2 Summary of Gold Best Values and Performance of SRMs

| Au std                  |   Number  of  samples |   Best value |   Average | Bias (%)   |   Fail 3  Sigma |   Fail 2  Sigma  (2 Seq) |
|-------------------------|-----------------------|--------------|-----------|------------|-----------------|--------------------------|
| SE29                    |                   319 |        0.597 |     0.567 | -5%        |              54 |                       64 |
| SG31                    |                   317 |        0.996 |     0.966 | -3%        |               6 |                        5 |
| SH35                    |                   152 |        1.323 |     1.28  | -3%        |               8 |                        8 |

| CDN-CGS-16  (Indicated) |                   112 |        0.14  |     0.165 | 18%        |               1 |                        4 |
| CDN-CGS-13              |                   104 |        1.01  |     1.013 | 0%         |               0 |                        2 |
| CDN-CM-3                |                   107 |        0.46  |     0.489 | 6%         |               1 |                        7 |

The standard performance is considered reasonable however; there are periods of time that should be reviewed. The CDN SRMs appear to be more stable and consistent than the Rocklabs SRM. The low grade SRMs do not appear to be performing consistently although no CDN SRMS at this lower grade exist  for  comparison  with  data  prior  to  2007.  The  higher  grade  SRMs  through  2007/2008  show  a consistent  low  bias  with  a  remarkably  consistent  shift  to  periods  of  less  or  no  bias  early  in  2008. Carpathian should investigate changes in the laboratory personal or if the bias resulted from a different SRM batch. The RockLab SRM SE29 appears to be consistently problematic and may not be of a very good quality even thought the SRM round robin data from the laboratory certificate appear reasonably strong. PEG recommends discontinuing the use of this SRM and submit a limited number of reference material samples to other laboratories in order to investigate if the problem is related to the SRM.

For  Copper,  a  total  of  800  samples  results  were  analysed.  Carpathian  used  three  copper  standard purchased from Geostats Pty Ltd. from February 8, 2007 to December 27, 2008 and three gold and copper  standard  purchased  from  the  Canadian  Resources  Laboratory  from  August  18,  2008  to September 3, 2008. The standard performance is considerably stronger for copper than for gold. The Geostats Pty Ltd performed better than the Canadian Resource laboratory with low bias and very few failures. For SRM provided by both sources, there are periods of time that should be reviewed. While not  exceeding  the  fail  line,  from  late  May  to  mid  June  2007  the  GBM903-4  showed  an  unusual deviation from the normal performance of the standard. The data indicate a higher failure rate from late may 2008 to June 2008 with the Canadian Resource Laboratory standards.

## Coarse Blanks

PEG  prepared  control  charts  for  1107  Au  and  Cu  coarse  blank  submitted  to  the  ALS  Chemex (Romania) primary laboratory. Cross-contamination would be considered significant if the blank value exceeds five times the detection limit for the element.

For gold six samples out of 1107 exceeded the five-time the detection limit. The analysis did not reveal any  trend  or  pattern  from  February  2007  to  March  2008.  For  copper,  The  detection  limit  of  the instrument is 2 ppm, Carpathian samples return an average of 31.4 ppm with the lower first quartile equal  to  20  ppm  leading  to  believe  that  the  blank  values  used  by  Carpathian  carries  a  background copper value of  approximately  20  ppm  copper.  Overall,  the  copper  distribution  for  the  copper  blank samples are tightly cluster around the 15ppm - 25 ppm range with 49% of the data within that range and less than 0.53% of the data exceeded 40 ppm. No trend or pattern was noticeable from the data examine.

## Pulp Blanks

PEG prepare control charts for 1107 Au and Cu pulp blank submitted to the ALS Chemex (Romania) primary laboratory. The pulp blank shows the same pattern as the coarse blank. The gold bIank return no samples above the three-time detection limit consider appropriate for this type of blank samples. For copper, the distribution is tightly cluster around the 15 to 30 ppm range with 95% of the data within that range and less than 0.45% of the data exceeded 40 ppm.

## Check Samples

No  additional  check  samples  were  submitted  to  a  secondary  laboratory  since  the  last  shipment reported  by  AMEC  in  early  February  2007.  At  that  time  the,  AMEC  reported  that  Carpathian  resubmitted 111 pulp samples to OMAC for external check assays on 2 February 2007. The samples corresponded  to  batches  previously  assayed  at  ALS  Chemex  between  22  November  2006  and  15 January 2007. After excluding seven outliers for Au and twelve outliers for Cu, the Reduction-to-MajorAxis (RMA) plots indicate a reasonably good fit for both elements between ALS Chemex and OMAC with high coefficient of determination R2 of 0.991 for Au and 0.996 for Cu.

## Sieve Checks

PEG did not receive sieve test data corresponding to the 2007-2008 exploration program assays.

## Conclusions

Based  on  the  QA/QC  review  conducted  on  the  2007/2008  Rovina  Apuseni  drilling  program,  PEG concluded that:

- The sampling precision for Au and Cu during the late 2007-2008 exploration campaign was satisfactory.
- The Au analytical accuracy at ROM Analize was within the acceptable ranges. Close monitoring of the SRM results need to be implemented with partial batch resubmission for bracketing the samples surrounding a two-standard deviation failure.
- The  Au  and  Cu  analytical  accuracies  at  ALS  Chemex  were  within  the  acceptable ranges  throughout  the  2007-2008  exploration  program.  The  pulp  duplicate  results indicated a slight degradation in precision near the end of the exploration program that should be monitored closely.
- No significant cross-contamination for Au and Cu was detected during preparation and assaying at ALS Chemex during the 2007-2008 exploration campaign.
- The Au and Cu assays of the Late 2007-2008 drilling exploration campaign at Rovina Apuseni are considered to be sufficiently precise and accurate for resource and reserve estimation purposes.

## 13.4 Security

PEG visited the  Carpathian  core  storage  facility  in  Criscior  during  sampling  activities,  and  a  secure storage facility  was  in  place.   All  of  the  sample  collection  and  handling  is  done  by  Carpathian  staff. Core sampling is done by Carpathian at their sampling and storage facility in Criscior, which is guarded and relatively secure.

## 13.5 Database Content and Integrity

## 13.5.1 Database Management

Currently  Carpathian  is  entering  all  of  their  geological  and  geotechnical  data  (including  relevant historical data) into a combination of Excel, MSAccessfi  (Access), MapInfo and Micromine databases. Sampling data recorded in the field are manually introduced into Excel files by a technician.  Following this,  the  files  are  transferred  to  the  database  manager  in  Criscior,  who  incorporates  them  into  the project  Access  database. Sampling  data  are  then  transferred  independently  to  the  Micromine database, located in Deva.  Assay data are not manually entered on site because they are digitally sent from the laboratory to Carpathian and imported into the Access and Micromine databases.  Carpathian visually checks each assay on the signed paper certificate against that in the digital databases.

Geological  data  from  the  geological  logs  are  entered  from  the  hardcopy  logs  into  the  Micromine database  and  are  then  transferred  to  the  Access  database  in  Criscior. Downhole  survey  data  is

08CARP0100\_REP00

entered from hardcopies supplied by the drill contractor.  Drill hole collar survey data are not manually entered because they are digitally sent by the surveyor to Carpathian and imported into the Access and Micromine databases.

Carpathian presents the data in up-to-date drill sections.  Section interpretations are  reconciled to level plans  and  longitudinal  sections  to  ensure  that  domains  (solids)  are  properly  constructed  and interpretations are sound.  Sections and levels are reviewed on a regular basis to ensure that all holes have crossed the target where planned, and that sufficient data density exists to make an appropriate interpretation. Solids  of  all  lithologies  and  mineralization  types  present  should  be  shown  on  the sections (and levels).

PEG audited the databases which form the basis of the updated resource estimates and found them to be well-organized and transparent.  The databases are duplicated in the Carpathian office in the city of Deva for security.  Carpathian dedicates one or two people for the majority of the data entry, including collar data, survey data, drill logs, assay data, etc.

## 1 4 . 0 D A T A V E R I F I C A T I O N

Carpathian geological staff have made a strong commitment to the geological and assay database and have, as far as is possible, produced a database that is complete, well documented and traceable.

## 14.1 AMEC assessment 2007

As part of  the  independent  expert  review,  AMEC  conducted  the following  verification  checks  on  the Rovina Property:

- Site visits;
- Review of the geological and mineralization interpretations;
- Geological model;
- Review of the exploration programs;
- Review of  data  that  support  the  resource  model.  The  review  covered  drill  core  samples including  drill  site  inspection,  drill  collar  coordinates,  drill  core  inspection,  review  of  core logging,  sampling  and  assay  protocols  and  methods,  and  review  of  sample  security measures and sample storage;
- Review of QA/QC data protocols and methods, data validation.

According to the AMEC NI43-101 report dated May 2007, Mr. Thomas of AMEC visited the property in 2007and Mr. Cinits also of AMEC visited the site in 2006. The 2007 site visit by AMEC covered the following items:

- overview  of  the  geology  and  exploration  history  of  the  Colnic  and  Rovina  Porphyries (presented by Carpathian geologists, Randy Ruff, Barbara Stefanini, and Sorin Halga);
- current exploration program design (drill hole orientation, depth, number of holes, etc.);
- visits to operating drill rig and drill hole collars at the Colnic and Rovina Porphyries;
- drill rig procedures including core handling;
- surveying (topography, collar and downhole deviations);
- sample collection protocols;
- sample transportation and sample chain of custody and security;
- core recovery;
- QA/QC program (insertion of standards, blanks, duplicates, etc.);
- inspection of the ALS Chemex laboratory at Gura Rosiei;
- laboratory sample preparation and analytical procedures;
- review  of  diamond  drill  core,  core  logging  sheets  and  core  logging  procedures  (selected core from eight representative drill holes from Colnic and four drill holes from Rovina).  The review included commentary on typical lithologies, alteration and mineralization styles and crosscutting relationships;
- density sampling;
- management of geological and geotechnical data and database structure.

During  the  2007  visit,  30  quarter-core  samples  (20  from  Colnic  and  10  from  Rovina)  and  one  pulp duplicate sample were collected by AMEC.  The appropriate control samples were inserted by AMEC and the samples were submitted to ALS Chemex (Carpathian's principal laboratory) in Gura Rosiei, Romania.  From these character samples, AMEC concluded the following:

…that the general range of values returned by the AMEC samples correspond well with those reported from previous exploration programs, and at the completion of the site visit, AMEC is confident that the general range of gold and copper values reported from drilling by Carpathian are representative of the values that can be expected from these deposits.

AMEC visited the drill rig on 21 January 2007, and took hand-held GPS coordinates of six drill hole collars in order to approximately verify a selection of Carpathian's collar coordinates.  The two sets of coordinates  corresponded  reasonably  well  with  the  differences  within  the  level  of  accuracy  to  be expected from hand-held GPS measurements.

## 14.1.1 Database validation by AMEC 2007

AMEC verified the coordinate locations of the drill hole collars by comparing the original spreadsheet of drill  hole  collar  coordinates  from  the  survey  contractor  with  the  drill  hole  collars  entered  into  the database.

AMEC randomly selected 5% of the downhole surveys from 5% of the drill holes entered in the drill hole  database  and  manually  checked  them  against  hard  copies  of  the  original  down-hole  survey records from the drill contractor.

AMEC verified the drill hole assay database by manually checking a randomly selected 5% of all hard copies  of  the  original  assay  certificates  against  the  assays  entered  in  the  database. AMEC  also manually checked the highest 5% of copper and gold assays in the database against hard copies of the original laboratory certificates.

At the completion of the database review, AMEC found the database to be acceptably accurate and error-free to be used in mineral resource estimation.

## 14.2 PEG Assessment 2008

## 14.2.1 Site visit by PEG

Mr. Pierre Desautels visited the Rovina Property, accompanied by Randy Ruff, Carpathian's Executive Vice President, Exploration, between August 26th and August 30th, 2008.

The 2008 site visit entailed brief reviews of the following:

- Overview  of  the  geology  and  exploration  history  of  the  Colnic  and  Rovina  Porphyries (presented by Carpathian geologists, Randy Ruff and Barbara Stefanini);
- Current exploration program design (drill hole orientation, depth, number of holes, etc.);
- Visits  to  operating  drill  rig  and  drill  hole  collars  at  the  Colnic,  Rovina  and  Ciresata Porphyries accompanied by Sorin Halga;

- Drill rig procedures including core handling on site;
- Surveying (topography, collar and downhole deviations);
- Sample collection protocols at the core logging facility;
- Sample transportation and sample chain of custody and security;
- Core recovery;
- QA/QC program (insertion of standards, blanks, duplicates, etc.);
- Review of diamond drill core, core logging sheets and core logging procedures. The review included commentary on typical lithologies, alteration and mineralization styles, and contact relationships at the various lithological boundaries;
- Density sample collection;
- Geological  and  geotechnical  database  structure  and  all  procedures  associated  with populating the final assay database with information returned from the laboratory.

Other  than  the  Colnic,  Rovina  and  Ciresata  Deposits,  none  of  the  other  target  areas  previously explored by Carpathian on the Rovina Property were visited.

During  the  2008  visit,  PEG  collected  3  quarter-core  character  samples,  one  for  each  deposit  and retained full custody of the sample from the Rovina Valley to the PEG office in Barrie Ontario where the samples were shipped to Activation Laboratories Ltd. located at 1428 Sandhill Drive, Ancaster, Ontario. The main intent of analysing these samples is to confirm the gold and copper presence on the deposit by an independent laboratory not previously used by Carpathian.   These samples were analysed for gold by 50 g fire assay with AA finish and total copper using ICP.

From the assay results shown in Table 14-1 PEG concluded that the general range of values returned by the PEG samples correspond well with those reported by Carpathian.

Table 14-1 PEG character sample results

|   PEG Sample Nb |   Au (ppb) |   Cu (%) | Carpathian Nb   |   Au (g/t) |   Cu (ppm) |   Au diff (g/t) |   Cu Diff % |
|-----------------|------------|----------|-----------------|------------|------------|-----------------|-------------|
|           00901 |       2000 |    0.95  | RRD12257        |       2.27 |       9720 |            0.27 |       0.022 |
|           00902 |       1850 |    0.424 | RCD1514         |       1.75 |       4720 |           -0.1  |       0.048 |
|           00903 |       1220 |    0.225 | RGD4408         |       1    |       1900 |           -0.22 |      -0.035 |

Core handling was found to be very efficient.   The core is collected on site daily and brought to the Carpathian office in Criscior where is it immediately laid out on a large table, measured and marked for sampling and prepared for photograph.  Core is cut with a diamond saw and sampled prior to logging.

The insertion of the purchased standard, pulp blank, coarse blank and pulp duplicate in the sampling chain  was  observed  during  the  core  logging  facility  visit. The  gold  and  copper  assay  standards observed on-site originated from the CDN resource Lab number CDN-CGS16, CDN-CGS13 and CDNCM3. Other gold standards from Rocklabs and copper standards from Geostats PTY Ltd are also used.

Geologists  responsible  for  logging  the  core  can  roughly  estimate  (high/low)  the  grade  of  the  core visually by the chalcopyrite content, the stockwork intensity and to a lesser extent the alteration.  Sharp contacts are often seen at the lithological boundaries (depending on the unit) as long as the contact

has not been obscured by the alteration.   For example, during the core review at Rovina, the contact between the PoB and PoC was transitional over a distance of 7 metres while the contact between the Glam Breccia and PoC was sharp.  The alteration boundaries are more difficult to pinpoint due to the overprinting of multiple alteration phases.   Carpathian geologists commented on the K2/K3 boundary that  can  be  determined  within  -  3-5  metres  accuracy  while  the  Argillic/phyllic  contact  can  be determined to -1metre accuracy. Phyllic and K2 boundary is usually sharp.

Figure 14-1 displays a few photographs taken during the site visit.

## 14.2.2 Database validation

Following the site visit and prior to the resource evaluation, PEG carried out an internal validation of the drill  holes  in  the  Rovina  Valley  database  used  in  the  September  2008  resource  estimate. Data validation has been done by AMEC in 2006 and 2007 prior to the completion of the 2007 drill campaign and did not  include  any  of  the  2008  drill  data.   The  hole  selection  for  PEG's  validation  was  heavily weighted on the 2007/2008 drilling with spot checks of the earlier holes verified by AMEC.  A total of 46 holes were partially or completely validated amounting to 10,938 individual samples out of a total of 61,329 (17.8%) were either checked against paper copies of the original signed certificate or against the electronic version of the certificate provided by the issuing laboratory.

## 14.2.3 Collar coordinate Validation

Collar coordinates were validated with the aid of a hand-held Garmin GPSmap model 60CSx. A series of collars were randomly selected and the GPS position was recorded.  The difference with the Gems database was calculated in a X-Y 2D plane with the following formula:

<!-- image -->

As shown on Table 14-1, results indicated an average difference in the X-Y plane of 10.2 metres for the nine holes where the instrument was located on the monument and 20.2 metre in the Z-plane.   The overall average difference of the eighteen hole surveyed amounted to 11.0 metres in the X-Y plane and 22.4  metres  in  the  Z-plane.   Elevation  difference  is  normal  as  the  hand  held  GPS  are  notoriously inaccurate in elevation.   The differences seen are well within the accuracy of the hand held GPS unit used.  The instrument reported an 'accuracy' between 3.5 to 9 metres at most field locations surveyed which is typically influenced by vegetation cover and number of satellites seen on the day the survey was taken.

## 14.2.4 Down-hole survey validation

The  down-hole  survey  data  was  validated  by  searching  for  large  discrepancies  between  dip  and azimuth reading against the previous reading.   A total of 1515 readings were evaluated. Holes were separated  weather  they  were  collared  vertically  or  at  an  angle  and  absolute  differences  were calculated.  Any measurements with a difference exceeding the 99 percentile was considered suspect and forwarded to Dr. Barbara Stefanini for review.

Results  indicated  10  values  for  the  angle  holes  and  4  values  required  further  validation.  Following review,  none were corrected as the database entry coincided with the down hole survey instrument value.

## 14.2.5 Assay Validation

Assay validation proceeded in three steps,

- Validation of GEMS database entry against the PDF copies of the original signed laboratory certificated for a limited number of holes;
- Validation of the electronic version of the certificates against the Gems database entry.
- Electronic comparison of the database maintained by the Carpathian information technology (IT) department against the Micromine database maintained by Barbara Stefanini.

The validation against the original signed PDF copies of the certificate consisted of three holes RCD-1, RCD-10 and RRD-2 with 1083 assays re-typed in an XLS spreadsheet. No errors were found.

The validation against the electronic version of the certificates consisted of comparing the values on the  certificate  against  the  GEMS  database  entry.  The  39  certificates  were  requested  from  the  ALS Chemex (Carpathian's principal laboratory) in Gura Rosiei, Romania via Randy Ruff of Carpathian. ALS Chemex issued the requested certificates as a series of text files in SIF format directly to a PEG Email address without Carpathian's interaction.  A total of 13,030 assays results covering 43 drillholes were  compiled  from  the  certificates  onto  an  Excel  spreadsheet  and  matched  against  the  sample number in the GEMS database. A total of 3,175 QA/QC assays did not find a matching sample number in the GEMS database with the remaining 9,855 samples number successfully matched.

As  shown on Table 14-2,  out  of  the  9,855  only  two  gold  and  two  copper  entries  did  not  match  the certificate value as shown in Table 14-2 below.   Assay validation covers 16% of the entire database with a total of 27% coverage for the 2007-2008 data not previously validated by AMEC. Error rate was virtually 0%.

## 1 5 . 0 A D J A C E N T P R O P E R T I E S

One deposit within the Golden Quadrilateral area of Romania, in the immediate vicinity of the Property is at an advanced-stage exploration phase: the Certej deposit, located15 km southeast of Colnic, which is held by European Goldfields Ltd, and is in the permitting phase.  European Goldfields is expecting to receive  final  permit  approval  for  the  commencement  of  construction  in  2009.   Two  other  significant deposits are recognized in the area.   The Sacaramb deposit (3 km southeast of Certej) has been the subject of historical mining, and is also held by European Goldfields, whereas the Valea Morii deposit (12 km to the southwest of Colnic) is a known porphyry copper-epithermal gold-silver deposit.   The deposit locations were included in Figure 7-4.

## 15.1 Certej

Mineralization at Certej occupies a sub-horizontal pipe-like zone, located across, and deformed around, the  Baiaga  Andesite.   It  is  localized  by  an  east-west  trending  dilatational  jog,  locally  offset  by  later north-south faulting.   Styles of mineralization recognized in the deposit to date include disseminated and breccia-hosted gold-silver, and vein-hosted base metal (- gold-silver) mineralization.   There are three main mineralized zones, Hondol, Baiaga and Dealul Grozii (Warries et al, 2006).

A Probable Reserve of 27.7 Mt at 2.0 g/t Au and 11.6 g/t Ag, using a gold price of US$425/oz and a silver  price  of  $7/oz  was  announced  in  April,  2006  (European  Goldfields  Ltd.,  2006a). European Goldfields  has  completed  in-house  pre-feasibility  studies,  that  have  confirmed  a  high-grade  gold flotation concentrate can be produced, that open pit mining, using a strip ratio of 2.6:1 is viable, and that there are appropriate sites for placement of infrastructure.  Mine production is envisaged at 3 Mt/a, over a 9-year mine life, producing approximately 249,000 t/a of concentrate with grades averaging 21 g/t  gold and 125 g/t silver, with a flotation gold recovery of approximately 88% (European Goldfields Ltd.,  2006a,  2006b, 2006c, 2006d).   From metallurgical testwork and process design for a definitive feasibility study, the proprietary Albion Process (X-Strata) is utilised for gold recovery whereby following ultra-fine grind, pyrite concentrates are subject to alkaline-solution oxidation prior to cyanide vat-leach for gold recovery (European Goldfields Ltd., 2008).

In  2006,  European Goldfields completed all necessary Environmental Impact Assessments (Levels I and  II),  a  Social  Impact  Assessment  Study  and  an  Archaeological  Study,  in  support  of  its  permit application to develop the Certej project (European Goldfields Ltd., 2007).   An environmental impact study  has  also  been  completed  during  2008. In  March  2007,  a  'Technical  Feasibility  Study'  was presented  to  the  Romanian  government,  in  support  of  development  permit  applications.   European Goldfields has finalized a definitive feasibility study and is well underway to the final permiting of the project, which they expect to receive in Q1-Q2, 09. (European Goldfields Ltd., 2008).

## 15.2 Sacaramb

The  historic  Sacaramb  deposit  (also  known  as  Nagyag  or  Szekeremb)  is  also  contained  within  the European Goldfields' Certej property.  When production ceased in 1935, about 85 t of combined silver and gold was reported to have been produced (Patrick and Jackson, 2004).

Epithermal gold-silver telluride mineralization is  developed in  Neogene andesite flows and breccias. Gold occurs as disseminations within breccias and in mineralised linear alteration zones  associated with fracturing and traditionally described as veins.  Bonanza high-grade zones at vein junctions formed pipe-like zones that have been mined to surface.   Over 230 individual mineralised veins are known, which have been traced along strike for up to 2,000 m, and down dip for 1,000 metres (Patrick and Jackson, 2004).

European  Goldfields  drill-tested  the  deposit  in  2002,  and  partially  sampled  seven  levels  of  historic workings, as part of an assessment of the open pit potential of the deposit (Patrick and Jackson, 2004).

## 15.3 Valea Morii

The  Valea  Morii  deposit  comprises  earlier  porphyry  copper-gold  and  later  epithermal  gold-silver mineralization associated with a shallow subvolcanic body of andesitic to dioritic composition (Grancea et al., 2001).  The top of the porphyry copper system is crosscut by low-sulphidation epithermal veins, with a paragenetic sequence from early veining related to propylitic alteration, followed by a second composite  stage,  characterized  by  the  emplacement  of  barren,  centimetre-thick,  quartz-rich  veins followed by millimetre-thick quartz-rich Cu-Au mineralized veins.  This porphyry-related stockwork-style mineralization  is  partly  overprinted  by  quartz  -  calcite  -  barite  epithermal  veins,  hosting  Au-Ag mineralization (Rosetti et al, 1999; Andre-Meyer et al., 2001).

Preliminary  metallurgical  testwork  was  initiated  at  SGS  Lakefield  Research  (Lakefield)  in  the  third quarter of 2006 and consisted of flotation testwork for copper and gold, and cyanide leaching for gold on  samples  from  the  Rovina  and  Colnic  deposits. Three  composite  samples  were  prepared  to represent expected 'typical' material; the samples selected are summarized in the following table.  Two samples were from the Colnic porphyry (RCD series) and one from the Rovina porphyry (RRD series) and are comprised of quarter HQ core material.

Additional testwork is underway on samples from the Ciresata deposit as well as the Colnic and Rovina deposits,  but  results  are  not  yet  available.  Mineralogical  (Qemscan)  indications  to  date  are  that  the Ciresata samples may be metallurgically similar to Colnic.

Mineral resource estimates have been completed by PEG for Carpathian's Rovina-Apuseni porphyry gold  copper  property. The  three  deposits  are  located  in  the  Golden  Quadrilateral  of  the  Apuseni Mountains in Western Romania centered approximately at latitude 46°07' N and longitude 22° 54' E, 140 km East-Northeast of the city of Timisoara.  The closest settlement is the village of Criscior located less than 10 kilometres from the deposits.

Gemcom software GEMS 6.41™ was used for the resource estimate in combination with Sage 2001 for the variography.   The metals of interest at Rovina Valley are copper and gold.   Minor amounts of zinc and molybdenum are also present.

Carpathian provided the digital data files as a series of XLS spreadsheets.   Rovina and Colnic data was  provided  in  August  2008  and  Ciresata  was  provided  in  October  2008. The  digital  data  files consisted of drill hole collar, survey, lithology, alteration and assay tables along with 3D triangulations representing the latest interpretation for the lithological  and alteration units.   Topographical  surfaces were also provided.

As shown in Table 17-1, for Rovina the data cut-off date was April 08 th , 2008 and consisted of 53 holes that were used in the resource estimation.  One hole was abandoned due to poor ground condition and six additional holes, drilled after the cut-off date, were not used.  Of those six holes, three showed weak mineralization on the periphery of the deposit and three holes encountered good mineralization in the PoC unit.   For Colnic, all 87-drill holes were used in the resource estimation.   Ciresata drilling was in progress in late summer 2008.   A total of 15 holes were included in the resource.   For the resource estimate, the cut-off date for Colnic and Ciresata was October 15 th ,  2008.   None of the holes in the database had pending assays and none of the historial drill holes were incorporate in the drill database. Table 17-1 summarizes the number of holes used in the resource estimate.  A full listing of the holes used in the resource estimate is located in appendix A.

The  three deposits on the Rovina  Valley project were  divided into several lithological units superimposed in various alteration phases.

## 17.1 Geological Interpretation

For all deposits a series of 3D wireframes models were provided by Carpathian consisting of a detailed lithology  model and a separate alteration model based on the dominant alteration logged in the drill core. The  alteration  is  typically  complex  with  more  than  one  overprinting  alteration  type  present. Where a number of alteration  phases  coexist,  the  dominant  alteration  type  was  assigned  a  logging code based on mineralogy and intensity that were grouped into units from which the alteration model was created.

Carpathian  geologists  first  modeled  the  deposit  on  series  of  cross  sections,  followed  by  a  series  of longitudinal sections and plans.   The lithological and alterations boundaries were adjusted to coincide in  all  three  orientations. The  paper  sections  and  plans  were  then  digitized  on  the  computer,  tied together and wireframed in 3D.  The complete list of the lithology and alteration wireframe is shown in Table 17-2.

The lithology and alteration solids are shown in Figures 17-1 to 17-6.   PEG validated the completed solids for interpretational consistency.   The solids honour the drill hole data and interpreted geology. The solids were used to code the drill hole data prior to final domain definition.  Identical colour profiles were assigned to the solids and drill hole data and the two datasets were visually inspected on sections and plans to ensure the proper assignment of domains to drill holes.

## 17.2 Exploratory Data Analysis

Exploratory  data  analysis  is  the  application  of  various  statistical  tools  to  characterize  the  statistical behaviour  or  grade  distributions  of  the  data  set. In  this  case,  the  objective  is  to  understand  the population  distribution  of  the  grade  elements  in  the  various  units  through  the  use  of  such  tools  as histograms, descriptive statistics, probability plots and contact profiles.

Statistical analysis of the data was performed on each of the lithology and alteration units and also the combination of lithology + alteration units in order to assist in the selection of the statistical domains used in the interpolation.

## 17.2.1 Domain Definition

For all three deposits, the delineation of the statistical domains was based primarily on field information gathered from the project geologists along with an examination of the drill core.  It also relied heavily on the following statistical tools for confirmation of the field observation:

- Mean  value  statistics  by  lithology,  alteration  and  a  combination  of  the  lithology  and alteration units;
- Box plots statistics by lithology alteration and a combination of the lithology and alteration units;
- Contact profiles to assist in understanding the grade distribution at the boundaries between the different units;
- Analysis  of  variance  (ANOVA)  which  assisted  sorting  the  low-grade  lithological/alteration combination units from the high-grade units.

Results pertaining to the domain definition of the Rovina, Colnic and Ciresata deposits described below are located in Appendix A.

## Rovina

The box plots for Gold and Copper by lithology shows PoB, PoC and PoD as separate entities with higher values for copper.  While the PoE unit could fall in that group as well, it is not as clearly defined.

The box plots by alterations show the MACE, POT and SILICIC alteration as a separate domain for both Gold and Copper.   Note that the SILICIC alteration is located only below the MACEB alteration unit.

The  box  plot  with  the  combined  alteration  and  lithology  codes  shows  some  dominant  features  but ranking  them  properly  is  difficult. The  analysis  of  variance  (ANOVA)  was  used  to  assist  in  the separation  of  the  combination  domains.   While  this  statistical  tool  functions  optimally  with  normally distributed data, it was used in this study as a guide for the classification, cross-referencing with the box  plot  and  mean  data.  During  the  ANOVA  analysis  a  table  was  produced  showing  the  critical difference  in  the  variance  within  the  group  pairs  along  with  the  calculation  of  their  significance  (P value).   A second table is then produced that calculates subsets of the grouping variable, which are significantly different from each other.

08CARP0100\_REP00

From the information obtained during the site visit, the box plot, the mean values, and the analysis of variance, the following conclusions were reached:

- The  Lithological  units  appear  to  have  the  most  weight  in  determining  the  grade  of  the deposit however, the MACE and POT alteration cannot be discounted as the best grade is located in the MACE;
- The KSIL alteration is deep-seated affecting only the POE lithological unit;
- It was  impossible  to  group  the  MACE  alteration  in  its  own  domain  encompassing  all lithologies. Each lithological unit in MACE forms its own separate domain due to relatively large grade variations between the Lithology/MACE combination units;
- GLAM is a brecciated unit with high-grade values in the clasts; this unit was treated as a separate domain.

The Rovina domains suggested by this work are:

## For Gold and Copper:

- OXIDE cap
- GLAM breccia
- PoA In all alteration
- IMB In all alteration - except MACE
- IMB in MACE
- PoB in MACE
- PoB in POT
- PoC In all alteration - except MACE and POT
- PoC in MACE
- PoC in POT
- PoD In all alteration - except MACE and POT
- PoD in MACE
- PoD in POT
- PoE (all in KSIL alteration)

## Colnic

The box plots for Gold by lithology shows C\_Por, Cd\_Por, IMB, F2\_Por and the PM\_Por clearly stand out as separate entities with higher gold values.  Copper values are similar except for the satellite area showing elevated copper values.  The CD\_Por is viewed as an extension of the C\_Por at depth even though the  grade is  generally  lower  in  this  unit.   The  Chubby  fault,  LM  and  LD  dike  show  elevated values and form their own domains.

08CARP0100\_REP00

The box plots sorted by alteration show with elevated values in the K alteration followed by K2\_MACE, K3  and  THRP.   The  distribution  for  Gold  and  Copper  is  similar  with  the  exception  of  the  K3\_ARG alteration located in the Satellite porphyry area, which shows elevated Copper values.

ANOVA was also used at Colnic to assist in the separation of the statistical domains

From the information obtained during the site visit, the box plot, the mean values, and the analysis of variance, the following conclusions were reached:

- The  Lithological  units  appear  to  have  the  most  weight  in  determining  the  grade  of  the deposit however the K, K2\_MACE and K3\_THRP alteration cannot be discounted;
- The F2\_POR and IMB are adjacent to each other with contact profiles suggesting a soft boundary. The mean  values are also very similar however, from the description '...magmatic foliations are also common, especially adjacent to the margins of the F2-Hill porphyry.'  It appears that the contact is fairly distinguishable in the core and therefore they were modeled as two separate domains;
- The PM\_POR is a low grade propylitic alteration plug inside the F2\_POR and shows sharp boundaries with all surrounding lithologies;
- Similar  to  Rovina,  the  K3\_ARG  and  PHILLIC  alteration  are  adjacent  to  each  other  and show a soft boundary for Gold (not for Copper).   Grades are  very low regardless  of  the lithological unit;
- The satellite porphyry area is located mostly in the K3\_ARG and PHYLLIC alteration, by using the lithology as the main control for the domains.  The Gold and Copper variation in the K3\_ARG and PHYLLIC alteration will be automatically honoured;
- In  3D  space,  the  K3  and  TRPH  alteration  are  adjacent  to  each  other.  Contact  profiles suggest  soft  boundaries  for  both  gold  and  copper.  They  were  therefore  treated  as  one alteration type for the domain definition.

The Colnic domains suggested by this work are:

- OXIDE cap
- C\_Por in K alteration
- C\_Por in K2\_MACE alteration
- C\_Por in K3 and THRP alteration
- PM\_POR plug
- F2\_Por in all alteration except K2\_MACE and K3+THRP combination
- F2\_Por in K2\_MACE alteration
- F2\_Por in K3 and THRP alteration combination
- IMB in all alteration except K, K2\_MACE and K3+THRP combination
- IMB in K alteration
- IMB in K2\_MACE alteration
- IMB in K3 and THRP alteration

- WR\_Por in all alteration except K, K2\_MACE and K3+THRP combination
- WR\_Por in K2\_MACE alteration
- WR\_Por in K3 and THRP alteration
- SED in all alteration

## Satellite porphyry area:

- G\_Por in all alteration
- S\_BX in all alteration
- S\_POR  in all alteration

Pre and post mineralized dikes and faults have their own separate domains

- FLT - Chubby fault
- LD - Mostly barren dike
- LM - medium to high grade late mineralized dike swarm

## Ciresata

At  Ciresata  the  lithological  and  alteration  domains  were  much  simpler  with  an  EM\_P  central  core surrounded  by  SED  and  cut  by  late  mineralized  (LM)  dikes.   Alteration  is  simple  with  a  high  grade potassic (K) central core surrounded by a phyllic halo.

The Ciresata domains were defined by simply combining the lithology and the alteration.   The Late mineralized dikes were grouped together in one domain.  The final domains were defined as follow:

- EM\_P in K alteration
- EM\_P in PH alteration
- SED in K alteration
- SED in PH alteration

Late-mineralize dikes

- LM\_P in all alteration

## 17.2.2 Assays

Table 17-3 shows the assay mean values for the different statistical domains. The gold and copper distribution in the Rovina valley can be described as follows:

- Rovina is a copper/gold deposit with CU:AU ratio of 3:1;
- Colnic is a gold rich with minor copper with a AU:CU ratio of 5.4:1;
- Ciresata is also gold rich with minor copper with a AU:CU ratio of 4.8:1.

## 17.2.3 Capping

In  a  resource  model  high  grade  outliers  can  contribute  excessively  to  the  total  metal  content  of  the deposit.   The  treatment  of  outliers  at  Rovina,  Colnic  and  Ciresata  was  based  on  3  methodologies, decile analysis, histograms and grade capping curves.  A decile is any of the nine values that divide the sorted data into ten equal parts so that each part represents one tenth of the sample or population.

Typically, in a decile analysis capping is warranted if:

- The last decile has more than 40% of metal or;
- The last decile contains more than 2.3 times the metal quantity contained in the one before last or;
- The last centile contains more than 10% of metal or;
- The  last  centile  contains  more  than  1.75  times  the  metal  quantity  contained  in  the  one before last.

Each statistical  domain  was  evaluated  separately  for  Gold  and  Copper  and  a  combination  of  grade capping and search restriction imposed on a threshold values was used to restrict the influence of the outliers.   Results  shown  in  Appendix  C  indicate  that  with  a  few  exceptions,  no  grade  capping  was warranted for copper at Colnic and Ciresata due to the near normal distribution observed.  In all three deposits, gold required some form of restriction.  Due to the higher copper content, Rovina required a search restriction applied to the copper outliers.  Table 17-4 compares the analyses and tabulates the implemented level.

The search restriction size was based on a next block diamond pattern with a 25 metre radius from the block center at Rovina and 15 metre at Colnic and Ciresata.   The search restriction size is based on the  resource  model  matrix  size.   With  a  search  restriction,  all  high-grade  samples  are  used  at  face value but their range of influence is limited to a very localized area.

## 17.2.4 Composites

Sampling  intervals  on  the  Carpathian  Rovina  Valley  property  average  1.0  metre. The  upper  third quartile of the sampling length shows a value close to 1.0 metre.  PEG evaluated composite intervals of 2.5, 5, and 10 metres via decile analysis, box plots and frequency distribution.  Results show that the grade distribution is largely unaffected by the change in composite length.  Figure 17-7 shows a typical grade distribution for composite sizes of 1.0 metre, 2.5 metre and 5.0 metre.   Results for Rovina and Ciresata are similar.

<!-- image -->

The  relative  frequency  distribution  in  Figure  17-8  clearly  shows  the  smoothing  effect  when  using  a larger  composite  size.   The  relative  frequency  graphs  shows  all  assessed  composite  intervals  plot within the same space.

From this work, PEG elected to use a composite length of 2.5 metres generating about four data points per block in the 10x10x10 metre block matrix at Rovina and 2 data points per block for the 5x5x5 metre block  matrix  for  Colnic  and  Ciresata. The  composite  size  also  allowed  grade  variations  to  be represented especially near the contact with the dikes at Colnic and Ciresata while producing a sample of proper support.  Assays were length-weighted averaged and any grade capping was applied to the raw assay data prior to compositing.

The 2.5 metre composite intervals were created in a downward fashion from the collar of the holes toward the hole bottoms re-setting the composite intervals at the lithological boundaries.   Composite remnants, which are composites less than 2.5 metres in length, are unavoidable with this methodology. Statistical analysis of the composite remnants indicates that in general, intervals less than 1.0 metre at Rovina, Colnic and Ciresata could be safely eliminated from the dataset without introducing a bias in the remaining composites.   Exceptions to that are at Colnic, in the G\_Por and PM\_Por, in the narrow zones comprised of the FLT, LD and LM units at Colnic and the LD unit at Ciresata where statistical analysis indicated a substantial drop in metal content would be occurring if the composite remnant less 1.0  are  eliminated.   For  these  units  a  threshold  of  0.6  metre  was  selected.  Figure  17-9  shows  an example  for the C\_POR+K3/THRP at Colnic where deleting composites less than 1 metre would only affect the metal content by less 0.5%.

Un-sampled intervals, gaps, and assays below detection limits did not exist in the database.  Any grade capping described in Section 17.2.3 was applied to the raw assays prior to compositing.

Summary statistics for composite grades are shown in Table 17-5.

## 17.3 Bulk Density

Carpathian's  database  contains  a  total  of  829  specific  gravity  (SG)  measurements.   The  sampling collection  averaged  1  measurement  per  66  metres,  80  metres,  and  99  metres  of  core  at  Rovina, Colnic, and Ciresata, respectively.

As mention earlier, the samples are sent to the ALS Laboratory at Gura Rosiei where all samples are dried, coated in a thin layer of lacquer or shellac before the samples are weighed in air (W1) and in water (W2).  The specific gravity is calculated using the standard formula:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

The  rock  types  found  at  Colnic  and  Rovina  are  generally  non-porous  and  therefore  PEG  is  of  the opinion that the specific gravity determinations are representative of the in-situ bulk density of the rock types, and sufficient for resource estimation purposes.

Results from the statistical study indicated that the alteration phases bear more control in the overall density of the deposit than the lithology; therefore, for Rovina, Colnic and Ciresata the density model was  constructed  by  assigning  the  average  density  value  of  the  alteration.   Any  cells  left  with  zero density  were  thereafter  initialized  to  the  average  density  of  the  deposit. Table  17-6  lists  the  bulk density values used in the various three deposits.

## 17.4 Spatial Analysis

Geostatisticians use a variety of tools to describe the pattern of spatial continuity, or strength of the spatial similarity of a variable with separation distance and direction.   The correlogram measures the correlation between data values as a function of their separation distance and direction.  If we compare samples that are close together, it is common to observe that their values are quite similar and the correlation  coefficient  for  closely  spaced  samples  is  near  1.0.   As  the  separation  between  samples increases,  there  is  likely  to  be  less  similarity  in  the  values  and  the  correlogram  tends  to  decrease toward 0.0.  The distance at which the correlogram reaches zero is called the "range of correlation" or simply the range.  The range of the correlogram corresponds roughly to the more qualitative notion of the  "range  of  influence"  of  a  sample;  it  is  the  distance  over  which  sample  values  show  some persistence or correlation.  The shape of the correlogram describes the pattern of spatial continuity.  A very rapid decrease near the origin is indicative of short scale variability.   A more gradual decrease moving away from the origin suggests longer scale continuity.

Using Sage 2001 software, directional  sample  correlograms  were  calculated  for  gold  and  copper  in each of the statistical domains outlined in section 17.2.1 along horizontal azimuths of 0, 30, 60, 90, 120,  150,  180,  210,  240,  270,  300  and  330  degrees. For  each  azimuth,  a  series  of  sample correlograms were also calculated at 30 degree dip increment and where necessary, at 15 degree dip increment. Lastly, a correlogram was calculated in the vertical direction.   Using the complete suite of correlograms, an algorithm determined the best-fit model.  This model is described by the nugget (C0) which was derived using down hole variograms; two nested structure variance contribution (C1, C2), ranges for the variance contributions and the model type (spherical or exponential).   After fitting the variance parameters, the algorithm then fits an ellipsoid to all ranges from the directional models for each structure.  The final models of anisotropy are given by the lengths and orientations of the axes of the ellipsoids.

Variography  was  attempted  for  all  lithological  and  alteration  combinations.  Generally,  the  best variograms  were  obtained  by  using  the  full  lithological  domains  discounting  the  alteration. For example, in Colnic the data for the lithological domain C\_Por in K, K2\_MACE and K3\_THRP alteration had  to  be  combined  to  provide  sufficient  data  points  and  an  area  of  greater  continuity  for  the variography to be conclusive.  PEG also ran a limited number of gold and copper indicator variograms to provide a second verification to the anisotropy range and angles.

All  anisotropy models generated by SAGE 2001 were visually inspected in Gems to compare output with the expected geological controls on the mineralization.  A variogram was considered inconclusive if the anisotropy range and angle did not appear to coincide with any known or expected trend in the mineralization.

Tables  17-7  and  17-8  summarize  the  results  of  the  variography  for  the  domains  that  returned  a conclusive variogram. The traditional exponential range R in the tables is defined as Gam(3R) = 0.95 * Sill  as  defined  by  the  first  edition  of  GSLIB  (Deutsch  and  Journel).   The  order  and  direction  of  the rotations around the 3 axes are given by:

- 1. The first rotation is around the Z axis.  The direction is given by the right hand rule.
- 2. The second rotation is around the rotated Y axis.  The direction is given by the right hand rule.
- 3. The third rotation is around the rotated Z axis.  The direction is given by the right hand rule.

## Rovina

In general terms, Rovina indicated a preferred continuity in the 300-330 degree azimuth with a near vertical dip.  Variography was conclusive for PoA, PoB, PoC, PoD and IMB domain.  Variography was inconclusive for the PoE Domain along with the OXYDE layer and the GLAM breccia due to a lack of data points.

## Colnic

Variograms for Colnic were not as consistent as Rovina due, in part, to the sub-domain subdivisions limiting the number of usable data points for each domain and also due to the circular configuration of some of the weekly drilled, external domains such as the SED unit.  Variography was conclusive for the C\_Por, IMB, WR\_POR and the late mineralized LM dike swarm.

Ciresata shows the best variograms in the EMP+PH domain however when the modelled anisotropy was illustrated in GEMS, the range and angles did not coincide with the expected geological controls and thus the variogram results were deemed inconclusive.  This is primarily due to the early stage drill coverage.

## 17.5 Resource Block Model

One  block  model  was  constructed  in  Gemcom's  GEMS  version  6.14™ software  for  each  of  the deposits.   For Rovina a 10x10x10 metre block size was selected based on open pit mining selectivity considerations. The 5x5x5 metre block size for Colnic was selected based upon consultation with the Engineering team on the project. The smaller block size at Colnic allows for enhanced definition of the grade surrounding the narrow dikes swarms and to model the small 'dike-like' satellite zone porphyry. It  was also based on a size that was suitable for a selective mining unit to extract mine 'ore' versus 'waste' with flexibility to incorporate an open pit with an underground mining scenario.  For Ciresata, a 5x5x5  metre  block  size  was  selected  based  on  mining  selectivity  in  a  bulk  underground  mining scenario.

The  block  model  matrix  for  all  three  deposits  was  defined  on  the  Romanian  Dealul  Piscului 1970/Stereo  70  coordinate  reference  system  with  no  rotation.  Table  17-9  lists  the  model  upper southeast corner and is defined on the block edge.

## Rovina

A Lithology model was assigned a code corresponding to the integer code of the lithological units.  An Alteration  model  was  assigned  a  code  corresponding  to  the  integer  code  of  the  POT  and  MACE alteration  units  these  two  models  were  exported  to  a  Microsoft  Access  (MSAccess)  database  along with the empty final domain model. The final domain code was constructed in Access using a dictionary replacement approach as outlined in section 17.2.1 of this report.   Codification was carried out in two passes - one for the main lithology/alteration combination and a second pass to handle the search ellipsoid orientation for the GLAM sub-domain north, east and west.   The final domain model was reimported  in  GEMS  and  verified  for  accuracy  against  the  wireframes. Table  17-10  lists  the  code replacement in the MSAccess manipulation.

## Colnic

At  Colnic  a  partial  (percent)  model  was  used  in  order  to  handle  dilution  associated  with  the  blocks overlapping the contact of the narrow LM dike swarm, the LD dike and the Chubby fault.  In the main model folder the domain code was created similarly to the Rovina model.   The lithology model was assigned a code corresponding to the integer code of the lithological units.   An Alteration model was assigned a code corresponding to the integer code of the K, K2-MACE, K3, K3-ARG, PHYLLIC and PROP alteration units.   These two models were exported to an MSAccess database along with the empty final domain model.

The final domain code was constructed in Access using a dictionary replacement approach as outlined in section 17.2.1 of this report.  Codification was carried out in one pass for the main lithology/alteration combination.  The final domain model was re-imported in GEMS and verified for accuracy against the wireframes.  Table 17-10 lists the code replacement in the MSAccess manipulation.

For the Dike model, the 3D wireframe for the LM, LD and Chubby fault were loaded in the GEMS's 3D environment and the domain models were updated directly from the wireframe along with a percentage of the block occupied by the wireframe.

## Ciresata

At Ciresata, a partial (percent) model was used in order to handle dilution for the blocks overlapping the contacts with the narrow four dikes.  The main domain code for Ciresata was considerably simpler than Rovina and Colnic.  The lithology model was assigned a code corresponding to the integer code of the lithological units.  An Alteration model was assigned a code corresponding to the integer code of the K alteration wireframe after initializing the entire model to a Phyllic alteration - code 12.  The final domain model was created by adding the lithological model code to the alteration domain code using a GEMS manipulation script for any blocks bearing a lithological code greater than 0.

For the Dike model, the 3D wireframe for the LM-P dikes was loaded in the GEMS's 3D environment and the lithology models were updated directly from the wireframe.  Two sub-domains were created to handle the change in azimuth of the search ellipsoids.  The final domain model was created by adding the lithological dike model code to the sub-domain model using a GEMS manipulation script.  A model containing the percentage of the block occupied by the wireframe was also updated directly from the 3D wireframe.

## 17.6 Interpolation Plan

The  interpolation  was  carried  out  in  multi-pass  approach  with  an  increasing  search  dimension interpolating only the blocks that were not interpolated in the earlier pass.   Ordinary kriging was used for all domains in Rovina and Colnic where the variography could be relied upon.  For domains where the  variography  was  inconclusive,  an  inverse  distance  cubed  methodology  was  employed  and  the value interpolated was written to the ordinary krige element in the model to differentiate it from the full inverse distance check model.

Grade interpolation at the domain boundaries relied upon results from the contact profile study.   The semi-soft  boundaries  between  some  of  the  domains  allow  the  interpolation  to  mix  the  sample population for the first most restrictive pass across domains boundaries.   On the subsequent passes, the  intermixing  of  the  sample  population  was  eliminated  to  prevent  smearing  of  'distant'  high-grade intercepts in one domain with the values in another.

The search ellipsoids orientation and dip were loosely based on the variography results and manually adjusted  to  coincide  with  the  geological  unit.  The  search  ranges  were  based  on  the  density  of  the diamond drilling for the first pass to a maximum range based on roughly 95% of the sill value (adjusted from the traditional exponential model).  Generally, the ratio between the major, semi-minor and minor axes were kept similar to the ratio of the three-variogram axis.   Where variography was inconclusive, the search ellipsoid dimension and orientation was based on the size and shape of the 3D wireframe.

## 17.7 Boundary Treatment

As part of the domain definition for the December 2008 resource model, PEG examined the contact relationship  between  the  individual  lithology/alteration  unit  combinations. Gold  and  copper  were treated separately for this study.

Average  grades  of  an  element  were  calculated  over  distance  from  a  'boundary'  between  two lithologies, two units/domains or two indicator values.   Contact relationships can be used to determine the inclusion or exclusion of sample data points used in the interpolation of one particular grade domain and also to assist in confirming geological interpretations.    A gradational contact (or soft boundary) generally allows the interpolation parameters to include a limited number of samples from the adjoining domain while a sharp contact (or hard boundary) will restrict the sample points used in the interpolation to its own domain.

Results from the analysis guided the inclusion (or exclusion) of the adjacent units in the interpolation plan for the various passes to reflect the hard/soft boundaries observed in the domain definition work.

For  all  three  deposits,  the  most  restrictive  pass  was  allowed  to  include  samples  from  the  adjacent domains with units displaying a soft or semi-soft boundaries.  For the subsequent passes 2 and 3, the composite used were restricted to their domains.

## Rovina

pass 1 = x, pass 2, 3 = o

A model in the block matrix called PassNb carries a code of 1, 2, 3 or 4 corresponding to the pass number when the block was interpolated to assist in the model classification. A second model to aid in the classification model (Closest\_Dist) holds the distance to the closest samples and was populated during the nearest neighbour interpolation.  The proportion of blocks interpolated in the various passes for each deposit are listed in Table 17-15

Finer detail on the interpolation plan varies with the deposit as describe below:

## Rovina

The interpolation plan for Rovina used ordinary kriging for the PoA, PoB, PoC, PoD and IMB domain and Inverse distance cube for the OXIDE layer.  The Glam breccia was interpolated using a probability model in order to handle the high grade clast within a waste matrix. The probability model was built using indicator cut-off of 0.30 g/t gold and 0.25% copper.  A value between 0 and 1 was interpolated in the gold and copper Indicator model representing the percentage of the block higher than the indicator value.  Two indicator grade models were interpolated using inverse distance cube for each element.

- A high-grade gold model using composites above the 0.30 g/t indicator value;
- A low-grade gold model using composites below the 0.30 g/t indicator value;
- A high-grade copper model using composites above the 0.25 % indicator value;
- A low-grade copper model using composites below the 0.25 % indicator value.

The final Glam grade was written back into the ordinary krige model by weighing the low-grade/highgrade model by the indicator model value.

A  full  inverse  distance  model  and  nearest  neighbour  model  was  also  interpolated  for  validation purposes.

## Colnic

The interpolation plan for Colnic used ordinary kriging for the C\_Por, WR\_Por, IMB and LM dike which carry  the  bulk  of  the  mineralization  at  Colnic.   Inverse  distance  cube  was  used  for  units  where  the variography was inconclusive for the low grade PM\_Por plug, F2\_Por, and the SED unit, all rocks in the satellite porphyry area namely G\_Por, S\_Bx and  S\_Por and the barren to weakly mineralized LD dike and  the  Chubby  fault.   For  these  domains,  results  for  the  inverse  distance  cube  interpolation  was written back in the ordinary krige model.  At Colnic a special pass 0 was interpolated in order to restrict the influence of the high-grade enrichment on the contact with the LM dikes swarm for the C\_Por and the IMB domain.  The search ellipsoid used for this special pass was oriented parallel to the dike and very narrow in the dip direction of the dikes.

At  Colnic,  the  LM,  LD  and  Chubby  faults  were  interpolated  separately  in  the  Dike  folder.  The  final model was calculated by weighting the dike grade with the grade in the ordinary krige model using the volume of the dike as a weighing factor according to the following formula:

If Dike Rock Code  &gt; 0 then

C = ((Dike AU grade * Dike Percent) + (Rock Au grade * (100 - Dike Percent)))/100

## Else

C = Rock AU grade

## End If

The calculated C value was written back in the ordinary krige Au model. An equivalent formula was used for copper.

A  full  inverse  distance  model  and  nearest  neighbour  model  were  also  interpolated  for  validation purpose.

## Ciresata

For Ciresata, in the EMP and SED domain, a special pass 0 was interpolated in order to isolate the high-grade enrichment on the contact with the dikes.   The search ellipsoid used for this special pass was oriented parallel to the dike very narrow in the Z direction.  The ellipsoid was slowly rotated in pass 1, 2 and 3 to eventually reach the general shape of the wireframe.

At Ciresata, the LM dike was interpolated separately in the Dike folder.  The final model was calculated by weighting the dike grade with the grade in the inverse distance model using the volume of the dike as a weighing factor according to the same formula used for Colnic.

For Ciresata, a full nearest neighbour model was also interpolated for validation purpose.

Tables 17-16, 17-17, 17-18 summarize the ellipsoid dimensions and orientation used in the different passes with full detail of the ellipsoid dimension definition located in appendix E.  The search restriction range imposed on the high grade outliers in some of the domains are described in the capping section (Section 17.2.3) of this report.

## 17.8 Mineral Resource Classification

Several factors are considered in the definition of a resource classification:

- Canadian Institute of Mining (CIM) requirements and guidelines;
- Experience with similar deposits;
- Spatial continuity;
- Confidence limit analysis;
- Geology.

No environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, socio-economic, marketing or other relevant issues are known to the author that may currently affect the estimate of mineral resources.  Mineral Reserves can  only  be  estimated  on  the  basis  of  an  economic  evaluation  that  is  used  in  a  Pre-feasibility  or Feasibility  Study  of  a  mineral  project,  thus  no  reserves  have  been  estimated. As  per  NI  43-101, mineral resources, which are not mineral reserves, do not have demonstrated economic viability.

Four confidence categories exist in the model.  The usual CIM guidelines of Measured, Indicated and Inferred classes are coded 1, 2 and 3 respectively.   A special code 4 called 'potential' mineralization represents mineralization that was considered too far away from the existing drilling to be classified as inferred resource.  As per NI43-101 guidelines, the tonnage and grade for the potential mineralization is not included in this report.

Typically, confidence level for a grade in the block model is reduced with the increase in the search ellipsoid  size  along  with  the  diminishing  restriction  on  the  number  of  samples  used  for  the  grade interpolation.  This is essentially controlled via the pass number of the interpolation plan describe in the previous  section. A  common  technique  is  to  categorize  a  model  based  on  the  pass  number  and distance to the closest sample.

For  the  Carpathian  deposits,  PEG  elected  to  classify  the  mineral  resource  primarily  using  the  Pass number  from  the  interpolation  plan  with  assistance  from  a  drill  holes  density  map  and  the  actual position of the drill holes in order to minimize having blocks in the measured category in close proximity with blocks in the inferred category. The two additional models used in the categorisation were created as follows:

- A  model  in  the  block  model  matrix  representing  the  drill  position  (Inside\_DDH)  was  first created  by  assigning  the  percentage  of  the  blocks  inside  a  50  metre  extruded  drillhole trace. The model contains values from 0 to 100% representing the volume occupied by the extruded  drill  hole  trace  where  100%  means  the  block  is  fully  within  the  trace  of  the drillhole;
- A  second  model  called  NBHoles  representing  the  drill  density  was  created  in  the  block model matrix containing the number of drillholes that are visible from a given block. The model contains values from 0 to 15 representing the number of drillholes visible within a 75 metre  search  bubble  from  the  block  center  for  Rovina  and  Colnic. This  distance  was expanded to 100 metres for Ciresata in consideration of the high grade intercepts at the bottom of the drill holes.

| Pass 1        | Measured if Number of DDH >= 7                                                | Indicated if Number of DDH < 7                                              |
| Pass 2        | Indicated if number of DDH >= 2 and  block is > 25% within a drill hole trace | Inferred if number of DDH < 2 and block is <  25% within a drill hole trace |
| Pass 3        | Inferred if the number of DDH > 0                                             | Potential mineralization if Nb of DDH = 0                                   |

On the basis of the criteria outlined in Table 17-19, on average, for Rovina and Colnic, 1% of the blocks estimated  are  classified  as  Measured,  19%  of  the  blocks  are  Indicated  and  28%  of  the  blocks  are Inferred.  The  remaining  blocks  are  either  non-interpolated  or  listed  as  potential  mineralization.   For Ciresata, due to the early stage exploration the entire resource was downgraded to Inferred. Table 1720 shows the distribution of the resource classification by deposits.

## 17.9 Metal Equivalent Formula

Metal equivalent value is calculated as follows:

- 1. For each element, a factor is calculated:
- a) For Copper (expressed in %):

Factor = Net Metal Price * Recovery * (Conversion % to lbs * 100)

- b) For Gold (expressed in g/t):

Factor = Net Metal Price * Recovery * Conversion grms to oz

Recoveries were assumed at 100% until the completion of the ongoing metallurgical test work.

- 2. For all elements, the value per tonne is calculated in US$:

Value/tons = grade * factor

- 3. Total MV is the addition of the Value per tons expressed in US$ for each element:

MV = Value/tons Cu + Value/tons Au

The copper equivalent for Rovina is calculated by dividing the MV by the copper price and multiplying by the % to pound conversion factor.

The gold equivalent for Colnic and Ciresata is calculated by dividing the MV by the gold price and then dividing by the grams to ounces conversion factor.

Table 17-21 below lists the price and recoveries used in the calculation.

Conversion factors used are:

- % to pounds per short ton multiply by 22.04622;
- ppm to % multiply by 0.0001;
- grams to troy ounces multiply by 0.03215074 or (1/ 31.1034768).

Table: 17-21 MV Input Parameters

| Metal in Model   | Metal price Unit   | Metal Price   | Recovery   |
|------------------|--------------------|---------------|------------|
| Copper (%)       | US$/lb             | $1.80         | 100%       |
| Gold (g/t)       | US$/troy oz        | $675          | 100%       |

## 17.10  Mineral Resource Tabulation

Effective September 30, 2008, PEG has estimated the Mineral Resource for each of the Colnic, Rovina and Ciresata porphyry deposits, utilizing approximately 62,700 m of diamond drill hole data from the 2006,  2007  and  2008  drilling  campaigns. The  resource  estimate  takes  into  account  all  drilling information for the Rovina up to the end of April 8 th , 2008 and on the Colnic and Ciresata deposit up to the middle of October 15 th , 2008.

The Rovina resource estimate comprises measured, indicated and inferred resources reported as CuAu mineralization with a base case cut-off grade of 0.30% copper equivalent ('Cu eq').   For Colnic, resource  estimate  comprises  of  measured,  indicated  and  inferred  resources  reported  as  Au-Cu mineralization with a base case cut-off grade of 0.45 g/t gold equivalent ('Au eq').  As stated earlier, at Ciresata the resource comprises of inferred mineralization only with a base case cut-off grade of 0.70 g/t Au eq.

The  base  case  cut-off  grades  chosen  for  each  respective  deposit  were  determined  by  giving consideration to the characteristics of each deposit, envisioned mining methods, approximate mining and milling costs derived from internal studies as well as comparable porphyry-type deposits, results from early metallurgical test work and the reasonableness to be potentially economic.

Table 17-22 summarizes the weighted average result of the resource estimate for all three porphyry deposits the Rovina Valley Project. The total Measured + Indicated Resource is 5.09 Moz Au eq and the total Inferred Resource is 5.66 Moz Au eq.

- *Au eq. determined by using a gold price of US$675 per ounce and a copper price of US$1.80/lb as defined by PEG.  Metallurgical recoveries are not taken into account.
- Base case cut-offs used in the table are 0.45 g/t Au eq. for the Colnic deposit, 0.70 g/t Au eq. for the Ciresata deposit and for 0.30% Cu. eq. for the Rovina deposit.
- Rounding of tonnes as required by reporting guidelines  may result in apparent differences between tonnes, grade and contained metal content.

## 17.11  Block Model Validation

The Rovina Valley grade models were validated by three methods:

- 1. Visual  comparison  of  colour-coded  block  model  grades  with  composite  grades  on section plots.
- 2. Comparison  of  the  global  mean  block  grades  for  ordinary  kriging,  inverse  distance, nearest neighbour models, composite grades and raw assay grades.
- 3. Comparison using grade profiles or swath plots in the X, Y and Z directions inspecting the results for local bias in the estimate.

## 17.11.1 Visual Comparisons

The visual comparisons of block model grades with composite grades show a reasonable correlation between the values.  No significant discrepancies were apparent from the sections reviewed.

## 17.11.2 Global Comparisons

The grade statistics for the raw assay grade, composite grade, ordinary kriging, nearest neighbour and inverse  distance  models,  are  tabulated  below  in  Table  17-25.   Figures  17-10  and  17-11  graph  the differences. Grade  statistics  for  composite  mean  grade  compared  very  well  to  raw  assay  grade indicating the uniformity of the grade distribution throughout the deposit.  The block model mean grade when compared against the composites shows a fairly steep reduction in values for gold and copper primarily due to the wireframe extending at or beyond the limit of the drilling which introduce a series of un-interpolated blocks that are taken into consideration when comparing grade globally at 0.0 cut-off. The global comparison was extended to include only the main ore bearing horizons which includes PoB and Poc for Rovina, C\_Por, F2\_Por and WR\_Por in K2\_MACE and in K3+THRP alteration, IMB in K, in K2\_MACE and in K3+THRP alteration, FLT and LM\_Por for Colnic and EMP and SED in K alteration for Ciresata.

Globally,  the  nearest  neighbour,  inverse  distance  and  ordinary  krige  model  all  compare  very  well indicating that no global bias was introduce during the kriging process.

## 17.11.3 Local Comparisons- Swath Plots

PEG verified the models local trends in the grade estimates (grade slice or swath checks).   This was done by plotting the mean values from the nearest-neighbour estimate versus the inverse distance and ordinary kriged results.  Swath plots were generated at 50 metre intervals in the X and Y direction and 25 metre vertically at Rovina.  At Colnic the swath sizes were 37, 40 and 42 metres respectively in the X, Y and Z direction and for Ciresata the swath sizes were 37, 43 and 35 metres respectively in the X, Y and Z direction.

The unrestricted  kriged  estimate  should  be  smoother  than  the  nearest-neighbour  estimate,  thus  the nearest-neighbour estimate should fluctuate around the kriged estimate on the plots.

In General, the swath plots show good agreement with all three methodologies with no major local bias. At Colnic, the resource model appears to return higher grade in the northeast corner of the deposit than the composite data possibly indicating smearing of the high-grade values.  This trend, more than likely, results from the presence of the LD dike which would significantly lower the composite average in that region and the reduce data coverage in the newly discovered satellite area of the model.  At Ciresata, the southeast corner shows the same behaviour which can be attributed to the low data density.

It is interesting to note that both Colnic and Ciresata swath plots shows a gradual increase in grade at depth.

## 17.12  Block Model Comparison with the Previous Resource Estimate

The December 2008 resource estimate was compared with the figure listed in Table 17-18 for Colnic and Table 17-19 for Rovina of the AMEC report dated May 27, 2007.  The gold and copper equivalent cut-off was determined using a gold price of $US550 per ounce and a copper price of $1.30 per pound. Metallurgical  recoveries  were  not  taken  into  account  by  AMEC  and  the  resource  figures  were constrained within a conceptual pit shell.  In contrast, PEG used $US675 per ounce for gold and $1.80 per pound for copper.   Volumes and tonnages were compiled for the PEG December 2008-resource estimate from the overburden surface down to the bottom of the block model.   Table 18-1 lists  the differences between resource statements:

Table 17-27 Differences between resource statements

| Item                 | AMEC (December 31 2006)   | PEG (November 17 2008)   |
|----------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|
| Gold price           | $US550 per ounce          | $US675 per ounce         |
| Copper price         | $1.30 per pound           | $1.80 per pound          |
| Recovery             | Not taken into account    | Not taken into account   |
| Conceptual pit shell | Yes                       | No                       |

Because  of  these  differences,  the  comparison  in  this  section  is  intended  to  present  an  order  of magnitude only.

## Rovina

A  CuEq  cut-off  of  0.25  was  selected  to  compare  the  results  with  the  AMEC  December  31,  2006 estimate.

Results shown in Table 18-2 indicated a relocation of 103.94 million tonnes from the inferred category to the measure and indicated category with a corresponding decrease in the inferred category between PEG and AMEC of 91.46 million tonnes with a net change of 12.45 million tonnes.   Gold and copper values compare well between AMEC 2006 and PEG 2008.   Total gold metal content increase in the measure  and  indicated  category  by  1.05  million  ounces  coupled  with  a  decrease  in  the  inferred category of 0.92 with a net change of 0.13 million ounces.   Total copper metal content increased by 594 million pounds in the measure and indicated category with a decrease of 567 million pounds in the inferred category resulting in a net change of 27 million pounds.

The differences can be explained by:

- Carpathian added 30 new holes or 14,940 metres of additional drilling at Rovina.  The new holes  allowed  the  re-classification  of  the  AMEC  inferred  resources  to  measured  and indicated;
- Differences  in  the  gold  and  copper  price  were  used  for  the  equivalency  formula.  Using higher prices moves material from an upper grade bin to a lower grade bin;
- The pit constraint used by AMEC probably accounted for a portion of the net change since it  more than likely eliminated mineralization at depth that PEG believes could possibly be extracted using a drop pit near the end of the mine life.

## Colnic

A  AuEq  cut-off  of  0.25  was  selected  to  compare  the  results  with  the  AMEC  December  31,  2006 estimate.

Results shown in Table 18-3 indicated an increase of 64.5 million tonnes in the measure and indicated category and an increase in the inferred category between PEG and AMEC of 37.5 million tonnes with a net change of 102 million tonnes.  Gold grade is lower 0.1 g/t in the PEG model in the measured and indicated  category  and  is  also  lower  by  0.22  in  the  inferred  category.   Copper  values  compare  well between AMEC 2006 and PEG 2008 with minor differences.  Total gold metal content increase in the measure  and  indicated  category  by  0.90  million  ounces  and  0.37  million  ounces  in  the  inferred category with a net change of 1.27 million ounces. Total copper metal content increase by 115 million pound in the measure and indicate category and 89 million pound in the inferred category with 204 27 million pound. The differences can be explained by:

- Carpathian added 33 new holes or 11,592 metres of additional drilling at Colnic;
- Differences  in  the  gold  and  copper  price  used  for  the  equivalency  formula.  Using  higher prices moves material from an upper grade bin to a lower grade bin;
- The  pit  constraint  used  by  AMEC  probably  accounted  for  a  portion  of  the  increase especially in the inferred category;

The Rovina Exploration  Property  is  located  in  the  Golden  Quadrilateral  Mining  District  of  the  South Apuseni  Mountains  in West  Central  Romania,  approximately  300  km  northwest  of  the  city  of Bucharest, the Capital City of Romania and 140 km East-Northeast of the City of Timisoara.

The Carpathian Property centered at approximately latitude 46°05' N and longitude 22° 54'E comprises one  exploration  licence  and  lies  in  the  Development  Region  of  Transylvania,  within  the  County  of Hunedoara.   The property is controlled 100% through Carpathian's wholly owned subsidiary, SAMAX Romania  SRL,  by  an  agreement  with  the  Romanian  government  which  expires  August  29th,  2009. Carpathian has the exclusive right to extend this term three years.   The Rovina, Colnic and Ciresata Porphyry deposits are the principal exploration targets on the Property.

The principal targets on the Rovina Property are related to the porphyry copper-gold mineral deposit model. Porphyry  deposits  in  general  are  large,  low  to  medium-grade  deposits  in  which  primary (hypogene)  sulphide  minerals  are  dominantly  structurally-controlled  and  which  are  spatially  and genetically related to felsic to intermediate porphyritic intrusions.

The Rovina, Colnic and Ciresata deposits are associated with porphyritic subvolcanic intrusives and lie within a Northeastern outlier of the 8-10 km diameter, Neogene-aged, Brad-Barza volcanic field of the South  Apuseni  Mountains.   Gold-copper  mineralization  at  the  three  deposits  is  hypogene  with  the weathering/oxidation  profile  poorly  developed  and  usually  &lt;  10  m  thick. Locally  at  Rovina,  minor secondary Cu-oxide minerals are observed in the upper 15 m.

The Rovina Cu-Au deposit is hosted in a composite stock, primarily an amphibole-feldspar porphyry. Dimensions of the known mineralization are 930 m x 780 m, with a very strong vertical high grade core of approximately 200 m x 200 m associated with an inter-mineral axial porphyry intrusion.  Early-stage potassic  and  magnetite alteration  is  associated  with  disseminated  and  stockwork-vein  hosted  pyritechalcopyrite.  A post-mineral phreato-magmatic breccia complex cuts part of the mineralised porphyry body.  The deposit is open at depth only in the core area with indication of diminishing grade.

The Colnic Au-Cu deposit is hosted in a composite porphyry stock which includes microdiorite, diorite and  andesite  rock  types. The  stock  is  variably  potassic  and  magnetite  altered,  and  intrudes  an intensely phyllic-altered complex  of  heterogeneous-textured  hornblende  porphyry. Overprinting alteration types are common with part of the high-grade zone in Rovina Valley coincident with a quartzstockwork-related  phyllic  alteration  overprint. In  Rovina  Valley  a  series  of  late-mineral  dykes  and breccias  zones  parallel  to  the  trend  of  the  valley  cut  early  mineralization.   Mineralization  occurs  as disseminated and stockwork-vein hosted pyrite-chalcopyrite.   The mineralized portion of the porphyry has known dimensions of 1168 m x 1156 m, with a high grade area of 520 m x 330 m and remains open at depth.

The Ciresata Au-Cu deposit is hosted equally in a 'funnel-shaped' intrusive neck of amphibole-feldspar porphyry and adjacent hornfelsed Cretaceous sediments.  Early-stage potassic and intense magnetite alteration effects both host rocks.   Mineralization occurs as disseminated and stockwork-vein hosted pyrite-chalcopyrite .  The mineralized portion of the porphyry is currently inferred at 700 m x 700 m at

depth with a barren cover of magnetite-altered amphibole-feldspar porphyry &gt; 50 m thick.  Four narrow post-to-late mineral dykes cut the deposit.  Grades generally increase with depth and the limited drilling completed to date has not closed-off mineralization.

From  2004  to  the  present,  Carpathian  has  completed  geological,  alteration  and  structural  mapping (1:5,000 scale and 1:1,000 scale over the main prospects), ground magnetics, induced polarization and resistivity surveys, stream sediment and soil geochemical surveys and diamond drilling.   Carpathian's work has demonstrated the geologic potential for Au-rich porphyry deposits on the Rovina property.

Carpathian drilling on the Rovina Property used in the resource estimate totals 61,716 m in 155 holes, distributed between Rovina 53 holes, Colnic 87 holes and Ciresata 15 holes.

PEG reviewed Carpathian's logging and sample collection procedures, and is of the opinion that core logging  is  efficient  and  of  sufficient  detail  to  be  utilized  in  resource  estimation. Core  sampling procedures  follow  standard  industry  practices  with  a  QC/QC  program  exceeding  industry  standard. Despite the fact that the performance of the QA/QC samples in the 2007-2008 drill campaign indicates that closer monitoring will be necessary in the future, PEG is of the opinion that the QA/QC samples are acceptable for resource estimation purposes

Data  verification  was  performed  by  PEG  through  site  visits,  collection  of  independent  character samples and a database audit prior to mineral resource estimation.   PEG found the database to be exceptionally well maintained and error free and usable in mineral resource estimation.

The in-situ bulk density of the rock types was based on 829 specific gravity determinations collected at a rate of 1 determination per 66 metre at Rovina, 1 in 80 at Colnic and 1 in 99 at Ciresata.  PEG is of the opinion that the specific gravity determinations are representative of the in-situ bulk density of the rock types.

Preliminary  metallurgical  testwork  was  initiated  at  SGS  Lakefield  Research  (Lakefield)  in  the  third quarter of 2006 and consisted of flotation testwork for copper and gold, and cyanide leaching for gold on samples from the Rovina and Colnic deposits.   Additional test work is underway at the time this report  was  written  on  samples  from  each  of  the  deposits,  but  results  were  not  yet  available. Mineralogical  (Qemscan)  indications  to  date  are  that  the  Ciresata  samples  may  be  metallurgically similar to Colnic and that a saleable copper concentrate containing much of the copper gold could be produced  from  ore  of  similar  makeup  to  the  composite  samples.   Cyanidation  tests  on  samples  of cleaner  tails  indicate  that  additional  gold  at  acceptable  reagent  consumptions  can  be  recovered  by leaching of flotation cleaner tails

Mineral resources at Rovina, Colnic and Ciresata were classified using logic consistent with the CIM definitions referred to in National Instrument 43-101.  At Rovina and Colnic the mineralization, density and position of the drill holes satisfies sufficient criteria to be classified into the Indicated and Inferred categories  with  minor  amount  of  measured  in  the  core  area  of  the  deposit. At  Ciresata  the mineralization satisfies sufficient criteria to be classified into the Inferred category only.

This independent mineral resource estimate and review by PEG supports the 17th of November 2008, disclosure by Carpathian of the mineral resource statement for the Rovina Property.

Following  the  site  visit,  audit  of  the  project  database  and  review  of  the  QA/QC  program,  PEG recommends the following:

- Carpathian should unify, as much as it is possible, the naming and coding of the lithological and alteration  units  in  the  database  in  order  to  facilitate  the  configuration  of  the  general mining package and to establish greater consistency.  This work will facilitate movement of staffs between the deposits with minimum re-training as the project moves forward;
- The  performance  of  the  magnetic  compass  of  the  down  hole  survey  tool  used  by Carpathian  appear  to  perform  adequately  however,  the  purchase  of  an  instrument  not affected by magnetism should be investigated. This is especially true for Ciresata where the drilling is deeper and subject to greater deviation;
- Carpathian needs to monitor the QA/QC more closely and re-submit sample batches that show an unusual failure rate in the standard and blanks combined with the coarse and pulp duplicates that shows unusual grade variations.

Following  the  completion  of  the  mineral  resource  estimates  at  the  Rovina,  Colnic  and  Ciresata deposits, PEG recommends the following:

- Additional drilling is required at Ciresata to complete the delineation of the lithological and alteration contacts affecting the grade distribution in the model.  Effort should also focus on a greater understanding of the grade distribution at or near the dike boundaries.   This is especially  important  at  Ciresata  because  of  the  bulk  underground  method  envisioned, which typically require more precision on the locations of the ore/waste boundaries and the correct location of major fault that may affect the mine plan;
- At  Rovina,  drilling  needs  to  focus  on  the  inferred  blocks  near  surface  to  ensure  that  all blocks within the reach of a potential open pit have sufficient coverage to be upgrade to the indicated resource category in preparation for a possible pre-feasibility study in the future;
- A similar recommendation also applies for Colnic, with a secondary focus in understanding the  distribution  of  the  dike  swarm  at  depth  to  increase  the  underground  potential  of  the deposit;
- With additional drilling, future resource models should revisit the interpolation plan in order to manage the higher grade frequently observed along the dike boundaries at Colnic and Ciresata.   One  possible  enhancement  could  be  to  have  an  expanded  domain  of  5  to  8 metres along each dike boundary and interpolate these separately;
- While  closely  spaced  grade  data  is  required  in  sufficient  quantity  to  enable  modelling  of well-structured  directional  variogram  models.   At  Colnic  the  lithological-alteration  domain combination complicates the variography, especially in the lower grade fringe units. With additional drilling, the lithological/alteration model should be re-evaluated and every attempt should be made to combine any units that are genetically close;
- Continued  exploration  is  recommended  for  the  Rovina  Property,  including  a  Preliminary Economic Assessment to assit and guide the future work program. The cost, including a 10% contingency provision, is US$12.07 million (see Table 20.1).

## 20.1 Exploration program

Carpathian should undertake desktop studies to evaluate various development options for the Rovina project  (Preliminary  Economic  Asssesment).   The  results  of  these  studies  will  provide  guidance  for further work required to 1) advance resources to the prefeasibility - feasibility stage and/or 2) expand the resource base through further generative exploration.  Given the demonstrated prospectivity of the Rovina  property,  generative  exploration  efforts  should  not  be  deferred. The  exploration  program moving forward would have the following features:

- Desktop studies to evaluate resource development options and identify any potential hurdles;
- Drilling programs to advance resources toward prefeasibility-feasibility;
- Drilling programs targeted to expand the resource base;
- Metallurgical and geotechnical studies suitable for prefeasibility-feasibility studies;
- Environmental  and  socio-economic  base-line  studies  suitable  for  EIA  and  SIA  permitting requirements;
- Robust stakeholder engagement and community partnership programs.

Based on the results from desktop studies of development options, Carpathian may decide to expidite the  proposed  exploration  program  and  include  concurrent  engineering  studies  appropriate  toward development of prefeasibility-feasibility studies.

## 20.1.1 Development Options Study

Carpathian  should  commence  desk-top  studies  utilizing  as  much  available  project-specific  data  as possible that investigate potential development options such as:

- Mining methods;
- Detailed Metallurgical-process treatment;
- Compilation of cost estimates (capital and operating) that are appropriate to the mineralization type and Project setting;
- Infrastructure requirements including power and water sources;
- Mine-site layout including tailings management facility;

The results from these studies will provide guidance for follow-up exploration programs.  The accuracy of these studies should be as high as available data allows such that areas requiring further work are clearly  elucidated.   A  cost  allocation  of  $US  400,000  toward  this  study  is  included  in  the  program budget and allows the utilisation consultant experts from the various disciplines required.

## 20.1.2 Drilling Programs

## Infill Resource-Definition Drilling and Step-out Drilling

The main objectives of this drilling program would be:

- Upgrade all existing resources that are determined minable to confidence categories suitable for prefeasibility-feasibility studies;
- Delineate limits of mineralization, especially at Ciresata;
- Provide new assay and geologic data through detailed drill-core logging and interpretation to address any weaknesses in the current resource models;
- Provide sufficient data for an updated mineral resource estimate.

At the Ciresata porphyry, a total of 32 HQ/NQ drill holes with an average of 620 m length for a total of approximately  20,000  m  is  recommended  to  infill  and  for  limited  step-out  drilling.  This  drilling  is expected to increase the resource category and further delineate the porphyry body.  In addition, as the mineralization is open and increasing in grade at depth, two or three vertical holes to test maximum depth  with  available  drilling  equiptment  would  be  very  informative.   These  drilling  metres  could  be allocated from the above amount.

Following  the  Development  Options  study,  evaluation  of  determined  minable  resources  of  inferred confidence  level  at  Rovina  and  Colnic  will  need  further  drilling  to  upgrade  confidence  level. An allocation of 15 infill drill holes at an approximate average length of 350 m for 5,000 total m is provided for this purpose.

## Metallurgical and Geotechnical Drilling

A total of six to eight PQ/HQ diamond drill-holes, for a combined 5,000 m, are recommended, to be distributed between each of the Colnic, Rovina and Ciresata porphyry bodies.   The holes should be sited with input from Carpathian's metallurgical and mining consultants.  The purpose of the drilling is to provide sufficient core for additional metallurgical test work suitable for prefeasibility-feasibility studies.

In addition, a total of eight to ten diamond drill holes for a combined 4,000 m distributed between each of the Colnic, Rovina, and Ciresata deposits for geotechnical purposes is recommended.   These drill holes should be sited and logging managed by Carpathian's geotechnical consultants.  This drilling will help define the need for any further geotechnical work and be applicable toward prefeasibility-feasibility studies.

## Reconnaissance Drilling

Other  porphyry  targets  in  the  Rovina  project  area  should  be  evaluated  and  ranked  by  Carpathian's generative exploration program.  Drill testing of these targets, especially in vicinity of existing deposits, is recommended.  The Ciresata area is particularly prospective.  Secondary exploration targets on the Rovina  property,  the  Cordurea  and  Valisoara-Porcurea  prospects  should  be  drill-tested  with  a  few scout holes providing it does not pull available resources from the Rovina project.  A total of 5,000 m of diamond drilling, approximately 12 drill holes, has been allocated for reconnaissance drilling.

08CARP0100\_REP00

<!-- image -->

In  total,  approximately  35,000  to  45,000  m  of  core  (amount  to  be  determined  on  results  during  the program) is budgeted for the next year's program, distributed between the Colnic, Rovina and Ciresata Porphyry bodies with 5,000 m of this to be allocated to reconnaissance drilling at proximal exploration targets. A provision for 20% QA/QC sampling is built into the analytical costs.   The total drilling and analytical costs are approximately $US 7.1 million.   The objectives of the program are to ensure the data  collected  in  the  drilling  programs  are  of  a  nature  and  standard  that  can  be  used  for  further resource estimations.

## 20.1.3 Enviromental and Socio-economic studies

Carpathian  should  continue  and  enhance  the  data  ongoing  data  collection  for  Environmental  and Socio-economic  baseline  studies. Appropriate consultants knowledgeable  in requirements for Romania and International bodies should design and oversee the implementation of these programs. These studies should initially address the long-lead general requirements with a subsequent focus on project specific needs. To advance Carpathian's ongoing baseline programs, and provide knowledgeable  consultant  input,  $US  200,000  are  allocated  in  the  proposed  budget  for  next  year's program.

## 20.1.4 Other

Additonal key  aspects  for the Rovina  project development  include  Archeological  assessment, stakeholder engagement, and community partnership programs.  Carpathian has begun work programs in  all  three  of  these  areas. It  is  recommended  that  Carpathian  advance  these  programs  and  an estimated cost of $US 300,000 is allocated for this work during the next year in this budget.

A  further  $US  2.5  million,  has  been  allocated  in  support  of  the  drilling  program  and  the  other recommended work programs, covering items such as in-country such as further ground geophysics, accommodation,  travel,  vehicles  and  transport,  road  and  access  construction,  surveying,  additional specific gravity determinations and petrographic studies and local labour and in-country company G&amp;A and contingency..

Details of the recommended budget, totalling $US 12.07 million is provided in Table 20.1

## 21.3 Glossary

The glossary terms are from the Canadian 'Northern Miner' publication group.

Aeromagnetic survey: A geophysical survey using a magnetometer on board or towed behind an aircraft.

Alluvium: Relatively  recent  deposits  of  sedimentary  material  laid  down  in  river  beds,  flood  plains, lakes, or at the base of mountain slopes. (adj. alluvial)

AMD: Acid  mine  drainage,  characterized  by  low  pH,  high  sulphate,  and  high  iron  and  other  metal species.

Anomaly: Any  departure  from  the  norm  which  may  indicate  the  presence  of  mineralization  in underlying bedrock.

Assay: To determine the amount of metal contained in an ore.

Channel sample: A sample composed of pieces of vein or mineral deposit that have been cut out of a small trench or channel, usually about 10 cm wide and 2 cm deep

Concentrate: The concentrate is the valuable product from mineral processing, as opposed to the tailing,  which  contains  the  waste  minerals.   The  concentrate  represents  a  smaller  volume  than  the original ore.

Cordillera: The continuous  chain  of  mountain  ranges  on  the  western  margins  of  North  and  South America.

Decline: A  sloping underground opening for machine access from level to level or from the surface. Also called a ramp.

Development: Underground work carried out for the purpose of opening up a mineral deposit.

Diamond drill: A rotary type of rock drill that cuts a core of rock that is recovered in long cylindrical sections, two cm or more in diameter.

Dilution  (mining): Rock  that  is,  by  necessity,  removed  along  with  the  ore  in  the  mining  process, subsequently lowering the grade of the ore.

Dore: The final saleable product of a gold mine, usually consisting of gold and silver.

Epithermal deposit: A mineral deposit consisting of veins and replacement bodies, usually in volcanic or sedimentary rocks, containing precious metals, or rarely, base metals.

Extractive metallurgy: The processes of chemically separating the valuable metal from its mineral matrix (ore or concentrate) to produce the pure metal.  Includes the disciplines of hydrometallurgy and pyrometallurgy.

<!-- image -->

Fiamme: Fragments of volcanic ejecta, frequently pumice.  Fiamme are formed from hot, relatively low viscosity, high porosity fragments of volcanic glass.   These fragments accumulate on the ground and flatten via compaction.

Flowsheet: An illustration showing the step-by-step sequence of operations by which ore is treated in a milling, smelting, or concentration process.

Footwall: The rock on the underside of a vein or ore structure.

Gangue: The fraction of  ore rejected as tailing in a separating process.   It is usually the valueless portion, but may have some secondary commercial use.

Grab sample: A  sample from a rock outcrop that is assayed to determine if valuable elements are contained in the rock.   A grab sample is not intended to be representative of the deposit, and usually the best-looking material is selected.

Grade: Percentage of a metal or mineral composition in an ore or processing product from mineral processing.

Gravity  separation: Exploitation  of  differences  in  the  densities  of  particles  to  achieve  separation. Machines utilizing gravity separation include jigs and shaking tables.

Hangingwall: The rock on the upper side of a vein or ore deposit.

Heap leaching: A process whereby valuable metals, usually gold and silver, are leached from a heap or pad of crushed ore by leaching solutions percolating down through the heap and collected from a sloping, impermeable liner below the pad.

Hypogene: A term used to describe processes originating within the earth, especially the formation of mineral deposits by ascending hydrothermal fluids

Induced polarization: A method of ground geophysical surveying employing an electrical current to determine indications of mineralization.

Metal complexes: An ion consisting of several atoms including at least one metal cation

Metallurgy: The science and art of  extracting  metals  from  their  ores,  refining  them,  and  preparing them for use.  Metallurgy consists of three major disciplines:  mineral processing metallurgy, extractive metallurgy, and physical metallurgy.

Mill: Includes any ore mill, sampling works, concentration, and any crushing, grinding, or screening plant used at, and in connection with, an excavation or mine.

Mine: An opening or excavation in the earth for the purpose of extracting minerals.

Mineral: A naturally occurring, solid, inorganic element or compound, with a definite composition or range of compositions, usually possessing a regular internal crystalline structure.

<!-- image -->

Mineral  processing: Preparation  of  ores  by  physical  methods. A  subcategory  of  metallurgy. Methods of mineral processing include comminution, classification, flotation, gravity separation, etc.

Open pit: A mine that is entirely on the surface.  Also referred to as an open-cut or open-cast mine.

Open stope: In competent rock, it is possible to remove all of a moderate sized ore body, resulting in an  opening  of  considerable  size.   Such  large,  irregularly-shaped  openings  are  called  stopes.   The mining of large inclined ore bodies often requires leaving horizontal pillars across the stope at intervals in order to prevent collapse of the walls.

Ore: A  natural  deposit in which a valuable metallic element occurs in high enough concentration to make mining economically feasible.  The term is proscribed under NI 43-101.

Overburden: Material of any nature, consolidated or unconsolidated, that overlies a deposit of ore that is to be mined.

pH: The  negative  logarithm  of  the  hydrogen  ion  concentration,  in  which  pH  =  -log  [H+].   Neutral solutions have pH values of 7, acidic solutions have pH values less than 7, and alkaline solutions have pH values greater than 7.

Porphyry copper: A deposit of disseminated copper minerals in or around a large body of intrusive rock.

Prill: Small pieces of pure precious metal extracted from assay samples.  Usually resembling a cone shape in appearance.

Reclamation: The restoration of a site after mining or exploration activity is completed.

Refining: A  high  temperature  process  in  which  impure  metal  is  reacted  with  flux  to  reduce  the impurities.  The metal is collected in a molten layer and the impurities in a slag layer. Refining results in the production of a marketable material.

Resistivity survey: A geophysical technique used to measure the resistance of a rock formation to an electric current.

Riparian: Pertaining to the bank of a natural watercourse.

Spoil: Debris or waste material from a mine.

Stockpile: Broken ore heaped on the surface, pending treatment or shipment.

Stope: An excavation in a mine, other than development workings, made for the purpose of extracting ore.

SX/EW: hydrometallurgical process known as solvent extraction-electrowinning. a two-stage process that  first  extracts  and  upgrades  copper  ions  from  low-grade  leach  solutions  into  a  concentrated electrolyte, and then deposits pure copper onto cathodes using an electrolytic procedure.

Tailings: Residue from milling processes (e.g., flotation tailings, gravity tailings, leach tailings, etc.).

<!-- image -->

Vein: A mineralized zone having a more or less regular development in length, width, and depth to give it a tabular form.

Vitric:

composed of volcanic glass fragments.

Zone:

An area of distinct mineralization.
