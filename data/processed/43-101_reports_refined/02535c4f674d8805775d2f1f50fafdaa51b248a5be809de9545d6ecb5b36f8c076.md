## 1 SUMMARY

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Scott  Wilson  Roscoe  Postle  Associates  Inc.  (Scott  Wilson  RPA)  was  retained  by North  American  Tungsten  Corporation  Ltd.  (NATCL)  to  prepare  an  updated  mineral resource estimate and an NI 43-101 compliant Technical Report on the Mactung tungsten deposit, located near MacMillan Pass, Yukon.  This Technical Report conforms to NI 43101 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects. Scott Wilson RPA visited the property on August 19, 2005.

The Mactung property, wholly owned by NATCL, consists of 113 mineral claims and 38 mining leases in Yukon and eight mining leases in the Northwest Territories, with a total area of 4,541.6 ha.  The Mactung property is at the feasibility stage of development, and environmental and engineering studies are in progress. NATCL has obtained a Class III Yukon Land Use permit to operate a camp and do extensive diamond drilling on the Yukon side of the border.  A water licence is not required for the levels of activity that are currently being undertaken.

## CONCLUSIONS

Scott Wilson RPA completed a solid model, or wireframe, of the mineralized zones and a multiple-seam 2D gridded seam block model (GSM) for the Mactung deposit.  The model  contains  two  separate  estimates  of  grade  (Kriged  and  Polygonal)  and  a  single estimate of vertical thickness for each block based on the solid model.  Scott Wilson RPA considers the kriged estimate more appropriate for this deposit.  A minimum thickness of 4.5  m  has  been  applied  to  the  model  and  grades  have  been  diluted  to  the  minimum thickness where necessary.

The  kriged  estimate  contains  an  indicated  mineral  resource  of  33  million  tonnes grading 0.88% WO3, or 290 Kt of contained WO3.  An additional resource of 11.9 million tonnes grading 0.78% WO3, or 92 Kt WO3, has been estimated for the inferred category.

These estimates, which are based on assays capped at unique levels for each zone, are

reported at a block cut-off of 0.5% WO3, which Scott Wilson RPA considers appropriate for the location and cost profile that can be expected for Mactung.

CIM definitions (December 2005) were followed for the classification of the mineral resources.  Scott Wilson RPA estimates an average drill spacing of 50 m based on the average distance between each composite and its four nearest neighbours.  Scott Wilson RPA considers the spacing close enough to classify approximately 76% of the estimated resources as indicated.

Both the kriged and polygonal estimates are virtually identical in terms of contained metal  at  the  stated  cut-off,  although  the  polygonal  estimates  are  lower  in  tonnage  and higher in grade.

The resources straddle the Yukon/Northwest Territories (NWT) border. Approximately 91% of the contained metal estimated for indicated category and 80% of the contained metal for inferred resources are located on the Yukon side of the border.

## RECOMMENDATIONS

Further drilling is required to improve the reliability of the mineral resource estimates in the upper 3 zones (3D, 3E and 3F) as well as on the periphery and northerly portions of all zones.  Initial efforts should focus on the areas of the deposit where the higher grades have not been entirely closed off by peripheral drilling.  Assessments of grade variability indicate  a  maximum drill spacing in the range of 120 m to classify any portion of the resource as indicated, although this must be confirmed by further drilling for the upper 3 zones.

A  phased  work  program  is  recommended,  the  first  phase  of  which  would  be  a preliminary  economic  assessment  of  the  project  based  on  the  current  mineral  resource estimates.  NATCL estimates the cost of the assessment to be approximately $200,000. Subject to positive results from the preliminary assessment, a feasibility study should be embarked  upon.    Concurrent  with  the  feasibility  work,  a  drilling  program  should  be carried  out;  however,  the  size  and  nature  of  the  drilling  program  would  be  contingent

upon the results of the preliminary study.  Should that study indicate that the project will have  to  draw  on  the  inferred  resources  to  produce  a  positive  economic  result,  a component of the drilling program will have to be aimed at upgrading sufficient resources to  satisfy  the  requirement  that  a  feasibility  (and  reserve)  be  based  on  measured  and indicated resources.  NATCL estimates the cost of the feasibility and drilling to be in the range of $5 million.

## TECHNICAL SUMMARY

## PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION

The Mactung property is located in the Selwyn Mountain Range and covers the area around Mt. Allan on the Yukon/NWT border, approximately eight kilometres northwest of  MacMillan  Pass.  The  nearest  settlement  accessible  by  road,  Ross  River,  is  250  km away  to  the  southwest  along  the  Canol  Road,  a  drive  that  takes  about  six  hours.  The property is located at latitude 63º17'N and longitude 130º10'W, and the Cantung Mine is approximately 160 km to the south.

## LAND TENURE

The Mactung property comprises 113 mineral claims and 38 mining leases in Yukon and eight mining leases in the NWT, with a total area of 4,541.6 ha, or 11,217.7 acres. The  claims  and  leases,  none  of  which  are  patented,  are  contiguous  and  cover  a  single block of ground that straddles the Yukon/NWT border.  The Mactung mineral resource is located on mineral leases, mainly on the Yukon side of the border.  All leases and claims belong  to  NATCL  and  royalties  on  production  are  payable  to  the  Yukon  and  NWT Governments under their respective mining legislation.

## SITE INFRASTRUCTURE

The infrastructure is represented by an adit and associated underground workings that were  driven  into  the  Lower  Zone  (2B)  ore  horizon  in  1973.    They  are  located  on  the Yukon side of the border at an elevation of 1,900 m.  A small dump of waste rock with a small amount of ore exists near the adit entrance.

## HISTORY

The Mactung deposit was discovered in 1962 by James Allan, a geologist of Amax Northwest Mining Co. Ltd. (Amax), probably as a result of follow-up prospecting to a regional stream sediment survey carried out as part of the Ogilvy Reconnaissance Project. The deposit was originally known as MacMillan Pass Tungsten and then as MacMillan Tungsten before it became known as Mactung.

During the years 1963 to 1967, Amax  completed  geological mapping, rock geochemical sampling, magnetometer surveying, and grid geochemical soil sampling on the property.   The five surface diamond drill holes completed in 1968 (1,513 m) were followed by 11 km of access road construction from the Canol Road to the property in 1970. Twenty-one surface diamond drill holes were drilled in 1971 and 48 holes in 1972. In 1973, an adit was collared at the 1,890 m elevation and 726 m of lateral development and 27 m of raising were completed in the Lower Zone.  A 295 tonne bulk sample was sent for metallurgical testing.  A total of 43 underground holes were drilled from the adit to  better  define  the  mineralization  in  the  Lower  Zone,  stratigraphically  known  as  the '2B' horizon.  Further surface diamond drilling was done in 1979 along with another 49 m  of  underground  development.  The  last  surface  drilling  conducted  by  Amax  was  in 1980.  Ongoing environmental and feasibility studies continued until 1985, when falling tungsten prices caused work on the project to stop.

Amax sold the Mactung property to Canada Tungsten Mining Corporation (CTMC) in 1986 as part of a larger sale that also included the Cantung mine.  CTMC merged with Canamax Resources and Minerex Resources in 1993, to become Canada Tungsten Inc. In August 1994, Aur Resources Inc. (Aur) purchased a 48% interest in Canada Tungsten Inc. and subsequently, in January 1997, the two companies merged.  In October 1997, the property, along with the Cantung Mine and other Aur assets, was sold to NATCL, the present owner.

In 2005, NATCL drilled 25 surface diamond drill holes (6,639 m) to better define the west  end  of  the  deposit  and  to  upgrade  the  resource  classification  of  some  mineral resource blocks from the 'Inferred' to 'Indicated' category.

## GEOLOGY

The Mactung deposit is located in the eastern Selwyn Basin, an outer miogeoclinal basin  that  formed  on  the  then  western  margin  of  the  North  American  continent.  The dominantly thin-bedded siliciclastic rocks (shale, chert, and basinal limestone) grade to the  northeast  into  the  thick-bedded  carbonate  sediments  of  the  variably  subsiding Mackenzie Platform.  Local stratigraphy of importance may include the Late Cambrian to Early-Middle Ordovician Gull Lake Formation (dolomitic siltstone and mudstone, slate, limestone  conglomerate)  and  Rabbitkettle  Formation  (basinal  silty  limestone)  and  the Ordovician  to  Lower  Devonian  Road  River  Group  which  includes  the  Duo  Lake Formation  (black  graptolitic  shale,  laminated  chert,  and  minor  limestone)  and  the overlying Steel Formation (pyritic, locally wispy laminated, siliceous, locally dolomitic mudstone to siltstone). Facies-changes between deep-water clastic rocks (shale basin) and shallow water carbonate rocks (platform) are transitional.

In Jurassic and Early Cretaceous time, the miogeocline was deformed by northeastdirected compression. The rocks of Selwyn Basin responded by thrust faulting and the development of open to tight similar folds. Structural trends generally parallel the arcuate Paleozoic shale-carbonate facies boundary. Widespread Early to Late Cretaceous granitic magmatism intruded the deformed rocks of the miogeocline. Five main intrusive suites are recognized, one of which, the Tungsten (97 ma - 92 Ma), is responsible for a string of tungsten skarn deposits along the eastern flank of the former Selwyn Basin.

The rocks  in  the  Mactung  area  are  part  of  the  west-trending  Macmillan  Fold  Belt. Stratigraphy in the general area of Mactung trends generally E-W and dips from 10º to 40º to the south. The axes of large folds also trend E-W and may have a shallow westerly plunge. Several ages of high-angle normal faulting, of various orientations, are known in the area.

A stratigraphic  sequence  has  been  established  on  the  property,  with  nine  mappable units distinguished and designated from oldest to youngest numerically I, 2B, 3C, 3D, 3E, 3F, 3G, 3H, and 4. At Mactung, this package is comprised of approximately 230 m of shallow  southerly  dipping,  altered  limestones,  shales  and  siltstones  of  Cambrian  to Silurian  age.  The  entire  sequence  is  overthrust  to  the  north,  producing  a  recumbent isoclinal  fold  with  an  axis  that  plunges  at  a  shallow  angle  to  the  west  and  to  the  east, away from the deposit. The Cretaceous-aged Cirque Lake stock is intruded through this sequence.  The  deposit  and  the  host  stratigraphy  is  cut  and  offset  by  numerous  steeply dipping northerly trending faults with displacements of up to 30 m or more.

## MINERALIZATION

The  Mactung  mineralization  can  be  characterized  as  a  metasomatic  skarn  deposit formed by magmatic hydrothermal fluids originating from a Cretaceous granitic stock. The deposit comprises an Upper and Lower mineralized skarn zone separated by 100 m of  hornfelsed  pelitic  sediments.  The  Lower  zone,  while  dipping  in  the  same  general direction as the Upper zone, contains a 'Z' fold with an amplitude of about 90 m.

The skarns associated with the metamorphosed limestone units may be divided into two  main  facies:  garnet-pyroxene  and  pyroxene-pyrrhotite.    Scheelite  is  the  economic mineral of interest at Mactung, with wolframite reported only occasionally. Chalcopyrite is  main  base  metal  found  in  the  deposit,  but  is  probably  not  of  economic  significance. Scheelite occurs predominantly with pyrrhotite in the pyroxene-pyrrhotite facies, wherein the scheelite content increases and grain size decreases with pyrrhotite content.  Minor scheelite also occurs in the garnet facies, and is coarser grained than that of the pyrrhotite facies.

## MINERAL RESOURCES AND MINERAL RESERVES

Scott  Wilson  RPA  has  completed  a  3D  solid  model,  or  wireframe,  and  2D  block model for the Mactung property.  The 2D model is a gridded seam model (GSM) and contains two separate estimates of grade (Kriged &amp; Polygonal) and a single estimate of

thickness  for  each  block.    Scott  Wilson  RPA  considers  the  kriged  estimate  more appropriate for this deposit.  Tables 1-1 and 1-2 summarize the kriged estimates.

These estimates, which are based on assays capped at unique levels for each zone, are reported at a block cut-off of 0.5% WO3, which Scott Wilson RPA considers appropriate for  the  location  and  cost  profile  that  can  be  expected  for  Mactung.    CIM  definitions (December  2005)  were  followed  for  the  classification  of  the  mineral  resources.    Scott Wilson RPA estimates an average drill spacing of 50 m based on the average distance between each composite and its four nearest neighbours.  Scott Wilson RPA considers the spacing close enough to classify approximately 76% of the resources as indicated.

Further drilling is required to improve the reliability of the mineral resource estimates for  the  upper  three  zones  (3D,  3E,  and  3F)  as  well  as  on  the  periphery  and  northern portions of all four zones.  Initial efforts should focus on the areas of the deposit where higher grade  intercepts have  not been  entirely closed off by  peripheral drilling. Assessments of grade variability indicate a maximum drill spacing in the range of 120 m to  classify  any  portion  of  the  resource  as  indicated  category,  although  this  must  be confirmed by further drilling in the upper 3 zones.

This  report  was  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  CIM  Definition  Standards  on Mineral  Resources  and  Mineral  Reserves  adopted  by  CIM  Council  on  December  11, 2005,  and  incorporated  in  National  Instrument  43-101.    Since  this  report  describes  a resource  estimation,  operational  considerations  are  limited  to  general  statements  and assumptions  about  any  potential  mine  development  that  may  occur  at  Mactung,  even though  very  detailed  reports  were  prepared  for  Amax  Northwest  Mining  Co.  Ltd. (Amax),  the  discoverer  of  the  deposit,  prior  to  its  attempt  to  put  the  deposit  into production in the early 1980s.  Amax had completed an initial environmental evaluation and a feasibility study by the mid-1980s when falling tungsten prices made the deposit uneconomic.  The present surge in tungsten prices suggests that the property is well worth reviewing for its economic potential, and some preliminary work is being undertaken by Strathcona Mineral Services to that end.

Many of the documents reviewed in the preparation of this report come from a library of  Amax  drawings  and  reports  that  accumulated  between  1963  and  1985  and  are  now housed in NATCL's Whitehorse office.

The documentation reviewed, and other sources of information, are listed at the end of this report in Section 21 References.

## 4 PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION

The Mactung property is located in the Selwyn Mountain Range and covers the area around  Mt.  Allan  on  the  Yukon/Northwest  Territories  (NWT)  border,  approximately eight  kilometres  northwest  of  MacMillan  Pass  (Figure  4-1).    The  nearest  settlement accessible by road, Ross River, is 250 km away to the southwest along the Canol Road, a drive  that  takes  about  six  hours.    A  ferry  at  Ross  River  and  the  Canol  Road  are maintained by the Yukon Territorial Government in the summer only.  The property is located at latitude 63º17'N  and longitude 130º10'W,  and  the Cantung  Mine  is approximately 160 km to the south.

The Mactung property comprises 113 mineral claims and 38 mining leases in Yukon and eight mining leases in the NWT, with a total area of 4,541.6 ha, or 11,217.7 acres (Figure 4-2).  Opinions on property title have been provided by NATCL's legal counsel, Fraser Milner Casgrain LLP (FMC 2007).  FMC reports that all mineral claims and leases pertaining to the Mactung property are in good standing as at May 14, 2007.

In the 1970s, Amax had the then existing claims and leases surveyed by Underhill &amp; Underhill  (Now  Underhill  Geomatics)  of  Whitehorse.    The  Territorial  border  was surveyed by Paul S. Dixon C.L.S. in the period July 28 to August 5, 2003.  The thirty-six Grind claims staked in 2005 using a handheld GPS unit have not been surveyed.  The claims and leases, none of which are patented, are contiguous and cover a single block of ground that straddles the Yukon/NWT border.  The Mactung mineral resource is located on mineral leases, mainly on the Yukon side of the border.  All leases and claims belong to NATCL and royalties on production are payable to the Yukon and NWT Governments under their respective mining legislation.  There was also a royalty of 4% payable to Aur Resources  Inc.  (Aur),  which  the  Company  may  reduce  to  1%  by  payments  to  Aur  of $100,000 on September 30, 2005 (paid in September 2005) and $1,000,000 by the earlier of March 30, 2015, or 60 days after the receipt of a water licence issued in connection with any proposed mineral production on the property.  If the Company has not exercised the option by March 30, 2010, it must pay an additional $200,000 to Aur on or before this

date  to  extend  the  option.    The  option  to  buy  down  the  royalty  will  terminate  if  the NATCL misses any of the option payments to Aur.

## 5 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE AND PHYSIOGRAPHY

## ACCESSIBILITY

The Mactung property is accessible from Ross River, a settlement 250 km southwest along the Canol Road.  This road is maintained by the Yukon Territorial Government as far as the NWT border in the summer only, and is only accessible while the ferry at Ross River  is  in  operation.    The  short  section  of  the  Canol  Road  in  the  NWT  between  the border and the mine access road is not maintained and is in poor driving condition.  The 11 km long access road from the Canol Road to the property itself is currently in fair driving condition.

There  are  two  airstrips  locally,  one  near  Tom  Creek  at  MacMillan  Pass,  which  is maintained  by  the  Yukon  Territorial  Government  and  can  accommodate  light  aircraft, and  another  at  Tsichu  River,  the  condition  of  which  is  not  known  but  probably  poor. There is a site near the start of the mine access road in the NWT where a 2,000 m airstrip could be constructed to service the property.

## CLIMATE

The  area  has  a  continental  climate  modified  by  the  mountain  setting.    The  Tsichu River meteorological station was operated by Amax  with assistance from the Atmospheric  Environment  Service  from  October  1974  to  August  1982  (Kershaw  and Kershaw 1983).  The mean annual temperature for this period was -7.7 C, with a mean o monthly  minimum ranging  from  -30 C  in  December  and  January  up  to  about  +4 C  in o o July.    For  the  same  periods  the  average  monthly  maximum  temperature  varied  from -18 C to +15 C.   Temperature extremes for the Mactung property range from -42 C to o o o 24 C, with a mean of -8.5 C.  The average annual precipitation is 490 mm and snowfall o o 294  cm.    Midwinter  snow  pack  varies  from  thin  discontinuous  on  windswept  sites  to greater  than  2  m  in  drifted  areas.    Frosts  occur  in  all  the  growing  season  months,  but

mean daily temperatures are above freezing from late May to mid-September.  Winds are most commonly from the west.

## INFRASTRUCTURE

The infrastructure is represented by an adit and associated underground workings that were  driven  into  the  Lower  Zone  (2B)  ore  horizon  in  1973.    They  are  located  on  the Yukon side of the border at an elevation of 1,900 m.  A small dump of waste rock with a small amount of ore exists near the adit entrance. There is also a core shack and two Atco trailers

## PHYSIOGRAPHY

The topography is rugged and the area has been glaciated.  Landforms include small glacier remnants, rock glaciers, glaciated surfaces, moraines and fluvio-glacial deposits (Kershaw 1976).  Rock talus slopes are common especially on Mount Allan.  The valleys on the Yukon side of the border are locally relatively narrow and steep sided, while those on the NWT side are broader and have shallower gradients. The valley floor lies at an elevation of about 1,400 m, while the peak of Mount Allan is at 2,200 m.

The region is above the tree line and can be classified as arctic/alpine tundra.   The vegetation is better developed in valleys and is limited mainly to grasses, small shrubs, moss  and  lichen  (Kershaw  and  Kershaw  1983).      Mountains,  especially  at  higher elevations, are extensively covered with talus and intermittently with grasses, moss, and lichen.

The  predominant  wildlife  species  in  the  area  are  moose,  caribou,  grizzly  bears, wolves and Dall's sheep, with smaller mammals such as voles, lemmings, chipmunks, shrews, ground squirrels, hares and foxes.  Over 50 species of birds have been reported in the Mactung area, with 40 species using the area for breeding purposes.  No fish were discovered by surveys in 2005, but some were identified in earlier surveys by Amax.

## 6 HISTORY

The Mactung deposit was discovered in 1962 by James Allan, an Amax geologist, probably as a result of follow-up prospecting to a regional stream sediment survey carried out  as  part  of  the  Ogilvy  Reconnaissance  Project  (Allan  1963).    The  deposit  was originally known as MacMillan Pass Tungsten and then as MacMillan Tungsten before it became known as Mactung.

During the years 1963 to 1967, Amax  completed  geological mapping, rock geochemical sampling, magnetometer surveying, and grid geochemical soil sampling on the property.   The five surface diamond drill holes completed in 1968 (1,513 m) were followed by 11 km of access road construction from the Canol Road to the property in 1970, and an additional twenty-one surface diamond drill holes (2,313 m) in 1971 and forty-eight  holes  (6,956  m)  in  1972.    In  1973,  an  adit  was  collared  at  the  1,890  m elevation and 726 m of lateral development and 27 m of raising were completed in the Lower Zone.  A 295 tonne bulk sample was excavated and shipped to an Amax facility in Colorado for metallurgical testing.  Every second round taken in the adit was crushed and then sampled using a Jones Riffle (tower sampler?).  A total of forty-three underground holes (1,653 m) were drilled from the adit to better define the mineralization in the Lower Zone,  stratigraphically  known  as  the  '2B'  horizon  (see  Appendix  1).    Further  surface diamond  drilling  was  done  in  1979  (Table  6-1),  and  another  49  m  of  underground development was done in 1979, with nine 45-gallon barrels of mineralized skarn blasted for  metallurgical  test  purposes.    The  last  surface  drilling  conducted  by  Amax  was  in 1980.  Ongoing environmental and feasibility studies, including an examination of local flora and fauna, archaeology, geomorphology, air quality, water quality and soil studies that  commenced in the early 1970s, continued until 1985, when falling tungsten prices caused work on the project to stop.

Nearly all the diamond drill core was relogged during the period 1982 to 1985.  This work  was  undertaken  by  D.  Atkinson  (1982,  1983);  D.  Baker  (1982);  J.  MacMillan (1984, 1985); J. Mustard (1985) and L. Erdman (1985).  As most drill holes have been

logged on several different occasions at differing levels of detail, it will be a challenge to summarize the information to produce a single diamond drill hole record for each drill hole.  The drill core that remains, which is no longer a complete record of the drilling because it has been extensively sampled and resampled, is stored at the Cantung Mine.

Amax sold the Mactung property to Canada Tungsten Mining Corporation (CTMC) in 1986 as part of a larger sale that also included the Cantung mine.  CTMC merged with Canamax Resources and Minerex Resources in 1993, to become Canada Tungsten Inc. In August 1994, Aur Resources Inc. (Aur) purchased a 48% interest in Canada Tungsten Inc. and subsequently, in January 1997, the two companies merged.  In October 1997, the property, along with the Cantung Mine and other Aur assets, was sold to NATCL, the present owner.

In 2005, NATCL drilled 25 surface diamond drill holes (6,639 m) to better define the west  end  of  the  deposit  and  to  upgrade  the  resource  classification  of  some  mineral resource blocks from the 'Inferred' to 'Indicated' category.  Also one old drill hole was 'twinned'.  The adit was rehabilitated and a bulk sample of 79 tonnes in size taken for metallurgical test purposes.

During  2005  and  2006,  EBA  Engineering  Consultants  Ltd.  (EBA  Consultants) restarted  environmental  studies  partly  to  confirm  previous  work  done  by  Amax,  and partly to prepare for new environmental and mining permit applications.  This work is ongoing.

Inc. 2001. 'Mineable'

Note. Mineral resource estimates are not NI 43-101 compliant.

These estimates, which, except for the Roscoe Postle Associates Inc. (RPA) estimate, are summarized by Atkinson and McNeil (1983), were made from 1973 to 2001 using a cut-off grade of 0.4% WO3 and minimum mining widths from 3.0 m to 4.5 m (10 ft. to 15 ft.).    The  Mineral  Resource  estimated  by  Strathcona  (1982)  forms  the  basis  for  the potentially mineable reserves reported in the Mactung Project Scope Book (1984).

In  its  2001  detailed  review,  RPA  used  the  Strathcona  resource  classifications  to estimate the amount of proven and probable reserves and noted that, since the Mactung deposit had not yet been demonstrated to be economic, the potential reserves should be

classified as Measured and Indicated Resources.  These resources, along with some prior estimates,  are  listed  in  Table  6-2  above.    The  Strathcona  report  also  included  an additional Inferred Resource of 13,785,000 t grading 0.94% WO3 which is not compliant with the CIM classifications.  Part of the objective for the surface drilling carried out in the summer of 2005 was to upgrade that part of these 'inferred reserves' lying at the west end of the deposit to indicated resources.   The drill results from this work are included in the updated mineral resource described in this report.

## 7 GEOLOGICAL SETTING

## REGIONAL GEOLOGY

The Mactung deposit is located in the eastern Selwyn Basin, an outer miogeoclinal basin that formed on the then western margin of the North American continent. Selwyn Basin refers  to  a  region  of  deep-water,  off  shelf  sedimentation  that  persisted  from  late Precambrian  to  Middle  Devonian  time  (Gordey  and  Anderson  1993).  The  dominantly thin-bedded siliciclastic rocks (shale, chert, and basinal limestone) grade to the northeast into the thick-bedded carbonate sediments of the variably subsiding Mackenzie Platform. Local  stratigraphy  of  importance  may  include  the  Late  Cambrian  to  Early-Middle Ordovician  Gull  Lake  Formation  (dolomitic  siltstone  and  mudstone,  slate,  limestone conglomerate) and Rabbitkettle Formation (basinal silty limestone) and the Ordovician to Lower  Devonian  Road  River  Group  which  includes  the  Duo  Lake  Formation  (black graptolitic shale, laminated chert, and minor  limestone) and the overlying Steel Formation  (pyritic,  locally  wispy  laminated,  siliceous,  locally  dolomitic  mudstone  to siltstone).  Facies-changes  between  deep-water  clastic  rocks  (shale  basin)  and  shallow water carbonate rocks (platform) are transitional.

Mid-Devonian rifting and/or wrench faulting resulted in a regional marine transgression  that  abruptly  terminated  the  Selwyn  Basin  phase  of  passive  margin sedimentation.    An  influx  of  marine,  turbiditic,  chert-rich  clastic  rocks  (Earn  Group) spread to the south and east from an uplifted source in northern Yukon and to the east from uplifted western portions of Selwyn Basin. These clastics rocks, locally accompanied by mafic and less abundant felsic volcanism, blanketed all previous facies, covering Selwyn Basin sediments and onlapping onto the western Mackenzie platform. The Selwyn Basin, as a distinct topographic entity, no longer existed.

In Jurassic and Early Cretaceous time, the miogeocline was deformed by northeastdirected  compression  caused  by  plate  convergence  and  the  accretion  of  pericratonic terranes onto North America. The rocks of Selwyn Basin, relatively incompetent when

compared to the carbonate rocks of the platforms, responded by thrust faulting and the development of open to tight similar folds. Structural trends generally parallel the arcuate Paleozoic shale-carbonate facies boundary.

Widespread  Early  to  Late  Cretaceous  granitic  magmatism  intruded  the  deformed rocks  of  the  miogeocline.  Five  main  intrusive  suites  are  recognized,  one  of  which,  the Tungsten (97 Ma - 92 Ma), is responsible for a string of tungsten skarn deposits along the eastern flank of the former Selwyn Basin.

## LOCAL GEOLOGY

The rocks  in  the  Mactung  area  are  part  of  the  west-trending  Macmillan  Fold  Belt, which is discordant to the regional northwest structural grain.  This fold belt is interpreted to reflect a deep-seated Devonian fault zone that localized facies changes within the Earn Group and also responded differently to Mesozoic deformation.  Folding is tight and a narrow imbricate fault zone of southerly directed east-west trending thrust faults repeats Lower Cambrian to Devonian stratigraphy.  South of the imbricate belt, open to closed folds and steep faults are the dominant structures.

Stratigraphy in the general area of Mactung trends generally E-W and dips from 10º to  40º  to  the  south.  The  axes  of  large  folds  also  trend  E-W  and  may  have  a  shallow westerly plunge. Several ages of high-angle normal faulting, of various orientations, are known in the area.  Strong  slaty  to  fracture  cleavage  can  be  developed.  At  least  in  the Paleozoic  rocks,  the  grade  of  regional  metamorphism  is  very  low.  The  area  has  been glaciated.

Mactung is the most northerly of a group of W-Cu (Zn) skarn deposits strung out in a 200  km  long,  northwesterly  trending  belt  which  roughly  follows  the  NWT-Yukon boundary.  The Cantung deposit is about 160 km to the southeast of Mactung.  These deposits are localized within thermal aureoles, typically above the altered apical zones of a  suite  of  Late  Cretaceous  quart-monzonite  stocks.  At  Mactung,  the  apparently  related

intrusive  has  been  referred  to  variously  as  the  Cirque  Lake  stock  (Harris  1977)  or  the Mactung pluton (Anderson 1982, 1983).

## PROPERTY GEOLOGY

The property geology has been described by Dick and Hodgson (1982), Harris and Godfrey (1975), and Atkinson and Baker (1979).

The Mactung mineralization occurs within a bedded sequence of altered limestones, shales and siltstones of Cambrian to Silurian age up to 230 m in thickness. The deposit consists  of  scheelite-bearing  skarns  developed  near  the  south  contact  of  a  granite intrusion,  the  Cirque  Lake  stock.    The  main  outcrop  occurs  in  the  NWT  along  a  steep northerly sloping cliff on the north side of Mount Allan.  The watershed at the top of the cliff  marks  the  border  between  the  Yukon  and  the  NWT  in  this  region.    The  main sedimentary sequence dips at low angles to the south.  The deposit comprises an Upper and  a  Lower  Skarn  Zone,  with  associated  calcareous  and  pelitic  sediments  and  their metamorphic  equivalents, separated by 100  m  of pelitic sediments, now  largely metamorphosed to hornfels.  The hornfels is a light to dark brown or black and represents metamorphosed  shales  and  siltstones  with  various  amounts  of  muscovite,  biotite  and graphite.    Numerous  thin  veinlets  of  quartz  or  quartz  carbonate  containing  pyrite, pyrrhotite, scheelite, and molybdenite cut the unit.

A stratigraphic  sequence  has  been  established  on  the  property,  with  nine  mappable units distinguished and designated from oldest to youngest numerically I, 2B, 3C, 3D, 3E, 3F,  3G,  3H,  and  4  (Figures  7-1  and  7-2).  The  following  descriptions  are  taken  from Atkinson and Baker (1979).

Unit 1, the lowermost unit exposed on the property, is a heterogeneous brown to grey, thinly  to  moderately  bedded  clastic  unit  composed  of  interbedded  mudstone,  shale, siltstone  and  greywacke.  The  unit  is  considered  to  be  of  lowermost  Cambrian  age,

however, confirmation of this age must await more definitive work on the Hadrynian -Cambrian contact.

Unit 2B, host to the Lower ore zone, is highly variable in thickness and composition. The unit is characterized by the presence of limestone slump breccias which appear to have formed as a series of coalescing debris fans at this stratigraphic level.  The unit has been correlated with the Lower Cambrian Sekwi Formation.  In outcrops on the North Face  of  Mount  Allen,  20  m  of  dominantly  well-bedded,  fine-grained  limestones  and clastics with  interbedded  slump  breccias  are  interpreted to represent the upslope extension of 35 m of chaotic, medium to light grey limestone slump breccia exposed in underground workings.  Down dip, these slump breccias abruptly thin and fragment size decreases  as  the  slumps  grade  into  a  few  centimetres  of  calcareous  pelite  as  seen  in southern  drill  holes.    South  of  these  drill  intersections,  additional  slump  breccias  also outcrop.  Slumps are chiefly lime or locally mud hosted.  Fragments include: limestone clasts, which may be fossiliferous containing Archaeocyathids, well-bedded or breccias; calcareous  pisolites and  ooids;  phosphatic  nodules;  and  various  siliciclastic rocks including  fragments  of  Unit  1.    Clasts  are  generally  elongate  and  range  from  a  few millimetres up to 10 m in diameter. Slumps rest locally with erosional unconformity on Unit 1, although, in southern drill intersections, the calcareous pelites of Unit 2B appear to conformably overlie shales of Unit 1.

Unit 3C is in gradational contact with Unit 2B.  It consists of 100 m of black, pyritic, carbonaceous,  fine-grained  clastic  rocks  and  rare  thin  limestone  beds.    Numerous elongate  clasts  of  mudstone,  shale,  siltstone,  and  collophane  occur  as  separate  distinct clasts, as intraformational conglomerates, and as boudinaged beds presumably disrupted by  soft  sediment  deformation.  This  unit  separates  the  Lower  and  Upper  ore  zones. Siliceous sponge spicules found in Unit 3C have been identified as Protospongia of broad Early to Middle Cambrian age.

Unit 3D consists of 20 m of repetitively intercalated 2 cm to 1 m thick beds of calcic and phosphatic limestone slump breccias, mudstone, shale and siltstone that conformably

overlie  Unit  3C.    Slump  breccias  contrast  with  Unit  2B  in  that  the  breccia  beds  are characteristically thin and contain smaller, compositionally less variable, well sorted and bedded  fragments.  Fragments  include  limestone  clasts,  black  phosphatic  nodules,  and siliciclastic rocks.  Metasomatized calcic limestones within Unit 3D form the basal unit of the Upper ore zone. .

Unit  3E  is  in  gradational  contact  with  Unit  3D,  as  slump  breccias  die  out  and  the sequence  becomes  dominantly  pelitic.  The  unit  consists  of  60  m  of  finely  interbanded black to brown  mudstones,  shales, and siltstones, with limestone beds scattered throughout.  The central portion of Unit 3E, with up to 20% limestone beds, hosts the middle part of the Upper ore zone.

Unit  3F  is  similar  to  Unit  3E,  consisting  of  30  m  of  intercalated  compositionally distinct  layers  commonly  less  than  10  cm  in  thickness.  The  central  part  of  Unit  3F contains  up  to  35%  limestone  beds  which  are  host  to  the  upper  part  of  the  Upper  ore zone.

Unit 3G, a 20 m thick cliff forming unit of light coloured talc-tremolite dolomite with thin shale interbeds, conformably caps the Upper ore zone.

Unit  3H  consists  of  90  m  of  black,  carbonaceous,  pyritic,  fissile  shale  which  is characterized by strong limonite staining on surface exposures.

Unit 4 consists of at least 50 m of black, carbonaceous, fossiliferous flagstones and shale.  Abundant  graptolite  fossils  include  late  Ordovician  species  (all  the  above  from Atkinson and Baker 1979).

The  Lower  zone,  while  dipping  in  the  same  general  direction  as  the  Upper  zone, contains a 'Z' fold (viewed down plunge to the west), with an amplitude of about 90 m. It has been suggested that in fact the fold is a fault, as there is significant fault material associated  with  it.  The  Lower  zone  unconformably  overlies  the  phyllite  unit  which

comprises a substantial thickness of folded schistose micaceous phyllite of Cambrian age. This rock forms the local base of the geological succession.

The entire sequence is overthrust to the north, producing a recumbent isoclinal fold with an axis that plunges at a shallow angle (about 16º) to the west in the west, and at a shallow angle to the east at the eastern end of the deposit.  This gives the upper limb of the 2B horizon a slightly domed appearance.

The Cirque Lake quartz monzonite stock cuts across the skarn succession on the north face  of  Mount  Allan,  penetrating  the  succession  in  large  apophyses,  dikes,  and  sills. Samples taken from the granite are reported to contain from 4 ppm to 20 ppm tungsten, and variable amounts of molybdenum, beryllium, and tin.

The deposit is cut and offset by numerous steeply dipping northerly trending faults. Some  of  the  faults  have  displacements  of  up  to  30  m  or  more,  as  interpreted  by Strathcona  (1982),  and  up  to  45  m  as  recorded  in  the  Mactung  Project  Scope  Book (1984).  The faults are generally characterized by up to one metre of clay and sand gouge, with breccia zones of quartz, calcite, and ice-filled pore space.

## 8 DEPOSIT TYPES

The ore genesis at Mactung is characterized as a contact metasomatic skarn formed by  magmatic  hydrothermal  fluids  originating  from  a  Cretaceous  granitic  stock.    The fluids  migrated  via  channel  ways  to  react  with  permeable  limestone  strata  of  Lower Palaeozoic age depositing scheelite mineralization.

## 9 MINERALIZATION

The mineralogy of the Mactung deposit was described in detail by Dick and Hodgson (1982) and the alteration facies by the Mactung Project Scope Book (1984).

The skarns associated with the metamorphosed limestone units may be divided into two main facies: garnet-pyroxene and pyroxene-pyrrhotite. Scheelite occurs predominantly  with  pyrrhotite  in  the  pyroxene-pyrrhotite  facies.    In  this  facies,  the scheelite  content  increases  and  grain  size  decreases  with  pyrrhotite  content.    Minor scheelite also occurs in the garnet facies, and is coarser grained than that of the pyrrhotite facies.

Scheelite  occurs  in  five  separate  skarn  horizons  formed  from  lime  rich  layers  in  a 300m thick  sequence  of  Lower  Cambrian  metasediments  that  lie  near  the  margin  of  a Cretaceous stock.  Locally, the rocks include phyllite (Unit 1), fragmental limestone (Unit 2B),  hornfels  (Unit  3C),  calc  silicate  and  pyrrhotite  skarns,  limestone,  phosphatic limestone (Units 3D, 3E, 3F) and black shale (Unit 4).

Pyrite  is  widely  disseminated  in  some  of  the  phyllite  layers  of  the  lower  unit,  with galena  and  sphalerite  occurring  in  small  quartz  veinlets.    Scheelite  is  the  economic mineral  of  interest  at  Mactung,  with  wolframite  reported  only  occasionally  in  biotite skarn.  Chalcopyrite is main base metal found in the deposit, but the grade of 0.2% Cu is probably too low for commercial exploitation.

The  Upper  Skarn  unit, which  is approximately 30 m  thick, is composed  of interbedded shale and white limestone that is often phosphatic because it contains fine grained  apatite.    Scheelite  and  pyrrhotite  occur  in  veins,  fractures,  and  disseminations. The limestone is generally recrystallized to white marble and varieties of skarn variably described  as  greenish,  fine-grained  diopside-hedenbergite,  with  local  red-brown  garnet with  various  amounts  of  pyrrhotite.    Tremolitic  amphibole  and  biotite-rich  skarns  are described as occurring in patches, derived from pyroxene skarn. The retrograde skarns

are  enriched  in  scheelite  compared  to  the  disseminated  forms  found  elsewhere.    An argillite,  siltstone  and  hornfels  unit  of  indeterminate  thickness,  containing  interbedded limestone and marble, overlies the Upper Skarn and outcrops mainly to the west of the deposit.

The  main  hornfels  unit,  which  separates  the  Upper  and  Lower  Skarn  Zones,  is approximately 100 m thick. The hornfels is a light to dark brown or black and represents metamorphosed  shales  and  siltstones  with  various  amounts  of  muscovite,  biotite  and graphite.  Numerous thin veinlets of quartz or quartz carbonate cut the unit, containing pyrite, pyrrhotite, scheelite, and molybdenite.

The  close  spatial  association  with  the  tungsten  deposit,  the  presence  of  abundant accessory garnet and quartz-tourmaline veins within the Cirque Lake stock led previous workers  to  suggest  that  hydrothermal  fluids  originated  from  this  stock.  However, Atkinson and Baker (1979) state that this simple interpretation was not compatible with critical  geological  observations,  notably  that  no  ore  is  developed  in  contact  with  the stock. They concluded that the Mactung deposit is only coincidentally located near the contact with the Cirque Lake stock and that the source of mineralizing fluids is probably a blind stock located immediately south of Mactung. Support for this theory is found in the work of Selby et al. (2003) who indicate that the U-Pb and Re-Os age data suggest that the exposed Mactung (Cirque Lake) stock is not the source of the ore-fluid for the tungsten skarns and that the progenitor pluton for the ore-fluid is unknown.

## 10 EXPLORATION

Between 1962, when the Mactung deposit was discovered and staked, and 1985, a total of about 26 million dollars was spent by Amax on exploration and development, and a further 1.6 million was spent by NATCL in 2005.

Geological mapping, geochemical sampling, and magnetometer surveys were carried out in 1963, 1964, and 1967.  The deposit gave rise to patchy magnetic readings.  Surface diamond drill  programs  followed  in  1968,  1971  and  1972,  and  an  adit  into  the  Lower Zone (2B) and an underground drill programme (43 drill holes totalling 1,653 m) were completed in 1973.  During the years 1974 to 1978, Amax changed their emphasis away from geology to environmental, metallurgical, and engineering studies.  In 1979, the adit was  reopened  and  more  bulk  samples  of  the  mineralization  taken  for  metallurgical testing.  Another eight holes (668 m) were drilled from the underground workings, and another seven holes (1,113 m) on surface.  The year 1980 saw another ten surface holes completed  (2,305  m).    From  1982  to  1985,  drill  core  was  relogged,  and  extensive environmental and engineering studies completed, culminating in the Initial Environmental Evaluation in 1983 (International Environmental Consultants 1983) and the  Mactung  Project  Scope  Book  (1984).    The  property  was  dormant  from  1985  until 2005,  when  DJ  Drilling  of  Watson  Lake,  under  contract  to  North  American  Tungsten, carried  out  a  25  hole  (6,639  m)  surface  diamond  drilling  programme  on  the  west  and deeper end of the deposit.  At the same time, the adit was reopened and a metallurgical test bulk sample of approximately 79 tonnes blasted by Mainstreet Mining of Whitehorse. This  sample  is  being  held  for  possible  future  testing.    Environmental  and  permitting studies started the same year by EBA Engineering are ongoing.

## 11 DRILLING

Between 1968 and 2005, a total of 169 surface and underground diamond drill holes, with an aggregate depth of 23,158 m, were completed on the property.  Fifty-one of these holes (7,614 m) were drilled underground from the adit.  Strathcona states that 93 of the Amax surface drill hole collars were surveyed, as well as 11 of the 51 underground drill holes  (Strathcona  1982).    The  remaining  underground  hole  locations  were  determined from the underground development survey performed in 1980 and the original diamond drill log.  Four surface holes drilled in 1980 were for testing of the mill site and tailings impoundment areas.  All of the 2005 drill collars were surveyed by Underhill Geomatics of Whitehorse using a differential GPS system.  In 1981 and 1982, the project site was resurveyed and the local mine grid, which exists in both imperial and metric forms, was reconciled  to  the  UTM  NAD27  grid.  This  work  was  updated  in  2005  by  Underhill Geomatics of Whitehorse who converted the NAD 27 collars to a NAD 83 datum that is currently in use.

Most of the drill holes that intersected the deposit were collared on the south facing slopes  of  Mount  Allan,  and  drilled  at  an  angle  of  about  seventy  degrees  to  the  north, which is approximately perpendicular to the dip of the sedimentary bedding in most of the  deposit.    In  the  earlier  drilling  north-south  drill  hole  section  lines  were  spaced  at intervals of 30 m (100 ft.), but this was increased to 60 m (200 ft.) in 2005 owing to the good  continuity  of  the  mineralization  along  strike  from  east  to  west.    Holes  were generally  placed  from  40  m  to  60  m  apart  up  and  down  the  dip  of  the  mineralized horizons.  The closer spacing was indicated because there was more variability of both tungsten grade and of thickness of mineralization in this direction.

## 12 SAMPLING METHOD AND APPROACH

## 1968-1983

In plan, the Mactung deposit extends approximately 700 m from east to west with a maximum width of about 500 m from north to south.  Nearly all of the diamond drilling in the current computerized diamond drill hole database is within this area.  The original drilling by Amax from 1968 to 1980 was done on an imperial grid that had north-south drill section lines at 30 m (100 ft.) intervals, with holes generally spaced along the lines at 30 m to 60 m intervals.  Drill core sample lengths were routinely 1.5 m (5 ft.), but varied from 0.3 m to 3.05 m with very minor exceptions.

The drill core and samples have not been examined by Scott Wilson RPA, however, sample data in the form of drill logs, assay sheets, and the computerized diamond drill hole database have been reviewed and used in the current resource estimate.

## 2005

The 2005 drilling program was designed to test the Lower Zone (2B) at the west end of  the  deposit  where  it  was  open  on  strike  to  the  west.    All  holes  also  incidentally intersected the Upper Zone.  The objective was to upgrade a large block of mineralization designated as 'inferred reserves' by Strathcona, to the Indicated Resource category, and extend the known mineralization as far to the west as possible.

The NQ size core recovered by the drillers was logged for geology and core recovery, and RQD measurements made.  Recoveries were at, or close to, 100% for the most part. The core was also examined with a short wavelength ultraviolet lamp, which causes any scheelite  on  the  surface  of  the  drill  core  to  fluoresce  a  bright  bluish  white,  and  visual estimates of the scheelite content made.  These estimates were typically overstated, but did provide a relative estimate of the grade that could be used as a check against the final assay results.

Because of the good continuity of the mineralization along strike from east to west, holes were drilled on north-south section lines that were 60 m apart on a grid.  This was done by extending the existing Amax grid to the west.  Holes were placed at 40 m to 60 m intervals  up  and  down  the  dip  of  the  mineralized  horizons,  because  there  was  more variability of both tungsten grade and thickness of mineralization in this direction, which justified the closer interval.  Hole dips and bearings were measured with a 'Flexit' down hole magnetic survey instrument, but only the dip was used, because the effects of any local pyrrhotite, some of which is magnetic, could not be predicted.  Some acid tests were also done.

Surface diamond drill hole MS156 was collared beside old hole MT72071 and in the same  direction  and  at  the  same  dip.    The  width  and  grade  encountered  in  the  '2B' horizon by these two holes were very similar (35.3 m grading 1.55% WO3 in hole MS156 and 32.0 m grading 1.66% WO3 in hole MT72071).

## BULK SAMPLES

A  300  ton  underground  bulk  sampling  was  sent  to  Colorado  for  metallurgical  test purposes  in  1973  (Amax  Exploration  1973).    The  average  calculated  grade  of  the  55 muck samples that were composited for this work was 1.66% WO3, while the average grade for all the muck samples in the bulk sampling area was 1.46% WO3.  The averaged grade for a set of underground chip samples taken during the same summer was 1.62% WO3.  Grades are higher than the average grades for the Lower Skarn unit because the underground  development  passed  through  a  higher  grade  portion  of  it.    Average calculated  underground  diamond  drill  hole  grades  were  calculated  by  Strathcona  to  be highest  closest  to  the  walls  of  the  adit  at  1.73%  WO3  (Strathcona  1982).  The  average grade of the 28 channel samples taken in the adit in 2005 was also 1.73% WO3.

Metallurgical  test  bulk  samples  were  taken  from  both  surface  and  underground  in 1979, and most recently a 79 tonne bulk sample was taken from underground in 2005. The grade and potential  metallurgical  recoveries  of  this  last  sample  have  not  yet  been determined.

## 13 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND SECURITY

## 1968-1980

Scott  Wilson  RPA  has  not  reviewed  the  sampling  procedures  for  the  drill  holes  or bulk sampling.  Based on the Strathcona report, however, no irregularities were found in the drilling or sampling procedures.

## 2005

Diamond drill core selected for assaying was marked off in the core box using a red crayon, and a metal tag with the sample number inscribed on it, nailed to the core box at the  start  of  the  sample  run.    A  pre-numbered  paper  sample  tag  was  placed  with  it.    A record of the sample 'from' and 'to' was made in the sample book on the appropriate sample ticket stub.  This information was also recorded on the drill log along with the sample number and the recovered length of core, which was usually 100%.  Diamond drill core, which was mainly sampled in lengths of 1.5 m, was split with a hydraulic core splitter set up in a room attached to the core storage shed on the Mactung property.  Some core was split with a diamond saw.  Once the sample was split, it was placed in a large polyethylene bag, which also had the sample number marked on it in black felt marker. This bag was then placed inside a second identical bag and the paper sample tag placed between the two bags, which were then sealed with a single plastic tie.  The samples were transported in rice bags, each rice bag containing about five samples.  The rice bags were sealed  with  a  numbered  plastic  security  tie  and  shipped  by  commercial  carrier  from Whitehorse  or  Watson  Lake  to  Global  Discovery  Laboratories  (Global  Discovery)  in Vancouver.    Sample  pulps  were  shipped  by  Global  Discovery  to  ALS  Chemex  of Vancouver  and  Becquerel  Laboratories  of  Toronto  for  further  assaying.    The  assay methods used by these companies are given in Appendix 1.

## DUPLICATES

All duplicate testing for Mactung was performed on splits from the same pulps used for the original assays.  The duplicate program did not include analysis of separate splits

from  the  core.    Consequently,  the  results  from  the  various  check  assay  programs  at Mactung are primarily a measure of laboratory precision and accuracy rather than sample variability and/or bias.  Future programs should include analysis of separate splits of core to  assess  the  variability  in  sampling.    Check  assays  were  performed  by  a  number  of laboratories  over  the  years,  including  Bondar  Clegg  (Vancouver),  Chemex  (North Vancouver), Warnock Hersey (Vancouver), and Crest Laboratories (Vancouver).

Scott Wilson RPA reviewed analytical results and found that differences in the means for  original  and  duplicate  analytical  results  were  statistically  significant  at  a  95% confidence interval for two sets of paired original and check assays.  In both cases the original assays were done at Amax's own laboratories, while the checks were performed at Chemex and Bondar Clegg respectively.  A scatter chart of original versus duplicate samples for the largest data set (Chemex) is depicted in Figure 13-1, while Table 13-1 summarizes the results of   tests for paired duplicate samples from various labs, including t the paired Amax/Chemex assays.

Where the absolute value of the   statistic exceeds the critical value for a 5% level of t significance, the difference is said to be statistically significant at that level (i.e., there is at least a 95% probability that the difference is significant).  Those with high   statistics t indicate a higher probability of statistically different means.

While the analysis indicated that differences in means are statistically significant at a 5% level of significance for two sets of paired data, the magnitude of the difference for the largest data set (Chemex colour) is only 5.3%.  It is probable that some laboratory bias exists in both the Chemex and Bondar Clegg colour assays when compared to the original  Amax  assays,  although  the  bias  is  in  opposite  directions.    Irrespective  of  the potential for bias, the differences are not large and, in Scott Wilson RPA's opinion, not material to the mineral resource estimates contained in this report.  In the 2005 duplicate program (Becquerel), the difference between the means of the original and check assays is only 1%.

## 14 DATA VERIFICATION

## 2005 DATA VERIFICATION

On  August  19,  2005,  R.B.  Cook  visited  the  Mactung  property.    Andy  Hureau provided an overview of the property geology and showed the writer cores of four drill holes from the surface drill program then in progress.  Under Cook's direction, the half core from three previously sawn samples was quarter sawn.  These samples were bagged, tagged, and sealed in a larger plastic bag by Cook and they remained in his possession for the  trip  back  to  Toronto.    The  bag  of  samples  was  dispatched  by  courier  to  the  SGS laboratory in Don Mills.  Analysis for tungsten by ICP and Au by fire assay/flame AA finish was requested and the results are listed in Table 14-1.

SGS  is  accredited  to  the  ISO17025  Standard  by  Certificate  number  456.    The analytical procedures used by SGS are outlined in Appendix 1.

TABLE 14-1   ASSAYS OF QUARTER SAWN DRILL CORE, DDH MS-157 North American Tungsten Corporation Ltd. - Mactung Property

Clearly  there  is  a  significant  amount  of  tungsten  in  the  material  sampled.  The difference  between  the  original  assays  and  the  SGS  assay  values  could  easily  be explained  by  the  very  coarse  nature  of  the  mineralization.  The  mineralization  assayed should not be taken as representative of the grade of the mineralized zones.

## SCOTT WILSON RPA DATA VERIFICATION

Assay data provided to Scott Wilson RPA was in the form of Excel TM spreadsheets. Scott Wilson RPA independently verified a portion of the database by randomly selecting a hole on each drill section and comparing the WO3 values in the provided data with the assay certificates and/or assay sheets from the various labs.  Data from the 2005 drilling program  was  compared  against  Excel TM spreadsheets  provided  by  the  labs  while  data from earlier drilling programs was verified by using scanned handwritten or typed assay sheets.  Much of the scanned data did not identify the lab.  In total, assay results for the mineralized portions of 31 holes drilled within the four interpreted zones were verified.

Other than a small transcription error in one interval, no errors were found in the data, however, the data needs to be better organized and consolidated.  The database originally provided to Scott Wilson RPA did not contain the check assays and survey information was not  well  organized.    Collar  locations  and  azimuths  were  reported  on  a  number  of different grids and a few discrepancies were present in the initial data provided.  The files containing the assay certificates were not labelled logically and Scott Wilson RPA did not receive  some  of  the  certificates  until  after  the  data  verification  exercise  was  complete. Consequently, some sequences of data could not be verified from the original certificates. While  not  material  to  the  mineral  resource  estimates  contained  in  this  report,  it  is recommended  that  these  deficiencies  be  addressed  forthwith.    The  use  of  database management software such as Access TM should be considered.

## 15 ADJACENT PROPERTIES

There are no adjacent mineral properties to the Mactung deposit.  Approximately 8 km to the southeast, near MacMillan Pass, there are two Sedex Zn-Pb prospects, the Tom and Jason.

## 16 MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING

Previous  metallurgical  test  work  indicates  that  the  Mactung  mineralization  can  be processed to produce marketable concentrates, using conventional flotation and gravity separation techniques, similar to the Cantung mill flowsheet.  The expected mill recovery will  range  from  80%  to  85%  depending  on  the  feed  grade  from  the  mine  and  the concentrate grades produced (Olin and McAndrew 1980).  Operational design parameters have been identified including mesh of grind, flotation conditioning times and temperatures, reagent consumptions plus consideration of pre-flotation of sulphides and sulphide  depression  techniques.    Both  an  all  flotation  circuit  and  a  more  conventional gravity/flotation circuit have been evaluated in the past.  With advances in new gravity recovery  equipment  over  the  past  20  years,  the  final  decision  as  to  which  circuit  is selected  will  have  to  be  re-evaluated.    Both  processes  will  produce  high  quality concentrates as well as intermediate to low grade products. Technology exists to convert all  concentrates  to  ammonium  paratungstate,  the  next  intermediate  step  in  producing tungsten powder.

## 17 MINERAL RESOURCE AND MINERAL RESERVE ESTIMATES

## MINERAL RESOURCES

## SUMMARY

Scott  Wilson  RPA  has  completed  a  3D  solid  model,  or  wireframe,  and  2D  block model for the Mactung property.  The 2D model is a gridded seam model (GSM) and contains two separate estimates of grade (Kriged &amp; Polygonal) and a single estimate of thickness  for  each  block.    Scott  Wilson  RPA  considers  the  kriged  estimate  more appropriate for this deposit.  Tables 17-1 and 17-2 summarize the kriged estimates.

These estimates, which are based on assays capped at unique levels for each zone, are reported at a block cut-off of 0.5 % WO3, which Scott Wilson RPA considers appropriate for  the  location  and  cost  profile  that  can  be  expected  for  Mactung.    CIM  definitions (December  2005)  were  followed  for  the  classification  of  the  mineral  resources.    Scott Wilson RPA estimates an average drill spacing of 50 m based on the average distance between each composite and its four nearest neighbours.  Scott Wilson RPA considers the spacing close enough to classify approximately 76% of the resources as indicated.

Further drilling is required to improve the reliability of the mineral resource estimates for the upper 3 zones (3D, 3E, and 3F) as well as on the periphery and northern portions of  all  four  zones.    Initial  efforts  should  focus  on  the  areas  of  the  deposit  where  higher grade intercepts have not been entirely closed off by peripheral drilling.  Assessments of grade variability indicate a maximum drill spacing in the range of 120 m to classify any portion of the resource as indicated category, although this must be confirmed by further drilling in the upper 3 zones.

## DATABASE - GENERAL DESCRIPTION

The  mineral  resource  estimates  for  the  Mactung  project  are  based  on  information from surface and underground drilling supplemented in part by surface and underground mapping.  The collar database provided to Scott Wilson RPA contains 168 drill holes, of which 161 were used for grade interpolation.  Those drill holes within the modeled area cover a 1,000 m (E-W) by 700 m (N-S) area.  Holes vary in length from 5 m to 450 m and  the  average  spacing  in  plan  is  estimated  at  50  m  based  on  the  average  distance between each composite and its four nearest neighbours.  Most surface holes are drilled toward the north at -50 degrees to -90 degrees (vertical), with the majority drilled at -70 degrees.  Underground holes are drilled at various horizontal and vertical angles (up and down) from the underground drifting in the upper 2B horizon.

## ASSAYS

The assay database provided to Scott Wilson RPA for the Mactung Project contains 6,311 assay intervals, of which all but 414 contain assay values of 0.01% WO3 or greater. A total  of  3,738  intervals  are  located  within  the  interpreted  mineralized  zones.    Assay intervals  vary  from  0.3  m  to  over  8  m  in  length,  although  most  are  1.5  m.    The  data approximate a normal distribution when transformed to natural log values (lognormal).  A brief  statistical  summary  of  WO3  assays  within  the  interpreted  mineralized  zones  is provided in Table 17-3.

Note: Only those assays within the interpreted mineralized zones are reported.

## GEOLOGICAL MODEL

For the purpose of resource estimates, the Mactung deposit has been modeled as four sheet-like mineralized envelopes dipping roughly S30°W at -20°.  Thickness averages 18 m and varies from less than 1 m to over 50 m.  The four main zones have been further subdivided  by  three  main  faults  and  a  fold  structure  to  produce  12  individual  lenses. Scott  Wilson  RPA  based  its  interpretation  primarily  on  the  previous  historic  estimate (Strathcona  1982),  although  subsequent  drilling  has  led  to  some  changes,  particularly around the fault structures.  Scott Wilson RPA modeled the hanging wall and footwall surfaces  for  each  lens  using  an  external  cut-off  of  0.4%  WO3,  creating  3D  solids,  or wireframes, representing the 12 mineralized envelopes.  These envelopes were used to control compositing and block selection in subsequent interpolation runs.

## ASSAY CAPPING (CUTTING)

In  order  to  reduce  the  influence  of  statistically  anomalous  sample  data  on  resource estimations, a number of higher-grade assay values are often capped prior to compositing at levels determined by various means, including examination of probability distribution data.    Scott  Wilson  RPA  produced  plots  of  the  WO3  distribution  for  each  of  the  four zones  using  the  assay  data  provided.    The  distribution  curves,  which  can  be  found  in Appendix 2, exhibit obvious breaks or inflection points in the upper parts of the curves and a general tailing off beyond these points.  These breaks often indicate the existence of several  distinct  populations  within  the  grouped  data,  with  upper  values  representing  a very small fraction of the total population.

Scott Wilson RPA selected the upper break in the distribution curve as caps for assay data.  In total, 37 assay intervals were capped.  These intervals represent less than 1% of the total number of assays  0.01 % WO3.  The net impact of the capping was to reduce the  average  assay  grade  within  the  interpreted  zones  by  0.7%  of  the  uncapped  mean grade.  Table 17-4 provides a summary of capping statistics for the Mactung data.  All data above the stated capping levels were set back to these levels prior to compositing.

## COMPOSITES

Composites, which were produced by Scott Wilson RPA for a 'gridded seam' or 2D model,  are  based  on  single  intercepts  for  each  drill  hole  that  pierces  a  lens.    Assay

intervals  for  each  drill  hole  were  composited  down  the  hole  from  the  top  of  the interpreted mineralized envelope to the point of exit, producing a single length-weighted average grade for each intercept.  The composites were tagged with a unique code for each lens to control composite selection in subsequent grade interpolation runs.  In Scott Wilson RPA's opinion, the 2D method is ideally suited to the Mactung deposit because of the  limited  thickness  of  each  lens.    A  summary  of  composite  statistics  is  provided  in Table 17-5.

## BLOCK MODEL AND GRADE ESTIMATION PROCEDURES

Scott Wilson RPA built a 'gridded-seam' model (GSM) based on blocks with fixed EW and NS dimensions and variable vertical thickness.  Individual block dimensions are 10  m  EW  by  10  m  NS  in  plan.    In  the  Mactung  GSM  model,  each  block  carries  an interpolated 'vertical thickness' value based on the difference between the elevations of the modeled hanging wall and footwall surfaces at block centre.  Often, the thickness is interpolated along with grade, using the composite thicknesses.  In the case of Mactung, some of the holes were drilled from development within the upper 2B horizon, resulting in  a  number of composites which are shorter than the actual thickness of the lens.  As well, some surface holes did not exit the mineralized horizons.  Use of these composites to  interpolate  thickness  would  have  inevitably  resulted  in  an  underestimate  of  block thickness.    As  an  alternative,  the  3D  location  of  the  hanging  wall  and  footwall  pierce points were used to model the two surfaces.  For drilling that did not completely pierce a

particular lens (both underground and surface holes), only the point of contact with the hanging wall or footwall was used.

Each block with its centre located within the interpreted zone was assigned a zone code that matched the composites.  A separate 'seam' is reserved for each lens, resulting in a total of 12 seams, or 2D matrices, representing the various components or fault/fold blocks  of  the  four  mineralized  horizons  (2B,  3D,  3E,  3F).    Each  seam  is  assigned  a unique code and grades estimated using only those composites with matching codes.  For reporting purposes, the estimated grades for each block are weighted by their corresponding thickness values and assigned densities.

Ordinary  kriging  and  polygonal  methods  were  utilized  to  estimate  grades  for  each block.  The polygonal method assigns each block within a particular seam the grade of the closest matching composite while the kriged grade is based on a weighted average of the surrounding matching composites.  Grade estimates were based on 2D searches with the  distance  in  the  XY  plane  only  considered.    Scott  Wilson  RPA  reviewed  the variography for the deposit and a reasonable model was developed, however, the nugget value is relatively high, indicating high grade variability between closely spaced holes. Small-scale faulting may be, in part, responsible for the variability.  More close-spaced drilling,  particularly  in  the  three  upper  horizons,  would  help  in  providing  a  more definitive  assessment  of  the  spatial  continuity  for  the  grades  and  structures  within  this deposit.    Table  17-6  summarizes  the  parameters  for  the  variogram  model  used  for Mactung.  Models for 3D and 2B are depicted graphically in Figures 17-1 and 17-2.

The minimum and maximum numbers of composites used in kriging interpolations were set at 2 and 4, respectively.  This allows a grade to be estimated for any block with two or more holes within the search area but prevents over-smoothing the estimate by using too many composites.  The search strategy employed by Scott Wilson RPA was based on two passes with a maximum search distance of 120 m (major) x 120 m (minor) on the first pass and 80 m (major) x 80 m (minor) on the second pass.   The second pass also  required  that  the  closest  composite  be  no  more  than  60  m  from  the  block  centre. Those  blocks  that  meet  the  search  criteria  in  the  second  pass  are  overwritten  while leaving other blocks unchanged from the first pass.  The two-pass strategy allows most blocks within the interpreted envelopes to receive grade estimates on the first pass, while using a tighter search on the second pass to reduce the influence of distant composites on grade  estimates  close  to  the  drill  holes.    Grade  estimates  were  made  using  only  the composite values derived from the capped assays.

Finally, after completing the grade interpolations, overall grades were calculated by weighting  the  block  grades  by  the  thickness  of  each  block  within  the  interpreted mineralized  envelopes.    A  minimum  vertical  thickness  of  4.5  m  was  applied  to  each block,  diluting the grade  accordingly,  if  required. The  tonnage  is  estimated  by multiplying their respective volumes by the SG.  For the purposes of the estimates, an SG of 2.99 was used for 3D, 3E and 3F, while a value of 3.14 was used for 2B.  The latter is based  on  densities  established  by  the  underground  bulk  sample  taken  from  2B.    Scott Wilson RPA has not reviewed any data or calculations related to the SG determination. Strathcona used identical values in their estimates while the preceding study (Steininger 1980)  used  an  SG  of  3.08  for  the  upper  horizons.    Application  of  the  methodology described above resulted in the estimates of mineral resources summarized in Tables 17-7 and 17-8.

Notes:

- 1. CIM definitions were followed for mineral resources.

In  Scott  Wilson  RPA's  opinion,  a  cut-off  of  0.5%  WO3  would  be  appropriate  for reporting purposes.  The current cut-off for North American Tungsten's operating mine is 0.75% WO3; however, should the Mactung property be put into production, it is likely that  its  larger  resource  would  allow  significant  gains  in  economy  of  scale.    Based  on current prices, a case could certainly be made for a lower cut-off, however, from a longterm price and cost perspective, 0.5% WO3 is reasonable.  Tables 17-9 and 17-10 provide estimates  at  increasing  block  cut-off  grades;  however,  caution  is  advised  in  the  use  of higher cut-offs, because the resource breaks up into smaller clusters of blocks as the cutoff increases and may be difficult to mine without encompassing some of the surrounding lower grade material reported at lower cut-off grades.

## MODEL VALIDATION

As part of the block model validation process, polygonal grade estimates were also produced and are provided in Tables 17-7 through 17-10 for comparison purposes.  The polygonal estimates are generally lower in tonnage and higher in grade at lower cut-offs, however, metal content is virtually identical at the selected cut-off of 0.5% WO3.

In  addition  to  producing  parallel  estimates  of  grade  by  polygonal  methods,  Scott Wilson  RPA  conducted  a  series  of  point  validation  exercises  where  the  grade  at  each composite location is estimated from the surrounding composite data by kriging (using the variogram model produced by Scott Wilson RPA) and inverse distance methods and compared to the actual composite values at those locations.  Results are shown in Table 17-11.    Only  those  composites  that  had  a  minimum  of  four  surrounding  composites within the variogram range (120 m) were used in the analysis.  In all, 309 points were estimated from the surrounding data.  While kriging did not model the extremes, as well due to the high nugget value, the mean and median values are closer to the actual values when compared to inverse distance weighting.

Inverse distance cubed (ID ) is often used as an alternative to kriging because grade 3 estimates for blocks that are very close to a composite generally show good agreement with  the  composite  values,  while  block  grade  estimates  between  composites  are  not

overly smoothed like those for inverse distance (ID ) and inverse distance squared (ID ). 1 2 A power of 4 or higher generally produces grade estimates similar to polygonal models, as  can  be  observed  in  the  reported  minimums  and  maximums  in  Table  17-11.    Scott Wilson  RPA  also  analyzed  the  point  validation  results  for  ID   and  kriging  by  linear 3 regression.  As can be seen in Table 17-12, kriging shows marginally better results with a higher correlation coefficient, a lower intercept value, and a slope closer to 1.  A perfect linear correlation would have a 0 Y intercept and a slope of 1.

Based  on  the  comparisons  of  means  and  medians  for  actual  versus  predicted composite grades as well as the results of the regression analysis discussed above, it is Scott  Wilson  RPA's  opinion  that  the  kriged  estimates  provide  superior  assessments  of grade variability and distribution compared to inverse distance weighting and polygonal interpolation.

## CLASSIFICATION

CIM definitions (December 2005) were followed for the classification of the mineral resources.    Scott  Wilson  RPA  analyzed  the  drill  spacing  within  the  modeled  area  by estimating the average distance between each composite and its four closest neighbours. For Mactung, this was determined to be 50 m (this is skewed by the higher density of drilling in 2B).  A common approach is to use a threshold for the maximum spacing of 4/3  the  variogram  range  in  order  to  classify  a  particular  area  as  indicated  and  2/3  as measured.    Because  of  the  numerous  faults  and  high  nugget  values  observed  in  the variography,  it  is  Scott  Wilson  RPA's  opinion  that  the  maximum  drill  spacing  for indicated should be no more than the variogram range for indicated.  Given a maximum

variogram range of 120 m, which should be confirmed by more drilling for the upper 3 zones, the maximum distance from the block centre to the closest composite used in the block grade estimate was set at 60 m (i.e., 120 m spacing) for indicated.  No blocks were classified as measured.  A small portion of the upper 2B lens where the bulk sample was taken  could  be  justifiably  upgraded  to  measured,  however,  Scott  Wilson  RPA  has  not reviewed the bulk sample data.  The 2B middle zone, which is interpreted as the middle limb  of  a  z-fold,  has  been  classified  entirely  as  inferred  due  to  the  limited  number  of intercepts  and  the  presence  of  abundant  fault  material  that  may  suggest  the  limb  is actually a fault zone rather than the limb of a fold.

## 18 OTHER RELEVANT DATA AND INFORMATION

## ENVIRONMENTAL

Preliminary  baseline  environmental  studies,  including  surveys  of  avifauna  (Amax 1983,  Hayes  and.  Mossop  1981),  terrestrial  fauna  (Gill  1978),  fish  (Kershaw  and Kershaw 1983), geomorphology (Kershaw 1976), vegetation (Kershaw and Gill 1979), archaeological considerations (Gotthard 1981), water quality (Orecklin et al. 1981), air quality  and  meteorology  (International  Environmental  Consultants  1983),  were  carried out  by  a  variety  of  consultants  for  Amax  in  the  late  1970s  and  early  1980s.  An  initial environmental evaluation (Amax 1983) for the Mactung Project was prepared by Amax in  1982.    In  2005,  EBA  Engineering  undertook  an  update  of  the  earlier  environmental studies  and  installed  a  weather  station  at  the  site  and  initiated  new  field  surveys  to examine the wildlife, vegetation, fish, avifauna, hydrology, weather and archaeology of the area, on both the Yukon and NWT sides of the border.  These studies are ongoing.

NATCL has obtained a Class III Yukon Land Use permit to operate a camp and do extensive  diamond  drilling  on  the  Yukon  side  of  the  border.    A  water  licence  is  not required for the levels of activity that are currently being undertaken.

## 19 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS

The following interpretations and conclusions are made with respect to the Mactung mineral resource estimated completed by Scott Wilson RPA.

- 1. Scott Wilson RPA completed a solid model, or wireframe, and multiple-seam 2D  GSM  block  model  for  Mactung:    The  2D  model  contains  two  separate estimates  of  grade  (Kriged  and  Polygonal)  and  a  single  estimate  of  vertical thickness  for  each  block  based  on  the  solid  model.    Scott  Wilson  RPA considers the kriged estimate more appropriate for this deposit.  A minimum thickness of 4.5 m has been applied to the model and grades have been diluted to the minimum thickness where necessary.
- 2. The  kriged  estimate  contains  an  indicated  mineral  resource  of  33  million tonnes  grading  0.88%  WO3,  or  290  Kt  of  contained  WO3.    An  additional resource of 11.9 million tonnes grading 0.78% WO3, or 92 Kt WO3, has been estimated  for  the  inferred  category.    These  estimates,  which  are  based  on assays capped at unique levels for each zone, are reported at a block cut-off of 0.5% WO3, which Scott Wilson RPA considers appropriate for the location and cost profile that can be expected for Mactung.
- 3. CIM definitions (December 2005) were followed for the classification of the mineral resources.  Scott Wilson RPA estimates an average drill spacing of 50 m based on the average distance between each composite and its four nearest neighbours.  Scott Wilson RPA considers the spacing close enough to classify approximately 76% of the estimated resources as indicated.
- 4. Both  the  kriged  and  polygonal  estimates  are  virtually  identical  in  terms  of contained  metal  at  the  stated  cut-off,  although  the  polygonal  estimates  are lower in tonnage and higher in grade.
- 5. The resources straddle the Yukon/NWT border.  Approximately 91% of the contained  metal  estimated  for  indicated  category  and  80%  of  the  contained metal for inferred resources are located on the Yukon side of the border.

## 20 RECOMMENDATIONS

Scott Wilson RPA makes the following recommendations:

- 1. Further  drilling  is  required  to  improve  the  reliability  of  the  mineral  resource estimates in the upper 3 zones (3D, 3E and 3F) as well as on the periphery and northerly portions of all zones.  Initial efforts should focus on the areas of the deposit  where  the  higher  grades  have  not  been  entirely  closed  off  by peripheral drilling.  Assessments of grade variability indicate a maximum drill spacing  in  the  range  of  120  m  to  classify  any  portion  of  the  resource  as indicated, although this must be confirmed by further drilling for the upper 3 zones.
- 2. A phased work program is recommended, the first phase of which would be a preliminary economic assessment of the project based on the current mineral resource  estimates.    NATCL  estimates  the  cost  of  the  assessment  to  be approximately $200,000.
- 3. Subject to positive results from the preliminary assessment, a feasibility study should  be  embarked  upon.    Concurrent  with  the  feasibility  work,  a  drilling program  should  be  carried  out;  however,  the  size  and  nature  of  the  drilling program  would  be  contingent  upon  the  results  of  the  preliminary  study. Should that study indicate that the project will have to draw on the inferred resources to produce a positive economic result, a component of the drilling program will have to be aimed at upgrading sufficient resources to satisfy the requirement  that  a  feasibility  (and  reserve)  be  based  on  measured  and indicated resources.  NATCL estimates the cost of the feasibility and drilling to be in the range of $5 million.

## 24 APPENDIX 1

## DESCRIPTION OF ANALYTICAL PROCEDURES

Listed  below  are  the  analytical  procedures  used  by  the  various  laboratories  to determine the elements indicated:

## SGS CANADA INC.

## FAA 313 - LEAD COLLECTION / FIRE ASSAY, FLAME AA FINISH FOR LOW LEVEL GOLD

## Purpose:

This procedure applies to all low level geological samples to be analyzed for gold by lead collection fire assay / AA finish.

## Procedure:

Weigh an assay ton (30 grams) or other weights as per client's instructions into a crucible with 150 grams (or more) of flux, Mix sample, add 1 mg of silver nitrate, cover with borax. Place crucible in furnace for 45 minutes at 1080 C. Pour into cast iron mold, cool, hammer lead button free of slag.  Place lead button on pre-heated cupel at 950 C all lead is removed. Remove from furnace and cool. Digest dore bead by adding 0.5 mls of 1:1 HNO3 and place in a hot water bath for 15 minutes. Add 0.5 mls HCL and return to bath for 60 minutes. Bring to final volume of 5 mls with distilled water.

## Instrumentation:

Samples are analyzed on a Flame AA Instrument equipped with an auto sampler and automatic data capture.

## Quality Control:

A reference material is digested and analyzed with each batch of 28 samples or less to ensure batch accuracy. Duplicates are digested and analyzed every 12th. sample or less to ensure batch precision. A blank is also analyzed in every batch of 28 to monitor contamination.

Data will be deemed acceptable if recovery of gold is ±20% at 5X the L.O.D. and the calculated RSD of duplicates is no more than 15%

## Reporting:

Results from the instruments are processed automatically, loaded into the LIMS where the QC parameters are checked before final reporting.

## Elements and Reporting Limits:

Detection limits

Upper Limits

Au3 5ppb

10,000 ppb

## ICA50 :  ORE GRADE ANALYSIS OF BASE METALS (TUNGSTEN) BY SODIUM PEROXIDE FUSION AND ICP-OES.

## 1. Parameter(s) measured, unit(s):

Cobalt (Co); Copper (Cu); Nickel (Ni); tungsten (WO3)

## 2. Typical sample size:

0.20 g

## 3. Type of sample applicable (media):

Crushed and Pulverized rocks, soils and sediments

## 4. Sample preparation technique used:

Crushed and pulverized rock, soil and /or sediment samples are fused by Sodium peroxide in zirconium crucibles and dissolved using dilute HNO3.

## 5. Method of analysis used:

The digested sample solution is aspirated into the inductively coupled plasma Optical Emission Spectrometer (ICP-OES) where the atoms in the plasma emit light (photons) with characteristic wavelengths for each element. This light is recorded by optical spectrometers and when calibrated against standards the technique provides a quantitative analysis of the original sample.

## 6. Data reduction by:

The results are exported via computer, on line, data fed to the Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS CCLAS EL) with secure audit trail.

## 7. Figures of Merit:

| Element   |   Limit of  Quantification (LOQ)  % | Element   | (LOQ) %   |
|-----------|-------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|
| Co        |                               0.001 | Pb        | 0.007     |
| Cu        |                               0.004 | Zn        | 0.004     |
| Ni        |                               0.005 |           |           |

## 8. Quality control:

The ICP-OES is calibrated with each work order. An instrument blank and calibration check is analyzed with each run. One preparation blank and reference material is analyzed every 46 samples, one duplicate every 12 samples.

All QC samples are verified using LIMS. The acceptance criteria are statistically controlled and control charts are used to monitor accuracy and precision. Data that falls outside the control limits is investigated and repeated as necessary.

## 9. Accreditation:

The Standards Council of Canada has accredited this test in conformance with the requirements of ISO/IEC 17025. See www.scc.ca for scope of accreditation

## ALS CHEMEX

## GEOCHEMICAL PROCEDURE - ME-ICP41

## TRACE LEVEL METHODS USING CONVENTIONAL ICP-AES ANALYSIS

Sample Decomposition:

Nitric Aqua Regia Digestion

Analytical Method:

Inductively Coupled Plasma - Atomic Emission Spectroscopy (ICP - AES)

A prepared sample (0.50 grams) is digested with aqua regia for at least one hour in a graphite heating block.  After cooling, the resulting solution is diluted to 12.5 ml with demineralized water, mixed and analyzed by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry.  The analytical results are corrected for inter-element spectral interferences.

## ORE GRADE ANALYSIS BY XRF - ME-XRF10

Sample Decomposition:

50% Li2B4O7 - 50% LiBO2 (WEI-GRA06)

Analytical Method:

X-Ray Fluorescence Spectroscopy (XRF)

A calcined or ignited sample (0.9 g) is added to 9.0g of Lithium Borate Flux (50 % - 50 % Li2B4O7 - LiBO2), mixed well and fused in an auto fluxer between 1050 - 1100°C. A flat molten glass disc is prepared from the resulting melt. This disc is then analysed by Xray fluorescence spectrometry.

## BECQUEREL

Neutron  Activation  Analysis  (NAA)  is  a  physical  technique  that  is  based  on  nuclear reactions whereby the elemental content is determined by irradiating the subject sample with neutrons, creating radioactive forms of the desired target element in the sample. As the sample becomes radioactive from the interaction of the neutron particle source and the  nuclei  of  the  element's  atoms,  radioisotopes  are  formed  that  subsequently  decay, emitting  gamma  rays  unique  in  half-life  and  energy.  These  distinct  energy-signatures provide  positive  identification  of  the  targeted  element(s)  present  in  the  sample,  while quantification is achieved by measuring the intensity of the emitted gamma rays that are directly proportionate proportional to the concentration of the respective element(s) in the sample.  Since  the  neutrons  activate  the  nucleus  of  the  atom,  this  allows  the  total elemental content to be observed regardless of the oxidation state, physical location, or chemical form of the desired element. Since neutrons possess the ability to pass through most materials  with  little  difficulty,  this  allows  the  center  of  the  sample  to  become  as radioactive as the surface, thereby reducing or even eliminating the potential for matrix effects. Because neutron activation can be applied to any element with an appropriated isotope, nearly 70% of elements in the Periodic Table can be analyzed by NAA.
