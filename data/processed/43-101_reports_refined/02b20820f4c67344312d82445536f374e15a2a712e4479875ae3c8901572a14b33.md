Dear Sirs/Mesdames:

## RE: Adex Mining Inc. - Amended Technical Report

We are filing with this letter an amended technical report entitled 'Amended Technical Report of  the  Mount  Pleasant  Property,  Including  Mineral  Resource  Estimates,  Southwestern  New Brunswick for Adex Mining Inc.' dated April 13, 2012, and amended October 11, 2013.

The  technical  report  has  been  amended  to  address  the  concerns  of  the  Ontario  Securities Commission  as  set  out  in  its  letters  of  August 8  and  September  30,  2013  regarding  the disclosure of the Mineral Resources in two separate reports currently filed on SEDAR (one for  the  North  Zone and  the other for the  Fire Tower  Zone) and the disclosure of results of economic studies.

This  new  report  is  intended  to  combine  the  existing  geological  information  and  Mineral Resource  estimates  as  previously  disclosed  on  the  two  deposits  into  a  single  report.    All references  to  previous  economic  studies  have  also  been  removed.    The  report  has  not otherwise  been  amended  or  updated  and  does  not  address  any  work  which  may  have  been done  in  connection  with  the  Mount  Pleasant  Mine  Property  since  the  original  date  of  the North  Zone  report  (April  2012).    As  such,  there  are  no  new  Mineral  Resource  estimates subsequent to the date of the report, as this additional information has not yet been assembled and analyzed for inclusion in this amended report.

## 1.  SUMMARY

The Mount Pleasant Mine Property ("Mount Pleasant" or "Property") in 1995 was acquired by Adex Mining Inc. (" ADEX "), a Toronto based Canadian junior mineral exploration company. The  Property  is  located  in  Charlotte  County,  New  Brunswick,  and  is  the  site  of  the  past producing  Mount  Pleasant  Tungsten  Mine  ("MPTM")  which  produced  990,200  tonnes grading  0.35% WO3  between  1983  and  1985  from  the  Fire  Tower  Zone.    Other  zones, including  the  predominantly  tin-indium  North  Zone  and  tin,  tungsten,  molybdenite  and bismuth-bearing  Saddle  Zone,  occur  on  the  Property  but  have  never  been  mined.    ADEX trades on the TSX Venture Exchange under the symbol "ADE".

Watts,  Griffis  and  McOuat  Limited  (" WGM ")  was  retained  initially  by  Adex  in  2006  to complete  a  technical  report  of  the  Property  and  prepare  an  'Inferred  Mineral  Resource' estimate  for  the  Fire  Tower  Zone.    In  2008,  WGM  was  retained  to  produce  an  updated technical  report  including  an  updated  Mineral  Resource  estimate  for  the  Fire  Tower  Zone utilizing the Phase I (2008) diamond drilling results.  In 2009, WGM was retained to prepare a technical report including an updated Mineral Resource estimate for the North Zone, and in 2011,  WGM  was  retained  to  prepare  an  updated  Mineral  Resource  estimate  of  the  North Zone, utilizing diamond drilling results from 2010 and 2011.  This report, which includes a re-presentation of the 2008 Mineral Resources for the Fire Tower Zone and updated Mineral Resources for the North Zone, has been prepared in accordance with the Canadian Securities Administrators' National Instrument 43-101 ("NI 43-101") governing standards of disclosure for  mineral  projects.    WGM's  previous  Technical  Reports  on  the  Property  in  2006,  2008 (Amended 2012) and 2009, are available for the reader to review on the SEDAR website at www.sedar.com. Note:  These  reports  are  no  longer  current  and  should  not  be  relied upon.

The Property consists of 1,600 ha of mining claims, located 60 km south of Fredericton, the provincial  capital  city.    The  claims  are  held  under  prospecting  license  14338  by  ADEX Minerals Corp., a 100% owned subsidiary of ADEX, under claim group number 1505. Since the Technical Report on Mount Pleasant (Dunbar and de L'Etoile 2009) was filed, however, New Brunswick has gone from a ground-staked claim system, based upon Magnetic North, to an on-line map staked claim system based upon True (geodetic) North, effective April 14, 2010.  The  present  annual  work  requirement  for  the  Property  is  $81,600,  and  the renewal date is February 2 nd .  On Jan 22, 2010, the annual renewal fee was paid forward for three years, until February 2, 2013.  ADEX reports a current reserve of $652,799.88 available for future renewals.

ADEX holds the surface rights for some 405 hectares of the Property.  The surface rights for the northern part of the North Zone, southern part of the Fire Tower Zone and eastern side of Mount  Pleasant  are  owned  by  third  parties.  ADEX  has  retained  100% ownership  of  the buildings and equipment remaining on the Property

However, the Province of New Brunswick holds a $2.0 million mortgage on the buildings to cover  the  cost  of  building  removal  and  rehabilitation.    The  government  also  holds  a $0.715 million security bond posted by ADEX for mine reclamation.  There may also be a royalty  payment,  in  the  amount  of  $0.10 per ton  of  ore  mined,  payable  to  Mount  Pleasant Mines  Limited,  although  ADEX  has  no  original  documentation  to  confirm  or  deny  the existence of this royalty.

Since  1954,  the  majority  of  the  exploration  work  has  been  focused  on  development  of tungsten-molybdenum deposits of the Fire Tower  Zone  and indium-bearing, tin-base metal deposits of the North Zone.  Work has consisted of extensive surface and underground drilling programs, bulk sampling and metallurgical work.  Surface exploration has included soil and bedrock sampling, ground geophysical surveying, geological mapping, stripping and trenching, and diamond drilling.  Underground exploration and development has included a 1,187 m long access ramp connecting the Fire Tower Zone with the North Zone as well as the excavation  of  several  adits.    Historically,  1,330  surface  and  underground  holes,  totalling 158,561 m, have been drilled and approximately 70% of the resulting core is currently stored at  the  mine  site.  All  historical  drillhole  information  and  assay  results  were  compiled  into  a GEMCOM database between 1995 and 1997.

The  Mount  Pleasant  Tungsten  Mine  was  put  into  production  in  September  1983  at  a  total construction cost of $150 million.  Mining was done by open stoping.  The concentrator was designed to process 650,000 tonnes per year from the Fire Tower Zone and produce 2,0002,500 tonnes per year of 70% WO3  tungsten concentrate (through tungsten magnetic separation) and 700-1,000 tonnes per year of 85% MoS2 molybdenum concentrate (through a leaching process yielding 60% recovery).  Cost overruns, metallurgical problems and falling tungsten  prices  led  to  mine  closure  in  July  1985  after  only  22  months  of  production.    The underground  workings  were  allowed  to  flood  and  the  mine  was  placed  on  care  and maintenance.

During the production period, the mine produced 990,200 tonnes of tungsten ore, all from the Fire  Tower  Zone,  at  an  average  grade  of  0.35% WO3.    There  was  no  attempt  to  extract molybdenum or any other metals.  A total of 2,000 tonnes of tungsten concentrate, grading 70% WO3, was produced.  At the time of closure, the mine reported a total recoverable diluted "mineable  ore reserve" of 6,863,300 tonnes at an average grade of 0.38% WO3  and

0.17% MoS2.    Included  in  the  "reserve"  was  an  inventory  of  800,000  tonnes  of  broken tungsten-molybdenum material, grading approximately 0.39% WO3 and 0.19% MoS2.

In 1996, Kvaerner was contracted to conduct a Feasibility Study to explore the possibility of mining  tin  and  indium  from  the  North  Zone  and  to  prepare  a  "mineral  resource"  estimate, which included an audit and verification of ADEX's "reserve" estimates of the North Zone. Limited additional surface diamond drilling was carried out to support this study.  Kvaerner estimated  a  total  "mineable  resource"  of  3,718,338 tonnes  with  a  grade  of  0.662% Sn, 85.72 ppm In, 0.091% WO3, 0.044% MoS2, 0.150% Cu, 0.050% Pb, 0.089% Bi and 0.695% Zn for the North Zone using a recovery factor of 85%, a dilution factor of 20% and a cutoff grade of 0.1% Sn.  The study concluded that the North Zone deposits were uneconomic due  to  declining  tin  prices  and  high  capital  costs.    This  historic  "reserves  and  resource" estimate was prepared prior to the implementation of NI 43-101.  WGM has neither audited these estimates nor made any attempt to classify them according to NI 43-101 standards, or the  Council  of  the  Canadian  Institute  of  Mining,  Metallurgy  and  Petroleum  definitions (" CIM ")  Standards.    A  Qualified  Person  has  not  done  sufficient  work  to  classify  this historical information as a current Mineral Reserve and as such this estimate should not be relied upon.

In 2008, SRK under contract to WGM, prepared an NI 43-101 and CIM Standards-compliant Mineral  Resource  estimate  of  the  Fire  Tower  West  and  Fire  Tower  North  sub-zones  as follows:

During  2008,  ADEX  completed  a  two-phase,  49  hole  definition  diamond  drilling  program totalling 13,300 m to test both the Fire Tower Zone and North Zone mineralization.  Thirtysix  holes,  for  a  total  of  8,859.1 m,  were  drilled  on  the  North  Zone,  including  three  for metallurgical bench and mineralogical testing. ADEX  also dispatched a total of 1,065 samples consisting of split cores, fill-in samples, pulps and rejects collected from some

124 historical  drillholes  for  assay  verification.    All  new  analytical  data  were  inputted  by ADEX into the existing GEMCOM database.

Subsequently,  SGS-GeoStat  Ltd.  (" SGS-Geostat ")  prepared  a  new  NI  43-101  and  CIM Standards-compliant Mineral Resource estimate of the North Zone as follows:

The Mineral Resources above are based on a SNEQ% cut-off of 0.25%.  The SNEQ% value is a combination of Sn and In as follows: SNEQ% = Sn% + 41.67 In%.

Preliminary mineralogical and liberation studies were completed at SGS Lakefield Research Limited  (" SGS  Lakefield ").    Some  Hydromet  testing  work  was  also  completed.    ADEX contracted  SGS  Lakefield  Resource  Europe  Ltd.  (" SGS Lakefield England ")  of  Cornwall, England,  to  design  a  gravity-flotation  separation  process  for  processing  ore  from  the  Fire Tower  Zone  and  North  Zone  deposits.    A  Baseline  Environmental  Effects  Monitoring Program was completed by Jacques Whitford.  A Preliminary Assessment of the North Zone was filed on SEDAR in 2010 and is entitled, ' NI 43-101 Technical Report Mount Pleasant North Zone Preliminary Assessment, Mount Pleasant Property, Southwestern New Brunswick, Canada ' (Thibault et al. 2010). Note:  This report is no longer current and should not be relied upon.

Geologically, the Mount Pleasant deposits are situated on the southwestern margin of the Late Devonian  Mount  Pleasant  Caldera  ("MPC")  and  are  associated  with  a  post-caldera,  multilayered granitic complex (Granite I, II, III) that intruded along the margin of the MPC. The deposits  are  porphyry  type  and  formed  from  metal-bearing  fluids,  which  evolved  from  the inward-cooling magma body that produced this granitic complex. Older tungsten-

<!-- image -->

molybdenum deposits are genetically related to, and in part hosted within Granite I, whereas younger  indium-bearing  tin-base  metal  deposits  are  related  to,  and  in  part  hosted  within Granite II.    No  significant  mineralization  has  been  found  within  Granite III  although  this granite has not been fully explored.  All deposits occur within 450 m from surface.

The Fire Tower Zone is dominated by tungsten-molybdenum mineralization occurring within three  distinct  deposits,  the  Fire  Tower  North,  the  Fire  Tower  West  and  Fire  Tower  South. Mineralization occurs as veinlets and is disseminated in the matrix of silicified breccia that constitutes part of the Mount Pleasant Porphyry.  Fine-grained wolframite and molybdenite are the principal minerals of economic interest.  Intense greisen-type alteration (quartz-topazfluorite) is associated with higher grade tungsten-molybdenum zones.

The North Zone consists of eight distinct tin-indium-bearing deposits or sub-zones, including three Tin Lodes, consisting of the Deep Tin Zone, Upper Deep Tin Zone, Endogranitic Zone, North  Adit  Zone,  North  W-Mo  Zone  and  the  #1-3,  #4  and  #5  Tin Lodes.    Mineralization occurs  mostly  in  chlorite-altered  and  brecciated  host  rocks  located  adjacent  to  granite  and porphyry  dykes.    Tungsten-molybdenum  mineralization  is  also  present  in  the  "X"  and  "Y" zones,  collectively  referred  to  as  the  North  W-Mo  Zone,  and  is  partly  overprinted  by  tinindium deposits of the North Adit Zone.  The boundaries of each sub-zone are gradational and they commonly cross-cut geological units and structural boundaries.  Consequently, resource boundaries were defined based solely on %Sn and %In values (or %WO3 and %MoS2 values in the case of the North W-Mo sub-zone).  The largest tin-base metal deposits occur along the contact of Granite I or within Granite II. The Deep Tin Zone is the shallowest underground deposit and is hosted within brecciated Granite I.

The  Saddle  Zone,  located  between  the  Fire  Tower  Zone  and  the  North  Zone,  contains  an irregular  distribution  of  tin  mineralization  consisting  of  cassiterite  with  small  amounts  of tungsten, molybdenite and bismuth hosted within Granite II.

Two diamond drilling  programs  were  conducted  in  2010  and  2011,  focussed  on  the  North Zone.  In 2010, 26 holes totalling 3734 m were drilled and sampled; in 2011, 18 holes (1-17, plus  17A)  totalling  7007 m  were  drilled  and  sampled.    The  purpose  of  the  26-hole,  2010 program  was  to  delineate  tin,  indium,  and  zinc  resources  in  the  North  Zone,  which  were known from historical drilling and from ADEX's 2008 program, and to collect geotechnical data (3 holes) to help site a new portal and decline into the North Zone.  Fifteen of the holes were oriented  vertically  and  the  others  were  inclined,  varying  from  -41  to  -75 degrees;  the holes varied in length from 35 to 250 metres.  The purpose of the 18-hole, 2011 program was to further delineate (infill holes) the tin, indium, and zinc resources of the North Zone and to obtain mineralized material for metallurgical testing (three holes).  In addition, the open, east

<!-- image -->

side of the North Zone was drill tested, following up on positive exploration results from the 2010 drill program, and six holes were drilled in the Saddle Zone, located approximately half way between the North and Fire Tower zones, which had not been drilled since 1990.  All of the holes were oriented vertically and varied in length from 75 to 570 metres.

Of the 44 holes drilled (counting AM11-17 and AM11-17A as two) during 2010 and 2011, 38 of the cores obtained were sampled for analysis.  A total of 2318 mineralized samples were collected for assay, 1121 samples from 23 of the 2010 cores, and 1197 samples from 15 of the 2011  cores.    Three  metallurgical  holes  (AM11-10,  AM11-11  and  AM11-12)  were  not assayed.  In  addition,  306  samples  from  historical  holes  were  submitted  to  Actlabs  for  reanalysis.    As  part  of  its  due  diligence  procedures,  ADEX  dispatched  252  pulp  samples  by bonded  courier  to SGS  Canada  Mineral  Services  Inc. (' SGS' ) in Toronto  for assay verification of approximately every 10 th sample that was sent to Actlabs.  In addition, 39 pulp samples from hole LNZ-15 were sent to SGS for re-assay. In 2010, several MPS-series cores were  quartered  and  re-assayed  at  Actlabs  for  indium  only,  because  Brunswick  Tin  Mines (BTM) did not assay for this element at the mine laboratory.  As part of its quality control procedures, Actlabs included one or more of CANMET standards MP-1a, MP-1b and MP-2 in each batch of samples that ADEX submitted for assay during 2010 and 2011.

In  the  authors'  opinion,  the  sample  preparation,  security  and  analytical  procedures  used  by ADEX  conform  to  generally  accepted  practice  of  the  Canadian  mining  industry  and  are appropriate for the purposes of this report.  Mr. Paul Dunbar, QP, made two site visits in 2008 related  to  the  2008  Fire  Tower  Zone  drilling  and  Dr.  Steven  McCutcheon,  independent consultant and QP, made four visits to the Property in 2011, which pertain to the 2010 and 2011 drilling programs.  Sampling intervals were selected by the QP after reviewing the assay data  from  both  the  2010  and  2011  drilling  programs.    In  total,  32  samples  were  taken. Comparison  of  the  results  from  Actlabs  and  SGS  for  these  32  samples  shows  reasonable correlation between the two analytical laboratories for zinc, arsenic, molybdenum and copper. However,  R -values  for  tin,  bismuth,  lead  and  indium  are  0.90,  0.85,  0.85  and  0.77, 2 respectively.  The  low  R -values  most  likely  reflect  the  inhomogeneous  distribution  of  the 2 mineralization  in  the  core,  i.e.    the  quarter-sampled  material  was  different  from  the  splitsampled material.  This is the most reasonable explanation, given the fact that there is good correlation between Actlabs and SGS for re-assays of samples during the entire 2011 drilling program.

Random checks of individual samples revealed that values in ADEX's GEMCOM database were identical to those in the Assay Certificates.  In addition, historical data from C-series, DDH-series, E-series, LNZ-series, MPS-series, and U-series holes in the GEMCOM database of  the  North  Zone  were  randomly  checked  to  verify  which  'NS'  values  for  Zn,  WO3  and

<!-- image -->

MoS2 should be replaced by numeric zero values.  This was done by comparison of assay values in hardcopy assay sheets stored at the mine site with values in an Excel file extracted from the database.  Necessary changes were made to the Excel file and then it was returned to ADEX for incorporation into the database.

Since  the  beginning  of  2009  ADEX  has  conducted  a  series  of  metallurgical  sampling  and testing programs on the North Zone, as follows:

- · Bulk  sample  collection  of  stockpiled  Sn-Zn-In  mineralized  material  from  the  600  Adit dump;
- · Indium-Zinc Hydromet Bench Scale Test to produce zinc metal and indium sponge from zinc concentrate;
- · Flotation  Bench  Scale  Test  to  develop  a  process  flowsheet  to  recover  tin  concentrate, zinc/indium concentrate and bulk sulphide concentrate;
- · Locked  Cycle  Flotation  Test  to  define  a  process  flowsheet  for  zinc,  indium  and  tin recovery as concentrates;
- · Pilot Plant Flotation Test consisting of grinding, desliming, zinc flotation, bulk sulphide flotation, desliming and tin flotation;
- · Indium-Zinc Hydromet Pilot Test to develop a process to produce added value zinc metal and indium sponge from zinc/indium flotation concentrate;
- · Locked Cycle Flotation Test in follow-up to the flotation test program in order to further optimize the flowsheet, reagent dosages, and recoveries of zinc-indium and tin concentrates; and
- · Tin Pyrometallurgical Test to extract tin from a low-grade tin concentrate with elevated arsenic content.

A February 2012 NI 43-101 Mineral Resource estimate has been prepared for the North Zone for the elements Sn, Zn and In. Values for other elements are tabulated in this report as they have potential implications for metallurgical purposes but those elements are not considered as part of the current NI 43-101 resource estimate and they do not contribute to any of the economic parameters used for the estimate.  The minimum cutoff grade and block size used for the estimate were applied with the assumption that a resource with potential bulk mineable characteristics  has  been  appropriately  estimated  using  these  parameters.    Mineral  Resource estimates and contained metal are summarised as follows:

<!-- image -->

| Mineral Resource  Class   |   Tonnage  (Millions of tonnes) |   Cut Sn Grade   (%) |   Cut Zn Grade   (%) |   Cut In Grade   (ppm) |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|------------------------|
| Indicated                 |                            12.4 |                 0.38 |                 0.86 |                   63.5 |
| Inferred                  |                             2.8 |                 0.3  |                 1.13 |                   69.8 |

- 3. The quantity and grade of reported inferred mineral resources in this estimation are uncertain in nature and there has been insufficient exploration to define these inferred resources as an indicated or measured mineral resource and it is uncertain if further exploration will result in upgrading them to an indicated or measured mineral resource category; and
- 4. The mineral resources in this press release were estimated using the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and  Petroleum  (CIM),  CIM  Standards  on  Mineral  Resources  and  Reserves,  Definitions  and  Guidelines prepared by the CIM Standing Committee on Reserve Definitions and adopted by CIM Council November 27, 2010.

Contained Metal, North Zone, Mount Pleasant Property (Capped*)

| Mineral Resource  Class   | Contained Sn (kg)   | Contained Zn (kg)   | Contained In (kg)   |
|---------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Indicated                 | 47,000,000          | 107,000,000         | 789,000             |
| Inferred                  | 8,600,000           | 32,000,000          | 198,000             |

The  North  Zone  Mineral  Resource  estimate  is  based  on  surface  and  underground  diamond drilling totalling 640 drillholes with an aggregate length of 85,515 m done from the 1950s to 2011, and from surface to a maximum depth of 580 metres.  A bulk density factor of 2.70 t/m 3 is assigned for this estimation. There are a total of 27,527 sample intervals that were assayed for  Sn  and  Zn  in  the  filtered  drillhole  database  used  for  estimation  and  74,684.27 m  of  the core was sampled for those elements (87.3% of the total drilled length of 85,515.16 m for the holes in the filtered database).  The mean sample length for the Sn and Zn samples is 2.71 m, the median sample length is 3.04 m and the mode for sample lengths is 3.05 m.  There are substantially fewer samples analysed for In than for Sn and Zn (9,435 samples over 27,813 m in the filtered data, which represents about 33% of the drill core). All elements are composited to  3.0 m  run-length  composites.    Except  for  a  number  of  very  short  and  a  few  long  assay

<!-- image -->

intervals  the  3.0 m  composites  are  not  substantially  different  in  length  than  the  majority  of assay intervals.

The block model configuration was completed based upon a block size of 5 metres for which Sn, Zn and In grades were estimated by an inverse distance squared ('ID ') method.  A dollar 2 equivalent  value,  designated  as  the  Gross  Metal  Value  ('GMV'),  was  calculated  for  each mineralized block by performing a simple manipulation of the block model grade parameters based on prices as listed below and as determined by the following formula:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

The GMV values of 183.72 for Sn, 20.00 for Zn and 6,000.00 for In represent the USD value per  tonne  for  those  metals  assuming  the  3  year  average  of  US$18.37  per kg  of  Sn, US$2.00 per kg  of  Zn  and  US$600.00  per kg  of  In  (the  imperial  equivalents  of  these  are US$8.33 per pound for Sn and US$0.91 per pound for Zn).  Recoveries are assumed to be 100%.

A conceptual mining plan for the North Zone was described in a previous Technical Report, the Mount Pleasant North Zone Preliminary Assessment (Thibault et al. 2010). Note:  This report  is  no  longer  current  and  should  not  be  relied  upon. Various  metallurgical  and hydrometallurgical  test  programs  have  been  completed  on  samples  from  the  North  Zone. However,  a  definitive  flowsheet  for  processing  has  not  been  developed  relative  to  the February, 2012 mineral resource assessment - as defined herein.

The former Mount Pleasant Tungsten Mine site has much of the infrastructure required for mining  of  the  North  Zone.  The  existing  site  infrastructure includes  a tailings pond, administrative  and  warehouse  buildings,  A-Frame  ore  storage  building,  a  concentrator building, a power substation and access roads to the site.

The mine site has been under care and maintenance since 1985.  Mine water that overflows from the flooded Fire Tower Zone workings is currently treated by neutralization with lime, followed by storage in a settling pond to precipitate and store metal hydroxide sludge, prior to the  treated  mine  water  being  discharged  into  the  existing  tailings  pond.    The  mine  water treatment  plant  is  currently  operated  under  New  Brunswick  Approval  to  Operate  I-6154. Water  quality parameters analyzed in monthly  grab  samples  have  typically been in compliance  with  prescribed  limits.    The  overall  tailings  deposition  and  water  management plan  is  not  yet  finalized  and  on-going  studies  are  aimed  to  develop  an  appropriate  tailings management and disposal strategy that is well-suited to the characteristics of the deposit and the existing conditions at the site.

<!-- image -->

The  capital  and  operating  costs  for  both  mining  and  processing  operations  have  not  been updated from the Mount Pleasant North Zone Preliminary Assessment.  Also, there has been no additional work performed on the assessment of North Zone product markets or contracts. The  economic  analysis  and  the  relative  impact  of  the  North  Zone  Mineral  Resources  (as defined herein) on the project economics have not been determined. Note:  This PEA report is no longer current and should not be relied upon.

Based upon the work completed for this report and the previous experience at Mount Pleasant, the authors make a series of interpretations, conclusions and recommendations. The proposed work plan and budget for the North Zone and remaining Mount Pleasant Property (excluding the Fire Tower Zone) amounts to $4,000.000.  The cost of the proposed work plan for the Fire Tower Zone has been estimated at $4.4 million (Dunbar and el-Rassi, 2008, amended 2012).

## 2.  INTRODUCTION AND TERMS OF REFERENCE

## 2.1 INTRODUCTION

In  1992,  Adex  Mining  Inc. (" ADEX ")  was  formed  as  a  junior  mining  company  from  the amalgamation of Adonis Resources Inc. and Belex Mining Corp. after which it commenced operations and began trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange (" TSX ").

ADEX acquired a 100% interest in the Mount Pleasant Mine Property ("Mount Pleasant" or the  "Property")  from  Piskahegan  Resources  Limited (" Piskahegan "),  a  private  company,  in 1995.  The Property is located at Mount Pleasant, New Brunswick, Canada, and is the site of the past producing Mount Pleasant Tungsten Mine.  The mine closed in 1985 due to dropping tungsten prices and metallurgical problems and was placed on care and maintenance.

In  2006,  ADEX  contracted  Watts,  Griffis  and  McOuat  Limited  (" WGM ")  to  conduct  a technical  review  of  Mount  Pleasant  and  to  prepare  a  report  in  compliance  with  Canadian Securities Administrators' National Instrument 43-101 ("NI 43-101").  This report (Dunbar, de  l'Etoile,  El-Rassi,  and  Boyd, 2006)  was  prepared  as  part  of  ADEX's  effort  to  have  a Ministerial  cease-trade  order  (dated  May 27, 1998)  by  the  Ontario  Securities  Commission lifted so that the Company could raise funds to further develop the Property.  The Company was originally de-listed from the TSX for failure to meet minimum listing requirements.  Prior to  the  cease  trade  order,  the  shares  traded  under  the  symbol  "AMG"  on  the  Toronto  Stock Exchange.  ADEX obtained the revocation of the cease trade order on March 23, 2008 and then re-listed its common shares on the TSX Venture Exchange in July, 2007.  ADEX has also been granted an "Approval to Operate" and the tailings dam has also been repaired.  The Company currently trades under the symbol "ADE".

ADEX raised $3.0 million in flow through funding to further explore and develop the Fire Tower  Zone  ('FTZ')  and  the  North  Zone  ("NZ")  deposits.    ADEX  has  further  advanced mineral resource development at Mount Pleasant with the completion of a Phase 1 diamond drilling program and re-sampling programs on the FTZ for delineating additional mineralization and upgrading the previous resource estimate of the FTN and FTW sub-zones.

Since 2006, three NI 43-101 Technical Reports, including Mineral Resource estimates, have been  completed  on  the  Property.    One  was  on  tungsten-molybdenum  mineralization  of  the Fire Tower Zone (Dunbar and El-Rassi 2008, amended September 24, 2012), another was on tin-indium-zinc  mineralization  of  the  North  Zone  (Dunbar  and  de  L'Etoile  2009),  and  the third  was  a  Preliminary  Assessment  of  the  North  Zone  (Thibault  et  al.  2010).    All  three

reports  are  available  on  the  SEDAR  website  [http://www.sedar.com/homepage\_en.htm]. Note:  The three Technical Reports referred to above are no longer current and should not be relied upon.

## 2.2 TERMS OF REFERENCE

In  July  2008,  WGM  was  retained  by  ADEX  to  prepare  a  NI  43-101  Technical  Report  in support of an updated Mineral Resource estimate of the Fire Tower Zone.  This estimate was an update of a previous  estimate completed in 2006 using new drilling information from a 2008 program.   In  November 2011, WGM was contracted by ADEX to prepare a new NI 43-101 Technical Report in support of an updated Mineral Resource estimate of the North Zone.  This estimate was to be based upon ADEX's results from its 2010 and 2011 diamond drilling programs and data that were used for the previous estimate (Dunbar and de L'Etoile, 2009),  which  are  in  ADEX's  GEMCOM  database.    ADEX  interpreted  and  modelled  the boundaries of the North Zone deposits and updated the GEMCOM database to assist with the Mineral Resource estimate and provided these data to WGM for their utilization.

The purpose of this report is to document the Mineral Resource estimates for the Property, including the 2008 Fire Tower Zone and updated North Zone estimates, which may be used to raise additional funds to further develop and conduct more advanced studies of the Property. The  classification  of  Mineral  Resources  used  in  this  report  conforms  to  the  definitions provided in NI 43-101 and the guidelines adopted by the Council of the Canadian Institute of Mining Metallurgy and Petroleum (" CIM ") Standards.

This report is intended to be used by ADEX subject to the terms and conditions of its contract with Watts, Griffis and McOuat Limited.  That contract permits ADEX to file this report as a Technical  Report  with  Canadian  Securities  Regulatory  Authorities  pursuant  to  provincial securities legislation.  Except for the purposes legislated under provincial securities laws, any other use of this report by any third party is at that party's sole risk.

The preparation of the April, 2012 North Zone report was authorized by Mr. Patrick Merrin, P.Eng., COO for ADEX, on November 21, 2011.

## 2.3 SOURCES OF INFORMATION

Data used to generate  the  Mineral  Resource  estimate  of  the  FTZ  originated  from  a  project database  created  by  ADEX  in  1997  and  later  updated  by  WGM  in  2006.    The  ADEX GEMCOM Project database contained three separate drillhole databases pertaining to three Mount  Pleasant  zones;  namely  the  FTZ,  the  Saddle  Zone  and  the  North  Zone  (not  to  be

confused with the Fire Tower North portion of the FTZ).  SRK did not validate the data for the North Zone and Saddle Zone workspaces.

The pre-2008 FTZ drillhole database consisted of 676 collar locations (in mine coordinates), downhole survey data, geological codes, and 24,544 assay intervals with multi-element values (percent of MoS2, WO3, Sn, Cu, Zn, Pb, Bi, As, Ca, Fe and In (ppm)).  The data was provided to SRK in digital form on a CD.   The 2008 data which contained additional data for twentythree diamond drillholes was supplied to SRK as Microsoft Excel spreadsheets via e-mail.  In total, the FTZ database was comprised of 699 collar locations and 26,355 assay intervals.

The  Mineral  Resource  estimate  for  the  North  Zone  is  based  upon  77  diamond  drillholes completed by ADEX and 567 historical holes drilled by previous operators on the Property; several holes were re-assayed by ADEX.  The ADEX drilling includes 11/11 AM96-series, 35/48  AM08-series,  23/26  AM10-series,  and  8/18  AM11-series  holes;  over  6200  assays  of drill  cores  from  these  holes  were  incorporated  into  ADEX's  GEMCOM  database.    The historical  drilling  includes  157/164  C-series,  124/166  DDH-series,  12/12  E-series,  10/16 LNZ-series, 87/227 MPS-series, and 175/185 U-series holes; over 23,000 assays of drill cores from these  holes  were  incorporated  into  ADEX's  GEMCOM database.    All  data  from  this drilling  were  made  available  to  WGM  by  ADEX,  after  the  integrity  of  the  database  was confirmed by independent Qualified Person ('QP') and Geologist, Dr. Steven McCutcheon, P.Geo.

Information about the historical drilling and all of ADEX's work prior to 2009 is described in the Technical Report by Dunbar and de L'Etoile (2009). Note:  This report is no longer current and should not be relied upon. Information about ADEX's 2010 and 2011 work, described  in  Sections  7  to  12  of  this  report,  was  supplied  to  WGM  by  independent QP, Dr. Steven  McCutcheon,  P.Geo.,  who  was  contracted  by  ADEX  for  this  purpose.    He obtained information from site visits, from a review of ADEX's recent technical reports and drilling  data,  from  hardcopy  files  and  correspondence  at  the  mine  site,  from  government reports (including assessment reports), and from discussions and correspondence with ADEX consulting geologists Mr.Gustaaf Kooiman and Dr. Trevor Boyd.

A  complete  list  of  the  material  reviewed  is  provided  under  References  at  the  end  of  this report.  Copies of selected reference material are available for review at the WGM office in Toronto.

## DETAILS OF PERSONAL INSPECTION OF THE PROPERTY

WGM personnel visited the Property in 2008, but not in 2010 or 2011.  However, independent QP  Dr. McCutcheon,  P.Geo.,  made  four  visits  to  the  Property  in  2011.    The  first  was  on September 28 th to 30 th , at which time an active drill site and several drill collars were visited with G.  Kooiman; core logging, splitting and sampling procedures were observed in the core building,  and  the  core  and  pulp  storage  areas  were  inspected.    Also,  drill  cores  from  three holes  were  inspected  and  photographed.    The  second  visit  was  on  October  17 th ,  after  the drilling  program  was  finished,  at  which  time  two  additional  drill  cores  were  inspected  and photographed.  The third visit was on November 3 rd and  4 th ,  after  most  of  the  assays  were in-hand,  at  which  time  quarter  samples  were  collected  from  mineralized  intervals  in  ten drillholes -  five from the 2010 program and five from the 2011 program.  The fourth visit was  on  December  2 nd and  3 rd ,  at  which  time  samples  were  collected  from  a  stockpile  of tungsten  ore,  to  be  used  for  metallurgical  testing  and  feasibility  studies.    During  this  visit, GPS coordinates were obtained from 10 of 26 drillhole collars in the 2010 program and from 8 of 18 drillhole collars in the 2011 program.

Dr. McCutcheon received the full co-operation and assistance of ADEX personnel during the site visit and the authors are grateful for the assistance provided by ADEX in the preparation of the Mineral Resource estimate and this NI 43-101 Report.

## 4.  PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION

## 4.1 LOCATION

The Property is located in Charlotte County, New Brunswick (NTS 21 G/07), approximately 60 km south of Fredericton, 65 km northwest of Saint John and 35 km north of St. George at latitude  45°26' Ν and  longitude  66°49'W  (Figure 1).    The  entire  land  package  consists  of 102 contiguous,  ground-staked  mineral  claims  covering  approximately  1,600 ha  in  claim group 1505 (Figure 2, Table 1), held under prospecting license 14338 by Adex Minerals Corp.,  a  100% owned  subsidiary  of  ADEX.    Since  the  last  Technical  Report  on Mount Pleasant (Dunbar and de L'Etoile, 2009) was filed, however, New Brunswick has gone from a ground-staked claim system, based upon Magnetic North, to an on-line map staked claim system based upon True (geodetic) North, effective April 14, 2010.  Now, claim group 1505  is  considered  to  be  one  claim  comprising  60  full  claim  units  and  parts  of  36  others. Each claim unit has fixed coordinates and is identified by a unique number-letter code.  Even though the Property has not yet been officially converted to the new system, the new claim units are in effect and can be viewed on NB e-CLAIMS [http://nbeclaims.gnb.ca/nbeclaims/].

New Brunswick is still in the process of changing its remaining ground staked claims to map claims, which will be done by the Mining Recorder once the order to do so is proclaimed by the  Provincial  Government.    Property  holders  will  no  longer  be  required  to  maintain  in physical good order the perimeter of ground-staked claim groups.  Furthermore, a property status report will not have to be filed every five years.  In January 1989, Hughes Surveys and Consultants legally surveyed the perimeter of claim group 1505.

Annual work requirements must be completed and an annual  renewal fee must be paid on claims to keep them in good standing.  The present annual work requirement for claim 1505 is $81,600, and the renewal date is February 2 nd .  On Jan 22, 2010, the annual renewal fee was paid forward  for three years for a total of $9,180. The  fees are fully paid until February 2, 2013.    ADEX  reports  a  current  reserve  of  $652,799.88  available  for  future renewals.

The  New  Brunswick  Mining  Act  requires  that  claim  holders  submit  a  work  report  to  the Mining Recorder every year exploration work is completed on the property, whether or not the holder has sufficient work credits to renew the claims.  The office of the Mining Recorder has requested that ADEX submit and file a work report covering its exploration activity since the filing of its last report.

## 4.2 PROPERTY DESCRIPTION

## Surface Rights

ADEX currently holds the surface rights to approximately 405 hectares, including the area of the former mine buildings.  During late 2003 and 2004, surface rights covering approximately 800 hectares were sold to several new owners.  In 2008, ADEX provided a 1:10,000 scale surface rights map to WGM, which showed that the surface rights to parts of the deposits are no longer owned by ADEX.  For example, the surface rights to the southern half of the Fire Tower  Zone,  the  northern  part  of  the  North  Zone,  and  eastern  side  of  Mount  Pleasant  are owned by third parties, including the Province.  The surface rights to the Saddle Zone, the northern half of the Fire Tower Zone and southern part of the North Zone are still held by ADEX.  Also, there is a right of way for the Province to the top of Mount Pleasant, and NB Power has a right of way for a power line to its communications tower.

## Royalty Payments

A  document  by  D.M.  Fraser  Services  Inc. (1994)  indicates  that  a  royalty  payment  in  the amount of $0.10 per ton of ore mined is payable to Mount Pleasant Mines Limited (' MPM '). This royalty is payable yearly on a non-cumulative basis out of net net profits (the definition of  "net  net  profits"  appears  to  be  more  or  less  the  equivalent  of  industry  standard  "net

<!-- image -->

profits"),  if  and  when  net  net  profits  are  made.    ADEX  has  no  original  documentation  to confirm or deny the existence of this royalty.

## Environmental Permits and Other Factors

ADEX has 100% ownership of the buildings and equipment remaining on the Property, which changed ownership from Piskahegan in 1996.  The Province of New Brunswick still holds a $2.0 million mortgage on the buildings as security to cover the costs of building removal and contouring  (ADEX,  1995).    In  addition,  ADEX  has  a  $0.715  million  security  bond  posted with the New Brunswick government for mine reclamation.  Environmental and permitting issues are discussed more fully in Section 20 of this Technical Report.

## 5.  ACCESS, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE AND PHYSIOGRAPHY

## 5.1 ACCESS

Mount Pleasant is located in southwestern New Brunswick (see Figure 1).  The mine site is accessible by all-weather roads from either Fredericton, approximately 80 km by road north of Mount Pleasant, or from the small town of St. George, approximately 40 km by road to the south.  The Property can be accessed by proceeding 60 km west of Saint John on Route 1 to provincial highway Route 785 (Beaver Harbour turn off).  Then travel north approximately 35 km on Route 785, past Irving's Lake Utopia paper mill, to the fork in the chip-sealed road. Bear left at the fork and the mine gatehouse is an additional 4 km after the fork.  Route 785 is maintained on a year-round basis by the Province and is the main access route to the Property. It was used for the transportation of concentrates from the former Mount Pleasant Tungsten Mine  to  the  port  of  Saint  John  and  the  eastern  United  States  seaboard.    The  New Brunswick/Maine border is located approximately 80 km to the southwest by road.

## 5.2 CLIMATE

The  majority  of  information  regarding  climate  reported  herein  has  been  gathered  from  the Environment  Canada website [http://climate.weatheroffice.gc.ca/Welcome\_e.html]. The climate  in  southwestern  New  Brunswick  is  characterized  by  warm  summers,  from  June through  September,  generally  cool  and  wet  spring  and  fall  seasons,  and  moderately  cold winters from December through March.  The proximity of southern New Brunswick to the Bay of Fundy provides a moderating effect on minimum winter temperatures relative to those experienced in northern New Brunswick.  Environment Canada historical climate records for nearby  Fredericton  from  1971  to  2000  indicate  average  daily  minimum  temperatures  in January  and  February  of  -15.5°C  and  -14.1°C,  respectively.    The  extreme  minimum temperatures for the same periods are reported as -35.6°C and -37.2°C whereas the average maximum temperatures are -4.0°C and -2.3°C, respectively.  In the summer, the maximum temperatures are 25.6°C average and 36.7°C extreme for July while for August the maximum temperatures are 24.7°C average and 37.2°C extreme.  The average minimum temperature in July  is  13.0°C  and  in  August  it  is  12.1°C.    The  yearly  average  total  precipitation  is 1,143.3 mm including 276.5 cm of snowfall and 885.5 mm of rain.

The months of May to October are the best time to conduct field programs, such as geological mapping, soil geochemical surveys, and trenching.  However, ground geophysical surveys and drilling programs can be conducted year round.  Winter drilling can be advantageous for ease

of crossing active streams or watersheds as many of these water bodies are frozen solid during the  winter  season.    The  New  Brunswick  climate  allows  for  year-round  mining  and  milling activities.

## 5.3 LOCAL RESOURCES AND INFRASTRUCTURE

Saint  John,  the  largest  city  in  New  Brunswick  with  a  population  of  around  70,000  (2011 Census), is the second largest port in Atlantic Canada.  This major seaport is ice-free all year and is located approximately 80 km by road from the Property.  Today, this industrial city is dominated by pulp and paper, oil refining and light manufacturing.  When the Mount Pleasant Tungsten Mine operated from 1983 to 1985, tungsten ore concentrate was regularly shipped via Route 785 to Saint John for shipments to Europe.  Concentrates could also be transported via Route 1 west to potential U.S. customers.

The City of Fredericton with a population of around 56,000 (2011 Census) is located about an hour  drive  north  of  Mount  Pleasant.    This  city  is  the  provincial  capital  and  home  to  the University of New Brunswick.  St. George, with a population of around 1,500 (2011 Census), is  about  a  half  hour  drive  to  the  south  and  70  km  west  of  Saint  John.    As  there  is  no accommodation  at  Mount  Pleasant,  mine  personnel  would  most  likely  live  in St. George. Labour could be recruited locally from Saint John, St. George, St. Stephen and Fredericton as well as from Bathurst, a mining community in northeastern New Brunswick.

There are commercial airports located at Fredericton (Oromocto) and Saint John.  The closest railway line runs from Saint John through Fredericton Junction northeast of Mount Pleasant to the city of Montreal, Quebec.

There  is  a  considerable  amount  of  existing  infrastructure  on  the  Property.    The  principal buildings  are  the  Administration  Building,  Warehouse,  "A"  Frame",  Ore  Storage  Shed, Concentrator,  Maintenance  Shop,  Core  Storage  and  Cold  Storage  buildings.    On  the  first floor,  the  administration  building  accommodates  the  mine  and  geological  offices,  change rooms and lamp room.  On the second floor, offices were reserved for management and for the  human  resources  and  accounting  departments.    Telephone  and  internet  services  are  in place in the maintenance / office building.

Water  for  processing  was  previously  supplied  from  a  pump  house  located  on  nearby Piskahegan  River  to  a  storage  reservoir  on  the  hillside  above  the  mill  (Billiton,  1985). However, the pump house is no longer in service.

An existing tailings pond (Figure 3) is permitted with an 'Approval to Operate' license from the  New  Brunswick  Department of  Environment.    A  drilled  well  at  the  mine  site  provides water for domestic consumption.

Electric power is supplied to the Property by the New Brunswick transmission grid connected to  the  electric  utility,  NB  Power.    The  supply  is  delivered  at  138  kV  and  is  transformed  to 4,160 V and 600 V to feed equipment.  However, ADEX sold most of the milling equipment in the late 1990s and early 2000s to raise money for Property and title maintenance.

## 5.4 PHYSIOGRAPHY

Southern New Brunswick is characterized by low-lying hills and gently rolling topography with hills sloping down to tidal marshes at the edge of the Bay of Fundy (McLeod, 1990). Mount Pleasant,  at  approximately  370 m  above  sea  level,  is  some  230 m  above  the  Hatch Brook valley floor and is one of the highest points in southern New Brunswick.  The rolling topography is a manifestation of the Pleistocene glaciation that affected the Mount Pleasant area.  The dominant ice-transport direction was from the northwest; consequently, hills and stream  valleys  tend  to  have  a  northwest-southeast  orientation.    Outcrops  are  sparse  but  till thickness is not great, occurring mostly as an intermittent veneer rather than a thick blanket, especially at higher elevations.  Mount Pleasant is drained by Hatch Brook to the west, Lower Niles Brook to the north, and McDougall Inlet to the east.

Very little of the land in the area is suitable for agriculture so most of it is tree covered, with softwoods in the lowlands and hardwoods on the hills.  However, forestry operations in the region  have  been  converting  many  of  the  hills  into  softwood  plantations.    Mount  Pleasant itself  was  harvested  in  the  1990s  so  little  marketable  timber  remains  on  the  Property; however, it has been allowed to regenerate naturally rather than converting it to a softwood plantation.

## 6.  HISTORY

## 6.1 GENERAL

A review paper (Kooiman 2004) summarizing all historical work previously conducted on the Property  has  been  provided  by  Mr.  G.  Kooiman,  consulting  geologist  to  ADEX.    The description below has largely been extracted from this paper with permission of the author. Additional  information  has  been  provided  from  other  reports  and  documents  provided  by ADEX to complete this review.  The authors believe the historical descriptions presented are generally accurate, but have not independently verified the data.

Mount Pleasant has a long history of exploration and development.  The focus of exploration over the years has shifted from tin-base metals ("Tin Lodes") from 1954-1969, to porphyry tungsten-molybdenum-bismuth  deposits  (1969-1985),  to  porphyry  tin  deposits  (1985-1991) and  back  to  tin-base  metals  (1991-2004),  and  now  includes  indium,  which  is  an  important component of the mineralization.

WGM has prepared  four  technical  reports  on  the  Property,  including  an  initial  NI  43-101 compliant Inferred Mineral Resource estimate of the Fire Tower Zone (Dunbar et al., 2006) followed by an  upgrading of this estimate to Inferred and Indicated classifications (Dunbar et al., 2008,  amended  2012).    Then  NI  43-101  compliant  Inferred  and  Indicated  Mineral Resource estimates of the North Zone were prepared (Dunbar and de L'Etoile 2009), followed by  a  Preliminary  Economic Assessment ('PEA') of the North Zone (Thibault et al., 2010).

Note: These reports are no longer current and should not be relied upon

All of the historical work completed on the Property has been summarized in Table 2.

## 6.2 EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT

## Tin Based Metal Deposit (1954-1969)

The Mount Pleasant area was first staked in 1954 by Geochemical Associates in follow up to one  of  the  very  first  stream  sediment  surveys  in  North  America  for  base  metals,  which indicated the possible presence of copper and lead mineralization located on the east side of Hatch Brook Valley and on the west flank of Mount Pleasant (Parrish and Tully 1976).  This

coincided  with  the  discovery  of  large  base  metal  deposits  in  the  Bathurst  Camp  located  in northeastern New Brunswick.  The claims were subsequently optioned to Selco Exploration Limited (" Selco "); this company conducted geological studies, ran a vertical loop electromagnetic ("EM") survey, and a reconnaissance radiation survey.  A massive boulder of löllingite (FeAs2) was found near the Fire Tower on Mount Pleasant.

Selco drilled four packsack drillholes to test a geochemical anomaly and preliminary "Geiger Counter" radiometric surveys were completed in the vicinity of the  Fire  Tower.  However, none of the drillholes intersected any significant metallic mineralization and it was concluded that the mineralized zones themselves showed only background radioactivity.  As a result, the claims  were  returned  to  Geochemical  Associates  in  July  of  1955.    In  1956,  Kennco Exploration  (Canada)  Limited  (" Kennco "),  the  Canadian  subsidiary  of  Kennecott  Copper , optioned this claim group and drilled ten holes but results were again disappointing and the option was dropped.  The Geological Survey of Canada (' GSC ') ran an aeromagnetic survey of the area in May of 1956 (GSC 1957; Parrish and Tully 1976), which revealed that Mount Pleasant is located on the side of a large aeromagnetic high.  Furthermore, it determined that magnetic  surveys  would  be  of  little  help  in  outlining  mineralized  zones  on  the  property. Geochemical Associates allowed the claims to lapse in 1958.

Renewed interest came with the discovery of in-situ gossanous outcrop material higher up on Mount  Pleasant.    Samples  of  this  material  contained  base  metals  and  anomalous  amounts of tin.    In  1959,  Mount  Pleasant  Mines  Limited  (' MPM ')  was  formed  and  it  re-staked  the property.    Subsequently,  Kennco  optioned  the  property  again  and  re-assayed  all  the  old geochemical  samples  for  tin,  molybdenum,  copper  and  lead  (Parrish  and  Tully  1976). Additional claims were staked followed by the first ground induced polarization ("IP") survey to  be  conducted  on  the  property.    The  IP  Survey  identified  two  broad  north-south  trending anomalies, one that coincided with the current Fire Tower Zone and the other with the current Saddle Zone.  Both  geophysical  anomalies  correlated  fairly  well  with  previously  identified anomalous soil values.  IP surveying was followed by the drilling of 24 shallow holes in 1960. Drilling  intersected  tungsten,  molybdenum  and  tin  mineralization  but  its  distribution  was erratic  and  it  could  not  be  followed.    Meanwhile,  Kennco's  exploration  interest  shifted  to Western Canada, so the option was dropped.

From  1960  to  1965,  MPM  completed  surface  stripping  (120  m )  and  trenching,  soil  and 2 bedrock sampling, ground geophysics (IP, seismic, self potential ("SP"), magnetic and gravity surveys),  surface  diamond  drilling  (Fire  Tower  Zone),  metallurgical  testing  of  drill  cores, detailed  geological  investigations,  extensive  underground  development  and  underground sampling  and  drilling  programs  (Parrish  and  Tully,  1976).    The  geological  investigations culminated with a Master's thesis on the geology of Mount Pleasant at the University of New

Brunswick (Ruitenberg 1963), IP surveying was conducted by McPhar Geophysics Ltd. over all three of the currently known zones (Fire Tower area, Saddle Zone and North Zone) as well as reconnaissance surveys in the area west of Hornet Hill.  A total of eighteen IP anomalies were  identified.    Follow-up  diamond  drilling  indicated  that  the  IP  anomalies  could  not  be directly  related  to  the  main  molybdenum,  tungsten,  bismuth  zones  but  were  most  likely related  to  disseminated  mineralization  in  the  cap  rock.    Ground  magnetic  surveys  over  the North Zone and Fire Tower Zone areas did not locate any significant magnetic anomalies.  On the  North  Zone,  results  indicated  that  silicified  zones  showed  up  as  weaker  magnetic background readings and that chloritized zones stood up above background.

The exploration work by MPM outlined widespread but erratic tin-base metal mineralization in  the  northern  part  of  the  current  Property  (the  North  Zone)  and  diamond  drilling  in  the southern  part  (Fire  Tower  Zone)  encountered  many  mineralised  intersections  with  varying amounts of tin, tungsten and molybdenum.  MPM drove a 1,465 m adit (the 600 Adit), where some  of  the  underground  drilling  took  place,  and  from  1963-64  outlined  a  number  of  tinbearing  lodes  (the  Open  Pit  Zone).    At  that  time,  it  was  difficult  to  establish  a  geological model for the tin-base  metal mineralization at Mount Pleasant as similar deposits were not known in New Brunswick or anywhere else in Canada.

From 1961 to 1962, several SP and resistivity measurements, both on surface and in diamond drillholes, were completed in the North Zone and Saddle Zone areas (Parrish and Tully 1976). Several weak anomalies were located within the Saddle area but data collected from the North Zone were inconclusive, possibly due to wide spread sphalerite mineralization.  In May 1963, a  100-ton  bulk  sample  was  collected  from  the  North  Zone  for  testing.    A  feasibility, development and "reserve" study, based mostly on the North Zone results, was completed in 1964.  A gravity survey was conducted over the 600 Adit in August of 1965 to try to prove the vertical continuity of the #1 and #3 Tin Lodes.  The results were inconclusive indicating that tin-base metal lodes might be reflected by low gravity values.  Some exploration work was completed on the #7 Tin Lode as well.  However, work abruptly stopped when MPM ran into financial problems.

The area lay  dormant  until  mid-1967  when  the  Sullivan  Mining  Group  (" Sullivan ")  began exploration  for  tin  and  copper  in  the  Fire  Tower  Zone.    Sullivan  followed  up  on  some excellent diamond drill intersections by driving two exploration adits.  The 750 Adit (1,330 m long)  and  the  900  Adit  (194 m  long)  were  driven  2.4  by  2.4 m  into  the  Fire  Tower  North Zone.  Only small replacement-style mineralized bodies were found.  Additional geophysical and geochemical work was carried out in 1968 (Parrish and Tully, 1976).

## Porphyry-Molybdenum-Bismuth Deposits (1969-1985)

Sullico Mines Limited, which became part of Sullivan in 1969, optioned the Mount Pleasant claim group in 1967.   In 1968, exploration activities focused on the Fire Tower  Zone area with  the  intersecting  of  tungsten,  molybdenum  and  bismuth  mineralization  by  drillhole MPS 39.

In  1969,  Brunswick  Tin  Mines  (" BTM ")  was  formed  as  a  joint  venture  between  Sullivan (78%) and MPM (22%).  That same year, surface diamond drilling discovered large porphyrytype  tungsten-molybdenum-bismuth zones in the Fire Tower  Zone.   By 1971, a "resource" had been outlined for the Fire Tower Zone with additional "resources" outlined in the North Zone and Deep Tin Zone (subzone) in 1972.  All exploration attention was now focused on the large porphyry deposits.

IP surveying was completed on adjoining claim groups in Hatch Brook, Upper Niles Brook, Beach Hill, Little Mount Pleasant, McDougall Lake and the East Group area in 1970 (Parrish and Tully 1976).  Weak anomalies attributed to contact pyritic and graphitic mineralization were located in the Upper Niles Brook and Hatch Brook areas.  The strongest anomaly was identified  on  the  East  Group  where  drilling  intersected  significant  tin  mineralization.    Drill testing of a second IP anomaly at Little Mount Pleasant intersected some zinc mineralization.

In 1971, an x-ray fluorescent spectrometer ("XRF") was set up in St. Stephen by BTM and all core and other materials were assayed using this equipment.  The surface of Mount Pleasant was re-mapped and a second IP survey completed.  Exploration shifted to the Deep Tin Zone (subzone) in 1972 and the near-surface, #4 Tin Lode.  An 815-ton bulk sample was collected from  the  750  Adit  (North  Zone).    During  1972,  a  preliminary  ground  EM  survey  with  an EM-16 unit was conducted over the Saddle Zone area and Hornet Hill.

BTM drove the 400 Adit (400 ft above sea level) into the higher grade part of the Fire Tower West Zone in 1973 to obtain a bulk sample.  This adit became the '+400 level' because BTM subsequently added 10,000 feet to all levels such that the 400 Adit was given a mine elevation of 10,400 feet.  Levels below sea level had elevations less than 10,000 feet.  This was done to avoid  having  negative  mine  levels.    When  the  metric  system  was  adopted  in  later  years, 1,000 m  was  added  to  sea  level;  at  that  time  the  10,400  level  became  the  1120  level. Exploration drifts were also established on the '+100 level' (later 1030 level) and extensive underground diamond drilling was undertaken.  Surface diamond drilling was also completed as well as 1,500 m of underground development.

In 1974, MPM dropped its ownership in BTM to 11% due to its inability to provide its share of  exploration  funding.    BTM  completed  metallurgical  studies  and  in  1976  completed  a

feasibility  study  for  a  tungsten  mine  at  Mount  Pleasant  based  on  the  "reserves"  in  the  Fire Tower  Zone  and  then  started  to  actively  search  for  another  partner  to  help  develop  the Property.

In  November, 1977, Billiton Exploration Canada Limited (' Billiton ')  formed  a  50/50  joint venture  ("JV")  with  BTM  (Sullivan  89%,  MPM  11%)  establishing  the  Mount  Pleasant Tungsten Mine.  The JV gave Billiton the right to undertake a full Feasibility Study and earn a 50% interest  in  the  Property  by  putting  it  into  production  (Billiton,  1985).    Arrangements were made to dewater the 400 decline, the 1030 Level workings, and to mine a 10,000-tonne bulk sample in the core of the Fire Tower West body.  The sample was shipped to Sullivan's Nigadoo River Mine, near Bathurst, where a continuous mill test was carried out to evaluate the recovery of wolframite and molybdenite by flotation (Billiton, 1985).  Strathcona Mineral Services  Limited was contracted to compile the  Feasibility Study, which was completed in 1979.    With  the  outlook  for  tungsten  prices  being  favourable,  a  decision  to  proceed  to production was made at a design capacity of 650,000 tonnes mined/milled per year.

Mine/mill construction commenced  in  April 1980  with a total construction cost of $150 million  (Billiton,  1985).    Underground  operations  started  in  December 1982,  with  the start  up  of  the  primary  crusher,  and  sales  of  tungsten  (wolframite)  concentrate  began  in December 1983.  A total of 14,478 m of underground drilling was completed to delineate the tungsten-molybdenum zones between 1981 and 1985.  In 1984, mine production was reduced to 325,000 tonnes per year.

The mine experienced numerous setbacks, including cost over-runs, metallurgical difficulties and  falling  tungsten  prices,  which  meant  poor  profitability  and  eventually  led  to  the  mine being permanently closed in July 1985.  During the mining operation from 1983 to 1985, a total of 990,200 tonnes of tungsten ore was milled.

After the mine closed, Sullivan dropped its interest in Mount Pleasant and MPM exchanged its shares in the Mount Pleasant Tungsten Mine for a royalty based on $0.10 per short ton of ore mined.

## Porphyry Deposits (1985-1991)

Mount  Pleasant  Tungsten  Mine  geologists  re-logged  most  of  the  surface  and  underground diamond drill cores drilled by BTM in the summer of 1981.  As a result, they found that a significant amount of tin mineralization in the North Zone occurred in a fine-grained granite underlying and intruding more intensely altered older rocks.  As most of the budget went to further outlining and sampling of the tungsten-molybdenum zones, it was not until the spring of 1984 that Billiton made funds available for a tin exploration program in the North Zone.  A

total of 4,767 m of diamond drilling was carried out in 1985.  All twelve holes (E-series) in this  program intersected significant tin mineralization in the  contact Crest, adjacent contact Flank and within the Endogranitic Zone (subzone), the latter hosted by younger fine-grained granite.

Site  visits  by  several  leading  experts  on  tin  geology  confirmed  the  significance  of  the discovery.  Dr. R.G. Taylor and Dr. P.J. Pollard of the Tin-Tungsten Research Unit of James Cook University of North Queensland, Townsville, Australia, concluded their visit report by saying that "it should be realized that to establish 2-3 million tonnes of good grade "reserves" (0.8-1.0% Sn)  is  an  extremely  difficult  task  and  this  potential  seems  obtainable  at  Mount Pleasant," (Taylor and Pollard 1985).  Dr. K.F.G. Hosking of Camborne, Cornwall, U.K, also inspected the key drill cores and sections from the North Zone and was similarly impressed by the drilling results stating that "the zone was a very promising tin prospect".

After the closure of the tungsten mine, Billiton started to actively search for a joint venture partner  to  further  explore  the  tin  deposits  of  the  North  Zone.    Of  the  eight  major  mining companies that presented bids, Lac Minerals Limited (" LAC ") became the preferred partner. Approximately $6.5 million was spent between 1985 and 1988 to drive a 1,187 m long access drift from the Fire Tower Zone to the North Zone, conduct underground drilling to delineate the zone(s) of tin mineralization and to produce a feasibility study.

The  "Lac-Billiton Tin Project" started in October  1985,  with LAC  as  the  operator, notwithstanding the collapse of the International Tin Council cartel, which saw tin prices drop from US$17.50/kg to US$5.50/kg.  The project involved completing 2,101 m of development, which included a 3.5 m by 5.0 m, 1,187 m long access ramp that started from the 1020 level of the service ramp of the Fire Tower Zone and extended to the North Zone.  The North Zone Access  Decline  and  lateral  exploration  development  were  channel  sampled  in  1986  by collecting 256 face, wall and muck samples.  None of these samples was a continuous channel sample but most of them consisted of 20 - 25 fist-sized pieces.

The  joint  venture  completed  25,377 m  of  surface  (LNZ  series  holes)  and  underground diamond drilling.  Two bulk samples totalling 2,582 tonnes were excavated from the Contact Crest and Endogranitic Zone (subzone) and processed in the bulk-sample tower on surface. Some  280 tonnes  were  shipped  to  Lakefield  Research  (" Lakefield ")  for  metallurgical  test work.  The remaining material was stored in the "A-frame" building on site where it remains today.

In 1987, Redpath Mining Consultants Limited (' Redpath ') of North Bay, Ontario, prepared a three-volume report (Redpath, 1987) on ore handling alternatives for tin ore from the North Zone.    Pilot  plant  testing  was  completed  on  bulk  samples  collected  from  the  Endogranitic Zone (subzone) and the Contact Crest deposit.

However, by the end of 1987, the tin price was still hovering in the US$5.50-$6.50/kg range, well below the US$11.00/kg required for a positive production decision.  As a result, LAC put the tin project on hold and the underground workings were allowed to flood.  The plant and equipment were placed on a care and maintenance program.  Some equipment was reallocated to other operating properties or sold.

During  1988,  LAC  continued  its  exploration  for  other  tin  deposits  on  the  Property  with  a modest budget of $250,000 plus government funding (MISP programs).  An IP survey was carried out over the northeast quadrant of the Property, covering an area of 4.0 km .  A six2 hole  surface  drilling  program  started  in  June  1988,  and  was  completed  in  October  of  that same year.  LAC terminated its exploration activities by the end of 1988.

In  October,  1989,  NovaGold  Resources  Inc. (" NovaGold ") optioned  the  Property  from LAC/Billiton.    NovaGold  completed  a  three-hole  diamond  drilling  program  (NMR  series holes) in the Saddle Zone and conducted metallurgical work on the tin mineralization based on a new flowsheet to investigate the North Zone as a potential polymetallic mineral deposit. NovaGold  completed  initial  metallurgical  studies  on  the  removal  and  processing  of  the sulphide mineralization to recover tin, indium, zinc and copper (ADEX, 1995).

NovaGold also commissioned a study by Cominco Engineering Services Limited (" Cominco "), which  developed  a  flow-sheet  to  produce  a  50% tin  concentrate  at an 80% recovery rate.  As part of this study, a total of 30 tonnes of samples for metallurgical test work were shipped to Lakefield, Cominco of Vancouver, British Columbia, and the Federal Government's  CANMET  research  facility  in  Ottawa.    In  1990,  NovaGold  initiated  a  tin feasibility study by WGM with involvement of Davy Canada Inc. as well as a mineralogical study of 40 core samples.  In 1992, NovaGold allowed their option to lapse due to financial constraints.

## Tin-Indium Base Metal Deposits

Due to low tin prices and a bleak outlook for significant price recovery, exploration efforts focused on other metals associated with tin.  NovaGold became interested in the presence of indium in 1991, after visits by indium/bismuth experts of the Geological Survey of Japan and the U.S. Bureau of Mines, who provided very useful insights into the geology, metallurgy and production figures of indium-bearing deposits, as well as the indium industry as a whole.  A

sampling  program  was  initiated  in  November  1991,  and  was  eventually  completed  with assistance of the New Brunswick Department of Natural Resources (" NBDNR "). Approximately 500 samples were analyzed for indium.  The Geological Survey of Canada (" GSC ")  also  participated  in  the  1991/1992  program  by  analyzing  over  100  samples  of mineralized and un-mineralized rocks from the Fire Tower West Zone (subzone).  Prior to the 1991/1992  program,  less  than  50  indium  assays  were  available.    In  addition,  only  a  few hundred semi-quantitative assays were carried out during the 1970s.

In the spring of 1992, the Property reverted back to LAC due to NovaGold's failure to secure financing  or  find  a  senior  partner  to  advance  the  project.    Ongoing  interest  in  indium  and bismuth  by  the  Japanese  and  Europeans  prompted  NBDNR  to  take  a  proactive  role  in promoting the Property, assisting in technical matters and facilitating meetings with potential investors.

In early 1993, Drew and McKeown began negotiations for the Property.  Due diligence work was carried  out  by  WGM  and  samples  were  shipped  to  Lakefield  and  Cominco.    NBDNR produced  a  promotional  video  on  Mount  Pleasant.    A  bismuth-bearing  concentrate  was shipped to SIDECH.  During a trade mission to Germany and Belgium in April 1993, led by then Premier McKenna, a meeting was held with the principals of SIDECH in Brussels.

In  December  1993,  Piskahegan  with  Drew  and  McKeown  as  principals,  purchased  the mine/mill  complex  and  the  mineral  rights  to  Mount  Pleasant  from  Billiton  and  LAC. Piskahegan continued to develop the metallurgical processes for the treatment of tin-sulphides from the North Zone and Deep Tin Zone (subzone) and prepared a new pre-feasibility study. A deal was struck with a local contractor to clear-cut most of the forest that covered Mount Pleasant in order for the company to meet its financial obligations.

Piskahegan quickly recognized the importance of indium as a co-product in any future mining operation and over 2,000 samples of previously drilled core were analyzed for indium.  The investigation  confirmed  the  widespread  occurrence  of  indium,  in  particular  in  the  tin-zinccopper-rich deposits.

A  five-hole  diamond  drilling  program  funded  by  ADEX  was  completed  in  1995  to  test indium, zinc and copper mineralization within the Fire Tower Zone.  Drilling intersected a new small zone called the Scotia Zone (subzone) and determined that the Fire Tower Zone contained tin-bearing mineralization with good indium, zinc and copper values.

In 1994, D.M. Fraser Services Ltd. prepared a report (Fraser 1995) for Piskahegan reviewing the feasibility of producing tin, indium, base metals and rare-earth metals utilizing all work conducted on the Property since 1987.

Finally, in January 1995, a 100 kg sample was shipped to Research and Productivity Council (" RPC ")  of  Fredericton, New Brunswick to start bacterial inoculums for bioleach test work (Akerly, 1996).

## 6.3 MINING AND MILLING OPERATIONS

## Fire Tower Zone

The Mount Pleasant Tungsten Mine was put into production in 1983 at a total construction cost of $150 million.  Mining started in the Fire Tower West orebody after two declines were completed between 1981 and 1982 (Billiton, 1985).  These declines provided access to the orebody at the north end of the Fire Tower West and Fire Tower South zones (subzones).  The Service Ramp runs from the surface to the 955 level (the 1,000 m mine level equals sea level) averaging a 15% slope and was used for transportation of mine personnel, materials and waste haulage.    The  Conveyor  Ramp  is  940 m  long,  625 m  at  an  18% slope  and  315 m  at  a 25% slope, and runs from the underground crusher on the 935 level to the surface portal.

According to mining records (Billiton, 1985), the underground mining started in December 1982.  The primary mining method employed at Mount Pleasant was transverse, long-hole, open stoping with primary and secondary extraction.  The ore extraction was done without backfill.    Some of the stopes were large and in excess of several hundreds of thousands of tonnes.  The mine levels were laid out at 30 and 45 m intervals.  However, during the initial stages  of  production  it  was  determined  that  shrinkage  mining  was  essential  to  provide additional stope support due to the failure of one or more pillars.  Additionally, vertical slicing was replaced by horizontal slicing using vertical crater retreat techniques.

The mine was designed to produce 650,000 tonnes of tungsten-molybdenum ore per year with a manpower level of 77 underground employees.  During the 1983-85 production period, the underground productivity averaged 50 tonnes per-man-shift.  In 1984, the total manpower on site  was 235 employees.  Prior to the operation shut down, the manpower level dropped to 155 employees and production was reduced to 325,000 tonnes per year.

Selling  and  shipment  of  the  tungsten  concentrate  began  in  December  1983.    The  tungsten concentrate was  sold exclusively to Billiton Metals and Ores International BV,  the Netherlands (Billiton, 1985).  Long-term supply contracts were in place with European and

<!-- image -->

U.S. customers.  The concentrate was delivered in 250 kg drums or one-tonne bags.  Lots of 18-22 tonnes were transported in containers by truck/ship to Europe or by truck to the U.S.

However, the mine was plagued by setbacks.  During construction of the mine, the tungsten price dropped to US$12.50/kg and dropped even further in subsequent years.  Severe capital cost overruns, from an original $89 million to over $150 million, in addition to metallurgical difficulties made for a bleak outlook for the mine.  By 1984, the price of tungsten had dropped further to US$8.40/kg.

In July 1985, the mine was closed permanently due to poor metal prices and the resulting poor profitability  and  metallurgical  problems  after  less  than  2 years  of  production.    A  total  of 990,200 tonnes of "tungsten ore" was milled from 1983 to 1985.  Tungsten was the only metal recovered in the plant.  No attempts were made to run the molybdenum recovery circuits.  The ore  bins  contain  an  unknown  amount  of  uncrushed  ore  and  there  are  twenty-five  205  litre drums containing historic bulk-sample material from the Fire Tower Zone securely stored in the warehouse.

The main mine is currently flooded to the portal level of the access ramps.  Kvaerner (1997) estimated that de-watering will take 24 weeks.

## North Zone

The North Zone was never mined by any of the previous operators.  The previously proposed mining methods are summarized below.  As with all mineral deposits, mining methods are dictated by the deposit geology, size, shape and orientation.

Billiton proposed access to the North Zone via the over 900 metre-long drift from the Fire Tower West, which connects to a 1,200 m decline that starts from surface, a distance of about 600 m north of the mill (Billiton, 1985).  They proposed that the Deep Tin Zone (subzone) could  be  mined  using  the  same  methods  used  at  the  Fire  Tower  Zone.    The  Contact  Crest mineralization  would  require  a  modified  slice  and  bench  or  sub-level  retreat  method.    The more steeply dipping Contact Flank mineralization might be amenable to blast-hole stoping or blast-hole  shrinkage,  if  the  mineralization  had  a  regular  shape,  or  cut-and-fill,  if  it  did  not. The Endogranitic mineralization could be mined by a room and pillar layout using top-slice and bench methods or blast-hole retreat with remote mucking.

Piskahegan  proposed  using  sub-level  caving  ("SLC")  as  its  main  mining  method  for  the Endogranitic  Zone (subzone) and contact deposits (ADEX 1995).  Some blast-hole stoping would  be  employed  on  the  Endogranitic  Zone  (subzone)  but  blast  hole  could  be  the  main mining method for the Deep Tin Zone (subzone) because the mineralization was interpreted to

<!-- image -->

be  one  mass.    SLC  was  proposed  because  it  was  considered  a  low  cost  mining  method. However, this technique has a high dilution factor (21%), especially in vein-type mineralization.  Blast-hole stoping was considered a low-cost mining method and in the Deep Tin Zone (subzone) less dilution (15%) was expected because the mineralization was in one mass.  Vertical-crater-retreat mining was also proposed where applicable.

Kvaerner (1997) recommended a mixture of SLC and long-hole stoping, with mining of ore from the North Zone and Deep Tin Zone (subzone) at a rate of 2,500 t/d.  SLC would be used for 90% of the deposits and long hole for the remainder.

## 6.4 HISTORICAL DIAMOND DRILLING

Since 1955, at least a dozen drilling campaigns have been completed to explore and develop deposits at Mount Pleasant.  Over the last 50 years, 1,318 drillholes totalling 155,444 m have been drilled, including 450 surface holes and 868 underground holes, totalling 93,657 m and 61,787 m,  respectively  (Table  3).    These  drill  programs  have  led  to  discovery  of  the  Fire Tower Zone tungsten-molybdenum deposits and the North Zone tin-indium deposits, as well as to preliminary exploration of tin mineralization at Hornet Hill.  Prior to this report, the last diamond drill program completed by ADEX was in 2008.

Each of the drill programs is described below.  The collar locations for the surface drillholes have been tied into a surveyed mine grid and are plotted in Figure 7 (Section 7 of this report). All sample intervals reported represent lengths measured down core and do not necessarily represent the true thickness of the mineralized zones as many of them appear to be irregularly shaped, both vertically and horizontally.

Most holes were inclined holes up to 1973 when vertical drilling became more common place. The size of the drill core prior to the Sullivan Mining Group's takeover was AX (Parrish and Tully 1976).  From 1969 to 1972 Sullivan and BTM continued to use A core and AQ core. As of June 1972, BTM started to use BQ core as they found that BQ holes did not deviate as much  as  AQ  holes.    Underground  drilling  conducted  in  the  600,  750  and  900  adits  was completed with air-powered BBU drills, producing A, E or XRT size core (Parrish and Tully 1976).    In  1975,  two  Longyear  EHS  38,  electric  drills  were  used  in  the  400  decline  that produced BQ core.

Since  1985,  all  surface  holes  have  been  drilled  vertically,  starting  with  NQ-size  core  and switching to BQ approximately half to two-thirds of the distance down hole (Gowdy, 1995). All underground holes were BQ-size and they were rarely surveyed.  During the Lac-Billiton Tin  Project,  down-hole  surveys  were  carried  out  occasionally,  using  a  Pajari  instrument, mainly to check the deviation of deeper holes.  All surface holes were drilled vertically and drillholes  seldom  deviated  more  than  3°  over  their  entire  length.    Most  underground  holes were relatively short and Pajari tests were carried out sporadically.

Ten historical  holes  from  surface  were  intersected  by  underground  workings.    Surface  and underground  drill  cores  are  reported  99% sampled  and  assayed  (Kvaerner  1997).    Average sample length was 3.0 m.  Much of the core splitting was done with a Longyear core splitter. Drill reports seldom reveal the name of the company that did the drilling.

Further  information  regarding  the  historical  diamond  drill  programs  at  Mount  Pleasant  is contained in WGM Technical Reports (Dunbar et al., 2006, 2009).

## 7.  GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND MINERALIZATION

## 7.1 REGIONAL GEOLOGY

The Mount Pleasant area, located in southern New Brunswick, lies within the Appalachian Orogen of eastern Canada; more specifically, near the western end of the Maritimes Basin, which contains rocks ranging in age from Late Devonian to Permian (Figure 4).  This basin oversteps  the  five  well-known  tectono-stratigraphic  zones  (terranes)  of  the  Appalachian Orogen (Williams 1979, 1995), and post-dates continental collision that occurred during the Early to Middle Devonian Acadian Orogeny (McCutcheon and Robinson 1987).

<!-- image -->

It is predominantly filled by gently dipping sedimentary rocks that were deposited in alluvial, fluvial,  lacustrine  and  marine  environments  but  it  also  contains  minor  subaerial  volcanic rocks, especially near the base of this successor basin.  Volcanic rocks in the Mount Pleasant area are assigned to the Late Devonian Piskahegan Group, which represents the remnants of a large epicontinental caldera complex (McCutcheon et al, 1997); the southwestern margin of this caldera complex is where the Mount Pleasant deposit is situated.

## 7.2 LOCAL GEOLOGY

The  Piskahegan  Group  was  originally  introduced  by  van  de  Poll  (1967)  and  subsequently revised by McCutcheon (1990).  For detailed descriptions of the formations comprising this group, the reader is referred to the 'New Brunswick Bedrock Lexicon' under 'Databases' on the New Brunswick Department of Energy and Mines (NBDEM) website: [http://www.gnb.ca/0078/minerals/index-e.aspx]. The distribution of all formations comprising  this  group  is  shown  on  the  'Bedrock  Geology  Map  of  Southwestern  New Brunswick'  (Smith  2005),  which  can  be  down-loaded  as  a  free  PDF  file  (NR-5)  under 'Selected Publications' on the NBDEM website.

Part  of  the  'Bedrock  Geology  Map  of  New  Brunswick'  (NBDEM,  2008)  shows  the distribution of the Late Devonian Piskahegan Group and adjacent rock units in the vicinity of Mount  Pleasant.    The  Piskahegan  Group  (Unit LDPl )  includes  felsic  (pale  yellow),  mafic (green)  and  sedimentary  (orange)  rocks  that  mainly  occupy  a  triangular  area  measuring approximately  13  by  17 km  and  underlie  a  curvilinear  belt  that  extends  to  the  east  of  it (Figure 5).  Most of the rocks of the triangular area, and all of those to the east, belong to the intracaldera  and  exocaldera  sequences,  respectively,  of  McCutcheon  et al., (1997).    A  latecaldera fill sequence oversteps and extends to the west of the triangular area in the north and includes late-stage intrusions, including the Mount Pleasant Porphyry (Unit LDMP ) but not the McDougall Brook Granite (Unit LDMB ), which is part of the intracaldera sequence.  The age of the Piskahegan Group is constrained by fossils (McGregor and McCutcheon 1988) and by radiometric ages (Tucker et al., 1998; Anderson 1992).  Notably, the group is roughly coeval with  the  Late  Devonian  Mount  Douglas  Granite  (Unit LDMD ),  part  of  the  Saint  George Batholith  (see  Bedrock  Lexicon)  to  the  southeast,  and  with  other  small  Late  Devonian intrusions (units LDBH LDK LDPR , , , LDSR , and LDTH ) to the southwest of Mount Pleasant.  All these  rocks  post-date  the  Early  to  Middle  Devonian  Acadian  Orogeny  and  therefore,  lack penetrative deformation fabrics.

(modified from NBDNR 2008)

The  Piskahegan  Group  unconformably  overlies  and  is  in  fault  contact  with  Late  Silurian sedimentary  rocks  of  the  Kingsclear  Group  (Unit LSK ),  part  of  the  Fredericton  belt  (see Figure 4).    Rocks  of  the  Kingsclear  Group  overlie  the  Ordovician  Cookson  Group  (Unit LOCK ), and both groups were poly-deformed and metamorphosed to greenschist grade during the Acadian Orogeny.

The Piskahegan Group, or Mount Pleasant caldera complex, is unconformably overlain by the Early  Carboniferous  Mabou  Group  (Unit ECMA );  more  specifically,  by  shallow  dipping redbeds  of  the  Shin  Formation,  followed  conformably  by  grey  sandstone  of  the  Late Carboniferous  Boss  Point  Formation  (see  Bedrock  Lexicon).    At  least  half  of  the  caldera complex lies beneath these Carboniferous rocks (McCutcheon et al., 1997).

## General Property Geology

The Property comprises parts of eight formal rock units (Figure 6), which are described in the NBDEM  Bedrock  Lexicon  [http://www.gnb.ca/0078/minerals/index-e.aspx].    They  include three formations of the Silurian Kingsclear Group,  two  formations  of the Devonian

<!-- image -->

Piskahegan Group, and three named Devonian intrusions.  Each of these is briefly described below based upon information extracted from the Bedrock Lexicon and elsewhere.  However, much of this formal nomenclature did not exist prior to the 1990s; instead, an informal 'mine terminology'  was  applied  to  rock  units  on  the  Property  by  previous  operators,  which  is subsequently described and correlated with the formal terminology.

(modified after McLeod et al., 1998 and Smith 2005).

## Kingsclear Group

The  western  part  of  the  Property  is  underlain  by  the  Digdeguash,  Sand  Brook  and  Flume Ridge formations.  The Sand Brook Formation has the greatest areal extent and is in direct contact  with  rocks  of  the  Piskahegan  Group  at  the  mine  site.    The  Digdeguash  Formation underlies a small area in the southwest part of the Property and the Flume Ridge Formation underlies an area in the northwest.

<!-- image -->

The  Early  Silurian  Digdeguash  Formation  (Unit SDI )  consists  of  medium  to  dark  grey, medium-  to  coarse-grained,  lithic to feldspathic wacke;  light grey quartz wacke  and polymictic, granule conglomerate; and dark grey to black shale.  Wacke beds are medium-to thick-bedded and commonly graded.  This unit is gradationally overlain by the Sand Brook Formation and is intruded by the Late Silurian Jake Lee Mountain Granite in the southwest corner of the Property.

The Silurian Sand Brook Formation (Unit SSB ) comprises light green to greyish green, thin- to medium-bedded,  fine-grained,  feldspathic  wacke  interstratified  with  maroon  and  green, laminated,  mudstone.    The  green  beds  contain  an  abundance  of  epidote  and  actinolite.    In contrast, the conformably overlying Flume Ridge Formation contains light grey, carbonaterich beds.  The Sand Brook Formation is unconformably overlain by (and/or in fault contact with)  the  Scoullar  Mountain  Formation  or  Little  Mount  Pleasant  Formation,  both  of  which belong to the Late Devonian Piskahegan Group.

The  Late  Silurian  Flume  Ridge  Formation  (Unit SFR )  consists  of  greyish  green,  calcareous sandstone,  siltstone,  and  shale.    The  sandstone  contains  large  detrital  muscovite  flakes  and abundant iron carbonate.  The shale commonly occurs as thin partings in the sandstone rather than as discrete beds.  This formation is unconformably overlain by the Scoullar Mountain Formation near the northern boundary of the Property.

## Piskahegan Group

Much of the eastern part of the Property is underlain by rocks of the Scoullar Mountain and Little Mount Pleasant Formations.  The Little Mount Pleasant Formation has the greater areal extent  of  the  two;  the  Scoullar  Mountain  Formation  is  confined  to  a  narrow,  northerly trending band that extends from the west side of Mount Pleasant to the northern boundary of the Property (see Figure 6).

The  Late  Devonian  Scoullar  Mountain  Formation  (Unit DSM )  is  characterized  by  greenish grey,  cobble  to  boulder,  sedimentary  breccia  with  minor  sandstone,  pebbly  sandstone  and conglomerate, but it also contains local interbeds of quartz-feldspar crystal tuff.  To the east of the Property, at Scoullar Mountain, porphyritic to amygdaloidal andesite flows constitute the top  of  this  formation.    The  sedimentary  breccia  is  dominated  by  clasts  of  metasedimentary rocks, suggesting that the lower contact of this formation is an erosional unconformity, but it also  contains  felsic  tuff  clasts  that  are  typical  of  the  Rothea  Formation  (exocaldera  facies), eruption of which produced the original caldera.  This breccia is interpreted to have formed from talus shed from the ring-fracture fault scarp of that caldera (McCutcheon et al., 1997).

<!-- image -->

The Late Devonian Little Mount Pleasant Formation (Unit DLMP ) is characterized by greyish red,  quartz-feldspar  crystal  tuff  containing  red  clasts  of  pseudomorphed  pumice,  where unaltered, but this formation also contains minor flow-banded rhyolite at the base, which does not  occur  on  the  Property.    Where  altered,  the  rocks  are  greenish  grey  and  with  increasing alteration, feldspar and pseudomorphed pumice clasts become hard to recognize, which is the case on most of the property.  This formation disconformably overlies the Scoullar Mountain Formation and is intruded by feldspar porphyry, a subvolcanic (locally extrusive?) phase of the McDougall Brook Granite.

## Intrusive Rocks

The  John  Lee  Brook  Granite  underlies  the  extreme  southwestern  corner  of  the  Property, whereas the McDougall Brook Granite underlies most of the northeastern part.  Two small plugs of Mount Pleasant Porphyry, one on the North Zone and the other on the Fire Tower Zone,  crop  out  at  Mount  Pleasant  and  a  possible  third  one  subcrops  at  Hornet  Hill (see Figure 6).

The Early Devonian John Lee Brook Granite (Unit DJL )  consists  of  grey,  medium-grained, equigranular,  two-mica  monzogranite.    The  presence  of  primary  muscovite,  and  locally garnet,  distinguishes  this  intrusion  from  others  in  the  Saint  George  Plutonic  Suite.    This granite intrudes both the Digdeguash and Sand Brook formations.  An 40 Ar39 Ar cooling age of 384 ± 7 Ma on muscovite suggests that the granite is Early Devonian (McLeod, 1990).

The  Late  Devonian  McDougall  Brook  Granite  (Unit DMB ) consists predominantly  of porphyritic microgranite (monzogranite) with a border phase of feldspar porphyry and minor equigranular to porphyritic, fine-grained, quartz monzonite.  This granite is the youngest unit within  the  intracaldera  sequence  of  the  Mount  Pleasant  caldera  complex.    All  three  phases occur on the Property, but the feldspar porphyry is the only phase that crops out on Mount Pleasant.   It  intrudes  rocks  of  the  Scoullar  Mountain  and  Little  Mount  Pleasant  formations, but it is intruded by the Mount Pleasant Porphyry.

The Late Devonian Mount Pleasant Porphyry (Unit DMP ) comprises greyish olive to greenish black, sparsely quartz-feldspar phyric porphyry and associated chloritic and silicic breccias. The porphyry occurs as multi-stage, flow-banded dykes and small plugs that grade downward into  granite.    The  breccias  are  both  matrix-supported  and  clast-supported,  but  original  rock types are commonly unrecognizable due to extensive magmatic-hydrothermal alteration.  The breccias and associated intrusive rocks form roughly vertical, pipe-like complexes interpreted to be centres of subvolcanic intrusive and related hydrothermal activity (McCutcheon et al.,

<!-- image -->

2001).    Drilling  and  underground  workings  have  revealed  that  there  are  several  phases  of granite  at  depth,  which  represent  successive  cooling  stages  of  one  magma  body.    These granite  phases,  which  are  described  in  the  next  section,  are  considered  to  be  genetically related to the tungsten-molybdenum and tin orebodies (Kooiman et al., 1986; Sinclair et al., 1988; McCutcheon, 1990).

The geology of the North, Saddle and Fire Tower Zones, plus drillhole locations are shown in Figure 7.

## Mine Terminology

Riddell  (1962)  published  the  first  rudimentary  map  of  the  Mount  Pleasant  deposit  but Ruitenberg (1967) published a better  one  at  a  reasonable  scale,  which  was  based  upon  his unpublished MSc thesis (Ruitenberg 1963).  This map was reproduced as NBDNR Map Plate 69-12 (Ruitenberg 1969), in which the following units are delineated: 'brecciated metasediments  intruded  by  quartz-feldspar  porphyry',  'intensely  altered  quartz-feldspar porphyry', 'intensely altered latite porphyry', and 'banded quartz-feldspar porphyry'.  These four  informal  units  are  now  referred  to  as:  sedimentary  breccia  (Unit SBx ),  quartz-feldspar porphyry  (Unit QFP ),  feldspar  porphyry  (Unit FP ),  and  hydrothermal  breccia  and  granite porphyry (Unit Bx ),  respectively.    This  informal  mine  terminology  is  used  in  Figure  7  and throughout the remainder of this report.  However, keep in mind that the formal names for these units are: Scoullar Mountain Formation, Little Mount Pleasant Formation, McDougall Brook Granite and Mount Pleasant Porphyry, respectively.

Sedimentary breccia (Unit SBx ) crops out intermittently in a narrow belt that extends from the northern boundary of the Property in a southerly direction, along the western flank of Mount Pleasant  towards  the  Fire  Tower  Zone,  where  it  separates  Silurian  sedimentary  rocks  from Unit QFP.  This sedimentary breccia also occurs in the subsurface beneath both the North and Saddle zones, where it  has been intersected in  numerous drillholes.   It  overlies  and  is  also intruded by QFP and FP in the North Zone; however, it appears to overlie FP in the Saddle Zone, either indicating that some FP is extrusive or that FP occurs as a sill in sedimentary breccia.    Where  unaltered,  this  clast-supported  breccia  predominantly  consists  of  variably sized,  angular  fragments  of  Silurian  sedimentary  rocks  (Figure  8a).    However,  this  is  not obvious where the breccia is intensely altered (Figure 8b).

Quartz-feldspar porphyry (Unit QFP ) underlies a large part of the Property, extending from the northern boundary, along the western side of Mount Pleasant past the North Zone, to the Fire Tower Zone and then to the southeast beyond the Property boundary.  It also underlies the northeast corner of the Property.  Where unaltered, the QFP is a pinkish to reddish grey, crystal tuff containing 30 - 40% crystals, with approximately twice as much pink feldspar as clear quartz,  which range in size from 0.5 - 3.0 mm (Figure 9a).  For the most part, the QFP is  an  extrusive  (volcanic)  unit  that  overlies  sedimentary  breccia  but  locally  it  reportedly intrudes this breccia (Ruitenberg 1963).  Where altered, QFP is various shades of green and grey,  with  the  feldspar  largely  replaced  by  alteration  minerals,  although  crystal  forms  are commonly preserved, and quartz crystals are unaffected (Figure 9b).

Feldspar porphyry (Unit FP ) underlies much of the northeastern part of the Property; it crops out intermittently in the  North  Zone but does not occur at surface in the Fire Tower Zone. Where  unaltered,  it  is  greyish  red  to  reddish  brown  and  contains  20  -  35% feldspar phenocrysts (1 - 12 mm) in a very fine grained (microcrystalline) groundmass (Figure 10a). This  unit  represents  the  fine-grained  border  or  sub-volcanic  part  of  the  McDougall  Brook Granite,  which  is  the  terminal  phase  of  igneous  activity  that  produced  the  Mount  Pleasant Caldera, or its extrusive equivalent, the Bailey Rock Rhyolite (McCutcheon et al., 1997).  The FP  intrudes  both  quartz-feldspar  porphyry  and  sedimentary  breccia.    Where  altered,  FP  is various shades of green and grey, with the feldspar largely replaced by alteration minerals, although crystal forms are commonly preserved (Figure 10b).

Hydrothermal breccia and granite porphyry (Unit Bx ) have the least areal extent, compared to the  other  rock  units  at  Mount  Pleasant,  and  they  are  confined  to  two  small  sub-circular (tadpole-shaped) areas, one at the North Zone and the other at the Fire Tower Zone.  Several stages  of  magmatic-hydrothermal brecciation and more than one phase of intrusive activity are apparent, which are associated with a post-caldera granite body at depth.  It was inward cooling  of  the  original  granitic  magma  that  produced  the  magmatic-hydrothermal  fluids, which caused brecciation of the country rocks and carried the metals that formed the tungstenmolybdenum and tin-indium deposits (McCutcheon 1990).

Two  broad  types  of  hydrothermal  breccia  were  recognized  in  the  Fire  Tower  Zone  by Kooiman et al., (1986)  -  an  older  and  more  voluminous  silicic  phase  and  a  younger  crosscutting  chloritic  phase.    The  older  phase  consists  of  angular  to  sub-rounded,  light  grey  to white,  greisenized  fragments  in  a  silicified  matrix,  whereas  the  younger  phase  contains

<!-- image -->

greisenized fragments in a chloritic matrix.  The latter type is generally associated with flowbanded,  'granite-porphyry'  dykes  (Figure  11).    In  thin  section,  these  dykes  bear  little resemblance to granite because they are extremely fine grained (cryptocrystalline), reflecting fluidized emplacement, and are more appropriately called tuffisite dykes (Lentz 2011).  The same types of breccia also occur in the North Zone.

Figure 11.  Photographs of hydrothermal breccia and granite porphyry (Unit Bx ):

Other informal rock units have been recognized in the subsurface at Mount Pleasant.  In the Fire  Tower  Zone, Kooiman et al., (1986) recognized fine-grained  granite,  granite porphyry, and porphyritic  granite,  from  oldest  to  youngest.    In  the  North  Zone,  Sinclair  et al., (1988) recognized  Granite  I,  Granite  II  and  Granite  III,  from  oldest  to  youngest,  which  they correlated with the three phases in the Fire Tower Zone, respectively.

Granite I or fine-grained granite is the oldest intrusive phase in the North Zone and it also occurs  under  the  Fire  Tower  Zone  in  association  with  low-grade  tungsten-molybdenum mineralization (Sinclair et al 2006).  This granite represents the outer, quickly cooled carapace

<!-- image -->

of  the  original  granitic  magma  and  it  is  extensively  altered  and  brecciated  because  it  was affected  by  hydrothermal  fluids  that  evolved  during  cooling  of  the  other  intrusive  phases. Fluids  derived  from  the  magma  during  this  early  stage  of  cooling  were  responsible  for  the initial development of the breccia pipes, specifically the silicic breccia, at the Fire Tower and North Zones and for the tungsten-molybdenum mineralization.  This granite is various shades of  grey,  green  or  white  because  of  alteration,  and  is  distinguished  from  other  phases  by  its grain size, specifically the absence of feldspar phenocrysts (Figure 12).

Granite II or granite porphyry is similar mineralogically to Granite I but it is characterized by feldspar phenocrysts and chloritic alteration.  This granite occurs in the North Zone, Saddle Zone and Fire Tower Zone.  Tin mineralization is generally associated with Granite II.  Two separate  phases  of  Granite  II  have  been  identified:  Granite  IIA  is  fine  to  medium  grained, porphyritic  granite,  whereas  Granite  IIB  is  equigranular,  fine  grained  granite  that  either

<!-- image -->

underlies or crosscuts Granite IIA, the predominant phase.  Granite IIA also occurs as dykes and plugs in the upper  parts of the breccia pipes at both the  Fire  Tower and North  Zones, which  locally  have  surface  expression  (Figure  13).    Granite  IIB  occupies  protrusions  or cupolas that intrude the lower part of the pipe.  The contact between Granite IIA and Granite IIB is defined by comb quartz layers.  Indium-bearing tin-base metal zones in the North Zone are primarily within the Granite IIA, commonly in close proximity to Granite IIB; however, the endogranitic tin is entirely in Granite IIB.

Comb quartz is a layer or band of quartz crystals that are all oriented roughly perpendicular to a plane, such as the wall of a vein, dike or the roof of a magma chamber.  Comb quartz layers near  the  roof  of  a  magma  chamber  are  referred  to  as  unidirectional  solidification  textures ("USTs") and are associated with fluid-saturated and/or undercooled magmas (Sinclair, 1994). USTs,  sometimes  referred  to  as  "brainrock",  are  a  distinctive  feature  restricted  mainly  to

<!-- image -->

Granite  IIB  near  the  Granite  IIA  contact  (see  Figure  13),  and  have  proved  invaluable  in deciphering  the  local  mine  geology  (Gowdy,  1995;  Billiton,  1985).    In  the  Saddle  Zone, Granite II forms a cupola, with Granite IIA above Granite IIB below (Figure 14); comb quartz layers typically occur near the upper contacts of both of these granites.

- d) Drill  core  (wet)  from  hole  AM11-13  showing  growth  zones  (thin  wavy  lines)  in  quartz (divisions on scale are centimetres).

Granite III or porphyritic granite is relatively fresh and generally coarser (medium) grained than Granites I and II.  It extends to the south and appears to be continuous with porphyritic granite that underlies the Fire Tower Zone.  It underlies Granite II and the contact between these two intrusive units is marked by chill zones, aplitic layers or, in some cases, by zones of USTs,  either  comb-quartz  layers  or  dendritic  unidirectional  feldspar  crystal  layers,  another type of UST.  To date, no significant "mineral resource" has been identified within this unit but it has not yet been fully explored (Akerley, 1996; Piskahegan, 1995; ADEX, 1995).

## Mineralized Zones

There  are  three  main  mineralized  zones  at  Mount  Pleasant,  namely:  the  Fire  Tower  Zone, Saddle Zone and North Zone, from south to north. At depth, the Fire Tower and North Zones have  been  subdivided  as  shown  in  a  schematic  longitudinal  section  (Figure 15).    The mineralization in each zone is related to a topographic high (cupola or cusp) in the roof (upper contact)  of  an  underlying  body  of  granite  that  evolved  magmatic-hydrothermal  fluids  as  it cooled.   The  cupolas beneath the Fire Tower and North Zones (not the Saddle Zone) were close  enough  to  surface  that  fluid  pressures  exceeded  the  confining  pressure  of  the  rocks (lithostatic  load),  allowing  hydrothermal  breccias  to  form,  mainly  in  the  country  rocks  but also  in  the  early-cooled  carapace  of  the  granite.    Each  of  these  mineralized  zones  was described in a previously filed NI 43-101 report (Dunbar and de l'Etoile 2009).  The reader is referred to the SEDAR website [http://www.sedar.com/issuers/issuers\_en.htm] for a copy of this report, which contains detailed descriptions of these zones.

The Fire Tower Zone and North Zone deposits are located approximately 1.0 km apart and are mostly less than 400 m vertically from surface.  The Fire Tower Zone contains predominantly large (low grade) tungsten-molybdenum deposits and was previously mined underground for tungsten.  Some small indium-bearing tin-base metal zones are also present.  The North Zone contains the most important indium-bearing, tin-base metal "resources" outlined to date along with  some  poorly  defined  low-grade  tungsten-molybdenum  bodies  (ADEX  1995).    The Saddle  Zone,  located  approximately  halfway  between  the  Fire  Tower  Zone  and  the  North Zone,  contains  tin  and  some  base  metals  and  newly  discovered  tungsten-molybdenum mineralization.    Although  this  report  primarily  focuses  on  the  North  and  Saddle  Zones, specifically on work done on tin mineralization in 2010 and 2011, it does include information from the earlier NI 43-101 technical report on the updated Mineral Resource estimate for the Fire Tower Zone (Dunbar and El-Rassi, 2008, amended 2012).  A brief description of these zones follow.

## North Zone

The  tin  and  porphyry  tungsten-molybdenum  deposits  of  the  North  Zone  represent  two different periods of mineralization even though they overlap spatially.  Tin mineralization in the  North  Zone  is  younger  and  crosscuts  the  older  tungsten-molybdenum  zones.    Six  tin deposits have been delineated, some near surface and others at depth.  Historically, each one of these deposits has been called a zone but they are actually subzones of the North Zone and should be renamed accordingly.  However, to maintain consistency with previous descriptions

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

lower case spelling of 'zone' is used to show their secondary importance to the main North Zone.   These are named as follows:

- · Deep Tin Subzone (zone);
- · Upper Deep Tin Subzone (zone);
- · Endogranitic Subzone (zone);
- · North Adit Subzone (zone);
- · North W-Mo Subzone (zone); and
- · #1 to #6 Tin Lodes.

The Upper Deep Tin zone is the shallowest of all the tin-bearing deposits in the North Zone with the exception of the Tin  Lodes.  Contact bodies associated  with the Endogranitic  and North Adit zones are deposits that flank the granitoid cupola and its protuberances and also its crest (Sinclair 1994).  The Endogranitic, Deep Tin and North Adit zones and the Sn lodes near surface are generally steeply dipping, whereas the Upper Deep Tin zone is more or less subhorizontal.  Indium-bearing tin-base metal zones in the North Zone appear to be principally associated with sphalerite and are more concentrated in the Deep Tin zone (Figure 16).

<!-- image -->

The  principal  metallic  minerals  in  these  deposits  are  cassiterite,  arsenopyrite,  löllingite, sphalerite and  chalcopyrite  with  lesser  amounts  of  stannite,  pyrite, marcasite, galena, wolframite,  molybdenite,  tennantite,  chalcocite,  bornite,  native  bismuth,  bismuthinite  and wittichenite.  The main non-metallic minerals are fluorite and chlorite (Kooiman, 2004).

Fander (1990) did a petrographic study of 35 tin-bearing samples from the North Zone and found that tin mostly occurs as cassiterite (oxide) with tin-sulphide phases present in a few of the  samples.    He  noted  that  '… much  of  the  cassiterite  is  exceedingly  fine-grained  when considered  as  individual  crystals,  and  the  masses  of  dehydrated  Sn  hydroxides  are  often composed of grains too small to resolve with an optical microscope …' However, he reported that there are two populations of cassiterite: large single crystals and crystal aggregates that are  amenable  to  a  coarser  grind  and  gravity  separation,  and  small  individual  crystals  that could be recovered by finer grinding and flotation (Figures 17 and 18).  Because of this, he advised  that  '… upgrading/processing  needs  to  be  handled  with  care,  based  upon  an understanding  of  the  mineralogy '  and  cautioned  that  '… there  could  be  a  temptation  to overgrind, leading to needless problems, expense, and loss of cassiterite .'

Four  tungsten-molybdenum  deposits  have  been  identified  in  the  North  Zone,  which  are labelled 'W' (eastern), 'X" (southern), "Y' (western), and 'Z' (upper).  They form a ring-like pattern  with  a  low  grade  to  barren  central  core  (Parrish  and  Tully  1976).    The  W  and  X deposits are actually one body, the only difference between them being that the X deposit, in part, overlaps the Deep Tin zone, and more rarely, the Upper Deep Tin zone.  The Y deposit is  the  largest,  and  the  Z  deposit  is  the  smallest  but  it  has  the  highest  tungsten  and  lowest bismuth grades of the four deposits.  These deposits are similar to, but smaller in size than, those of the Fire Tower Zone and are of lower grade (Kooiman et al 2005; Kvaerner 1997). The  tin  content  of  these  deposits  reflects  the  superposition  of  the  younger  tin-base  metal mineralization  on  the  tungsten-molybdenum  deposits.    Indium  content  is  low  (typically ≤1 ppm)  in  tungsten-molybdenum  deposits  that  are  not  overprinted  by  the  tin-base  metal mineralization.

## Saddle Zone

Tin-base  metal  mineralization  was  discovered  in  the  Saddle  Zone  during  a  1988  surface drilling program  that was  initiated by Lac Minerals because tin mineralization was encountered underground, during development work between the Fire Tower Zone and the North Zone (Sinclair 1994).  A 40-metre section in hole LNZ-15, within Granite IIA, graded 0.33% Sn.    Subsequently,  NovaGold  Resources  intersected  a  16-metre  section,  also  within granite, of 1.31% Sn in drillhole NMR-89-1; this hole also intersected W-Mo-Bi mineralization within quartz-feldspar porphyry adjacent to this granite (Sinclair, 2011).  Holes drilled  during  the  2011  campaign  show  that  tin  mineralization  has  greater  extent  than previously known (Figure 19) and that tungsten-molybdenum mineralization is also present.

Figure 19.  Photographs of tin mineralization in the Saddle Zone:

Sinclair  (2011)  prepared  a  brief  description  of  the  Saddle  Zone,  parts  of  which  are  quoted and/or paraphrased as follows:  'The Saddle Zone intrusion is part of a ridge of Granite II that extends north from the Fire Tower North Zone and lies east of a hill (or ridge) of Granite III.

<!-- image -->

The intrusion is roughly oval in plan, about 300 m long by 200 m wide near its base.  It is steep-sided in sections and is highest in the southwest part of the intrusion in the vicinity of drillhole  AM11-16,  where  narrow  dykes  form  the  upper  part  of  the  intrusion.'  Tungstenmolybdenum mineralization occurs above the east shoulder of Granite IIA and extends to the south above the ridge of Granite IIA.  This zone is on the order of 50 to 100 m wide, 25 to 100 m high and extends at least 150 m down the southern side of Saddle Zone intrusion and along the crest of the ridge of Granite IIA.  In places, the zone extends into Granite IIA, but mainly it occurs above the contact.  Further drilling is required to fully delineate the resources of  the  Saddle  Zone  and  to  determine  if  mineralization  is  continuous  with  that  in  the  Fire Tower Zone to the south.

## Fire Tower Zone

The Fire  Tower  Zone  is  a  tungsten-molybdenum  deposit  that  contains  three  distinct  zones: Fire  Tower  North,  Fire  Tower  West  and  Fire  Tower  South.    The  tungsten-molybdenum deposits in the Fire Tower Zone mainly occur in the lower part of the breccia pipe and the upper part of the underlying fine-grained granite, and to a lesser extent in associated volcanic rocks (Kooiman et al, 2005).  These low-grade porphyry-type deposits are characterized by extensive  stockworks  of  mineralized  fractures  and  quartz  veinlets.    Higher  grade  zones occurring in areas of intense fracturing measure 200 to 300 m across and as much as 100 m in vertical extent. The  high-grade  zones  are  surrounded  by  lower-grade  zones  that  are characterized  by  more  widely  spaced  fractures  that  extend  for  hundreds  of  metres  into  the surrounding rocks.

Mineralization occurs as veinlets and disseminated grains in breccias mainly located within the  Mount  Pleasant  porphyry.    The  principal  "economic-type"  minerals  are  fine-grained wolframite and molybdenite, along with minor amounts of native bismuth and bismuthinite. The gangue minerals consist of cassiterite, arsenopyrite, löllingite, quartz, topaz and fluorite. Multi-stage  mineralization  is  indicated  by  crosscutting  relationships  between  mineralized fractures and veinlets.  Sparse molybdenum-bearing fractures in fine-grained granite appear to represent  the  final  stage  of  mineralization  associated  with  crystallization  of  this  granite. Finally, the tungsten-molybdenum deposits appear to predate crosscutting dykes of unmineralized granite porphyry that truncate mineralized stockwork zones.

Some small indium-bearing tin-base metal zones are also present.  The characteristics of the indium-bearing  tin-base  metal  deposits  hosted  within  the  Fire  Tower  Zone  have  been  best described by Kooiman et al. (2005).  These deposits occur as irregular veins and mineralized breccias  that  are  irregularly  distributed  throughout  the  Fire  Tower  Zone  and  are  associated with altered and mineralized granite porphyry dykes.  Throughout the Fire Tower Zone, the

<!-- image -->

tin-base  metal  deposits  either  crosscut  or  truncate  tungsten-molybdenum  stockworks.    In general, veins range from 1 to 2 cm in width and up to several metres in strike length.   In places, larger veins up to 10 m in width and 100 m long can occur.  Veins pinch and swell along strike and contain abundant chlorite and fluorite and disseminated massive sulphides. The Fire Tower Zone contains one tin lode, called the No.  7 tin lode.

Mineralized breccias are irregular bodies and occur as small vertical circular pipes up to 10 m wide  and  100 m  in  vertical  extent.    These  breccias  can  contain  fine-grained  sulphides  and cassiterite as well as chlorite and fluorite.

The  indium-bearing  tin-base  metal  veins  and  breccias  contain  the  principal  oxide  minerals cassiterite and wolframite. Sulphide mineralization consists mainly of sphalerite, chalcopyrite,  galena  and  arsenopyrite  and  minor  amounts  of  pyrite,  löllingite,  molybdenite, tennantite, native bismuth and bismuthinite.

The  reader  is  referred  to  the  NI  43-101  technical  report  by  Dunbar  and  El-Rassi  (2008, amended 2012) for additional details on the Fire Tower Zone.

## 8.  DEPOSIT TYPES

As noted in a previously filed 43-101 report by Dunbar and de l'Etoile (2009), the North Zone deposits at Mount Pleasant have many characteristics in common with porphyry tin deposits. However, at the time of discovery in the late 1950s, it was difficult to establish a geological model for the tin-base metal mineralization at Mount Pleasant because similar deposits were not  known  in  New  Brunswick  or  elsewhere  in  Canada.    Comparisons  were  made  with hypothermal-type  deposits  of  Cornwall,  England,  or  xenothermal-type  deposits  of  Bolivia (Riddell, 1962; Hosking 1963).  Hosking (1985) concluded that the North Zone tin deposits were broadly similar in geological setting to Bolivian porphyry deposits, excluding the very rich Tin Lodes.  He noted that exogranitic and endogranitic tin deposits, which are associated with the apices of granitoid cusps (cupolas), are common and well-documented in many parts of  the  world,  including  eastern  Germany,  Czechoslovakia,  eastern  Australia  and  eastern Mongolia.    Parts  of  the  North  Zone  have  also  been  compared  to  granite-related  greisen deposits, such as Cinovec, Krupka and Krasno in Czechoslovakia (Billiton Canada Ltd. 1985b).    On  the  'Metallogenic  Map  of  New  Brunswick'  (2002),  Mount  Pleasant  is classified as a 'greisen and stockwork vein' deposit type, which equates to the porphyry tin deposit type (model 20a of Cox and Singer 1986; model 19.7 of Kirkham and Sinclair 1996). At Mount Pleasant, porphyry tin mineralization is younger than, and partly overlaps, earlier porphyry tungsten mineralization (model 16 of Cox and Singer 1986; model 19.6 of Kirkham and Sinclair 1996).

The regional and deposit scale characteristics of various types of porphyry deposits, including porphyry  tin,  have  been  described  by  Seedorff  et al., (2005)  and  Sinclair  (2007).    A generalized magmatic-hydrothermal model illustrating how porphyry deposits form, originally described by Burnham (1967), is shown in Figure 20.  In this model, a small body of  magma  of  intermediate-composition  is  cooling  from  the  margin  (contact  with  its  host rocks) inward and evolving large volumes of magmatic, metal-bearing fluids that episodically become  over-pressured  and  break  the  surrounding  rocks,  releasing  metals  and  fingers  of magma (dykes) into the resulting fractures and breccias.  The episodic nature of this cooling process ultimately concentrates enough metals to form a mineral deposit, the nature of which largely depends upon the composition and tectonic setting of the intrusion.  For porphyry tin deposits,  relatively  small  granitic  intrusions  in  post-orogenic,  extensional  settings  are  a prerequisite, especially in areas underlain by thick continental crust.

Compared to Mount Pleasant, the orange colour is fine-grained granite (Granite I), representing the  quenched  margin  of  the  intrusion  (magma  chamber);  note  that  this  phase  did  not  reach anywhere  near  surface  in  the  North  Zone.    The  pink  colour  is  granite  porphyry  (Granite  II), representing  the  inward-cooling  part  of  the  magma  chamber  (successive  stages  of  cooling  are shown by blue lines labeled S1, S2 and S3), which evolved magmatic-hydrothermal fluids that episodically over-pressured and fractured (heavy black lines) the early cooled parts (carapace) of the  intrusion  and  its  host  rocks.    When  over-pressuring  occurred,  fingers  of  magma  escaped, forming dykes (American spelling on diagram) that cut the carapace and metals were expelled from  the  top  of  the  magma  chamber  into  the  fractured  rocks.    The  red  colour  is  Granite  III, representing the final (post-convective) stage of cooling of the intrusion (granite); note that the temperature of the Mount Pleasant magma would have been approximately 700ºC, not 1000ºC as illustrated.

A  detailed  description  of  the  porphyry  tin,  deposit  type  can  be  found  in  the  BC  Mineral Deposit Profiles, under 'Listing by Deposit Group', as Porphyry Profile L06 [http://www.em.gov.bc.ca/Mining/Geoscience/MineralDepositProfiles/ListbyDepositGroup/P ages/LPorphyry.aspx].  Tin mineralization, predominantly fine-grained cassiterite, occurs in stockworks of cross-cutting fractures and quartz veinlets, or is disseminated in the matrix of hydrothermal breccias.  Veins, vein sets, and replacement zones may also be present.  The deposits vary in shape from inverted cone, to roughly cylindrical, to highly irregular.  They are  typically  large,  generally  hundreds  of metres  across  and  range  from  tens  to  hundreds of metres in vertical extent.

## 9.  EXPLORATION

The  reader  is  directed  to  the  2006  WGM  technical  report  for  details  regarding  all  of  the exploration  work  conducted  on  the  Mount  Pleasant  Property  from  1994  to  2006  (Watts, Griffis and McOuat, 2006).

Exploration work carried out by the Company between 2006 and 2008 primarily consisted of a two-phase 13,300 m exploration and definition drilling program to expand the then existing Mineral Resource estimate of the FTZ tungsten-molybdenum deposit and to provide drillhole data for a Mineral Resource estimate for the NZ tin-indium deposit.  Also during this time, the surface exposure of the FTZ was trenched and chip-sampled.

This section pertains to most recent exploration work carried out, including the re-sampling of historical trenches, which was conducted in the fall of 2010.  No geophysical surveys have been  conducted  on  the  Property  since  the  last  NI  43-101  Report  (Dunbar  and  de  L'Etoile 2009)  was  filed.    The  results  of  exploration  drilling  done  on  the  Property  since  then  are summarized in Section 10.  The following description was prepared by G. Kooiman and the authors believe it is accurate but have not independently verified the information.

## 9.1 PROCEDURES/PARAMETERS OF SURVEYS AND INVESTIGATION

## Historical View

In the early 1960s, several trenching/stripping programs were carried out on the North Zone, in the vicinity of what are now called the #1 and the #3 lodes, to help delineate structures and mineralized zones.  Between the beginning of September 1961 and the end of October 1962, Mount  Pleasant  Mines  Limited  (' MPM' )  stripped  a  large  area  measuring  approximately 260 m by 137 m.  Trenches were cut in the rock at 20 foot (6.1 m) intervals between minegrid sections 50900 E and 51300 E (later converted to metric sections 15514 E and 15636 E, respectively).  Some 3.66 km of trenching was completed, which involved clearing vegetation and  overburden  by  tractor,  drilling  and  blasting,  and  rock  breaking.    A  few  trenches  were excavated to a depth of 1.2 to 1.8 m, a width of 1.8 m and a length of 30 m.  A surface assay plan,  dated  August  1963,  showing  the  original  trenching  results  of  MPM  was  compiled  by Behre  Dolbear  &amp;  Company  Inc. of  New  York  (Banfield  1963);  this  company  cleaned approximately 1.1 km of old trenches during the summer of 1965 and check-sampled MPM's results by panel sampling areas measuring 1.5 m long by 0.9 m wide.  This work formed the basis for selecting trenches to be re-sampled during the fall of 2010.

## Trenching Program in 2010

Four historical trenches, originally dug by MPM, were selected for re-sampling in 2010.  The four  trenches,  labelled  T1  to  T4,  are  located  on  mine  grid  sections  15618  E,  15600  E, 15569 E,  and  15551 E,  respectively,  MPM  grid  lines  51240  E,  51180  E,  51080  E,  and 51000 E.  Approximately 106 m of old trenches were cleaned by excavator and rock breaker, as well as manually, before re-sampling.  Chip samples were collected in the deepest, least oxidized parts of the trenches.  Approximately 5 to 8 kg of rock was collected per sample; each sample represents one linear metre along the trench, except for one sample in Trench T3 (#185192), which covers two metres of trench.  The rocks were mostly chloritized, silicified and, in places, brecciated feldspar porphyry (FP), with minor granite porphyry (GP) occurring as irregular dykes.  A grab sample (# 185198) from a small breccia pipe adjacent to Trench T3 was also collected.

Trench T1 was 21 m long and sampled from south to north.  The first sample from 0-1 m (# 186046) was at mine grid coordinates 15618 E, 13702 N and elevation 1,265 m.  The last sample  from  20  -  21 m  (#  186026)  was  at  mine  grid  coordinates  15618  E,  13723  N  and elevation 1,262 m.

Trench T2 was 25 m long and also sampled from south to north.  The first sample from 0-1 m (# 186025) was at mine grid coordinates 15600 E, 13700 N and elevation 1272 m, which is 25 m north of the collar of historical hole E-3.  The last sample from 24 - 25 m (# 186001) was at mine grid coordinates 15600 E, 13725 N and elevation 1,268 m.

Trench T3 was 31 m long and sampled from north to south.  The first sample from 0-1 m (# 186047) was at mine grid coordinates 15569 E, 13726 N and elevation 1,268 m.  The last sample  from  30  -  31 m  (#  185197)  was  at  mine  grid  coordinates  15569  E,  13695  N  and elevation 1,265 m.

Trench T4 was 30 m long and sampled from north to south.  The first sample from 0-1 m (# 186651) was at mine grid coordinates 15551 E, 13721 N and elevation 1,266 m.  The last sample  from  29  -  30 m  (#  186680)  was  at  mine  grid  coordinates15551  E,  13691  N  and elevation 1,266 m.

## 9.2 SAMPLING METHODS AND SAMPLE QUALITY

The quality of the 2010 samples could not possibly be as good as the original 1960s samples because the rocks were freshly exposed at that time.  Approximately 50 years of weathering undoubtedly caused oxidation of some minerals.  However, care was taken to get the freshest

<!-- image -->

material  possible  for  each  composite  chip  sample  and  the  samples  were  collected  by experienced people, G. Kooiman and W. Maston, using hammers and a rented rock breaker. At least twenty small samples, ranging from large chips to small hand specimen, were taken in each metre of trench and placed in plastic sample bags.  An assay tag was inserted into each bag,  the  tag  number  was  written  on  the  bag  with  indelible  marker,  and  the  bag  was  sealed using  a  plastic  zip  lock.    Several  bagged  samples  were  placed  in  fiberglass  shipping  bags, secured with zip locks and taken to the mine site for safe keeping until all four trenches were sampled.    Subsequently,  they  were  delivered  directly  to  the  sample  preparation  facility  of Activation  Laboratories  Ltd. (Actlabs)  in  Fredericton,  with  instructions  to  process  them  as described in Section 11 of this report.  No blank, duplicate or standard samples were inserted into the sample stream by ADEX geologists.

## 9.3 RESULTS AND INTERPRETATION OF EXPLORATION

A  tabulated  list  of  significant  assays  from  re-sampling  of  trenches  in  2010  is  shown  in Table 4.

The  results  of  the  2010  sampling  are  comparable  to  the  1960s  assays  for  the  equivalent sample intervals. In short, the results show that fifty years of weathering has not affected the compositional integrity of the mineralization that much.

## 10.  DRILLING

Historical drilling on the Mount Pleasant Property is described in Section 6 of this Report. Three previously filed NI 43-101 reports, one by Dunbar et al., (2006), the second by Dunbar and El-Rassi (2008, amended 2012) and the third by Dunbar and de l'Etoile (2009), provide details of ADEX's 1996 and 2008 drilling programs on the Property, which are summarized in Table  5  below.    The  reader  is  referred  to  these reports on  the  SEDAR  website [http://www.sedar.com/issuers/issuers\_en.htm]  for  more  information.  This  section  describes diamond drilling programs that were conducted in 2008, 2010 and 2011.

## 2008 Drilling Program

Since 2008, ADEX completed 47 drillholes in total for its Phases 1 and 2 programs for a total of  13,300 m,  testing  both  the  tin-indium-zinc-copper  and  tungsten-molybdenum-bismuth zones  throughout  the  Property.    These  drill  programs,  operated  under  the  supervision  of ADEX geological staff, were carried out in order to verify the extent of known mineralization, to delineate the possible extensions of zones and to expand on the existing Mineral Resource estimates at the FTZ and NZ.   Drilling was also completed to recover fresh drill core material for metallurgical bench and mineralogical testing.

## Phase I

ADEX completed a 6,030 m Phase 1 diamond drilling program on the Property from March 1 to June 1, 2008 covering both the FTZ and NZ.  Drillholes AM-08-08, 09 and 11 to 16 tested the FTZ; drillholes AM-08-01 to 07 and 10 tested the North Zone.  ADEX designed the FTZ drilling program following the 2006 recommendations presented by WGM (Watts, Griffis and McOuat, 2006).

The Phase 1 resource definition drill program of the FTZ was completed:

- 1. to upgrade the classification of the 2006 resource estimation of the FTE and FTN;
- 2. to delineate additional tonnage in parts of the deposit not previously drill tested; and,

<!-- image -->

- 3. to determine if there was justification to upgrade the resource categorization of the FTZ from an "inferred" to the "indicated" category.
- 4. to recover fresh drill core for metallurgical and mineralogical testing.

A total  of  nine  holes  were  drilled  totalling  3,312 m  (Table  6).    Two  of  these  twined  1995 drillholes  PRL  95-2  and  PRL  95-4.    The  remaining  holes  were  drilled  to  delineate  further mineralization  within  the  deposit.    The  drill  contract  was  awarded  to  Lantech  Drilling Services  Inc.  of  Dieppe,  New  Brunswick.    Core  size  was  "NQ".    Down  hole  surveys  were completed using a Reflex single shoot instrument every 100 m.  Upon the completion of each hole, the casing was left in for all holes, the holes were capped and numbered and the collar location recorded using a global positioning instrument ("GPS").

ADEX logged  the  core,  Rock  Quality  Designation  ("RQD")  and  core  recovery  data  were collected  and  the  core  was  photographed  and  split.    Drill  geologists  used  a  binocular microscope  to  assist  in  identifying  the  individual  mineral  phases  within  the  drill  core  as mineralization is commonly very fine grained and not visible to the naked eye.

A total of 619 spit core samples were collected from the FTZ drillholes, each measuring 3.0 m in length.  All analytical results were added to the company's GEMCOM digital database.

The  significant  drill  results  are  summarized  in  Table  7.    A  comparison  of  the  2008  twin drillholes with the 1995 drillholes is summarized in Table 8 demonstrating a moderately good comparison of analytical results with the twin holes.

Drillhole  AM-08-09  weaves  in  and  out  of  the  FTN  with  core  intersects  looking  like  they intersected  fingers  of  mineralization  rather  that  one  complete  zone.    Hole  AM-08-11  was drilled straight down  the  middle  of  the  FTN.    The  best  mineralization  in  terms  of molybdenum was intersected from 270 to 291 m.  The silicified breccias contained a lot of arsenopyrite, which is typical of the FTN mineralization.  Hole AM-08-13 was abandoned due to a lost drill bit in fractured ground.  The core was logged but did not contain any visible mineralization so no core samples were taken from this hole.  Drillhole AM-08-13A stopped

<!-- image -->

near the top of the FTZ due to drill problems just as it started to intersect core  containing interesting  mineralization.    Hole  AM-08-15  was  drilled  to  test  mineralization  previously intersected by hole PRL 95-4 and AM-08-08.  This hole intersected part of the mineralized body at depth and essentially closed off the FTZ to the east but extended the deposit in that direction.  The zone remains open to the south of the drill holes.  Mineralization is shouldered by a quartz feldspar porphyry unit.  Tungsten-molybdenum is commonly associated with fine grained bismuthite with arsenopyrite.

## Phase II

A Phase 1I drill program, consisting of four holes totalling 1,126 m, was completed on the FTZ.    Vertical  holes  AM-08-21  and  AM-08-24  were  drilled  to  depths  of  435  and  531 m, respectively. According  to  ADEX,  hole  AM-08-24,  drilled  100 m  north-northeast  of AM-08-11,  has  extended  the  FTN  a  farther  40 m  in  that  direction.    Hole  AM-08-21  was drilled  50 m  south  of  AM-08-08  to  test  the  FTE  Sub-Zone.    Preliminary  assay  results  are summarized in Table 9.

The  remaining  two  holes  were  drilled  to  test  a  known  surface  exposure  of  tin-zinc-copper mineralization within an area called the "Fire Tower Breccia" which is located in the FTZ. Hole AM-08-42 was drilled east at an inclination of 60° to a depth of 100 m.  The second hole AM-08-43, also drilled toward the east, had an inclination of 45° and a final depth of 60m. Assay results are presented in Table 10. No estimation of true width can be provided at this stage for any of the Phase 1I drillholes.

## Drillhole Surveying

In  May,  the  drill  collar  locations  for  holes  AM-08-08  and  AM-08-09  were  surveyed  by Murphy Surveys  (1990)  Ltd. (" MSL "),  located  in  Old  Ridge,  New  Brunswick.    Surveying was done using a real time Trimbel G8 (base and rover) receiver with a Trimble TSC2 data collector/controller. All  points  were  acquired  within  an  accuracy  of  ±0.1 m  or  less. Coordinates are reported in NAD83.  At the time of the survey, all of the Phase 1 drilling of the North Zone was completed but only the first two holes, hole AM-08-08 and AM-08-09, in the Fire Tower Zone had been drilled.

ADEX submitted the MSL collar data for holes AM-08-08 and AM-08-09 and June WGM GPS collar  survey  coordinates,  using  a  GARMIN  12,  for  the  remaining  holes  to  SRK  for importing into the GEMCOM database for the resource calculation.  It should be noted that the accuracy of the WGM survey data reported ranged from 4.0 to 5.0 m.  Comparisons of the WGM hole coordinates for holes 8 and 9 against the MSL data differed by 1.0 to 2.0 m.

In October, MSL returned to Mount Pleasant and completed surveying the rest of the Phase I and II drill collar locations.

## 2010 and 2011 Drilling Programs

Contracts for both drilling programs were awarded to Lantech Drilling Services Inc. (" LanTech ") of Dieppe, New Brunswick.  Core size was "NQ".  Down hole surveys were completed  using  a  Reflex  single  shoot  instrument  every  100 m.    Upon  completion  of  each hole, the casing was left in and the hole was capped and numbered (Figure 21).  The drilling was conducted under the supervision of ADEX geological staff.

Approximately  10,741 m  were  drilled  in  the  two  programs.    In  2010,  26  holes  totalling 3,734 m were drilled and sampled; in 2011, 18 holes (1 to 17, plus 17A) totalling 7,007 m were  drilled  and  sampled.    The  relationship  between  sample/intersection  lengths  and  true thickness is not known for these holes.  All reported intervals are intersection widths, not true widths.  Drillhole locations are shown on the geology map (see Figure 7 in Section 7 in this Report), and the drillhole metadata are provided in Tables 11 and 12.

ADEX geological personnel logged the core at its drill-core storage facility on the mine site. Core from the 2010 program was logged by T. Boyd, G. Kooiman, and W. Maston, whereas core from the 2011 program was logged by G. Kooiman, D.V. Venugopal and Wei Zhang. Rock Quality Designation ("RQD") and core recovery data were also collected; the core was partially  photographed,  and  intervals  (mostly  3 m  long)  were  marked  and  tagged  by  the geologist  to  be  split  by  technical  personnel.    A  binocular  microscope  was  used  to  assist  in

identifying the individual mineral phases within the drill core because the mineralization is very fine grained and commonly not visible to the naked eye.

After the drilling was completed, the drill collar locations for both the 2010 and 2011 holes were  surveyed  by  Murphy  Surveys  (1990)  Ltd. (" MSL "), located  in  Old  Ridge,  New Brunswick.  Surveying was done using a real time Trimbel G8 (base and rover) receiver with a  Trimble  TSC2  data  collector/controller.    All  points  were  acquired  within  an  accuracy  of ±0.1 m or less, and reported to three decimal places in Canadian Standard Reference System (NB  Stereographic,  NAD'83)  coordinates  as  well  as  Mine  Grid  coordinates.    The  NB Stereographic coordinates are rounded to zero decimals and their equivalent UTM, NAD'83 coordinates are also shown.

The author used a hand-held GPS (Garmin model 60CSx) to check the locations of 18 of the 43 holes (10 from 2010 and 8 from 2011) against coordinates obtained by MSL, and found that the UTM coordinates differed by only 1.0 to 2.0 m.

The purpose of the 26 hole, 2010 program was to delineate tin, indium, and zinc resources in the North Zone, which were known from historical drilling and from ADEX's 2008 program, and to collect geotechnical data (3 holes) to help site a new portal and decline into the North Zone.  Fifteen of the holes were oriented vertically and the others were inclined, varying from -41 to  -75 degrees;  the  holes  varied  in  length  from  35  to  250 metres.    A  summary  of  what each  2010  hole  intersected  can  be  found  in  Appendix  1  and  a  tabulated  list  of  significant intersections is presented in Table 13.

Hole AM10-10 was drilled at -60º towards 260º magnetic to try to duplicate historical hole MPS-112, which was drilled at -45º towards 260º magnetic.  This historical hole intersected nearly 58 m of 0.07% Sn and 2.81% Zn; however, AM10-10 cut 6 m of 4.67% Sn, 14.5% Zn and 984 g/t In.

The  purpose  of  the  18  hole,  2011  program  was  to  further  delineate  (infill  holes)  the  tin, indium,  and  zinc  resources  of  the  North  Zone  and  to  obtain  mineralized  material  for metallurgical testing (3 holes).  In addition, the open, east side of the North Zone was drill tested, following up on positive exploration results from the 2010 drill program, and six holes were drilled in the Saddle Zone, located approximately half way between the North and Fire Tower zones, which had not been drilled since 1990.  All of the holes were oriented vertically and varied in length from 75 to 570 metres.  A summary of what each 2011 hole intersected can be found in Appendix 2 and a tabulated list of significant intersections is presented in Table 14.

To  the  author's  knowledge,  there  are  no  drilling,  sampling  or  recovery  factors  that  could materially affect the accuracy and reliability of the analytical results.

## 11.  SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND SECURITY

## 11.1 SAMPLE PREPARATION AND ASSAYING

The following section applies to sampling of a historical rock dump in 2009, to sampling of trenches  in  2008  and  2010;  to  sampling  of  drill  cores  in  2008,  2010  and  2011,  and  to  reanalysis of sample pulps from a few historical holes, which was done in 2008, 2010 and 2011. Information  regarding  sample  preparation,  analyses  and  security  was  obtained  through discussions with G.  Kooiman and information provided from reports provided by ADEX and directly  by  the  analytical  laboratories.    The  authors  believe  this  information  is  accurate  but have not independently verified the information.

Composite samples were collected for assay during 2009 from a rock dump in front of, and adjacent to, the 600 Adit portal (UTM coordinates: 670040 East, 5034803 North), situated on the northwest side of the North Zone.  The material was collected under the supervision of Trevor Boyd, P.Geo, ADEX's qualified person at that time.  During the 1960s, approximately 1000 tonnes of mineralized material had been selectively extracted from the #1-3 Tin Lode sub-zone via the 600 Adit and piled outside but never processed.

In June 2009, a series of small pits were dug throughout the rock dump and 10, approximately 10 kg samples were taken in order to assess their metal content for metallurgical testing.  The samples were sent to Activation Laboratories (' Actlabs' )  in  Ancaster,  Ontario  for  analysis using the same methods as described in the technical report of Dunbar and de L'Etoile (2009).

The  results  of  the  initial  sampling  were  encouraging,  so  in  July  and  August,  161.5  tonnes were taken from this rock dump using a mechanical back hoe, in addition to hand sorting. The  material  was  placed  in  five  piles  near  the  600  Level  Adit  portal  and  then  shipped separately to the crushing facilities of Fundy Contractors Limited at Bethel, near St. George, where each pile was crushed to pass a -12.5 mm screen.  The crushed material was returned to the Mount Pleasant mine site and stored on separate prepared pads.  The fine fraction (-5 mm) of the largest pile (pile #5) was placed upon a separate pad.  One sample was taken from each pile except for the coarse fraction of pile #5, where two samples were taken.  In total, seven approximately 10 kg composite samples were taken and sent to Actlabs for analysis.  Details regarding both stages of sampling are shown in Table 15.  The analytical results showed that the weight-adjusted average grade of the five piles is 0.03% MoS2, 0.06% WO3, 0.63% Sn, 0.55% Cu, 0.13% Pb, 1.39% Zn, 0.04% Bi, 1.07% As and 228 ppm In.  The six sample piles were then combined into a single bulk sample pile and stored in the mill building, to be used as feed for future metallurgical bench and pilot testing.

All four trenches that were excavated in 2010 (see Section 9 in this report), were chip sampled for analysis, with each sample being one metre in length except for one two metre sample.  A total of 106 samples were collected for assay, 21 from Trench 1, 25 from Trench 2, 30 from Trench 3, and 30 from Trench 4.  Notable assay results from this trenching are summarized in Table 4 in the Exploration section.  One grab sample from a breccia pipe adjacent to Trench 3 was also assayed.

Of the 44 holes drilled (counting AM11-17 and AM11-17A as two) during 2010 and 2011, 38 of the cores obtained were sampled for analysis.  A total of 2319 mineralized samples were collected for assay, 1121 samples from 23 of the 2010 cores, and 1198 samples from 15 of the 2011 cores.  Notable assay results from this drilling are summarized in the Drilling section. Three geotechnical holes (AM10-02, AM10-03 and AM10-26) and three metallurgical holes (AM11-10, AM11-11 and AM11-12) were not assayed.

A total of approximately 400 kg of rejects from the 2008 drill program were shipped to SGS Mineral Services Canada (' SGS' ) in Toronto during 2010 for metallurgical testing.  Rejects from holes AM 08-03, AM 08-04, AM 08-06, AM 08-07, AM 08-30, AM 08-31, AM 08-35, AM 08-37 and AM 08-40A were utilized.  Thirty five kilograms of drill core from holes AM 08-03, AM 08-04, AM 08-30, AM 08-31, AM 08-35 and AM 08-40A were obtained for rod grindability work and shipped to SGS during 2010.  During 2011, 45 kg of drill core rejects from  the  2010  drill  program  obtained  from  holes  AM-10-16,  AM-10-18,  AM-10-20  and AM-10-21 were shipped to SGS.

In  2008, ADEX collected 300 split core samples from 1995 Piskahegan Resources Limited drillholes  PRL-94-1,  PRL-95-3,  PRL-95-4  and  PRL-95-5.    The  drill  core,  not  previously sampled, was split in half following the same method for the 2008 drill core samples.

The 2006 original split  core samples for drillholes PRL95-02, B104, B114 and B169 were assayed by IC90M for In, As, Bi, Cu, Mo, Pb, Sn and W using sodium fusion and ICP-MS finish.  Zinc was determined using the ICM90A method.  The 2008 ore grade analyses at SGS used sodium peroxide fusion with ICPOES finish for As, Bi, Cu, Mo, Pb, Sn, W and Zn.  In was  determined  by  method  ICM90A.    Pulps  submitted  to  Activation  laboratories  were analyzed for In and Bi by sodium fusion, ICP/MS finish, for As, Cu, Pb and Zn by sodium fusion, ICP finish, and for Mo, Sn and W by XRF fusion.

In  general,  all  mineralized  and  altered  cores  were  sampled;  only  un-mineralized  or  weakly altered cores were left un-split.  Core intervals were marked off and tagged, mostly in 3 m sample lengths, by the geologist who logged the core.  The maximum sample interval was 4.5 m and the shortest interval was 0.5 m.  These intervals were split by technical personnel, under the supervision of the geologist, using a hydraulic splitter.  The entire split was placed in  a  plastic  bag  with  the  sample  tag;  the  tag  number  was  written  on  the  bag  with  indelible marker, and the bag was sealed using a plastic zip lock.  The remaining half of the core was put  back  in  the  box  with  the  duplicate  sample  tag  for  future  reference.    Individual  bagged samples were placed in fiberglass shipping bags, secured with zip locks and delivered directly to  Activation  Laboratories  Ltd. (Actlabs)  sample  preparation  facility  in  Fredericton.    No blank,  duplicate  or  standard  samples  were  inserted  into  the  sample  stream  by  ADEX geologists.

The majority of the analytical work between 2006 - 2008 was completed by SGS Mineral Services (" SGS ")  located  in  Don  Mills,  Ontario  (Boyd, 2008, 2006).  This laboratory is an ISO/IEC 17025 accredited laboratory.  Samples, including those from the 2008 drill program, were analyzed for W, Mo, Sn, Bi, As, Zn, Cu, Pb, and ICP-MS finish for In.  The following methods were used to analyze samples at SGS:

- · A sample, weighing less than 3.0 kg, was first dried, crushed to 75% passing 2 mm, split to 250 g and then pulverized to 85% passing 75 micron (method code PRP89);
- · Ore grade analysis by sodium peroxide fusion, ICPOES finish for Cu, Pb, Zn, As, Sn, Bi, Mo and W (method code ICP90Q);

<!-- image -->

- · Indium by sodium peroxide fusion ICP-MS finish using method code IC90M (detection limit  0.2  ppm  to  0.1wt  %).    Over-limit  Indium  analyses  were  completed  using  method code ICP90Q after sodium fusion ore grade analyses; and,
- · In  and  Zn  by  sodium  peroxide  fusion/ICP-AES  and  ICP-MS  finish  (method  code ICM90A).

The 2008 pulp duplicates plus the additional core and pulp samples were sent to Activation Laboratories (" Actlabs "), located in Ancaster, Ontario, for analysis as follows:

- · The sample was dried, crushed (90% to pass 2 mm), split to 250 gm and pulverized to 95% passing 75 micron at their sample preparation facility in Fredericton, New Brunswick;
- · Peroxide  fusion  and  ICP  analysis  for  Cu,  Pb,  Mo  and  As  (method  code  8).    Detection limits 0.01 wt % for As, Pb and Zn, 0.008 for MoS2, and 0.005 for Cu;
- · Peroxide fusion ICP/MS analysis for Bi and In (method code 8).  Detection limits 2 ppm for Bi and 0.2 ppm for Indium; and
- · Fusion  XRF  for  Sn  and  W  (method  code  8).    Detection  limits  0.002  wt  % for  Sn  and 0.003 wt% for WO3.

Actlabs is ISO/IEC 17025 and CAN-P-1579 (Mineral Analysis) accredited by the Standards Council of Canada (SCC).

The 2006 original split  core samples for drillholes PRL95-02, B104, B114 and B169 were assayed by IC90M for In, As, Bi, Cu, Mo, Pb, Sn and W using sodium fusion and ICP-MS finish.  Zinc was determined using the ICM90A method.  The 2008 ore grade analyses at SGS used sodium peroxide fusion with ICPOES finish for As, Bi, Cu, Mo, Pb, Sn, W and Zn.  In was  determined  by  method  ICM90A.    Pulps  submitted  to  Activation  laboratories  were analyzed for In and Bi by sodium fusion, ICP/MS finish, for As, Cu, Pb and Zn by sodium fusion, ICP finish, and for Mo, Sn and W by XRF fusion.

ADEX grab samples FC-1 to FC-5 collected for the barrels of crushed W-Mo ore material and the 19 pulps collected from the sulphide concentrate pond were analyzed by SGS using the following analytical methods:

- · Code FAI303, 30 g sample of pulverized material was fire assayed for Au with an ICP finish; and,

<!-- image -->

- · Code ICM90A (described above) for 54 elements including Cu, Zn, Ag, As, Bi, In, Mo, Sn and W.

The high-definition mineralogy assessment completed at SGS Lakefield was completed using QEMSCAN technology and X-ray diffraction analyses.  Electron Microprobe  analysis was completed on the indium carrying minerals.

The drill core from the 2010 and 2011 drilling programs is stored in racks, either in the core logging  building  or  on  the  mine  site,  which  has  a  security  fence  around  it  and  a  security person  on  duty  24  hours  a  day,  7  days  per  week.    All  drill  core  from  previous  drilling programs is stored within the confines of this fenced compound.  All coarse rejects and pulps are also stored, either in the core building or in locked, metal shipping containers within the fenced compound.

Upon receipt at Actlabs' facility in Fredericton, New Brunswick, each sample was:

- · logged into the company's tracking system and dried;
- · crushed (90% to minus 10 mesh or 2 mm) in entirety; and
- · mechanically split (riffle) to obtain a representative 250 g sample.

Each 250 g sample was pulverized (95% to minus 200 mesh or 0.075 mm) using a mild steel mill,  and  the  resulting  powders  were  then  shipped  by  bonded  courier  to  the  company's laboratory in Ancaster, Ontario for analysis.

All of the 2010 powdered samples were analysed as follows:

- · sodium  peroxide  fusion  of    0.2  g  of  powdered  sample,  acid  dissolution  of  the  fused sample, followed by ICP/OES analysis (Code 8 - Peroxide Fusion ICP) for As, Cu, Mo (reported as MoS2), Pb, and Zn;
- · sodium peroxide fusion of 0.2 g of powdered sample, acid dissolution of the fused sample, followed by ICP/MS analysis (Code 8 - Peroxide Fusion ICPMS) for Bi and In; and
- · lithium metaborate/tetraborate fusion of 0.5g of powdered sample, with the resulting glass disc analysed for Sn and W (reported as WO3) using a Panalytical Axios Advanced wavelength dispersive XRF (Code 8 - Fusion XRF).

The detection limits in weight percent, except for In, were as follows: As = 0.01, Bi = 0.002, Cu = 0.005, In = 0.2 ppm, MoS2 = 0.008, Pb = 0.01, Sn = 0.002, and WO3 = 0.003.  Actlabs inserted  blanks,  duplicates  and  certified  standards,  including  at  least  one  of  three  Mount

Pleasant standards (MP-1a, MP-1b and MP-2), into each batch of samples as part of its quality control program.

Most of the 2011 powdered samples (except those from holes AM11-02 and AM11-04, which were done the same way as the 2010 sample) were analysed as follows:

- · sodium peroxide fusion of 0.2 g of powdered sample, acid dissolution of the fused sample, followed by ICP/OES analysis (Code 8 - Peroxide Fusion ICP) for As, Cu, Mo (reported as MoS2), Pb, and Zn; and
- · sodium peroxide fusion of 0.2 g of powdered sample, acid dissolution of the fused sample, followed by ICP/MS analysis (Code 8 - Peroxide Fusion ICPMS) for Bi, In, Sn, and W (reported as WO3).

The detection limits are the same as those given above.

In addition, 306 samples from historical holes were submitted to Actlabs for re-analysis by the methods  described  above.    This  included  117  samples  from  two  AM96  series  cores, 168 samples from five MPS series cores (assayed for In only), and 21 samples from one LNZ series core.  The AM96 series samples were mostly newly split core that had not previously been assayed; the MPS series samples were all quartered core because pulps no longer exist; and the LNZ series samples were mostly pulps with a few samples of previously un-split core.

As  part  of  its  due  diligence  procedures,  ADEX  dispatched  252  pulp  samples  by  bonded courier  to  SGS  Canada  Mineral  Services  Inc. (' SGS' )  in  Toronto  for  assay  verification  of approximately every 10 th sample that was sent to Actlabs.  In addition, 39 pulp samples from hole LNZ-15 were sent to SGS for re-assay.  Each of these samples was analyzed as follows:

- · dried,  weighed  and  crushed  to  75% passing  2 mm,  split  to  250  g  and  pulverized  to 85% passing 75 microns (0.075 mm) as required;
- · sodium peroxide fusion of 0.2 g of powdered sample, acid dissolution of the fused sample, followed by ICP-OES analysis (Code ICP90Q) for As, Bi, Cu, Mo, Pb, Sn, W, and Zn;
- · sodium peroxide fusion of 0.1 g of powdered sample, acid dissolution of the fused sample, followed by ICP-MS analysis (Code IC90 m) for In.

The detection limit in weight percent for all elements by ICP90Q was 0.01%; the reporting range for indium by IC90 m was 0.2 ppm - 0.1%.  SGS inserted duplicates into the sample stream as a quality control measure.  Furthermore, ADEX inserted certified standards, MP-1b and MP-2 (either one or both), into every other batch of samples sent to SGS.

Both  Actlabs  (Ancaster)  and  SGS  Mineral  Services  (Toronto)  are  ISO/IEC  17025  and CAN-P-1579  accredited.    ISO  17025  is  the  main  standard  used  by  testing  and  calibration laboratories;  it  has  many  commonalities  with  the  ISO  9000  (9001,  9002) standard,  but emphasizes  both  management  and  technical  requirements.    Management  requirements  are primarily related to the operation and effectiveness of the quality management system within the  laboratory.    Technical  requirements  address  the  competence  of  staff,  methodology, test/calibration  equipment  and  test  methods.    Full  validation  of  test  methods  and  proof  of proficiency set this standard apart from ISO 9001 or 9002.  CAN-P-1579 details the Standard Council  of  Canada's  (SCC)  requirements  for  the  accreditation  of  mineral  analysis  testing laboratories.    It  is  specific  to  laboratories  that  perform  mineral  analysis  for  exploration, mining and mineral processing projects; it elaborates upon and adds requirements to those in the  ISO  17025  standard.    Both  Actlabs  and  SGS  have  an  arms-length  relationship  with ADEX; no employee, officer, director or associate of ADEX has any affiliation with these companies, other than as a customer.

## 11.2 QA/QC

For the 2010 drilling program, pulps from 96 of the 1121 samples that were sent to Actlabs were also submitted to SGS for analysis by ADEX.  The assay results for arsenic, bismuth, tin,  and zinc show good correlation between the two analytical laboratories, with R -values 2 ≥0.95  (Figure 22).    However,  molybdenum,  copper,  indium,  and  tungsten  show  decreasing R 2 -values of 0.92, 0.89, 0.70, and 0.61, respectively (Figure 23).  Lead (not shown) has the lowest  R-value  (0.01)  of  any  element,  largely  because  two  samples  (427849  and  427850) from hole AM10-14 have radically different results by the two labs (1.61% and 1.71% from Actlabs, versus below detection limit from SGS for both samples).  The same two samples also have very different copper values (0.14% and 0.34% from SGS versus below detection limit  from  Actlabs),  accounting  for  the  low  R-value  of  copper.    Four  samples  (428178, 428320,  428330  and  428340)  from  three  holes  (AM10-24,  AM10-22  and  AM10-18, respectively)  account  for  the  low  R-value  of  indium.    The  SGS  values  in  parts  per  million (ppm) for these four samples are 82, 136, 113, and 227, respectively, versus 447, 2, 8, and 85 from Actlabs.  The original assay certificates confirm the numbers are correct so the reason for this discrepancy is unknown.

For the 2010 trenching program, pulps from 11 of the 107 samples that were sent to Actlabs were also submitted to SGS for analysis.  The assay results for arsenic (not shown), copper, indium,  lead,  tin,  tungsten  and  zinc  show  good  correlation  between  the  two  analytical laboratories,  with  R -values  ≥  0.92;  however,  bismuth  and  molybdenum  have  R -values  of 2 2 0.77  and  0.34,  respectively  (Figures  24  and  25).    The  low  R -values  for  the  latter  two 2 elements reflect the fact that many values for both are at or near their detection limits.

In 2010, several MPS-series cores were quartered and re-assayed at Actlabs for indium only, because Brunswick Tin Mines (BTM) did not assay for this element at the mine laboratory. Pulps from 15 of the 168 samples that were sent to Actlabs were also submitted to SGS for the  complete  suite  of  elements  normally  assayed.    For  the  scatter  plots,  all  assay  values (except for indium) are from the BTM laboratory.  The assay results for arsenic (not shown), copper, indium, tin, and zinc show good correlation between the two analytical laboratories, with  R -values  ≥  0.99  (Figure  26).    However,  tungsten,  lead,  molybdenum,  and  bismuth 2 exhibit decreasing R -values of 0.87, 0.84, 0.74, and 0.71, respectively (Figure 27).  The low 2 R 2 -values reflect the fact that many of these samples have values less than or equal to twice their detection limits.

For the 2011 drilling program, pulps from 122 of the 1198 samples that were sent to Actlabs were  also  submitted  to  SGS  for  analysis.    The  assay  results  for  all  elements  show  good correlation  between  the  two  analytical  laboratories,  with  R -values  ≥  0.98  (Figures  28  and 2 29).  The highest R-value is for copper and the lowest R-value is for molybdenum.

In 2011, parts of two LNZ-series cores were assayed, one at Actlabs and the other at SGS. The interval of interest in core LNZ-15 was originally assayed at the mine laboratory by Lac Minerals, so pulps were available for re-assay, and results from the two laboratories could be compared.  For hole LNZ-17, however, only three samples were previously assayed from the interval of interest, so there are few data to compare.  Comparison of LM's results with those of SGS, for LNZ-15 shows good correlation for arsenic, bismuth, tin and zinc with R -values 2 ≥ 0.95 (Figure 30).  Copper and molybdenum both have R -values ≥ 0.91 but the R-value for 2 tungsten is only 0.48 and there is no value for lead because all of the SGS data are below detection limit (0.01%) for lead (Figure 31).

In  the  authors'  opinion,  the  sample  preparation,  security  and  analytical  procedures  used  by ADEX  conform  to  generally  accepted  practice  of  the  Canadian  mining  industry  and  are adequate for the purposes of this report.

## 11.3

Effort was made to secure the chain of custody of all samples that were sent for analysis.  This included careful labelling of sample bags, sealing them with zip locks immediately after their collection,  and  delivery  of  the  samples  directly  to  Actlabs  by  ADEX  personnel,  or  to  SGS Mineral Services by bonded courier.  All pulps and coarse rejects from SGS were returned to the mine site by bonded courier.  Pulps and rejects from Actlabs were released in work-order sequence to ADEX personnel at the sample preparation facility in Fredericton, once a final assay report for that work order was completed.  All returned pulps and coarse rejects were stored in metal shipping containers by work order within the security-fenced compound that surrounds the mine site.  The compound is monitored by a security guard on duty 24 hours a day, 7 days per week.

## 12.  DATA VERIFICATION

Drill core and surface rock samples collected by ADEX and previous owners of the project were submitted by these companies to various accredited laboratories.  The independent QP viewed recent drill core and collected verification samples.  These samples were collected and assayed independently of ADEX to validate the results.  Although the authors have reviewed a  selection  of  assay  results  and  Certificates  generated  by  the  labs  and  believe  they  are generally  accurate,  the  authors  are  relying  on  the  labs  as  experts  in  the  field  of  analytical procedure.

Data  verification  by  the  independent  QP  included  the  following  components  of  ADEX's 2008, 2010 and 2011 work:

- · site visits to verify drilling;
- · core logging and independent sampling of drill cores;
- · collection of composite samples;
- · comparison of values in assay certificates with those in the GEMCOM database; and
- · comparison of measured and certified values for analytical standards that are specific to Mount Pleasant.

Each of these components is more fully described below.  In addition, historical data from C-series, DDH-series, E-series, LNZ-series, MPS-series, and U-series holes in the GEMCOM database of the North Zone were randomly checked against hardcopy assay files at the mine site in early January, 2012.

## 12.1 SITE VISITS

In  2008,  WGM  conducted  two  visits  to  the  Mount  Pleasant  Property.    The  first  visit  was completed from May 2 nd to May 6, 2008 when only hole AM-08-08 had just finished being drilled.  A second visit was conducted from June 23 to 26, 2008 upon the completion of the Phase 1 drill program.  During each visit, all of the new exploration work was reviewed, the 2008 drill core was examined and each of the drill sites was visited.  A GPS (Garmin 12XL) was  used  to  record  the  locations  of  the  drill  collar  casings  (NAD83,  Zone  19T).    Digital photographs  were  taken  to  document  the  field  visit  and  sampling  activities.  A  total  of 13 samples  of  the  drill core were  taken  to  determine  their  precious  and  base  metal concentrations and confirm the presence of mineralization.

<!-- image -->

WGM submitted the 13 quarter split drill core samples and one standard to SGS in Don Mills. The following analytical methods were used to assay the samples:

- · Preparation code PRP89 as described above;
- · Ore  grade  analysis  using  method  ICP90Q  for  Cu,  Pb,  Zn,  As,  Sn,  Bi,  Mo  and  W  as described above;
- · A 50 g pulp fire assayed for gold, ICP-AES finish (method FAI505);
- · IC90M for In as described above with over-limit In analyses by ICP90Q; and,
- · A 50 g pulp assayed for Ag (method AAA50).

One  standard  sample  MP-2  was  submitted  with  this  batch  of  samples  as  part  of  WGM's QA/QC procedures and is the same standard inserted by ADEX in sample shipments to the various laboratories.  This tungsten-molybdenum ore reference material has been certified by CANMET Mining and Mineral Sciences Laboratories, located in Ottawa, Ontario as part of the Canadian Certified Reference Materials Project ("CCRMP").  The certified values were not reported to ensure its continued use in future ADEX diamond drilling programs.

The QP (Dr. Steven McCutcheon, P.Geo.) made four visits to the Property in 2011, which pertain to the 2010 and 2011 drilling programs.  The first was on September 28 th to  30 th ,  at which time an active drill site and several drill collars were visited with G.  Kooiman; core logging, splitting and sampling procedures were observed in the core building; and the core and pulp storage areas were inspected.  Also, drill cores from three holes were inspected and photographed.  The second visit was on October 17 th , after the drilling program was finished, at which time two additional drill cores were inspected and photographed.  The third visit was on November 3 rd and 4 th , after most of the assays were in-hand, at which time quarter samples were collected from mineralized intervals in ten drill cores -  five from the 2010 program and five  from the 2011 program.  The fourth visit was on December 2 nd and  3 rd ,  at  which  time samples were collected from a stockpile of tungsten ore as a bulk sample for metallurgical testing.  During this visit, GPS coordinates were obtained from 10 of 26 drill collars in the 2010 program and from 8 of 18 drill collars in the 2011 program.

## 12.2 CORE LOGGING AND SAMPLING

Drill cores from holes AM11-07, AM11-10, AM11-12, AM11-13 and AM11-14 were logged by the QP to obtain a 'feel' for the nature and distribution of the mineralization with respect to its host rocks and associated alteration.  Holes AM11-07 and AM11-13 are from the Saddle Zone; the other three are from the North Zone.  Photographs of various features in these cores were taken for documentation purposes but no samples were taken during the logging process.

<!-- image -->

Sampling intervals were selected by the QP after reviewing the assay data from both the 2010 and  2011  drilling  programs.    Only  intersections  with  significant  assays  over  two  or  more standard  sample  intervals  were  selected  for  sampling  as  the  true  widths  of  these  intercepts may exceed the minimum mining width requirement of 3 m.  Two contiguous samples were taken  in  the  6 m  interval;  each  sample  comprised  3 m  of  quartered  core  that  matched  the original split-core interval that was sent to Actlabs for assay.  Cores AM10-05 (4 samples), AM10-10  (2 samples), AM10-13  (4  samples), AM10-18  (2  samples), and AM10-21 (4 samples)  were  sampled  from  the  2010  drilling  program.    Cores  AM11-02  (2  samples), AM11-04  (2 samples), AM11-07  (4  samples), AM11-14  (4  samples), and AM11-15 (4 samples) were sampled from the 2011 drilling program.  In total, 32 samples were taken. The author supervised the quartering of the core; personally inserted the sample tags in their plastic bags and secured them with zip locks; packed the samples in plastic shipping pails and secured the lids; and delivered the pails directly to the bonded courier for shipping to SGS for analysis with instructions to use the same analytical procedures used by ADEX (described in Section  11)  and  to  send  a  copy  of  the  results  directly  to  the  author.    Standards  were  not submitted with this batch of samples because they were included in the original sample stream at Actlabs and ADEX's check samples at SGS provide a basis for comparison.

Comparison  of  the  results  from  Actlabs  and  SGS  for  these  32  samples  shows  reasonable correlation between the two analytical laboratories for zinc, arsenic, molybdenum and copper, with R -values ≥ 0.92 (Figure 32).  However, R -values for tin, bismuth, lead and indium are 2 2 0.90,  0.85,  0.85  and  0.77,  respectively  (Figure  33).    Tungsten  (not  shown)  has  the  lowest R-value at 0.04.  The low R -values most likely reflect the inhomogeneous distribution of the 2 mineralization  in  the  core,  i.e.,  the  quarter-sampled  material  was  different  from  the  splitsampled material.

This is the most reasonable explanation, given the fact that there is good correlation between Actlabs and SGS for re-assays of samples during the entire 2011 drilling program (see Figures 28 and 29, previously).

## 12.3 ADDITIONAL CORE SAMPLING OF 1995 HISTORICAL DRILL CORE

ADEX conducted a review of all historical drillholes completed to date on the FTZ to identify holes containing un-split drill core that resided either in geologically favourable areas within 200 m from surface  and/or  core  sections  with  visible  tungsten  or  molybdenum,  zinc  or  tin mineralization not previously sampled.

This  review  identified  four  1995  Piskahegan  Resources  Limited  drillholes,  designated  as PRL-94-1, PRL-95-3, PRL-95-4 and PRL-95-5, which contained mineralized core that was not  previously  sampled.      All  four  holes  were  part  of  Scotia  or  Fire  Tower  East  ("FTE") subzones of the FTZ.  A total of 300 samples were collected as follows:

- · PRL 95-1: 171710 - 171793 (84 samples);
- · PRL 95-3: 171794 - 171800, 171151 - 171186 (43 samples);
- · PRL 95-4: 171101 - 171150, 171651 - 171709 (109 samples); and,
- · PRL 95-5: 171187 - 171200, 173251 - 173300 (64 samples).

Each  sample  measured  ten-feet  (3.1 m)  in  length  which  was  consistent  with  Piskahegan's historical  sampling  procedure.    ADEX  entered  all  of  the  assay  results  into  the  GEMCOM database.

Two  new  zones  of  mineralization  were  identified  in  drillholes  PRL95-04  and  PRL95-05. Hole PRL-95-04, which originally intersected deeper zinc-copper-tin-indium mineralization at a depths of 384.1 to 396.3 m, returned a new zone of tungsten-molybdenum mineralization at a  shallower  vertical  depth,  between  279.6  to  362.8 m.    This  section  of  core  returned 0.30% WO3, 0.20% MoS2 and 0.06% Bi over a core length of 83.2 m.  A new shallow zone, containing low grade zinc-copper-tin-indium, was identified in hole PRL95-05 from 109.8 to 131.1 m, which returned 2.63% Zn, 0.15 % Cu, 0.10% Sn and 45 ppm In over a core length of 21.3 m.    None  of  the  samples  collected  in  this  interval  contained  any  significant  values  of tungsten or molybdenum.   However, it should be noted that three zones containing a mixture of  these  metals  as  well  as  varying  concentrations  of  zinc,  copper,  tin  and  indium  were previously defined between vertical depths of 152.4 to 334.5 m. ADEX recalculated the new significant intersection grades using both the new assay data and historically reported assays (Boyd, 2008).

According to Boyd (2008), none of the sampling in holes PRL 95-01 or PRL 95-03 returned any significant assay values.  Additional sampling of unsplit core at depths of less than 200 m was undertaken in holes PRL95-02 and PRL95-03 in follow-up to the results in PRL95-05.

## 12.4 COMPOSITE SAMPLES

In addition, three composite samples were collected from a stockpile of tungsten-bearing ore that  came  from the  Fire Tower Zone for metallurgical work.  This stockpile came from the Secondary  Crusher  feed  in  the  mill  and  dated  back  to  the  last  stages  of  mine  operation  in 1985.  The 'mine/mill daily tonnage and grade' report for the month of May 1985 showed that  24,755  tonnes  of  ore  were  processed  at  an  average  grade  of  0.34% WO3.   ADEX  had previously  collected  one  composite  sample  from  this  stockpile  and  sent  it  to  Actlabs  for analysis.

Each composite sample, including the ADEX sample, comprised fist-sized pieces of freshly broken rock that were randomly selected from the stockpile of material.  The individual pieces were washed with water and placed in a plastic bucket; each bucket weighed approximately 25 kg.  The author collected one sample from the Secondary Crusher floor, and two others from the A-frame building where the bulk sample was being accumulated prior to shipping. One of the latter samples was taken from the amassed bulk sample and the other was from the northeast  corner  of  the  shed  where  another  ore  pile  was  located.    At  the  time,  there  was  a possibility that this ore pile might have to be included in the bulk sample if enough material could not be had from the Secondary Crusher feed.

Samples collected by the QP were sent to SGS for assay; each bucket was packed, sealed and personally delivered to a bonded courier for shipping.  The instructions to SGS were to crush the entire sample, homogenize it and split to 250 g, after which processing was to follow the same procedures as described in Section 11.  The analytical results were to be sent directly to the author.

The analytical results are shown in Table 16 along with data from the ADEX sample.  The overall  WO3  grade  from  the  Secondary  Crusher  feed,  approximately  0.26% at  SGS  and 0.28% at  Actlabs,  is  somewhat  lower  than  the  average  mill  feed  (0.34%)  from  May  1985. However, on individual days during that month, values ranged from 0.16 - 0.57% WO3.

## 12.5 COMPARISON OF ASSAY CERTIFICATES AND ASSAY VALUES

Independent  verification  of results from  the  2010-11  core-sampling  was  achieved  by comparing results reported by  ADEX with copies of original, signed Assay Certificates (in PDF format) that were obtained directly from Actlabs and SGS.  Random checks of individual samples revealed that values in ADEX's GEMCOM database were identical to those in the Assay Certificates.

In addition, historical data from C-series, DDH-series, E-series, LNZ-series, MPS-series, and U-series holes in the GEMCOM database of the North Zone were randomly checked to verify which 'NS' values for Zn, WO3 and MoS2 should be replaced by numeric zero values.  This was done by comparison of assay values in hardcopy assay sheets stored at the mine site with values  in  an  Excel  file  extracted  from  the  database.    Necessary  changes  were  made  to  the Excel file and then it was returned to ADEX for incorporation into the database.

## 12.6 COMPARISON  OF  MEASURED  AND  CERTIFIED  VALUES  OF STANDARDS

Canadian Certified Reference Materials (standards) have been prepared by CANMET from tin-bearing and tungsten-bearing material obtained from Mount Pleasant.  Standard MP-1 was a certified reference material for zinc-tin-copper-lead ore, which was first issued in 1978.  It became exhausted and a new standard, named MP-1a, was prepared in 1983 to replace the original  one.    Standard  MP-2,  a  certified  reference  material  for  tungsten-molybdenum  ore, was prepared at the same time.  Revised values for these two standards were reported in 1996. Standard  MP-1a  was  replaced  by  standard  MP-1b  in  2008.    The  reference  values  used  for MP-1a and MP-2 in Table 17 are from 1996, and those for MP-1b are from 2008.

As part of its quality control procedures, Actlabs included one or more of standards MP-1a, MP-1b and MP-2 in each batch of samples that ADEX submitted for assay during 2010 and 2011.  Perusal of Table 12 reveals the following:

- · The average measured values in 2010, of all elements except As, are within the certified error ranges (± numbers) for standard MP-1b.  However, the measured ranges (High and Low values) for As, Cu, Mo, Pb and Zn have some values that are outside the certified error ranges (&lt;Cert.  Range; &gt;Cert.  Range).  The median value (Median) for As is at the upper limit of the certified range;

- · The average measured values in 2010, of all elements except Mo, are within the certified error ranges for standard MP-2.  Furthermore, the measured ranges for Bi, Sn and W are either within or are very close to their certified error ranges.  Only one value for Mo is higher than its certified range;
- · The  average  measured  values  in  2011,  of  all  elements  except  Mo  are  lower  than  the certified error ranges for standard MP-1a;
- · The average measured values in 2011, of all elements except As, Cu and Zn, are within the  certified  error  ranges  for  standard  MP-1b.    However,  the  measured  ranges  for  all elements have values that are outside their certified error ranges.  Notably, 58 of 62 Zn values and 33 of 62 Mo values are below their certified lower limits (&lt;Cert.  Range); and
- · The average measured values in 2011, of all elements except Mo, are within the certified error  ranges  for  standard  MP-2.    Furthermore,  the  measured  ranges  for  Bi  and  Sn  are either within or are very close to their certified error ranges.  Notably, 11 of 20 W values and all 6 Mo values are below their certified lower limit; in fact, the median value for Mo is approximately half of its certified average value.

To sum up, the measured values of Mount Pleasant standards indicate that Actlabs' analytical data  for  the  2010  and  2011  drilling  programs  are  quite  good  for  most  elements,  with  the following  caveats.    Arsenic  (As)  values  are  likely  a  bit  too  high  and  molybdenum  (Mo) values, especially in molybdenum-rich samples, and zinc (Zn) values are probably too low. However,  it  is  the  QP's  opinion  that  the  analytical  data  from  past  and  current  drilling programs are adequate for the purposes of this report since tin and indium are the main metals of interest in the North Zone.

In addition, ADEX submitted blind samples of standards MP-1b and/or MP-2 into some of its batches  of  Actlabs'  pulp  samples  that  were  sent  to  SGS  for  re-analysis  in  2011.    For comparison, the  SGS measured values on these  standards  are  shown  in  Table  18.    For  the three analyses of standard MP-1b, the average measured values for all elements, except zinc (Zn), are within their certified ranges.  Notably, all three Zn values are less than the certified lower limit of standard MP-1b.  For both analyses of standard MP-2, the measured values of all elements are within their certified ranges.

## 12.7 RE-SAMPLING OF TUNGSTEN-MOLYBDENUM ORES

In 2006, ADEX collected five grab samples, numbered FC-1 to FC-5, from sealed barrels of crushed W-Mo mineralized ore placed in long-term storage at the mine site (see reference to barrels,  Watts,  Griffis  and  McOuat,  2006,  page  62).    Historical  records  indicate  that  these barrels  were  believed  to  contain  material  that  originated  from  the  FTZ  that  was  mined  by Billiton just before production halted in 1984 (Boyd, 2006).  The same analytical procedures were  used  as  recommended  by  WGM  (Watts,  Griffis  and  McOuat,  2006).    Boyd  (2006) concluded that  the  analytical  results  were  consistent  with  historical  WO3  and  MoS2  grades reported from the FTZ.

## 12.8 RE-ANALYSES OF SULPHIDE CONCENTRATE POND PULPS

During the Billiton Mount Pleasant mining operations, a flotation circuit recovered sulphides in  the  ore  prior  to  further  processing  of  the  tungsten  ore  (Boyd,  2006).    This  sulphide concentrate  was  disposed  of  in  a  pond  located  behind  the  warehouse  (Watts,  Griffis  and McOuat, 2006).   In  1995,  ADEX  analyzed  nineteen  samples  of  the  concentrate  for  mostly zinc and molybdenum to assess their economic potential.

In 2006, the preserved pulps were reanalyzed using the analytical methods recommended in the NI 43-101 report.  According to Boyd (2006), the results were "largely consistent with the 1995 analytical results but consistently lower than the original estimated grade determined by Billiton during disposal by Billiton".

## 12.9 DUPLICATE ANALYSES OF 2006 PULP SAMPLES

As part of ADEX's due diligence program, 46 pulp samples previously analyzed by ADEX in 2006 by SGS were dispatched to SGS and Activation Laboratories for re-analyses using assay methods for comparison against original geochemical methods.  Fourteen samples originated from drillhole PRL 95-02, drilled by Piskahegan Resources in 1995   The remaining samples . were  from  the  1981  to  1985  Mount  Pleasant  Tungsten  Mine  drill  program,  holes  B104  (9 samples), B114 (21 samples) and B169 (2 samples).

The initial split core samples were analyzed for In, As, Bi, Cu, Mo, Cu, Pb, Sn, and W using method IC90M and ICM90A for Zn only (see Section 13.0, Sample Preparation, Analyses and Security).  In 2008, the pulp samples were re-submitted to SGS for the same elements by methods  ICP90Q  and  ICM90A  (In  only).    The  pulps  were  then  dispatched  to  Actlabs  for check assaying using analytical method Code 8 (XRF, ICP and ICP/MS finish).

ADEX's  comparative  examination  of  the  different  analytical  methods  between  the  two laboratories resulted in the following conclusions (Boyd, 2008):

- 1. Concentrations  of  indium,  copper,  lead  and  arsenic  compared  well  between  the  two laboratories and differing analytical methods.
- 2. Molybdenum, tungsten  and  bismuth,  on  average,  differed  by  less  than  5% between  the two laboratories with SGS usually reporting the higher grades.
- 3. Activation results were lower in zinc in comparison to SGS by nearly 10%.
- 4. No trends were evident for tin.
- 5. The MP2 standard reference material returned values similar to accepted values at SGS, but measured values at Actlabs were generally lower than accepted values.

In 2008, ADEX collected 20 additional pulp duplicate samples from the Piskehegan drill core. Samples were taken from the following holes:

- · PRL-95-1, 9 samples;
- · PRL-95-3, 1 sample; and,
- · PRL-95-4, 10 samples.

ADEX dispatched 32 pulps and 16 rejects, originally assayed by SGS, to Actlabs for recheck analyses (approximately 8.0% of the original 619 split core samples taken).  Overall, the SGS results compared well with those obtained by Actlabs (Table 19).  There was some variability with the rejects which is to be expected due to sample heterogeneity.

In 2008, WGM collected a total of 13 samples of drill core during the site visits to determine their  precious  and  base  metal  concentrations  and  confirm  the  presence  of  mineralization. Each WGM sample was a ¼ split of an original sample interval collected by ADEX.  Overall, the  assay  results  compare  reasonably  well  with  the  original  assays  obtained  over  the  same intervals by ADEX (Table 20), with the following exceptions for WGM samples:

- · sample MP14 was 35% lower in MoS2;
- · sample MP15 had over three times as much WO3;
- · sample 2286 had less than half as much Sn;
- · sample 2282 returned lower concentrations of MoS2 and
- · sample 2289 returned significantly higher values of Sn, WO3, Zn, In, As and Bi.

No significant gold assays were obtained from any of the samples.

## 13.  MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING

## 13.1 METALLURGICAL TESTING COMPLETED PRIOR TO 2010

The  reader  is  referred  to  the  Watts,  Griffis  and  McOuat  technical  reports  entitled,  " A Technical Review of the Mount Pleasant Property, Including a Mineral Resource Estimate of the North Zone, Southwestern New Brunswick for Adex Mining Inc ." (Dunbar and de L'Etoile, 2009) for a description of the 2006 to 2009 test work that has been completed on the Property. The reader is further referred to the Watts, Griffis and McOuat technical report entitled " A Technical Review of the Mount Pleasant Property, Including a Mineral Resource Estimate for the  Fire  Tower  Zone,  Southwestern  New  Brunswick  for  Adex  Mining  Inc. "  (Dunbar  et  al. 2006) for a description of historical mineral processing and metallurgical testing completed on the Property prior to 2006.

The  test  work  completed  prior  to  2010  most  relevant  to  the  Fire  Tower  and  North  Zones involves  mineralogical  characterization  and  bench  scale  testing  to  develop  a  gravity-based flowsheet for recovery of tin concentrate.

ADEX awarded a contract to SGS Lakefield in May, 2008 to characterize the elemental and mineralogical make-up of seven 10 - 30 kg samples, two from the Fire Tower Zone and five from the North Zone.  The contract included the following parameters:

- · The quantification of mineral types;
- · Liberation characteristics of minerals (metals) of value;
- · Association of minerals (metals) of value with gangue materials and impurities;
- · Mineralogical-limiting grade-recovery relation of minerals (metals) of value; and
- · Mineral release of metals of value (liberation as a function of grain size).

This work was conducted under the direction of Thibault &amp; Associates Inc.; the results of this work were provided to ADEX (SGS 2008) and they are summarized in the previous Technical Report on the North Zone (Dunbar and de L'Etoile, 2009).  Information from this work, such as  detailed  grain  size  and  liberation  analysis  of  recoverable  minerals,  was  provided  to  SGS Mineral  Services  UK  Ltd.  for  further  development  of  grinding,  gravity  separation  and flotation test programs.

SGS Mineral Services UK Ltd. was contracted by ADEX in 2008 to develop a gravity-based separation method for processing tungsten-molybdenum and tin-indium mineralization from the  Fire  Tower  and  North  Zones,  respectively.    This  work  was  conducted  under  the supervision  of  Thibault  &amp;  Associates  Inc.    ADEX  sent  separate  250 kg  samples  of  fine

crushed ore (tungsten-molybdenum) and bulk sample material (tin-indium), which had been stored under cover on the mine site, to the SGS laboratory in England in March of 2008, to get gravity test work done.  The results from the North Zone sample were provided in three reports (MacDonald and Hallewell, 2008c, 2008d, 2008e).

The  mineralogy  and  gravity  test  programs  in  2008  showed  that  the  North  Zone  tin mineralization was very fine and not readily amenable to a gravity-based recovery process. Subsequent testing focussed on a flotation-based tin recovery process.

## 13.2 INDIUM-ZINC HYDROMET BENCH SCALE TEST PROGRAM (THIBAULT &amp; ASSOCIATES INC)

Reference: Thibault  &amp;  Associates  Inc.,  Indium-Zinc  Hydromet  Flowsheet  Development Bench  Scale  Unit  Operations  Characterization,  Project  6526-04,  March  24,  2010  Rev.  01, Final Report for Adex Mining Inc.

Thibault &amp; Associates Inc. identified a conceptual process to produce zinc metal and indium sponge from North Zone zinc concentrate.  A bench scale test program was then initiated to confirm the technical viability of the flowsheet and to define operating conditions for each unit  operation.    The  feed  material  was  a  sample  of  bulk  sulphide  concentrate  generated  in 1995 from the North Zone (600 Adit) with head grades as shown in Table 21.

TABLE 21. BULK SULPHIDE CONCENTRATE HEAD GRADES FROM North Zone 2011 HYDROMET PILOT TEST PROGRAM

| Element     |   Zinc  (wt%) |   Tin  (wt%) |   Arsenic  (wt%) |   Iron  (wt%) |   Lead  (wt%) |   Copper  (wt%) |   Indium  (g/tonne) |
|-------------|---------------|--------------|------------------|---------------|---------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Assay Value |          24.8 |         0.34 |              5.3 |          12.7 |          0.98 |             3.2 |                1995 |

The preliminary bench scale test program i) demonstrated the technical viability of the ferric chloride  leach  process  for  extraction  of  indium  and  zinc  from  a  bulk  sulfide  concentrate, ii) defined  effective  methods  for  removal  of  impurities  from  the  circuit,  and  iii)  defined  a conceptual solvent extraction flowsheet capable of producing separate indium chloride, zinc chloride and ferrous chloride streams as required for production of indium sponge, zinc metal and for regeneration of the ferric chloride leach solution.  The preliminary bench scale test program  culminated  in  production  of  a  small  amount  of  indium  sponge  product  assaying 87.5% indium, 11.6% zinc and containing only trace amounts of impurity metals.

## 13.3 FLOTATION TEST PROGRAM (SGS CANADA INC., 2010)

Reference: SGS Canada Inc., An Investigation into a Metallurgical Testwork Program on Ore Samples from the North Zone of the Mount Pleasant Deposit, Project 12347-001, December, 2010 Final Report for Adex Mining Inc.

The  purpose  of  this  test  program  was  to  develop  a  process  flowsheet  to  recover  tin concentrate, zinc/indium concentrate and bulk sulphide concentrate from the North Zone at Mount Pleasant.  Two metallurgical samples were provided for testing.  Sample A was fresh drill core from the 2008 North Zone drill program while Sample B was collected from surface stockpiles of material mined from the North Zone 600 Adit in the 1960s.  Head grades for the two samples are shown in Table 22.

| Sample B (Surface Stockpile) |          1.46 |         0.65 |              1.2 |          5.04 |             1.82 |            0.55 |                 260 |

Testing occurred from January to May 2010.  Table 23 summarizes the ore grindability test results.    Batch  open-circuit  flotation  tests  were  undertaken  to  evaluate  alternative  flotation collectors,  test  conditions  and  flowsheet  configurations.    After  the  initial  screening  tests,  a sequential flowsheet consisting of grinding, zinc flotation, bulk sulphide flotation, desliming, and tin flotation was tested in open circuit for both samples and in locked cycle configuration for Sample B.  The metallurgical balance results for open circuit and locked cycle testing are shown in Table 24.

| Element                      |   Bond Rod Mill Work   Index - RWI (kWh/tonne) |   Bond Ball Mill Work   Index - BWI (kWh/tonne) |
|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Sample A (Drill Core)        |                                           15.6 |                                            13.5 |
| Sample B (Surface Stockpile) |                                           16.2 |                                            14.4 |

The metallurgical response of Sample B was not as good as Sample A and it was suspected this could be due to weathering/oxidation in the surface stockpile.  Tin grades achieved using Samples A and B were low, and zinc grades were limited by the significant amount of copper reporting to the zinc concentrate.  Further testing was recommended to improve the flowsheet performance.

## 13.4 LOCKED CYCLE FLOTATION TEST PROGRAM

## (HUNAN NONFERROUS METALS RESEARCH INSTITUTE, 2010)

Reference: Hunan  Nonferrous Metals Research Institute, Study on the Beneficiation Technology  Development  of  Indium-Tin  Polymetallic  ore  in  Canada,  December  30,  2010 Final Report for Rongfeng Canada Investment Co. Ltd.

The intent of this program was to define a process flowsheet for zinc, indium and tin recovery as concentrates from the North Zone.  The test program included the following:

- · Investigation of North Zone mineralogy;
- · Preliminary batch flotation, centrifugal separation and conventional gravity separation to assess flowsheet alternatives;
- · Definition of optimum flotation conditions based on open circuit batch flotation tests;
- · Propose a process flowsheet based on batch tests;
- · Conduct locked cycle test for the recommended flowsheet and operating conditions; and
- · Product settling tests.

The  test  work  was  conducted  between  April  and  December,  2010  on  a  North  Zone metallurgical sample with head grades is shown in Table 25.

TABLE 25. HEAD GRADES FROM HUNAN 2010 North Zone FLOTATION TEST PROGRAM

| Element     |   Zinc  (wt%) |   Tin  (wt%) |   Arsenic  (wt%) |   Iron  (wt%) |   Sulphur  (wt%) |   Copper  (wt%) |   Indium  (g/tonne) |
|-------------|---------------|--------------|------------------|---------------|------------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Assay Value |          1.55 |         0.86 |             1.08 |          4.99 |             2.44 |            0.56 |                 270 |

The mineralogical investigation found that tin deported as follows:

- · 73% as cassiterite;
- · 14% as hydrocassiterite; and
- · 14% as stannite.

It  was noted that tin as stannite would normally report to a sulphide concentrate rather than the tin concentrate.  Hydrocassiterite was observed to be very fine.

Indium deportment was reported as follows:

- · 40% in stannite;
- · 25% in sphalerite;
- · 20% in mixed copper-indium-sulphide minerals; and
- · 15% as indium hydroxide.

Zinc mineralogy in the sample was found to be:

- · 86.8% as sphalerite and other sulphides;
- · 9.4% as calamine and other oxides; and
- · 3.8% as franklinite.

Flotation test work  initially considered  a  sequential flotation for recovery  of copper concentrate, zinc concentrate and bulk sulphide concentrate, but it was found that selectivity for copper, zinc, and indium to the appropriate products was difficult to achieve.  Based on open circuit  flotation  tests  and  gravity  separation  tests,  a  process  flowsheet  was  defined  as follows: Grinding, bulk sulphide flotation, zinc/copper/indium flotation from bulk sulphide, centrifugal pre-concentration and desliming of bulk sulphide flotation tailings, and finally tin flotation from the centrifugal concentrate.  As an option to the final tin flotation step, the test program also considered a combination of gravity separation and flotation to recover the final tin concentrate.

The process flowsheet for tin recovery, which relied solely on flotation, was tested in locked cycle resulting in the following overall metallurgical balance (Tables 26 and 27).

Both flowsheet options produced similar results.  The zinc and tin concentrate grades were relatively low, and similar to that achieved in the 2010 pilot test program at SGS Canada Inc., but  recoveries  were  higher  compared  to  the  2010  SGS  Canada  Inc. pilot  test  program. Reportedly,  the  zinc  concentrate  grade  was  limited  by  the  amount  of  stannite  (containing copper and tin) in the sample which reports to the zinc concentrate.  The major limitation to tin recovery was reported to be a consequence of the stannite content in the sample.  The tin as  stannite  reports  to  the  sulphide  concentrates  and  cannot  be  recovered  into  the  tin concentrate.  Indium losses were observed to be associated with the indium hydroxide content which is not recovered in the sulphide flotation process.

The flowsheet for this test program was based on the 2010 bench scale test program by SGS Canada  Inc.,  consisting  of  grinding,  desliming,  zinc  flotation,  bulk  sulphide  flotation, desliming,  and  finally  tin  flotation.    The  purpose  of  the  test  program  was  to  assess  the performance of the flowsheet at a pilot plant scale and optimize the metallurgical response. The  100  tonne  sample  delivered  to  SGS  Canada  Inc. for  the  test  program  was  taken  from material originally extracted from underground development in the North Zone 600 adit in the 1960s that was stockpiled outside on the surface since that time.  The sample can be expected to be more weathered/oxidized than freshly mined material.

In the pilot test, a total of 60 tonnes was processed at a feed rate of about 500 kg/hr.  Head grades for the test program were similar to the sample used in the 2010 Hunan test program with assays as shown in Table 30.

The  pilot test included several different runs with varying operating conditions and configurations.  The average metallurgical balance results of the best conditions are shown in Tables 31 and 32.

The  tin  losses  under  this  test  program  were  considered  excessive  with  an  average  of 20.3% lost  in  desliming,  11.9% lost  in  the  zinc  and  bulk  sulphide  flotation  circuits,  and 23.5% lost in the tin flotation circuit, resulting in only 44.1% tin recovery to final concentrate. Zinc recoveries were also low and further testing was recommended to improve the zinc and tin recoveries and grades.

<!-- image -->

A test  program was undertaken between May 2010 and June 2011 to develop a process to produce  added  value  zinc  metal  and  indium  sponge  from  Mount  Pleasant  North  Zone zinc/indium flotation concentrate.  Since Mount Pleasant would be a low tonnage operation (relative  to  large  zinc  smelters),  the  process  was  based  on  chloride  hydrometallurgy  as  an alternative to the conventional large scale smelter plant with roasting and sulphuric acid coproduction for electrolytic zinc production.

The hydrometallurgical process included the following unit operations:

- · Ferric Chloride Leach: leaching of metal sulphides to produce metal chlorides in solution;
- · Copper and Arsenic Cementation: removal of copper and arsenic from solution;
- · Primary Solvent Extraction: separation of iron (for recycle) from indium and zinc;
- · Chlorination: conversion of recycled iron(II) to iron(III) for leaching;
- · Sulphide Precipitation: precipitation of tin and other trace impurity metals as sulphides;
- · Secondary Solvent Extraction: separation of indium and zinc;
- · Tertiary Solvent Extraction: purification / concentration of indium and recycle of acid;
- · Indium Cementation: production of indium sponge; and
- · Zinc Electrowinning: production of zinc metal and recovery of chlorine for recycle.

The  test  program  consisted  of  initial  bench  scale  testing  to  refine  pilot  plant  operating parameters followed by semi-continuous operation of the pilot plant.  The concentrate feed for the  test  program  was  a  bulk  sulphide  concentrate  produced  in  1995  at  the  Technical University of Nova Scotia by ADEX and Research and Productivity Council personnel using a  feed  sample  from  the  North  Zone  600  adit  surface  stockpile.    As  a  bulk  sulphide concentrate,  it  was  lower  grade  with  higher  impurity  content  than  the  more  selective  zinc concentrates produced in the 2010-2011 test programs by SGS Canada Inc.  Therefore, the concentrate feed represents a worst-case scenario with head grades as shown in Table 33.

TABLE 33. BULK SULPHIDE CONCENTRATE HEAD GRADES FROM North Zone 2011 HYDROMET PILOT TEST PROGRAM

| Element     |   Zinc  (wt%) |   Tin  (wt%) |   Arsenic  (wt%) |   Iron  (wt%) |   Lead  (wt%) |   Copper  (wt%) |   Indium  (g/tonne) |
|-------------|---------------|--------------|------------------|---------------|---------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Assay Value |          23.9 |         0.36 |              4.5 |          12.7 |          1.51 |             3.2 |                1926 |

The pilot test program produced indium sponge with grades from 90.2% to 96.9% In, and zinc metal  grading  99.8% to  99.9% Zn  was  produced.    A  metallurgical  balance  simulation  was used to assess the overall mass balance and recoveries from the pilot plant test program.  The overall recoveries were calculated to be 87.2% (79.4% to 95.0%) for indium and 89.1% (81.8% to 96.4%) for zinc.

## 13.7 LOCKED CYCLE FLOTATION TEST PROGRAM

## (SGS CANADA INC., 2011)

Reference: SGS Canada Inc., An Investigation into Optimisation and Locked Cycle Testing on Samples from the Mount Pleasant -North Zone Deposit, Project 12347-003, October 20, 2011 Final Report for Adex Mining Inc.

This test program was a follow-up from the 2010 North Zone flotation test program at SGS Canada Inc. in order to further optimize the flowsheet, reagent dosages, and recoveries.  The process  flowsheet  tested  was  based  on  grinding,  flotation  to  recover  zinc  and  copper sulphides,  bulk  sulphide  flotation,  conventional  desliming  with  cyclones,  and  finally  tin flotation  to  recover  a  tin  concentrate.    The  process  did  not  involve  any  gravity  separation. The testing used a single sample weighing 215 kg consisting of core samples of a number of different North Zone drillholes from the 2008 drill program with the following head grades (Table 34).

TABLE 34. HEAD GRADES FROM SGS 2011 North Zone FLOTATION TEST PROGRAM

| Element     |   Zinc  (wt%) |   Tin  (wt%) |   Arsenic  (wt%) |   Iron  (wt%) |   Sulphur  (wt%) |   Copper  (wt%) |   Indium  (g/tonne) |

| Assay Value |           3.3 |         1.14 |             2.37 |          5.24 |             3.27 |            0.21 |                 410 |

Testing occurred from January to May 2011.  Initial testing was based on batch flotation tests to  define  operating conditions for the locked  cycle test.  The initial testing was not able to produce  acceptable  copper  and  zinc  concentrates  by  sequential  flotation  and  therefore  a combined  copper/zinc  concentrate  was  produced.    High  intensity  conditioning  prior  to  tin flotation  at  longer  residence  times  improved  tin  rougher  flotation  selectivity.    A  synthetic depressant was defined to help reject arsenic in the tin flotation circuit.  Locked cycle testing of the flowsheet resulted in the following overall metallurgical balance (Tables 35 and 36).

## 13.8 TIN PYROMETALLURGICAL TEST PROGRAM

## (XSTRATA PROCESS SUPPORT, 2011)

Reference: Xstrata  Process  Support,  Testing  of  Pyrometallurgical  Options  for  Extraction  of Tin from Tin Concentrate, October 20, 2011 Final Report for Adex Mining Inc.

The purpose of this test program was to conduct an initial assessment of options to extract tin from a low-grade tin concentrate with elevated arsenic content from the North Zone.  ADEX sent two samples of concentrate to Xstrata as shown in Table 37.

TABLE 37. LOW GRADE TIN CONCENTRATE GRADES FOR XSTRATA 2011 PYROMETALLURGICAL TEST PROGRAM

| Sample       | Tin  (wt%)   | Arsenic  (wt%)   |   Iron  (wt%) |
|--------------|--------------|------------------|---------------|
| Low Grade    | 13.9%        | 1.7%             |          9.44 |
| Higher Grade | 35.6%        | 4.1%             |          9.34 |

The  program  included  thermo-chemical  modelling  to  theoretically  define  pyrometallurgical conditions that could be used in subsequent volatization, roasting and smelting testwork.  The low grade sample would require upgrading to separate most of the iron from the tin prior to smelting,  while  the  higher  grade  sample  (still  considered  low  grade)  would  require  arsenic removal as well as tin-iron separation prior to smelting.  It was theoretically determined that the  concentrate  could  be  enriched  to  reduce  iron  content  by  volatizing  with  pyrite  under reducing conditions at 850ºC to 900°C.

A series of batch roasts were completed on the higher grade sample and arsenic removal of 80 to 85% was achieved, producing an upgraded concentrate assaying 34.0% tin, 0.31% arsenic and  10.0% iron.    Further  testing  would  be  required  to  assess  smelting  the  upgraded concentrate to produce tin metal.

## SUMMARY OF FIRE TOWER ZONE METALLURGICAL TESTING 2010 TO PRESENT

Metallurgical testing was also completed for the Fire Tower Zone at Mount Pleasant which does not apply to the North Zone and was not reviewed for this report.  Testing for the Fire Tower Zone is presented in the following reports:

- 1) Hunan Research  Institute  of  Non-ferrous  Metals,  Research  Report  on  Laboratory  Flow Test  for  Development  of  Comprehensive  Recovery  Dressing  Technology  of  Tungsten Molybdenum Zinc Bismuth Polymetallic Ore, July 24, 2010 Final Report for Rongfeng Canada Investment Co.
- 2) SGS Minerals Services, An Investigation into Hydrometallurgical Treatment of Molybdenum Concentrates from Mount Pleasant, Project 12432-001, September 3,  2010 Final Report for Adex Mining Inc.

## 13.10 SUMMARY OF NORTH ZONE METALLURGICAL TESTING, 2010 TO PRESENT

The testing by SGS Canada Inc. and Hunan Nonferrous Metals Research Institute has defined preliminary  flowsheet  options  for  the  recovery  of  tin  concentrate  and  zinc/copper/indium concentrate from the North Zone.  The recovery of tin was highest with the Hunan approach, but the tin concentrate grade was low as a result of the testing of both Hunan and SGS Canada Inc.  An initial study was undertaken to assess upgrading of the tin concentrate.  Further test work  is  required  to  ensure  tin  concentrate  can  be  produced  in  compliance  with  smelter schedules.

The recovery of sulphide concentrate (zinc, copper, and indium) was challenging in the test programs  that  used  the  metallurgical  sample  from  an  existing  surface  stockpile  stored outdoors since the 1960s.  This difficulty was observed with the 2010 SGS Locked Cycle test (Sample  B),  2010  Hunan  Locked  Cycle  test,  and  2010  SGS  Pilot  test.    The  metallurgical response for sulphide concentrate recovery was much improved when testing samples from fresh drill core in the 2010 SGS Locked Cycle test (Sample A) and 2011 SGS Locked Cycle test.

It  is  recommended that  additional metallurgical  testing be  conducted on  fresh metallurgical samples  obtained  from  the  North  Zone  to  confirm  the  process  flowsheet,  improve  tin concentrate  grades,  and  define  final  recoveries  to  tin  and  zinc/copper/indium  concentrates. Continuous  testing  at  the  pilot  scale  should  be  conducted  to  identify  a  definitive  process flowsheet.

<!-- image -->

Based on bench scale and mini-pilot testing, a preliminary process flowsheet has been defined to  produce  the  finished  products  of  zinc  metal  and  indium  sponge  from  the  North  Zone low-grade  zinc/copper/indium  concentrate.    It  is  recommended  that  further  testing  be conducted  at  a  larger  pilot  scale  to  advance  this  unique  hydrometallurgical  process  to  a definitive process flowsheet.

## 14.  MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATES

## 14.1 MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATE OF THE FIRE TOWER ZONE BY SRK

In  September 2008, ADEX engaged WGM to prepare an updated resource estimate for the FTZ in the Mt. Pleasant Project, New Brunswick.  This work was, in turn, sub-contracted to SRK  by  WGM  to  be  included  in  this  report.    The  data  and  parameters  used  by  SRK  to estimate the Mineral Resource are summarized below.

SRK has prepared Mineral Resource estimates for the Mt Pleasant Fire Tower West Zone and Fire Tower North Zone, collectively known as the FTZ.  A summary of the Mineral Resource estimates is tabulated in Table 38.

TABLE 38. MOUNT PLEASANT MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATE, FIRE TOWER ZONE (SRK, October 11, 2008)

| Area             | Tonnes     | %WO3   | %MoS2   | %As   | %Bi   |
|------------------|------------|--------|---------|-------|-------|
| Indicated        |            |        |         |       |       |
| Fire Tower West  | 9,148,900  | 0.32   | 0.21    | 0.29  | 0.04  |
| Fire Tower North | 4,340,100  | 0.35   | 0.20    | 1.15  | 0.09  |
| Total Indicated  | 13,489,000 | 0.33   | 0.21    | 0.57  | 0.06  |
| Inferred         |            |        |         |       |       |
| Fire Tower West  | 831,000    | 0.26   | 0.20    | 0.21  | 0.04  |
| Fire Tower North | 10,700     | 0.26   | 0.17    | 0.26  | 0.05  |
| Total Inferred   | 841,700    | 0.26   | 0.20    | 0.21  | 0.04  |

The Mineral Resources are reported in accordance with Canadian Securities Administrators' National Instrument 43-101 and have been estimated in conformity with generally accepted CIM "Estimation of Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserves Best Practices" guidelines.  For the purposes of this report, the relevant definitions of the CIM guidelines are as follows:

- A Mineral  Resource is  a  concentration  or  occurrence  of  diamonds,  natural  solid inorganic  material,  or  natural  solid  fossilized  organic  material  including  base  and precious metals, coal, and industrial minerals in or on the Earth's crust in such form and  quantity  and  of  such  a  grade  or  quality  that  it  has  reasonable  prospects  for economic  extraction.    The  location,  quantity,  grade,  geological  characteristics  and continuity of a Mineral Resource are known, estimated or interpreted from specific geological evidence and knowledge.

<!-- image -->

An 'Inferred  Mineral  Resource' is  that  part  of  a  Mineral  Resource  for  which quantity and grade or quality can be estimated on the basis of geological evidence and limited  sampling  and  reasonably  assumed,  but  not  verified,  geological  and  grade continuity.    The  estimate  is  based  on  limited  information  and  sampling  gathered through  appropriate  techniques  from  locations  such  as  outcrops,  trenches,  pits, workings and drillholes.

An 'Indicated  Mineral  Resource' is  that  part  of  a  Mineral  Resource  for  which quantity,  grade  or  quality,  densities,  shape  and  physical  characteristics,  can  be estimated with a level of confidence sufficient to allow the appropriate application of technical and economic parameters, to support mine planning and evaluation of the economic  viability  of  the  deposit.    The  estimate  is  based  on  detailed  and  reliable exploration  and  testing  information  gathered  through  appropriate  techniques  from locations  such  as  outcrops,  trenches,  pits,  workings  and  drillholes  that  are  spaced closely enough for geological and grade continuity to be reasonably assumed.

A 'Measured  Mineral  Resource' is  that  part  of  a  Mineral  Resource  for  which quantity,  grade  or  quality,  densities,  shape,  and  physical  characteristics  are  so  well established  that  they  can  be  estimated  with  confidence  sufficient  to  allow  the appropriate application of technical and economic parameters, to support production planning  and  evaluation  of  the  economic  viability  of  the  deposit.    The  estimate  is based on detailed and reliable exploration, sampling and testing information gathered through  appropriate  techniques  from  locations  such  as  outcrops,  trenches,  pits, workings and drillholes that are spaced closely enough to confirm both geological and grade continuity.

## 14.2 GENERAL MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATION METHODOLOGY

SRK applied the following methodology for the Mineral Resource estimate of the FTZ:

- · Database compilation and verification;
- · Resource Modelling:
- o Updating of 3-D wireframe models within major lithological units, using the suite of geochemical assays available for each drillhole sample interval;
- o Data processing (compositing and capping) and statistical analyses;
- o Variography;
- o Grade  interpolation  and  block  modelling  applying  Ordinary  Kriging  ("OK")  grade estimation techniques and carrying out comparative estimations using Inverse Distance Squared ("ID "); 2
- o Resource classification, tabulation and reporting; and
- o Resource validation applying ID  methodology. 2

## 14.3

## 14.3.1 GENERAL

Data  used  to  generate  the  Mineral  Resource  estimates  originated  from  Gemcom  Software International  Inc. (" GEMCOM or GEMS ")  project  files.    The  original  GEMCOM  project was  created  by  ADEX  in  1997  and  later  updated  by  WGM  in  2006.    The  ADEX  GEMS Project  contained  three  separate  drillhole  databases  pertaining  to  three  Mt  Pleasant  zones, namely the FTZ, the Saddle Zone and the North Zone (not to be confused with the Fire Tower North portion of the FTZ).  SRK has not validated the data for the North Zone and Saddle Zone workspaces as they were not part of this study.

The pre-2008 FTZ drillhole database consisted of 676 collar locations (in mine coordinates), downhole survey data, geological codes, and 24,544 assay intervals with multi-element values (percent of  MoS2,  WO3,  Sn,  Cu,  Zn,  Pb,  Bi,  As,  Ca,  Fe  and  In  (ppm)).    The  data  were provided to SRK in digital form on a CD.   The 2008 data, which contained additional data for twenty-three diamond drillholes, were supplied to SRK as Microsoft Excel spreadsheets via e-mail.  In total, the database comprises 699 collar locations and 26,355 assay intervals.

The GEMCOM project received by SRK also contained a set of geological wireframes and 3-D solids representing underground development and mined-out stopes.

## 14.3.2 DATA VALIDATION

Upon receipt of the data, SRK performed the following validation steps:

- · Checking for location and elevation discrepancies  by comparing collar coordinates with the drillholes collars already in the GEMCOM project;
- · Checking  the  assay  values  provided  in  the  excel  files against the original assay certificates;
- · Checking minimum and maximum values for each quality value field and confirming/modifying those outside of expected ranges;
- · Checking for inconsistency in lithological unit terminology and/or gaps in the lithological code; and,
- · Checking for gaps, overlaps and out of sequence intervals for both assays and lithology tables.

The GEMCOM assay table contained a few errors, i.e., "composite length greater than hole length", "out of sequence interval" or "negative value interval", which were corrected by SRK using  drill  logs  provided  by  ADEX.    On  completion  of  the  validation  procedure,  SRK

<!-- image -->

considered the database suitable for resource estimation with no further obvious errors that could affect the Mineral Resource estimate.

## 14.3.3 DATABASE MANAGEMENT

The drillhole data were stored in a GEMCOM multi-tabled workspace specifically designed to  manage  collar  and  interval  data.    Other  data,  like  surface  contours  or  cross  sectional geological  interpretations  were  stored  in  multi-tabled  polyline  workspaces.    The  project database also stored section and level plan definitions, 3-D surfaces and solids, and the block models, such that all data pertaining to the project are stored within the same project database.

## 14.4 RESOURCE MODELLING PROCEDURES

## 14.4.1 GENERAL

SRK applied the following procedures for resource modelling:

- · Geological interpretation and digitizing of updated lithological outlines;
- · 3-D surface (TIN) and solid/wireframe creation;
- · Database manipulation and compositing;
- · Statistical analysis and variography;
- · Block grade estimation; and
- · Classification and reporting of Mineral Resources.

## 14.4.2 GEOLOGICAL INTERPRETATION AND DIGITIZING

## Vertical Sections

Vertical  sections  for  the  Fire  Tower  West  and  North  Zones  were  generated  by  ADEX  to coincide  with  the  historical  sections.    They  were  oriented  east-west  ("E-W"),  and  had  a spacing that varied from ten metres to thirty-one metres.  The north-south (long) sections had a standard twenty-five metre separation.  In the Fire Tower North Zone ADEX also created radial sections to best fit the orientation of underground holes.

In  total,  twenty-five  north-looking  vertical  (cross)  sections,  eighteen  west-looking  vertical (long) sections and fifteen radial sections were supplied to SRK in the Fire Tower West and Fire  Tower North Zones.  Figure 34 shows the drillhole plan (collars only) and the section locations used for subsequent geological modelling.

## Geological Interpretation of the FTZ

The  boundaries  of  the  mineralized  body  were  re-interpreted  manually  by  Mr. Trevor  Boyd from ADEX (Boyd, 2008) on twelve drill sections orientated E-W defined solely on %WO3 and  %MoS2  values.  Three  main  W-Mo  mineralized  units  are  recognized  by  ADEX  in  the project  area:  viz.    Fire  Tower  Breccia  ("FT-BX"),  Granite  I  ("GR1")  and  Quartz  Feldspar Porphyry ("QFP").  SRK found that mineralization commonly cross-cuts geological units and structural boundaries.  SRK also defined mineralization based solely on %WO3 and %MoS2 values.  These were plotted on cross sections.  Mineralization boundaries were drawn halfway between drillholes, and if no holes existed, the boundaries were extended to a maximum of twenty  metres  away  from  the  nearest  hole.    In  general,  extensions  of  the  boundaries  were made consistent with the trends defined by joining known cutoff boundaries.  A minimum width of three metres was used for defining the zones.

## Cutoff Grade

Mineralized zones were defined based on a cutoff grade of 0.3% WO3 equivalent ("Eq"), with WO3 Eq = %WO3 + 1.5 x %MoS2.  The WO3 Eq cutoff was chosen as a result of the close geological  and  spatial  relationship  between  the  two  elements.    The  equivalency  formula  is based on a US$30/tonne tungsten price or US$100/MTU (US$10.0/kg WO3), upon a mine life of  ten  plus  years  and  on  the  previous  ten  year  price  relationship  between  W  and  Mo.    The assumed metal price/Eq grade cutoff is slightly conservative considering that the early 2008 prices were approximately US$20/kg WO3 and US$30/lb for MoO3.

## Digitizing Geological Interpretations and Solid 3-D Wireframe Creation

The new manually drawn cross sectional interpretations of the mineralization were digitized into a GEMCOM polyline workspace.  SRK has used previously defined rock types assigned to the polylines (based on 0.3 % WO3 Eq) each representing separate zones (Figure 35):

- 1. WO3 Eq in the FT West Area (Block Model Code - 104).
- 2. WO3 Eq in the FT North Area (Block Model Code - 105).

In total, five sections in the Fire Tower West Zone and seven sections in the Fire Tower North Zone have digitized  sectional  polylines.    The  geological  polylines  digitized  on  the  vertical sections  were  joined  using  special  polylines  (tie  lines)  in  order  to  produce  separate  3-D solids/wireframes for each zone, so individual volumes and tonnages could be reported.  In total,  two  geological  wireframes  were  created;  WO3  Eq  in  the  Fire  Tower  West  and  North areas.

## DATABASE PREPARATION, STATISTICAL ANALYSIS AND

## 14.5 COMPOSITING

## 14.5.1 BACK-CODING OF ROCK CODE FIELD

The 3-D solids that represented the interpreted mineralized zones were used to back-code a rock code field into the drillhole workspace.  Each interval in the assay table was assigned (back-coded) a new rock code value based on the rock type solid that the interval midpoint fell  within.    The  two  geological  WO3 Eq  geological  solids,  for  Fire  Tower  West  and  Fire Tower North, were back-coded and considered for the Mineral Resource estimate.

Although the database contains assays for multiple elements (MoS2, WO3, Sn, Cu, Zn, Pb, Bi, As, Ca, Fe and In), only MoS2, WO3, Bi and As have been investigated.

Table 39 presents basic statistics of the original  drillhole data, regardless of position in the mineralized envelope.  Figure 36 shows the 3-D drillhole distribution in the FTZ.

TABLE 39. BASIC STATISTICS OF DRILLHOLE SAMPLES IN FTZ

## 14.5.2 PREPARATION OF ASSAY COMPOSITES

In order to carry out the variography and Mineral Resource block modelling, a set of equal length composites was generated from the raw drillhole intervals.  Since the majority of the samples were taken at three metre intervals as indicated in Figure 37, SRK chose to composite the data at 3.0 m as well.  Table 40 summarizes the statistics of the composited data inside the mineralized envelope for the West and North Zones.

## 14.5.3 OUTLIER TREATMENT

The  statistical distributions of MoS2,  WO3,  Bi  and  As  show  lognormal  distributions (Figures 38 to 47) and both zones also exhibit similar behaviour.  Considering the nature of the elements and their statistical distributions, SRK is of the opinion that it is not necessary to cap high-grade values for MoS2 or WO3.

## 14.5.4 STATISTICAL ANALYSES

SRK  considered  the  relation  between  the  various  elements  that  could  further  facilitate geostatistical  study  of  the  FTZ  mineralization  style.    Table  41  summarizes  correlation coefficients for the 3.0 m composites of various elements.  The best correlation exists between Zn and Sn, Pb and In.  Most of the elements, however, show very low relation to each other; therefore, SRK could not calculate covariance.

TABLE 41. CORRELATION MATRIX OF 3.0 m COMPOSITES IN THE MINERALIZED ENVELOPE OF THE FTZ

| Element   |   MoS2 |   Bi |    As |   Zn |   WO3 |    Sn |    Pb |    In |

Probability plots in the Figures 48 and 51 show that As have a bimodal distribution in both zones.    In  order  to  properly  calculate  arsenic  variograms  the  3.0 m  As  composites  were divided into the As rich and low As zones in FT West and North using previously defined As zones  (ADEX  generated  3-D  wireframes).    Figures  52  to  55  show  histograms  of  As composites  in  the  four  zones.    The  basic  statistics  of  the  As  composites  are  presented  in Table 42.

Note : All the variograms above are modelled with the Spherical equation.

- * Range numbers refer to influence of anisotropy X,Y and Z.

It was noted that the MoS2 is more continuous than the WO3 in the West Zone.  The WO3 and Bi show isotropic distribution hence only omnidirectional variograms was calculated for these elements.    This  could  be  due  to  the  shape  of  the  ore  bodies  in  the  Fire  Tower  Project. Figures 52 to 55 present the variogram graphs for WO3 and MoS2 in each zone.  Please refer to Appendix 2 for the full list of variogram graphs.

## 14.7 RESOURCE ESTIMATION

The Mineral Resource block grades have been estimated with the Ordinary Kriging ("OK") geostatistical  estimation  technique.    For  comparison  and  cross  checking  purposes,  Inverse Distance Squared ("ID ") estimation was applied. 2

## 14.7.1 BLOCK MODEL

The Mineral Resources have been estimated within a grid of regular five meter by five metre by five metre blocks.  The block model grid covers both the West Zone and North Zone and is defined in Table 44.

TABLE 44. BLOCK MODEL GRID PARAMETERS FOR FTZ

| Direction   | Origin   | Size   | Minimum (index)   | Maximum (index)   |
|-------------|----------|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| East-West   | 15,400E  | 5 m    | 15,400E (1)       | 15,875E (96)      |
| North-South | 12,200N  | 5 m    | 12,200N (1)       | 12,700N (101)     |
| Vertical    | 900Z     | 5 m    | 900Z (1)          | 1,250Z (71)       |

## 14.7.2 GRADE INTERPOLATION

## Kriging

The  principal  Mineral  Resource  estimate  model  is  derived  from  OK.    The  variograms modelled and summarized in the previous section of this report were used to estimate each zone separately.

## Fire Tower West

- 1. Indicated Search:
- -Spherical Search Ellipsoid - 35 m range
- o Maximum number of composites used to estimate a block: 10
- o Minimum number of composites used to estimate a block: 3
- o Octant  search  strategy  was  used  with  minimum  octants  of  2  and  maximum  of 8 composites per octant.
- 2. Inferred Search:
- -Spherical Search Ellipsoid - 70 m range
- o Maximum number of composites used to estimate a block: 15
- o Minimum number of composites used to estimate a block: 2
- o Octant  search  strategy  was  used  with  minimum  octants  of  2  and  maximum  of 8 composites per octant.

## Fire Tower North

- 1. Indicated Search:
- -Spherical Search Ellipsoid - 30 m range
- o Maximum number of composites used to estimate a block: 10
- o Minimum number of composites used to estimate a block: 3
- o Octant  search  strategy  was  used  with  minimum  octants  of  2  and  maximum  of 8 composites per octant.
- 2. Inferred Search:
- -Spherical Search Ellipsoid - 70 m range
- o Maximum number of composites used to estimate a block: 15
- o Minimum number of composites used to estimate a block: 2
- o Octant  search  strategy  was  used  with  minimum  octants  of  2  and  maximum  of 8 composites per octant.

## Inverse Distance Squared ("ID ") 2

This estimation technique was used to provide ADEX with a comparison to OK.  In this case, both  the  West  and  North  Zones  were  interpolated  the  same  search  parameters  as  in  the Ordinary Kriging method.

## 14.8 MINERAL RESOURCE CLASSIFICATION AND TABULATION

## 14.8.1 MINERAL RESOURCE STATEMENT

The  Mineral  Resources  are  compiled  by  simple  addition  of  the  OK  model  blocks  and  by averaging  the  corresponding  grade  values.    SRK  has  classified  the  Fire  Tower  Mineral Resource estimate as Indicated and Inferred.  Summary of the Mineral Resource estimate is presented  in  Table  45.    The  mined  out  stope  areas  have  been  excluded  from  the  resources calculations.

TABLE 45. MOUNT PLEASANT MINERAL RESOURCE STATEMENT*, FIRE TOWER ZONE (SRK, OCTOBER 11, 2008)

| Fire Tower North | 4,340,100  | 0.35   | 0.20    | 1.15  | 0.09  |
| Total Indicated  | 13,489,000 | 0.33   | 0.21    | 0.57  | 0.06  |

| Fire Tower West  | 831,000    | 0.26   | 0.20    | 0.21  | 0.04  |
| Fire Tower North | 10,700     | 0.26   | 0.17    | 0.26  | 0.05  |
| Total Inferred   | 841,700    | 0.26   | 0.20    | 0.21  | 0.04  |

ADEX indicated that the Inferred Mineral Resource reported for the Fire Tower West zone was mostly defined from the 2008 Phase I drilling.  ADEX believes that this is a new easterly extension on the east side of the Fire Tower West zone called the Fire Tower East zone.

Since the As is a known contaminant the Fire Tower West and North Zones were further subdivided into areas of low and high As (Table 46).  The distribution of the As mineralization is useful  in  the  future  planning  of  the  mill  feed  (the  resource  model  is  populated  with  As grades).

The  sensitivity  of  the  Mineral  Resources  to  WO3  Eq  cutoff,  is  tabulated  at  various  cutoff levels for both Indicated and Inferred Resources in Table 47 and 48.  Eleven cutoffs, ranging from  0% to  1.0% WO3  Eq  (in  increments  of  0.1%) were  applied.    A  grade  tonnage  curve representing total Indicated Resources is presented in Figure 56.

FTZ Indicated Resource grade-tonnage curve based on OK model

The specific gravity used to derive tonnes from the block volumes is constant at 2.65.  This value was provided by ADEX and is based on historic measurements.  SRK has applied this specific gravity; however, it is recommended that more density analysis to be carried out in the future to support this number.

## 14.8.2 RESOURCE MODEL VALIDATION

As a validation check of the OK-derived resource model, the ID  grade estimation method 2 was  applied  (Table  49).    The  ID 2 method  is  a  distance-weighted  interpolation  class  of methods, similar to OK, whereby the grade of a block is interpolated from several composites within a defined distance range of that block.  ID  uses the inverse of the distance squared 2 between a composite and the block as the weighting factor.

|------------------|------------|--------|---------|-------|-------|

| Total Inferred   | 823,700    | 0.26   | 0.20    | 0.21  | 0.04  |

(using a 0.3% WO3 Eq* cutoff grade)

Both methods gave very similar results, however SRK has elected to use the OK model since the continuity of the grades can be modelled from the variograms.

## 14.9 PREVIOUS MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATES OF THE NORTH ZONE BY ADEX

In 1996, ADEX contracted Kvaerner Metals Davey Ltd. (" Kvaerner ") to prepare a "mineral resource" estimate, which included an audit and verification of ADEX's previous "reserve" estimates of the North Zone.  Kvaerner (1997) estimated an audited "probable resource" for the  North  Zone  of  3,645,429 tonnes  with  an  average  grade  of  0.801% Sn,  107.15 ppm  In, 0.114% WO3,  0.055% MoS2,  0.187% Cu,  0.063% Pb  and  0.869% Zn  (Table 50).    At  a planned mining rate of 2,500 tonnes/day, the projected mine life would have been four years. Kvaerner (1997) recommended a mixture of SLC and long-hole stoping, with mining of ore from the North Zone and Deep Tin Zone (subzone) at a rate of 2,500 t/d.  SLC would be used for 90% of the deposits and long hole for the remainder.

The study indicated that the North Zone deposits were uneconomic due to declining tin prices and  high  capital  costs. This  historic "resource"  estimate  was  prepared  prior  to  the implementation  of  NI 43-101.    WGM  has  neither  audited  these  estimates  nor  made  any attempt to classify them according to NI 43-101 standards, which are the resource and reserve definitions of the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (CIM 2010).  This estimate should not be relied upon.

In  2008,  WGM contracted SGS-Geostat  Limited to do a Mineral Resource  estimate of the North  Zone  using  ADEX's  2008  diamond  drilling  results.  Indicated  and  Inferred  Mineral Resource estimates are provided in Table 51.  The Technical Report (Dunbar and de L'Etoile, 2009) that describes these estimates can be obtained from SEDAR's website [http://www.sedar.com/homepage\_en.htm],  under  'Company  Profiles',  then  'Adex  Mining Inc.', and 'View this Public Company's Documents'.

## 14.10 MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATE FOR THE NORTH ZONE

The Mineral Resource  estimates for  the  North  Zone  have  been  prepared  by  John  Reddick, M.Sc.,  P.Geo.,  who  is  the  President  of  Reddick  Consulting  Inc. (' RCI '),  and  a  Senior Geological  Associate  of  Watts,  Griffis  and  McOuat  Limited.    Mohan  Srivastava,  M.Sc., P.Geo.,  of  FSS  Canada  Consultants  Inc. provided  assistance  with  some  aspects  of  the  data analysis and establishment of the estimation parameters.  Mr. Srivastava and Mr. Reddick are Consulting Geologists and are independent of ADEX.

The North Zone Mineral Resources occur in a zone of variable mineralisation which has the potential for economic extraction of several elements.  The elements reported for this estimate include Sn, Zn and In.  Values for other  elements are tabulated in this report as they have potential implications for metallurgical purposes but those elements are not considered as part of the current NI 43-101 compliant resource estimate and they do not contribute to any of the economic parameters used for the estimate.  The minimum cutoff grade and block size used for the estimate were applied with the assumption that a resource with potential bulk mineable characteristics  has  been  appropriately  estimated  using  these  parameters.    Mineral  Resource estimates are summarised in Table 52 and contained metal is summarised in Table 53.

## 14.11

## DRILLHOLE DATABASE

The  North  Zone  Mineral  Resource  estimate  is  based  on  surface  and  underground  diamond drilling done from the 1950s to 2011.  The database provided to WGM covers an area larger than that for which resources are estimated and the unfiltered drillhole data provided covers an area of about 2.0 km in an east-west direction by 2.0 km in a north-south direction.  A filter was applied by RCI to define an area that covers a smaller area but still includes the entire North Zone (Mine Grid 15000E to 15800E and Mine Grid 13200N to 14100N).  Within this filtered  area  there  are  a  total  of  640  drillholes  with  an  aggregate  length  of  85,515 m.    The coring has been at diameters ranging from 23 to 27 mm (AQ, AX, E and XRT wireline core) for early drilling, 36.5 mm core (BQ wireline) in the 1970s and 36.5 to 47.5 mm diameter core (BQ to NQ wireline) from the 1980s to present.  There was a check sampling program of historic drill samples done for the May 2009 Technical Report (Dunbar and l'Etoile, WGM, May 2009) and those authors concluded that the historic sampling results were repeatable.

The  drill  pattern  is  irregular;  recent  drilling  has  been  entirely  from  surface  and  is  less clustered  than  older  underground  drilling.    In  addition,  the  suite  of  elements  analysed  has varied  over  time.    Holes  extend  from  surface  to  a  maximum  depth  of  about  580 m  below surface  but  the  majority  test  areas  less  than  450 m  below  surface.    The  area  previously explored  by  means  of  underground  development  and  drilling  focused  on  the  Endogranite Zone, the #1-3 Tin Zone and the #4 Tin Zone at elevations of roughly 250 to 400 m below surface for the Endogranite zone and elevations of roughly 50 to 150 m below surface for the #1-3 Tin Zone and the #4 Tin Zones.  Drilling done by ADEX from 1996 to 2011 accounts for 81 surface holes totalling about 19,027 m.  Almost all of these holes are drilled vertically, and generally directed at defining zones of better grade Sn mineralisation.  Tin remains the metal that  makes  the  greatest  contribution  to  the  Gross  Metal  Value  ('GMV')  in  the  current resource estimate.

RCI has not undertaken any studies to determine the sensitivity of the resource estimates to drilling by date or by core size.  A total of 377 holes totalling ~41,679 m that were used for this  resource  were  drilled  prior  to  1985  and  presumably  these  holes  are  mostly  smaller diameter (&lt;36.5 mm).  This represents a little over one half of the metres of drilling in the database used for this estimate.  Of the older holes about 8,114 m of core is from underground drilling and that core was likely less than 30 mm in diameter.  Of the holes drilled since 1985, 103 holes totalling about 26,075 m were drilled from surface and 160 holes totalling about 14,761 m  were  drilled  from  underground  and  are  reported  to  be  BQ  size  ((Dunbar  and l'Etoile, WGM, May 2009, p. 36).

Collar coordinates are recorded in the mine grid coordinate system.  Vertical and angled holes from  surface,  and  horizontal  and  angled  ones  from  underground,  are  at  highly  variable azimuths.    The  areas  drilled  are  projected  on  vertical  sections  on  25 m  centres  that  are oriented  north-south  and  also  on  another  set  of  sections  on  25 m  centres  that  are  oriented southwest-northeast.

Drillholes are collared at varied or variousspacings.  Underground holes were drilled on 6 to 25 m centres and surface drillholes are generally tens of metres apart.

Surface  drillhole  collars  from  1996  to  2011  were  located  using  differential  GPS  survey instrumentation.    ADEX  reports  that  holes  drilled  prior  to  1996  were  located  by  means  of conventional surveying and many of the collars of surface holes drilled before 1996 have been located by differential GPS.  Figure 57 shows a 3D view of the traces of all the drillholes used for  this  estimate.    RCI  is  of  the  opinion  that  the  drillhole  collar  locations  and  down-hole survey  information  is  reliable  for  the  purposes  of  resource  estimation.    RCI  estimated  the Mineral Resources for the North Zone of the Mount Pleasant Property using block modelling methods in Gemcom software.

## ASSAYS,  GEOLOGICAL  INFORMATION  AND  OTHER  DRILLHOLE

## 14.11.1 DATA

Drillhole assay data were provided to RCI in the form of spreadsheets with drillhole collar locations, borehole deviation survey data and assay data and these data were imported into a Gemcom database.    The  data  from  earlier  drilling  by  other  companies  that  worked  on  the North  Zone  have  been  incorporated  into  the  database  used  by  ADEX.    Lithology,  Rock Quality Determinant ('RQD') and core recovery data for the drillholes are not recorded in the digital  database,  although  lithology  is  recorded  on  archived,  hard  copy  drill  logs.    RCI recommends that pertinent summary lithology data be entered into the digital database.

The  drillhole  database  was  filtered  by  RCI  to  limit  the  holes  being  used  to  those  in  the immediate  vicinity  of  the  North  Zone,  as  there  were  a  number  of  holes  that  were  some distance away from the area being estimated.  The filtered drillhole database used by RCI for resource  estimation  was  produced  using  a  Gemcom  key  index  filter.    Only  data  from drillholes passing this filter were utilised for this resource estimate.

RCI is satisfied that the filtered data used for the estimates are sufficiently free of error to be adequate  for  resource  estimation.    Initial  error  checking  in  2011  found  there  were  some mistakes in the assay database.  ADEX revisited the hard copy records for assay data in late 2011  and  early  2012  and  made  corrections  as  warranted  before  the  estimation  was  done. These corrections largely related to changing entries that were entered as zero values to either not sampled or below detection limit entries.

## 14.11.2 BULK DENSITY

According to the January 2010 Preliminary Economic Assessment done for the North Zone by Thibault and Associates ' the last measurements on a selection of core by the wax immersion method were done in 1985.  Specific gravities ranged from 2.29 to 3.25 with an average of 2.70 ' (Thibault and Associates, 2010).  RCI assigned a bulk density factor of 2.70 t/m  and is 3 of  the  opinion  that  this  bulk  density  factor  forms  a  reliable  basis  for  the  purposes  of calculating tonnages for this resource estimate.  RCI recommends additional bulk density data be collected.

Database records for rock quality designation ('RQD') measurements and core recoveries are not recorded in the drillhole database.  RCI recommends that these data be entered into the digital database for future drillholes.

## 14.11.3 TOPOGRAPHY

A digital topographic surface was generated from surface drillhole data. As all the drillhole data is associated with the areas for which the resources are reported, RCI is of the opinion that  the  data  accurately  reflects  the  topographic  surface.    Insufficient  lithology  data  were available  to  generate  a  viable  bedrock  surface  so  the  topographic  surface  was  copied  5 m below and this copied surface was used to represent the bedrock surface.

## 14.12 DATA ANALYSIS

## 14.12.1 SAMPLE LENGTHS

As a result of different assay protocols over time, not all drillhole intervals have been sampled and  further,  the  sampled  intervals  have  not  all  been  sampled  for  the  complete  suite  of elements  for  which  there  are  data.    There  are  a  total  of  27,527  sample  intervals  that  were assayed for Sn and Zn in the filtered drillhole database used for estimation and 74,684.27 m of the core was sampled for those elements (87.3% of the total drilled length of 85,515.16 m for the holes in the filtered database).  The mean sample length for the Sn and Zn samples is 2.71 m, the median sample length is 3.04 m and the mode for sample lengths is at 3.05 m. There  are  68 samples  analysed  for  Sn  and  Zn  that  are  5.0 m  or  longer  with  three  samples 7.0 m or longer.  There are 229 sample intervals that are shorter than 0.5 m.

There are substantially fewer samples analysed for In than for Sn and Zn (9,435 samples over 27,813m in the filtered data which represents about 33% of the drill core).  For samples with In analyses, the mean sample length is 2.95 m, the median sample length is 3.04 m and the mode is at 3.00 m.  There are 10 samples analysed for In that are 5.0 m or longer with two samples 7.0 m or longer.  There are 13 sample intervals that are shorter than 0.5 m.

Tables  54  and  55  show  the  sample  length  statistics  for  Sn,  Zn  and  In  assays,  including  a breakdown by domains.  A normal histogram of sample lengths for Sn and Zn is shown in Figure 58 and for In by Figure 59.  A description of the domains is given in the following section.

## 14.12.2 LITHOLOGY

There are no lithology records in the digital database.  It is recommended that lithology from the archived hard copy logs be included in the database.

## 14.12.3 GEOLOGICAL DOMAINS

The North Zone was divided into a number of domains when estimated in 2009.  A review of those domains and the underlying data led to a simpler domain model for the current estimate. The Endogranite zone was identified as unique domain on the basis of significantly different metal  values  and  metal  ratios  than  the  rest  of  the  North  Zone  and  is  assigned  as  the 100 Domain.  It is characterised by significantly higher Sn grades and lower Zn and In grades than the rest of the North Zone.  The other domains used in the 2009 estimate are generally characterised  by  lower  Sn  and  higher  Zn  and  In  values  relative  to  the  Endogranite  Zone. However, the ratio of these metals to one another is highly variable.  The manner in which the domains were modelled in  2009  resulted  in  a  large  number  of  isolated  blocks  that  had  no continuity  with  other  blocks  in  the  same  domain  or  with  other  domains.    Further,  the boundaries  of  these  blocks  were  defined  in  such  a  manner  that  there  were  gaps  between domains  where  no  grades  were  estimated,  even  though  elevated  values  for  Sn,  Zn  and  In existed  for  drillhole  intervals  in  these  gaps.    Therefore  for  this  estimate  the  balance  of  the North  Zone  was  grouped  as  one  larger  domain  that  excluded  the  Endogranite  Zone  but included all other data; this was designated as the 200 Domain.

## 14.12.4 ASSAYS GRADE DISTRIBUTIONS AND STATISTICS

Only  Sn,  Zn  and  In  values  contribute  to  the  current  resource  estimates.    Table  56  shows summary statistics for all the Sn, Zn and In assays from holes used in the area of the resource estimates.

## 14.13 GRADE CAPPING

On the basis of the point at which the ragged tail appears on the lognormal histogram, reviews of  the  probability  plots  and  on  the  total  metal  carried  by  the  higher  grade  samples,  the following top cuts were applied.  The difference in contained metal between the uncut and cut grades for the resource estimates ranges from about 4% to 12% depending on the metal and the domain.  Tin is the metal that has the largest economic contribution to the resource.  The twenty  highest  grade  uncut  Sn  samples  in  the  100  Domain,  ranging  from  4.73% Sn  to 14.94% Sn, account for 9.9% of the total metal as determined by a grade times length basis. The  forty  highest  grade  uncut  Sn  samples  in  the  200  Domain,  ranging  from  4.60% Sn  to 14.15% Sn, account for 9.2% of the total metal as determined by a grade times length basis.

## 14.14 COMPOSITES

All elements were composited to 3.0 m run-length composites.  Except for a number of very short  and  a  few  long  assay  intervals  the  3.0 m  composites  are  not  substantially  different  in length than the majority of assay intervals.  The presence of some very short assay intervals in the data was the primary reason for compositing.  Assays were cut before compositing.

Table 59 shows summary statistics for all the Sn, Zn and In composites for holes used in the resource  estimates.  When  composites  were  created,  the  grade  of  any  unassayed  sample intervals  was  assumed  to  be  zero.  This  has  almost  no  effect  on  the  Sn  and  Zn  composites, since virtually every sample interval in the 100 and 200 Domains has Sn and Zn assays. But it has a significant effect on the Indium composites, since many of the sample intervals do not have Indium assays. Previous resource estimates for the Mount Pleasant Project have in-filled the missing Indium assays by predicting the Indium grade from the grades of other metals, principally relying on Zinc. The use of zeros where Indium is not assayed is conservative, but limits the risk of incorrectly predicting good Indium grades where no direct assays of Indium support this.

## 14.15 HISTORICAL PRODUCTION

There  has  been  no  historical  production  from  the  North  Zone  although  there  has  been underground development for exploration and to provide platforms for underground drilling at the  955 m  level  (mine  elevation)  for  the  Endogranite  Zone  and  the  1,185 m  level  (mine elevation) for the #1-3 Tin Zone and #4 Tin Zone.

## 14.16 VARIOGRAPHY

## 14.16.1 100 DOMAIN

Figures 69 to 71 show experimental variograms using the assay data for Sn, Zn and In from the 100 Domain and, in the case of indium, using only the sample intervals that had actual assays (i.e. not using the intervals where an indium grade of zero had been assigned because no indium assay had yet been done).  These figures show that the continuity is slightly longer in the sub-horizontal direction, with a range of approximately 35 m, and slightly shorter in the vertical direction, with a range of approximately 20 m.

Nugget effects are roughly 40-50% of the sill, which reflects a combination of genuine shortscale  variation  (the  erratic  and  unpredictable  occurrence  of  the  higher  grade  values)  and additional variability due to noise from sampling and assaying procedures.  The lower nugget effect  component  seen  in  the  vertical  direction  is  partly  attributed  to  the  availability  of  a

relatively large number of closely spaced samples in vertical holes drilled by ADEX that, by virtue of being relatively recent data, likely have lower analytical noise than assays from holes drilled by previous operators. This has been confirmed by downhole variograms calculated for older drill holes versus the more recent ADEX drill holes; these show a higher nugget effect for the older drilling for both Sn and Zn. With very few Indium data in the older drill holes, the downhole variogram for the Indium assays in the older holes has few data pairs, and does not present a clear structure.

Figure 71. Experimental Variograms for In for the 100 Domain

<!-- image -->

The older drill holes and the more recent holes both show similar ranges: 35 m horizontally and 20 m vertically.

## 14.16.2 200 DOMAIN

Figures  72  to  74  show  experimental  variograms  calculated  in  several  different  directions using the assay data for Sn, Zn and In for the 200 Domain and, in the case of indium, using only the sample intervals that had actual assays (i.e. not using the intervals where an indium grade of zero had been assigned because no Indium assay had yet been done).  These figures show a similar pattern of spatial continuity as seen in the 100 Domain, with the grades being more continuous in sub-horizontal directions, but with a weaker directional anisotropy than in the 100 Domain. For all three metals, the horizontal ranges are approximately 30 m and the vertical range is approximately 20 m.

Nugget effects are similar to those seen in the 100 Domain, roughly 40-50% of the sill, and, as with the 100 Domain, are slightly lower in the vertical direction, likely because many of the vertical assay pairs are from holes drilled recently by ADEX.

## 14.17 ESTIMATION APPROACH

## 14.17.1 COMPOSITES

For  the  purposes  of  resource  estimation,  assay  data  were  capped  and  then  composited  into 3.0 m intervals, roughly corresponding to 50% of the dimensions used for blocks in the block model.    All  un-assayed  intervals  for  all  elements  were  assigned  a  grade  of  zero,  including unsampled  intervals  at  the  top  of  each  hole,  and  any  unsampled  interval  in  the  last  3.0 m composite at the bottom of each hole.

Composites were assigned a domain code according to the domain in which the centre of the composite lies: either the 100 or 200 domain.

## 14.17.2 BLOCK MODEL CONFIGURATION

Table 60 describes the  block model configuration.  The vertical  and horizontal dimensions covered by the block model reflect the extent of regular surface and underground drilling in the North Zone; from an elevation of 800 to 1400 m, mine grid easting 15200E to 15725E and northing 13350N to 14025N.

| Direction   |   Block size (m) |   Number of blocks | Minimum   | Maximum   |
|-------------|------------------|--------------------|-----------|-----------|
| East-West   |                5 |                105 | 15200E    | 15725E    |
| North-South |                5 |                135 | 13350N    | 14025N    |
| Vertical    |                5 |                120 | 800       | 1400      |

## 14.17.3 INTERPOLATION USING GEOLOGICAL DOMAINS

The data analysis presented earlier in this section indicates that Sn, Zn and In grades are not distributed evenly between the 100 Domain (Endogranite) and the 200 Domain.  Sn grades tend  to  be  higher  in  the  100  Domain  and  Zn  and  In  tend  to  be  lower  in  the  100  Domain. Lithology  data  has  not  been  entered  into  the  database  so  the  distinction  between  the Endogranite Domain and the other areas is largely based on incorporation of geological data from past interpretations.  In many areas the distinction between the two domains is arbitrary.

Although the domains have significant internal or local variations on grade and metal ratios, they are important to the resource estimation for two reasons:

- 1. As shown by the exploratory data analysis the distribution of metals is different in the two domains (mean, median etc.).
- 2. As shown by the variogram analysis, the pattern of spatial continuity in 100 Domain is different than that of the 200 Domain.

For these reasons, the resource estimation uses a 'hard' boundary between the 100 and 200 Domains.

## 14.18 CLASSIFICATION

The classification of mineral resources and mineral reserves used in this report conforms with the  definitions  standards  provided  in  the  final  version  of  National  Instrument  43-101 ("NI 43-101"), which came into effect on February 1, 2001, as revised on December 11, 2005. The Definitions  Standards  includes  further  changes  to  maintain  compatibility  with  the  new version of National Instrument 43-101, effective June 30, 2011.  We further confirm that, in arriving at our classification, we have followed the guidelines and standards by the Canadian Institute of Mining Metallurgy and Petroleum (" CIM ") Council adopted on November 27, 2010.

<!-- image -->

The relevant definitions for the CIM Standards/NI 43-101 are as follows:

A Mineral Resource is  a  concentration  or  occurrence  of  diamonds,  natural  solid inorganic, or natural solid fossilized organic material including base and precious metals,  coal,  and  industrial  minerals  in  or  on  the  Earth's  crust  in  such  form  and quantity and of such a grade or quality that it has reasonable prospects for economic extraction.  The location, quantity, grade, geological characteristics and continuity of a Mineral Resource are known, estimated or interpreted from specific geological evidence and knowledge.

An Inferred  Mineral  Resource is  that  part  of  a  Mineral  Resource for  which quantity and grade or quality can be estimated on the basis of geological evidence and  limited  sampling  and  reasonably  assumed,  but  not  verified,  geological  and grade  continuity.    The  estimate  is  based  on  limited  information  and  sampling gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drillholes.

An Indicated  Mineral  Resource is  that  part  of  a  Mineral  Resource for  which quantity,  grade  or  quality,  densities,  shape  and  physical  characteristics  can  be estimated with a level of confidence sufficient to allow the appropriate application of technical and economic parameters, to support mine planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit.  The estimate is based on detailed and reliable exploration and testing information gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drillholes that are spaced closely enough for geological and grade continuity to be reasonably assumed.

A Measured  Mineral  Resource is  that  part  of  a  Mineral  Resource for  which quantity, grade or quality, densities, shape, and physical characteristics are so well established  that  they  can  be  estimated  with  confidence  sufficient  to  allow  the appropriate application of technical and economic parameters, to support production planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit.  The estimate  is based  on  detailed  and  reliable  exploration,  sampling  and  testing information gathered through  appropriate techniques from  locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drillholes that are spaced closely enough to confirm both geological and grade continuity.

## 14.19 GRADE ESTIMATION PARAMETERS

For  all  blocks  whose  centres  fall  within  either  of  the  domains,  Sn,  Zn  and  In  grades  were estimated by an inverse distance squared ('ID ') method.  A minimum of 6 composites were 2 needed  within  the  search  ellipsoid  for  a  block  in  order  for  that  block  to  be  included  in Indicated Mineral Resources.  Additionally, a block needed to have composites present within the  search  range  in  at  least  two  different  octants  to  be  classified  as  Indicated  to  limit  the impact  due  to  clustering  of  sample  data.    Further,  composites  had  to  be  available  from  a

<!-- image -->

minimum to two drillholes in order for a block to be classified as Indicated.  If a block did not have  enough  composites  within  the  search  radius  to  be  classified  as  Indicated  a  second interpolation was made to estimate Inferred Mineral Resources.

## Estimation Parameters for Indicated Resources Common to Both Domains

The following search parameters were used for the estimation of Indicated Resources in the 100 Domain and in the 200 Domain:

16

Minimum # of composites:

6

Maximum # of composites:

Minimum # of holes:

2

Minimum # of octants with data:

2

Both domains also used the same orientation for the axes of the variogram model and for the search ellipsoid.  The search was isotropic in the horizontal plane.

Direction 1:

North-South, horizontal

Direction 2:

East-West, horizontal

Direction 3:

Vertical, no inclination from horizontal

The only differences in the estimation parameters used for the 100 Domain and those used for the 200 Domain are the size of the search ellipsoid.

## Estimation Parameters for Inferred Resources Common to Both Domains

A  second  grade  interpolation  pass  was  done  to  identify  Inferred  Resources.    The  search parameters were modified using the same parameters for domains, search range, orientation and composites as for the Indicated Resources.  An ID  estimation method was used with the 2 same search parameters as for Indicated except that a minimum of only two composites and a maximum of 16 composites were used which could come from as few as one drillhole.  The closest composites were used.  Only blocks that had not had a grade value assigned during the pass for the Indicated Resources, as determined by a flag, were estimated in this pass.  The use of a flag prevented blocks that were interpolated at a '0' grade during the first pass from being populated by a different value during the second pass.

## Estimation Parameters for Sn, Zn and In for the 100 Domain

The  search  ellipse  used  in  the  100  Domain  uses  the  directions  given  above  for  the  search ellipsoid, with the following parameters:

Range in 1 st direction:

35 m

Range in 2 nd direction:

35 m

Range in 3 rd direction:

20 m

The search ellipse was based on the spatial continuity shown by the experimental variograms (Figures  46  to  48),  with  greatest  continuity  in  the  both  horizontal  directions  and  the  least continuity in the vertical direction.

## Estimation Parameters for the 200 Domain

The  search  ellipse  used  in  the  200  Domain  uses  the  directions  given  above  for  the  search ellipsoid, with the following parameters:

Range in 1 st direction:

30 m

Range in 2 nd direction:

30 m

Range in 3 rd direction:

20 m

The search ellipse was based on the spatial continuity shown by the experimental variograms (Figures  49  to  51),  with  greatest  continuity  in  the  both  horizontal  directions    and  the  least continuity in the vertical direction.

## 14.20 BULK DENSITY AND TONNAGE

On the basis  of  the  2010  Thibault  and  Associates  Report,  a  bulk  density  of  2.70  t/m   was 3 assigned  to  all  lithology  units.    A  bulk  density  of  2.00  t/m   was  assumed  for  overburden. 3 There are no grades interpolated in the blocks assigned as overburden.

## 14.21 GRADE INTERPOLATION

A dollar equivalent value, designated as the Gross Metal Value ('GMV'), was calculated for each  mineralized  block  by  performing  a  simple  manipulation  of  the  block  model  grade parameters  based on prices as listed below and as determined by the following formula:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

<!-- image -->

The GMV values of 183.72 for Sn, 20.00 for Zn and 6,000.00 for In represent the USD value per tonne for those metals assuming the 3 year average of US$18.37 per kg of Sn, US$2.00 per kg of Zn and US$600.00 per kg of In (the imperial equivalents of these are US$8.33 per pound for Sn and US$0.91 per pound for Zn).  Recoveries are assumed to be 100%.  Using these values, the relative contribution for the individual metals for the resources reported in Table 36 is as follows:

- · For the Indicated Resources, approximately 56% of the GMV value is derived from Sn, 14% from Zn and 30% from In; and
- · For  the  Inferred  Resources,  approximately  46% of  the  GMV  value  is  derived  from  Sn, 18% from Zn and 35% from In.

## 14.22 SOFTWARE

RCI estimated the Mineral Resources for the North Zone using the block model estimation tools  available  in  GEMS  version  6.1.4  of  Gemcom  Software  International  Inc. In-house proprietary  software  from  FSS  was  used  to  check  the  GEMS  results  and  for  specific  sidestudies aimed at establishing appropriate resource estimation parameters.

## 14.23 CHECKS OF MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATES

## 14.23.1 VISUAL INSPECTION ON CROSS SECTIONS

Figure 75 is a vertical north-south cross section through the deposit on Section 15500E that shows the boundary between the 100 and 200 Domains (the irregular solid grey line at the lower  centre  part  of  the  figure)  and  the  typical  distribution  of  composites  along  drillholes. Composites  with  Sn  grades  of  0.3% or  better  and  estimated  blocks  showing  Sn  grades  of 0.3% or better are colour coded.  The figure shows that the distribution of the better grade blocks matches very well in terms of location, shape and grade with that of the composites. Figure 76 is  a  plan  view  at  the  950 m  elevation  that  shows  the  same  data  as  in  Figure  75. Figure 77 is a 3D view showing composited Sn values over 0.3% Sn.

## 14.23.2 ESTIMATION METHOD

Estimates  were  also  done  using  alternative  methodologies.    Using  the  GEMS  software, estimates for Sn, Zn and In were done using an ordinary kriging interpolation and also the same  metals  were  estimated  using  a  nearest  neighbour  interpolation.    An  additional  check estimate  using  an  ID   interpolation  was  done  independently  by  FSS  Canada  Consultants 2 Inc. All of the alternative interpolations matched well with the resources that were generated using the ID  estimate in GEMS. 2

## 14.23.3 ORIGINAL DATA

Figure 78 shows 'swath plots': comparisons of the average grade of each column, row and level in the block model versus the length-weighted average grade of the assay data on each column, row and level.  The block model is well constrained by the drillhole data, picking up local  peaks  and  valleys  in  grade.    The  block  model  grades  show  less  variability  than  the drillhole data, as they should since they are intended to reflect grades of selective mining units that are larger than the volume of the drillhole sample intervals (i.e. 3 m of drill core).

## 14.24 SENSITIVITY STUDIES

## Effect of Cutoff Grade

Tables  61  and  62  summarize  the  grade  and  tonnage  of  the  classified  resources  for  cutoffs other than the $75 GMV cutoff selected for reporting.  In the case of the Indicated Resources, at a lower cutoff of $55 GMV, the tonnage increases by about 64% and the GMV drops by about 25%.  For a higher cutoff at $95 GMV, the tonnage drops by about 37% and the GMV value per tonne increases by about 18%.  Similar impacts are seen when the GMV cutoff is changed for the Inferred Resources.

## 14.25 RECONCILIATION

The North Zone had a previous resource estimate prepared in 2009 by WGM and the results of that were filed in a Technical Report that is available on SEDAR (Dunbar and de l'Etoile, 2009).  The 2009 estimates were used for the 2010 Preliminary Economic Assessment that which  is  contained  in  a  Technical  Report  that  is  also  available  on  SEDAR  (Thibault  and Associates, 2010). Note: This report is no longer current and should not be relied upon. The 2009 estimates did not include Zn, used substantially different domains to constrain the estimates,  used  fewer  assay  data  as  the  2010  and  2011  ADEX  drilling  had  not  yet  been undertaken, and finally, the 2009 estimates employed different estimation parameters.

<!-- image -->

The cutoff grade for the 2009 estimates used a Sn equivalent ('SNEQ') grade of 0.25% Sn and converted In grades to a Sn equivalent using a factor of:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

At  the  metal  prices  assumed  for  the  current  estimate,  a  SNEQ% of  0.25% Sn  is  about  the same as a GMV cutoff of about US$46/T.  The higher cutoff used for the current estimates in part  is  based  on  the  estimated  operating  cost  breakdown  as  presented  in  Table  26-1  of Thibault et al (2010).

If  a  comparable  cutoff  to  the  2009  cutoff  is  employed  on  the  2012  estimates,  they  report considerably more tonnes for material that would classified as Indicated and somewhat less tonnes  for  material  that  would  be  classified  as  Inferred  relative  to  the  2009  estimate  (the US$55 GMV listed in Tables 42 and 43 is approximately  equivalent  to  a  SNEQ  cutoff  of 0.3%).    The  2009  estimate  reported  Indicated  Resources  of  10.9 m  T  @  0.43% Sn  and 67.8 gpt  In  and  Inferred  Resources  of  7.6 m  T  @  0.22% Sn  and  74.6  gpt  In.    The  relative increase in the percentage of Indicated to Inferred Resources in the 2012 estimate relative to the 2009 estimate reflects the impact of:

- · the infill drilling done by ADEX on 2010 and 2011; and
- · differing domain models and estimation procedures.

## 14.26 OTHER METALS

There  are  a  number  of  other  elements  that  occur  in  the  North  Zone  and  these  may  have potential importance in regard to metallurgical recoveries.  However, these elements have not been  given  any  consideration  in  the  current  resource  estimate  and  the  results  of  the interpolations  for  these  metals  as  presented  here  are  not  NI  43-101  compliant  resource estimates.  Detailed data analysis, data verification, QA/QC checks and variography were not done for these metals.  This, is part of the reason they are not included as part of the resource estimates.    Further,  the  ability  (or  inability)  to  recover  some  of  these  elements  when recovering Sn-Zn-In, mitigates against the inclusion of these elements as part of the current resource  estimate.    Table  63  presents  the  results  of  a  series  of  ID   interpolations  for  these 2 elements.

The data in Table 63 were derived using the same interpolation parameters as for the inferred resource estimates for Sn, Zn and In.  Those parameters included search ranges of 35 m in all horizontal directions and 20 m in the vertical direction for the 100 Domain and 30 m in all horizontal  directions  and  20 m  in  the  vertical  direction  for  the  200  Domain.    Only  two

<!-- image -->

composites were needed to inform a block and a maximum of 16 composites were allowed. For  the  interpolation  method  used  for  Table  44,  unsampled  intervals  were  treated  as  zero grade  entries  and  samples  that  had  been  entered  as  Below  Detection  Limits  ('BDL')  were reported  by  ADEX  to  be  entered  at  half  the  detection  limit.    RCI  cautions  that  it  has  not verified the data that supports these results.

## 14.27 DISCUSSION ON OTHER MATERIAL FACTORS

The reader is referred to Sections 4, 13 and 19 to 23 of this Report for information regarding the extent to which the mineral resource estimates could be materially affected by any known environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, socio-economic, marketing, political or other relevant factors.  Recovery of the metals reported, and the impact of other economic factors required to convert the mineral resources to mineral reserves would need to be addressed in order  to  facilitate  a  meaningful  review  of  all  factors  that  might  impact  the  current  mineral resources,  however,  the  author  is  of  the  opinion  that  the  mineral  resources  reported  are consistent  with  the  2010  CIM  definitions,  viz.  ' A  Mineral  Resource  is  an  inventory  of mineralization  that  under  realistically  assumed  and  justifiable  technical  and  economic conditions might become economically extractable'.

The Mount Pleasant Property is the proposed site for production from both the North Zone and  the  Fire  Tower  Zone.    As  discussed  in  the  Mount  Pleasant  North  Zone  Preliminary Assessment  Report  of  January  22,  2010,  there  is  an  existing  infrastructure  for  Fire  Tower Zone mine and surface operations.

The  existing  site  infrastructure  includes  a  tailings  pond,  site  administrative  and  warehouse buildings, A-Frame ore storage building, a concentrator building from previous operations, a site substation and access roads to the site.

The Fire Tower Zone mine was developed during previous operations by Billiton Exploration Canada Limited.  Studies to define the mine development plan based on the revised Mineral Resource estimate and surface infrastructure requirements for the North Zone have not been completed.

A  semi-detailed  design  and  budget  cost  assessment  for  the  installation  of  a  wastewater treatment facility (for treatment of wastewater from the production of both zones and mine water) is in progress and not completed as of this date.

## 20.  ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES, PERMITTING, AND SOCIAL OR COMMUNITY IMPACT

## 20.1 BACKGROUND

The Mount Pleasant property is a formerly producing tungsten-molybdenum mine, which also hosts tin-indium-zinc mineralization within an adjacent ore zone on the same property.  The tungsten-molybdenum deposit is commonly referred to as the Fire Tower Zone ('FTZ') and the indium-zinc-tin deposit is referred to as the North  Zone  ('NZ').    The  existing underground mine workings used to extract ore from the FTZ during the previous operation are physically connected to the NZ by means of the North Zone Access Ramp, which was driven to advance exploration activities within the North Zone.

The property has been under care and maintenance since 1985, when the mine was closed due to a down-turn in tungsten prices.  Mine water which overflows from the flooded Fire Tower Zone mine workings is currently treated  by  neutralization  with  lime  followed  by  a  settling pond to precipitate  and  store  metal  hydroxide  sludge  prior  to  the  treated  mine  water  being discharged into the existing tailings pond.  Effluent from the mine continues to be managed such that there is a single point of effluent discharge from the tailings pond to Hatch Brook through the tailings pond decant structure.

The  mine  water  treatment  plant  is  currently  operated  under  New  Brunswick  Approval  to Operate I-6154, which requires that the Mount Pleasant mine site be operated in such in a way as to meet the following water quality objectives for discharge of effluent from the tailings impoundment area ("TIA"):

- · the pH is between 6.5 and 9.0 at all times;
- · the total suspended solids are less than 10 mg/L at all times;
- · the aluminum concentration is less than 0.4 mg/L at all times;
- · the arsenic concentration is less than 0.3 mg/L at all times;
- · the fluoride concentration is less than 3.0 mg/L at all times;
- · the zinc concentration is less than 0.4 mg/L at all times; and
- · the effluent is non-acutely lethal to aquatic life at all times.

Under the current approval to operate (dated October 31, 2007), ADEX has monitored and reported the tailings pond discharge water quality on a monthly basis to the New Brunswick Department  of  Environment  (" NBDOE ").    Water  quality  parameters  analyzed  in  monthly grab  samples  have  typically  been  in  compliance  with  the  prescribed  limits.    The  current approval to operate is valid to September 30 th , 2012.

The Decant Structure, Tailings Dam and Emergency Spillway structures were repaired and upgraded  in  2008  to  meet  Canadian  Dam  Safety  Guidelines  (Canadian  Dam  Association, 2007).    New  piezometers  were  also  installed  in  2008  to  monitor  dam  stability.    The  new decant structure will allow for the water level and rate of discharge from the tailings pond to be controlled via a system of wooden stop logs.  Currently, there are no stop logs installed in the decant structure and the effluent overflows through the decant structure to maintain the water level within the TIA at approximately 122.5 m (mine datum).  At this water level, there are both flooded and un-flooded zones of previously placed tailings present within the TIA.

Condition 13(c) of Approval to Operate I-6154 states that, ' prior to flooding the tailings in the TIA, Adex shall submit to the Project Assessment and Approvals Branch for review and approval, a Tailings Flooding Contingency Plan in case the flooding begins to release metal concentrations  greater  than  shown  in  Condition  15(g) '.    In  2008,  ADEX  commissioned Jacques Whitford Limited ('JWL') to complete a study identifying environmental issues that may  arise  upon  flooding  of  the  exposed  tailings  entitled  ' Background  Documentation  for Tailings Flooding Contingency Plan - Mount Pleasant Mine '.  The study concluded that the majority of the metals that may be released during flooding can be controlled by maintaining the  pH  of  the  tailings  pond  between  pH  8.0  and  9.0;  however,  mitigation  measures  for  the potential release of  fluoride from the tailings were not identified  and it was concluded that control  of  soluble  fluoride  concentrations  in  the  tailings  pond  is  not  pH  dependant.    As  a result,  further  research  and  testing  on  the  mobility  and  leachability  of  fluoride  would  be required to fully understand and prepare a mitigation plan for the potential release of fluoride into the tailings pond water upon flooding the tailings.

A subsequent study entitled, ' Mount Pleasant Property Tailings Leachability and Wastewater Treatability ',  was  completed  by  Thibault  &amp;  Associates  Inc. in  2010  and  confirmed  the potential for release of high concentrations of soluble fluoride upon flooding of the exposed tailings.    Furthermore,  the  study  concluded  that  the  release  of  fluoride  was  greater  from samples  of  exposed  tailings  than  from  samples  of  previously  submerged  tailings  and  that higher solid to liquid ratios and the presence of mixing increase the rate of fluoride leaching from  the  tailings.    Bench  scale  tests  were  completed  on  the  exposed  tailings  samples  to determine the effect of mitigation measures that could be readily implemented to control the release of fluoride in the tailings pond during flooding.  From these tests it was determined that at pH greater than 8.0, soluble fluoride concentrations in the supernatant water increased with  both  the  use  of  lime  and  caustic  for  pH  control.    At  constant  pH,  adjustment  of  the supernatant water hardness using calcium chloride also failed to adequately control the release of fluoride.

<!-- image -->

Based  on  the  results  of  the  study  completed  by  Thibault,  it  was  concluded  that  adsorption using activated alumina is considered to be the best available control technology for removal of  fluoride  from the tailings pond water or other wastewater sources generated from future operation of the mine.  Furthermore, sub-aerial tailings (beach tailings) disposal was proposed as  an  alternative  to  sub-aqueous  disposal  for  future  operation  of  the  mine,  subject  to  a comprehensive review of available options for tailings and solid waste disposal.  An overall water, wastewater and solid waste management concept has not yet been defined for the site and is the subject of on-going study and review.

Detailed engineering design of a new sludge pond to accommodate lime neutralization (metal hydroxide) sludge generated from continued mine  water treatment, mine  dewatering wastewater treatment, or for future mine operations was also completed in 2008 by Jacques Whitford Limited.  Although approval was granted by the NBDOE Project Assessment and Approvals Branch for construction of the new sludge cell, the project was put on hold pending the outcome of a Preliminary Assessment Report on the North Zone (completed in 2010) and more detailed feasibility studies.

Revisions to the design concept and cost estimate for construction of the proposed new sludge storage cell were completed by Dillon Consulting Limited (' Dillon ') in 2011 and construction of the sludge cell will be deferred until definitive plans for mine dewatering and re-commencement of mine production at the Mount Pleasant site are finalized.

The  existing  sludge  pond  is  considered  to  provide  adequate  suspended  solids  removal  for treatment of mine water while the site is operated under Care and Maintenance. Approximately 2,500 cubic metres of settled sludge was removed from the pond during the summer of 2010 to restore sufficient retention time for settling of precipitated solids from the treated mine water.  This sludge was disposed in the flooded mine workings by pumping the slurry through the vent shaft opening at EL. 1,150 metres.

## 20.2 RELATED ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES

## 20.2.1 WASTEWATER TREATABILITY STUDIES

As  an  integral  part  of  development  of  the  Mount  Pleasant  property,  discussions  regarding environmental  standards  for  operation  of  the  mine  were  initiated  with  members  of  New Brunswick's Standing Committee on Mining and the Environment, which includes officials from  the  New  Brunswick  Department  of  Natural  Resources  (" NBDNR "), NBDOE  and Environment Canada.  Through these meetings, and based on the fact that a specific effluent limit  for  fluoride  has  been  imposed  for  the  operation  of  the  existing  mine  water  treatment

<!-- image -->

system / tailings pond discharge, it is recognized that fluoride removal from both the mine water and concentrator plant will be required for wastewater treatment related to re-commencement of operations at the site.

Currently,  fluoride  levels  in  the  raw  mine  water  range  between  5.0  and  8.0 mg/L  and  the existing  lime  neutralization  treatment  process  does  not  have  the  capability  to  remove dissolved fluoride.  Furthermore, fluoride has historically been added to the flotation circuit at Mount  Pleasant  in  the  form  of  sodium  silicofluoride  and/or  hydrofluorosilicic  acid  as  a gangue suppressant and this was the case during the previous operation producing tungsten and molybdenum concentrates.  During the previous operation of the mine in the early 1980s, the maximum level of soluble fluoride in the discharge from the tailings pond was defined as 12.0 mg/L.  The current discharge limit as defined by Approval to Operate I-6154 is 3.0 mg/L and the basis upon which these limits were established is unknown.

In  June,  2008,  an  independent  study  by  ADI  Limited  was  commissioned  to  identify  a wastewater  treatment  process  that  would  be  capable  of  treating  the  raw  mine  water  for removal of both heavy metals and fluoride to levels that would be safely below the limits set out in the current approval to operate at the point of discharge from the mine water treatment plant.    The  ADI  study  (ADI  Limited,  2008)  determined  that  effluent  metals  concentration limits  could  be  met  by  pH  adjustment  with  lime  to  pH  8.5  and  that  the  effluent  zinc  and arsenic concentrations could be further reduced by addition of soluble ferric iron to the metals precipitation  stage  in  a  commercially  proven  wastewater  treatment  process  referred  to  as co-precipitation.

The  ADI  report  identified  two  technically  viable  means  of  reducing  effluent  fluoride concentrations  to  below  3.0 mg/L  -  alum  coagulation  (Nalgonda  technique)  and  adsorption with activated alumina.  Alum coagulation is commonly used for defluoridation of drinking water in developing countries and is relatively simple and easy to implement; however, the high operating cost associated with the procurement of aluminum sulphate reagent does not support its use for industrial wastewater treatment. Activated alumina systems are commercially  proven  for  large-scale  defluoridation  of  drinking  water;  however,  limited testing has been done on industrial or mining effluents.

Subsequently, ADEX commissioned a second study by Thibault &amp; Associates Inc. (Thibault &amp;  Associates  Inc.,  2010)  to  i)  assess  the  treatability  of  simulated  high  concentration wastewater  that  could  potentially  be  generated  from  hydrometallurgical  processing  of  the North  Zone  ore,  ii)  assess  the  technical  feasibility  of  removing  fluoride  from  the  effluent using the activated alumina process; and, iii) assess leachability of fluoride from previously submerged and un-submerged tailings and from a sample of ore from the North Zone.  The

<!-- image -->

results of the tailings leachability portion of the study have been previously discussed in this section.

Both  bench  scale  testing  and  a  mini-pilot  simulation  of  the  proposed  treatment  process, involving lime neutralization, co-precipitation of heavy metals by addition of soluble ferric iron and removal of fluoride by adsorption onto activated alumina, successfully demonstrated the technical viability of the process for treatment of both raw mine water and a sample of simulated high concentration wastewater containing several times the normal concentration of heavy metals, including aluminum, zinc and arsenic.

The effluent from the mini-pilot simulation of the proposed wastewater treatment process met all  of  the  discharge water quality guidelines defined by the current approval to operate and was  determined  to  be  non-acutely  lethal  to  rainbow  trout  (zero  mortalities  were  observed during the standard 96-hour test period).

## 20.2.2 DETERMINATION OF A SITE SPECIFIC ENVIRONMENTAL DISCHARGE OBJECTIVE FOR FLUORIDE

The  Province  of  New  Brunswick  does  not  have  an  established  environmental  discharge objective ('EDO') for fluoride.  Environmental discharge objectives represent effluent quality guidelines that are protective of the receiving environment and, traditionally, Metals Mining Effluent Regulations ('MMER") required that these limits be set such that the whole effluent (or concentration of any specific contaminant) was not acutely lethal to rainbow trout based on a 96-hour exposure period.  More recently, environmental discharge objectives have been determined based on meeting environmental quality objectives ('EQOs') that represent the maximum  concentration  of  a  substance  in  the  surface  water  of  the  downstream  aquatic habitats that would have no adverse chronic, or long-term, effects on aquatic species.  In a practical setting, the determination of a site-specific EDO for fluoride should consider both of these endpoints.

In  2011,  ADEX  commissioned  a  study  to  be  completed  jointly  by  Thibault  &amp;  Associates Inc. and Dillon Consulting Limited that would provide a basis for establishing a reasonable environmental discharge objective for fluoride for the Mount Pleasant site. The recommended discharge limit for fluoride to be established from the study would be observant of the traditional MMER guideline (i.e.  effluent is non-acutely lethal to aquatic life) while also being respectful of the chronic effect level.

The  study  relied  primarily  on  the  results  of  Whole  Effluent  Toxicity  ('WET')  tests  and included  completion  of  a  number  of  single  concentration  and  multi-concentration  acute

<!-- image -->

toxicity tests on both rainbow trout and Daphnia magna, as well as a multi-concentration test to determine the chronic sub-lethal effects of fluoride exposure on Ceriodaphnia dubia.  All aquatic life toxicity testing was completed in accordance with Environment Canada standard methods  EPS1/RM/14,  EPS1/RM/13  and  EPS1/RM/21  by  a  Standards  Council  of  Canada accredited laboratory on samples of treated minewater obtained by mini-pilot scale simulation of the proposed wastewater treatment process using untreated mine water collected from the open  portal  at  the  Mount  Pleasant  site.    Samples  of  simulated  treated  wastewater  were neutralized with lime and treated for removal of dissolved metals but were not subjected to any form of treatment for fluoride removal.

Results of aquatic toxicity testing have indicated that the effluent samples, containing up to 9.8 mg/L of dissolved fluoride were non-acutely lethal (zero mortalities) to rainbow trout and daphnia magna.  Results of chronic effects testing, completed on simulated treated effluent containing  7.0 mg/L  fluoride,  also  resulted  in  zero  mortalities  of  the  test  organism  at 100% sample concentration, suggesting that both the the 50% lethality (LC50) level and the Lowest Observable  Effect Concentration ('LOEC') for fluoride is greater than 7.0 mg/L for all species tested.  These results were compared with acute lethality data for fluoride available from  the  USEPA  EcoTox  Database,  which  includes  the  results  of  over  140  WET  tests  on more than 20 different species of aquatic plant, invertebrates and fish.  The concentration of fluoride that  would have an acutely lethal effect on 5% of aquatic species was found to be approximately 10 mg/L, based on the data available from the EcoTox database.

The results of the chronic sub-lethal effects test indicated that a reduction in the reproductive success was observed within the undiluted effluent and the concentration that would resulted in  25% inhibition  (IC25)  was  reported  as  3.85 mg/L  (55% of  whole  sample)  by  the  test laboratory.    Further  review  of  the  chronic  sub-lethal  effects  data  by  Ulysses  Klee,  an ecotoxicologist  with  Dillon  Consulting  Limited,  concluded  that  the  this  endpoint  was misleading given that there was no significant difference between the reproductive success of the control sample and that quantified in the 50% dilution sample and therefore, 50% dilution, or 3.5 mg/L fluoride, actually represents the No Observable Effect Concentration ('NOEC'). According to the USEPA EcoTox database, the lowest NOEC for growth was 2.5 mg/L based on  the  response  of  the  caddisfly  and  a  21-day  NOEC  of  14 mg/L  was  reported  for reproductive success in Daphnia magna.

The study concluded that the current effluent discharge limit of 3.0 mg/L for fluoride is both practically  achievable  using  available  technology  and  will  be  suitably  protective  of  the receiving aquatic environment, both in terms of acute toxicity and chronic sub-lethal effects.

## 20.2.3 BASELINE ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS MONITORING

In  September  of  2008,  a  Baseline  Aquatic  Survey  for  Environmental  Effects  Monitoring ("EEM")  was  conducted  in  Hatch  Brook  by  Jacques  Whitford  Stantec  (Jacques  Whitford Stantec, 2009) in order to document present environmental and aquatic conditions in the area of  the  Mount Pleasant property.  The study was conducted in a manner consistent with the federal  EEM  program  administered  by  Environment  Canada  such  that  the  results  could  be used to support future EEM studies, as would be required under MMER  in the event that the mine re-opens.

The baseline aquatic survey included sampling and analysis of water and sediment chemistry, benthic community analysis, assessment of fish habitat and analysis of fish tissues for metals at  three  sampling  stations  along  Hatch  Brook  including  a  i)  reference  station  -  located upstream from the former Mount  Pleasant  mine site, ii) exposure station -located immediately downstream of the discharge from the tailings pond, and iii) far field exposure station  located approximately 1.6 km downstream from the tailings pond discharge.

Overall,  water  quality  in  Hatch  Brook  was  considered  to  be  good  and  most  general  water quality  parameters,  as  well  as  trace  metals  and  mercury,  were  similar  across  all  sampling stations.

The fish and fish habitat assessment showed that there is abundant suitable fish habitat in the study locations and nine species of fish were collected for analysis, with the catch per unit effort being highest at the exposure station.  There were no exceedances of the Health Canada guideline for mercury in fish for human consumption.

Benthic  invertebrate  assemblage  structure  showed  no  evidence  of  adverse  effects  and  was noted as being "rich, diverse and similar to assemblages elsewhere in the brook" at all three stations.

## 20.2.4 TAILINGS IMPOUNDMENT FACILITY FISH PRESENCE SURVEY

In 2008, following the tailings dam upgrade construction project, the Department of Fisheries and Oceans Canada ('DFO') became aware of the potential presence of fish in the tailings pond  and  formally  requested  that  ADEX  conduct  a  fish  presence  survey  to  encompass  the areal extent of the tailings impoundment area.

The tailings impound facility fish presence survey was conducted in the Spring of 2009 by Jacques Whitford Stantec Limited and included an assessment of: i) water quality,

<!-- image -->

ii) sediment  quality,  and  iii)  fish  tissue  sample  analysis  on  brook  trout,  lake  chub  and longnose sucker.  The data collected was compared to data obtained during the 2008 Baseline Aquatic Survey for Environmental Effects Monitoring to ascertain if there were significant statistical differences between the fish found to be present in the tailings pond and fish tissues sampled from the surrounding environment outside of the tailings impoundment structure.

The presence of the following species of fish was confirmed within the tailings impoundment area: brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis), longnose sucker (Catostomus catotomus), lake chub (Couesius  plumbeus),  golden  shiner  (Notemigonus  crysoleucas)  and  pumpkinseed  sunfish (Lepomis gibbosus).

Water  quality  within  the  tailings  pond  was  generally  below  the  CCME  guidelines  for protection  of  Freshwater  Aquatic  Life  (FWAL,  CCME  1999)  and  was  found  to  contain elevated  levels  of  arsenic,  cadmium,  copper,  molybdenum  and  zinc  (relative  to  CCME guidelines).  Sediment quality was also generally below the CCME Probable Effect Level for trace elements in sediment (CCME 1999) and contained elevated levels of arsenic, cadmium and zinc.  These results were not unexpected due to the nature of the tailings pond and its intended  function  as  a  permitted  waste  stabilization  pond  used  for  deposition  of  tailings during the former mine operation and its current function as an integral part of the mine water treatment plant permitted under Approval to Operate I-6154.

No abnormalities were observed in the external condition of the fish sampled in the tailings impoundment area; however, 33% of the longnose suckers were observed to have lumps and discoloured  livers.    No  other  internal  abnormalities  were  observed  in  any  of  the  other  fish caught, overall condition factors of all the fish fell within a normal range and no significant visual  differences  were  noted  between  fish  in  the  tailings  pond  and  fish  collected  at  the reference  station  (upstream  of  the  tailings  pond  decant  structure)  and  the  exposure  station (downstream of the tailings pond decant structure) during the Baseline EEM study.

Statistical comparison of fish tissue sample analysis confirmed that the fish sampled from the tailings  pond,  the  reference  station  and  the  exposure  station  in  Hatch  Brook  were  all chemically  distinct.    Concentrations  of  arsenic,  copper,  molybdenum  and  rubidium  were generally  higher  in  fillet  samples  collected  from  fish  within  the  tailings  pond,  whereas mercury  and  strontium  concentrations  were  generally  higher  in  fillet  samples  from  fish collected from the reference and exposure stations during the 2008 EEM study.

Concentrations of arsenic, rubidium, selenium and thallium were generally higher in livers of fish  collected  from  the  tailings  impoundment  area,  while  cadmium,  iron,  lead,  manganese,

<!-- image -->

mercury, potassium, silver and sodium were generally higher in livers of fish collected from the reference and exposure stations in Hatch Brook.

This study also concluded that, since mercury is released very slowly from fish tissues, the fish  population in the tailings pond is not mixing with the fish population in Hatch Brook. This conclusion was based on the finding that concentrations of mercury in tissue samples collected  from  fish  in  the  tailings  pond  were  significantly  lower  and  statistically  different from those collected from fish in Hatch Brook during the Baseline EEM Study.

Although  none  of  the  fish  sampled  contained  levels  of  mercury  above  the  Health  Canada guideline  for  mercury  in  fish  for  human  consumption,  concentrations  of  several  elements including arsenic,  copper,  molybdenum, rubidium, selenium and thallium were found to be elevated in tissue samples collected from fish within the tailings pond and the study further concluded that human consumption of the fish from the tailings pond should be avoided.

## 20.2.5 ADDITIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL FIELD STUDIES

In  the  Fall  of  2011,  Dillon  Consulting  Limited  conducted additional field studies to further investigate and establish existing environmental conditions at the site.  The studies focused on the areas surrounding the existing tailings pond and were completed by qualified terrestrial and aquatic biologists employed by Dillon Consulting Limited.  The completed field surveys specifically  included  an  aquatic  habitat  survey  and  study  of  fish  assemblages,  late  growing vegetation survey, preliminary wetland identification survey, mammal survey and preliminary herpetile  survey.    The  results  of  these  studies  are  pending  and  further  environmental  field studies planned for the Spring of 2012 include a migratory bird survey and an early flowering plant survey.

## 20.3 ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT AND MANAGEMENT

## 20.3.1 PROPOSED PLAN FOR WATER MANAGEMENT AND OPERATION OF TAILINGS IMPOUNDMENT AREA

The  development  plan  for  the  proposed  re-commencement  of  operations  at  the  Mount Pleasant mine is based on integrated management of process water, wastewater and tailings, which will all be controlled through the operation of the existing tailings impoundment area such that all treated effluent from the mine operations will be discharged to Hatch Brook from a single point at the site.

<!-- image -->

All process water required for the concentrator plant will be reclaimed from the tailings pond to  minimize  the  need  for  extracting  fresh  water  from  ground  or  surface  water  sources. Process wastewater from the various concentrator process unit operations and mine water will be collected and treated in a central, integrated wastewater treatment ('WWT') facility.  The new wastewater treatment process will be designed such that treated effluent at the discharge from WWT will meet the water quality objectives set out in the current approval to operate I6154 and applicable MMER  standards.

The overall tailings deposition and water management plan is not yet finalized and on-going studies are aimed to develop an appropriate tailings management and disposal strategy that is well-suited to the characteristics of the deposit and the existing conditions at the site.

## 20.3.2 WASTEWATER TREATMENT SLUDGE MANAGEMENT

Solids generated in the wastewater treatment process are mainly  comprised of excess lime, metal hydroxide precipitates and calcium fluoride sludge generated from periodic regeneration of activated alumina  media. The  wastewater  treatment sludge will be concentrated in the clarifier  underflow  stream  prior  to  being  disposed  in  the  proposed  new sludge storage cell, which would be constructed within the perimeter of the existing tailings impoundment area.

## 20.3.3 RECLAMATION PLAN

A scoping level reclamation plan approach was developed by Jacques Whitford as part of the Fire Tower Zone Scoping Study (Aker Solutions, 2008) that would meet the requirements of Regulation  86-98,  Sections  30(2) and  30(3) under  the provincial Mining  Act.    The reclamation plan developed by Jacques Whitford assumed that the existing buildings at site would be re-used for re-commencement of operations from the FTZ and no new buildings would be required.  As a result, the scope of the preliminary reclamation plan does not include remediation activities for any new buildings or site infrastructure that may be associated with future activities at the site related to i) potential future production from the North Zone, ii) expansion  of  existing  buildings  and  site  infrastructure,  iii)  expansion  or  changes  to  the existing  tailings  pond,  and  iv)  expansion  or  changes  to  the  existing  mine  water  treatment system.

For the purpose of future preliminary assessment or feasibility reports, it is assumed that a similar approach would be used for reclamation of the site; however, the reclamation plan will need to be updated to account for any changes to the scope of the project from that stated in the 2008 Aker Solutions Fire Tower Zone Scoping Study.  The following points summarize

<!-- image -->

the  goals  and  major  processes  associated  with  the  reclamation  plan  developed  by  Jacques Whitford:

- · removal  and/or  capping  and  revegetation  of  the  majority  of  the  physical  features  and structure associated with the site;
- · establishment of vegetation that will facilitate the natural recovery of the area for use by local wildlife;
- · control and mitigation of site drainage issues from  surface waste materials and underground openings;
- · control and mitigation of discharge water from the Tailings Impoundment Area;
- · permanent closure of mine portals, access ramps, raises by back-filling and installation of structurally engineered plugs;
- · removal  of  any  environmentally  hazardous  materials  from  underground  mine  workings prior to closure;
- · flattening of the downstream portions of both the Diversion Dam and the Tailings Dam to improve long-term stability of the unmonitored dams following closure;
- · salvage  of  any  equipment  and  building  materials  (e.g.    processing  equipment,  mobile equipment, windows, doors, cable, transformers, etc.);
- · demolition of all light frame buildings;
- · demolition, removal and disposal of concrete structures and foundations;
- · removal of any on-site power lines and electrical equipment; and
- · implementation of a post-closure monitoring and treatment program.

Jacques Whitford  estimated that, based on the reclamation plan approach as outlined above for  the  FTZ  Scoping  Study,  financial  securities  in  the  amount  of  C$2.87  million  would  be required for reclamation (Jacques Whitford, 2008b).

## 20.4 PERMITTING

Requirements for obtaining provincial and federal permits related to the proposed re-commencement  of  operations  at  the  Mount  Pleasant  mine  and  a  review  of  applicable government regulations was completed by Jacques Whitford Stantec as part of the Fire Tower Zone Scoping Study completed by Aker Solutions for Adex Mining Inc. in 2008.  A summary of  the  information  contained  in  the  Jacques  Whitford  Stantec  report  is  contained  in  the following sections.

<!-- image -->

## 20.4.1 PROVINCIAL REGULATIONS AND PERMITS

The following is a list of legislation, regulations and required permits that are administered by the Province of New Brunswick and are applicable to the current operation of the mine water treatment  plant  (care  and  maintenance  related  site  activity),  potential  construction  and pre-production activities associated with the re-opening of the mine.

## Clean Environment Act (Chapter C-6):

The Clean Environment Act is administered by NBDOE and provides the general legislative framework  for  protection  of  the  environment  in  New  Brunswick.    Handling,  storage  and disposal of hazardous wastes is managed as part of a stewardship program under this Act.

## Water Quality Regulation 82-126:

This instrument is administered by NBDOE under the Clean Water Act (Chapter C-6.1) for regulation of discharge of liquid effluents to bodies of water in New Brunswick and requires that any operator of a source of contaminants or release of contaminants that may cause water pollution must obtain a Certificate of Approval to Operate.  The Certificate of Approval to Operate defines the terms and conditions that the operator of the source must comply with in order to remain in compliance with the Regulation and to prevent pollution of the waters of the  Province.    The  terms  and  conditions  are  specific  to  the  operation  in  question  and  are determined by NBDOE on a case-by-case basis.  An effluent sampling and analysis program is  typically  required  and  limits  are  imposed  on  concentrations  of  specific  contaminants  for that site.  Provincial requirements for conducting Environmental Effects Monitoring studies are also mandated by the Certificate Approval to Operate.

## Air Quality Approvals Regulation 97-133:

This regulation was implemented under the Clean Air Act and is analogous to Water Quality Regulation 82-126 in that the NBDOE requires that any operator of a source of contaminants or release of contaminants to the air that may cause air pollution must obtain a Certificate of Approval to Operate.  The Mount Pleasant property currently does not require any Approvals under the Clean Air Act, as there are no sources of contaminants being released to the air on the  site.    If,  during  the  project,  one  or  more  sources  of  emissions  to  the  air  are  installed (e.g. boilers, kilns, vent scrubbers, etc.), an Approval will be required.

## Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Regulation 87-83:

The EIA Regulation 87-83 is administered by NBDOE under the Clean Environment Act and is intended to assure that all "undertakings" in the province are identified, reviewed and that any  potential  adverse  environmental  effects  associated  with  the  proposals  are  mitigated  in advance of their implementation.  The term, "undertakings" includes proposed construction,

<!-- image -->

operation, modification, extension, abandonment, demolition or rehabilitation of projects or activities as described in Schedule A of the regulation.  The proposed activities for resuming production at Mount Pleasant from the North Zone will have to be registered under the EIA Regulation, which requires that a registration document (report) be prepared and submitted to NBDOE for a Determination Review.  The registration document must i) describe the project in a sufficient level of detail to allow for a full technical review and, ii) assess all potential environmental  impacts  and  issues  and  describe  mitigation  measures  that  will  be  taken  to minimize impacts to the environment.

## Mining Act (Chapter M-14.1):

The  Mining  Act  is  administered  by  the  New  Brunswick  Department  of  Natural  Resources (NBDNR) and provides  the  legislative  framework  for  regulation  of  all  activities  related  to exploitation of mineral resources in New Brunswick.  This Act addresses all issues related to prospecting, exploration, drilling, claim staking,  ownership and allocation of minerals, land use, royalties, documentation of mining operations, damage and securities.  The requirement for a person or company to produce a Feasibility Study, apply for a Mining Lease, produce a Reclamation Plan and provide NBDNR with a Reclamation Bond prior to producing minerals from a mineral claim is regulated through the New Brunswick Mining Act.

## Petroleum Product Storage and Handling Regulation 87-97:

The regulation requires that the storage of petroleum products in excess of 2,000 litres on a site  requires  a  licence  to  assure  that  petroleum  products  are  stored  in  a  safe  manner  in  a registered  storage  vessel.    The  Mount  Pleasant  site  does  not  currently  hold  any  Petroleum Storage Site licences; however, it will require licences and a certificate of insurance for any propane, diesel fuel or heavy fuel oil to be stored on the site in the future.

## Crown Lands and Forests Act (C-38.1):

Administered by NBDNR, this act provides legislation for activities related to development, utilization,  protection  and  management  of  resources  located  on  Crown  Lands.    The  Crown Lands and Forests Act does not apply to the Mount Pleasant property, which is wholly owned by Adex Mining Inc.

## Other Provincial Acts and Regulations:

Other Provincial acts and regulations that may  apply  to the care and maintenance, construction,  pre-production  and  prospective  operation  of  the  Mount  Pleasant  property include:

- · Water Classification Regulation (NB Regulation 2002-13 under the Clean Water Act);

<!-- image -->

- · Watershed Protected Area Designation Order (NB Regulation 2001-83 under Clean Water Act);
- · Wellfield Protected Area Designation Order (NB Regulation 2000-47 under Clean Water Act);
- · Potable Water Regulation (NB Regulation 93-203 under Clean Water Act);
- · Fees for Industrial Approvals Regulation (NB Regulation 93-201 under Clean Water Act);
- · Protected Area Exemption Regulation (NB Regulation 90-120 under Clean Water Act);
- · Watercourse  and  Wetland  Alteration  Regulation  (NB  Regulation  90-80  under  Clean Water Act);
- · Water Well Regulation (NB Regulation 90-79 under Clean Water Act);
- · Used Oil Regulation (NB Regulation 2002-19 under Clean Environment Act);
- · Public Participation Regulation (NB Regulation 2001-98 under Clean Air Act); and
- · Ozone Depleting Substances Regulation (NB Regulation 97-132 under Clean Air Act).

All of the above referenced Provincial Acts and Regulation are available to be viewed on the government of New Brunswick website at http://www.gnb.ca/0062/acts/acts-e.asp.

## 20.4.2 FEDERAL REGULATIONS AND PERMITS

The  following  is  a  summary  of  legislation,  regulations  and  required  permits  that  are administered  at  the  Federal  level  in  Canada  and  which  may  be  applicable  to  the  care  and maintenance of the site and to any activities related the potential future operation of the mine.

## Federal Fisheries Act:

The Fisheries Act is jointly administered by both Environment Canada and the Department of Fisheries and Oceans Canada (" DFO ") and provides legislation to protect aquatic environments, fish and fish habitat from the harmful effects of pollutants, termed "deleterious substances" in the Act.  Deleterious substances can be interpreted to include a broad scope of materials,  but  is  typically  considered  to  be  any  substance  (e.g.    industrial  effluent,  tailings, refuse,  etc.)  that  is  or  has  the  potential  to  be  acutely  lethal  to  fish.    The  Act  also  contains provisions for preventing the harmful alteration, disruption or destruction of fish habitat and enables DFO to impede "undertakings" or work that proposes to do this.  Where the harmful alteration,  disruption  or  destruction  of  fish  habitat  is  proposed  in  the  execution  of  an undertaking, DFO requires that the Owner complete an Environmental Assessment under the Canadian  Environmental  Assessment  Act  ("CEAA").    The  outcome  of  such  an  assessment may require the Owner to implement certain measures and/or adhere to certain conditions to mitigate these effects, or the undertaking may be completely blocked from proceeding in the manner proposed.

The existing TIA or Tailings Pond is a fully permitted, man-made and self-contained structure that  was  constructed  by  Billiton  Exploration  Canada  Ltd  in  the  early  1980s  to  support  the mineral production operation.  In 1981, Billiton obtained Approval to Construct (No. 22-15-8) a  "waste  stabilization  pond"  (a.k.a  the  Tailings  Pond)  as  well  as  a  Permit  for  Watercourse Alteration from the New Brunswick Department of Environment.  In this regard, all issues of compensation, water diversions and other regulatory requirements related to the deposition of tailings in the TIA were settled by the previous Owner in the early 1980s.  Since 1985, the site has been placed on care and maintenance and the TIA, which currently receives mine water effluent and is fully permitted under NBDOE Approval to Operate I-6154, has not changed in purpose or character since production was suspended.

## Canadian Environmental Assessment Act:

The requirement for completion of an Environmental Assessment under the federal Canadian Environmental  Assessment  Act  ("CEAA")  depends  on  the  specific  nature  and  scope  of  an undertaking as well as other factors such as i) sources of funding for the project, ii) permitting requirements,  and  iii)  land  requirements.    In  order  for  CEAA  to  apply  the  proposed undertaking must have a certain "trigger" under Section 5(1) of the Act.  Triggers which could be applicable to the re-opening of the Mount Pleasant mine include:

- · if a federal government department or agency is a proponent of the undertaking;
- · if  funding  for  the  project  or  other  forms  of  financial  assistance  are  to  be  provided  by  a federal government department or agency;
- · if  the  undertaking  is  to  be  constructed  on  federal  lands  or  if  federal  lands  must  be transferred to allow the work to proceed; and
- · if  a  permit,  approval  or  authorization  is  required  to  be  issued  by  a  federal  government department or agency to allow the project to proceed.

## Canadian Environmental Protection Act:

The  Canadian  Environmental  Protection  Act  ("CEPA")  is  administered  by  Environment Canada  and  contains  the  MMER,  which  is  a  federal  guideline  for  maximum  allowable contaminant concentrations for discharge of liquid effluent from mining and ore processing facilities (Table 64).  For discharge of effluent to the environment, the MMER requires that:

- · concentrations  of  deleterious  substances  in  the  effluent  do  not  exceed  the  limits  in Table 48;
- · the pH is between 6.0 and 9.5; and
- · the effluent is not acutely lethal to fish.

## 25.  INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS

The  Mount  Pleasant  Mine  Property  contains  several  tungsten,  molybdenum,  tin,  indium, bismuth, zinc and copper polymetallic deposits.  Much of the earlier exploration work was focused in the immediate vicinity of the former mine site.  This exploration work included stream  and  soil  sampling  surveys,  surface  and  underground  drilling,  IP,  seismic,  SP, magnetic, gravity, EM and radiation surveys, stripping, trenching and sampling, some surface geological mapping,  previous feasibility studies, bulk sampling, metallurgical testing, underground development work and mining.

Updated  Mineral  Resource  estimates  have  been  made  for  the  North  Zone  and  Fire  Tower Zone.

Based  upon  work  done  for  this  report  and  the  previous  experience  at  Mount  Pleasant,  the authors make the following interpretations and conclusions:

- · Mineralization is related to inward-cooling of a small-volume, granitic magma that was emplaced along the margin of the dormant Mount Pleasant Caldera in the Late Devonian ( circa . 368 Ma);
- · Mineralization  is  focused  in  the  highest  parts  of  the  roof  zone  of  this  ancient  magma chamber (granite body), in cupolas or cusps, which occur beneath the North Zone, Saddle Zone and Fire Tower Zone at Mount Pleasant, as well as at Hornet Hill;
- · Mineralization is structurally controlled, in fractures that were produced by hydro-fracturing;  i.e.,  magmatic-hydrothermal  fluids  evolved  from  the  cooling  magma under pressure, accumulated in apical parts (cupolas) of the magma chamber, became over pressured and shattered the overlying rocks, including the early cooled parts of the granite cupolas;
- · Both  porphyry  tin  (Sn)  and  porphyry  tungsten  (W)  deposit  types  are  present  at  Mount Pleasant;  the  older  tungsten-molybdenum  mineralization,  which  has  associated  silicic alteration, is partly overprinted (spatially and temporally) by the tin-zinc (indium-bearing) mineralization, which has associated chloritic alteration.  The metals were transported by the same magmatic-hydrothermal fluids that caused the fracturing;
- · The tin mineralization mainly occurs as cassiterite and two populations are present - large single  crystals  and  crystal  aggregates  (&gt;100  microns)  and  small  individual  crystals (&lt;20 microns).    The  former  population  is  amenable  to  a  coarser  grind  and  gravity separation,  whereas  the  latter  population  requires  a  finer  grind  and  flotation  in  order  to

<!-- image -->

recover  the  cassiterite.    Over-grinding  must  be  avoided;  'Mt.  Isa  mills'  should  be considered as a possible way to prevent this from happening;

- · The 2008 drilling program was successful in upgrading the resource estimate of the FTZ from the 'Inferred' category to 'Indicated' category. The total 'indicated' tonnage and grades  for  tungsten  and  molybdenum  remain  almost  the  identical  with  old  "inferred" resources  for  the  FTW  and  FTN  sub-zones.    There  is  also  an  additional  'inferred' resource for the FTW based upon the results of the Phase I drilling;
- · Exploration potential still remains for future definition drilling to add additional mineral reserves within the FTZ.  The FTW subzone remains open on the southeast side in an area now referred to as the Fire Tower East ("FTE") sub-zone.  This area was drill tested by Phase II drillholes AM-08-15 and AM-08-16, with narrower and lower grade intersections.  Phase II hole AM-08-21 also tested mineralization in the same area as the FTE.  Additional drilling will be required to close off this zone;
- · It  also appears that the mineralization within the FTN sub-zone extends farther north of hole AM-08-11.  Phase II hole AM-08-24 was collared around 100 m north-northwest of hole AM-08-11  resulting in the extension of the FTN sub-zone a farther 40-50 m in that direction.  This hole intersected 0.12% Bi, 0.29% WO3, 0.15% MoS2 over a core length of 18.0 m.  Further diamond drilling is necessary to define the northern limit of the FTN subzone, which may close off to the north and then re-open again into the Saddle Zone;
- · Further drilling is required to delineate W-Mo-Bi mineralization in the southern and the eastern parts of the North Zone;
- · Further  drilling  is  required  to  fully  delineate  the  resources  of  the  Saddle  Zone  and  to determine  if  tungsten-molybdenum  mineralization  is  continuous  with  that  in  the  Fire Tower Zone to the south;
- · ADEX completed  repeat  analyses  on  historical  drill  core  and  pulp  samples  using  two different laboratories, SGS and Actlabs, which employ different analytical methods for the determination  of  In,  Sn,  W,  Mo,  Bi,  As,  Cu,  Pb  and  Zn  concentrations.    Preliminary conclusions by ADEX regarding which analytical methods should be used in future drill programs are  as  follows  (per.  comm.  Trevor  Boyd):  it  was  found  that  the  SGS  sodium peroxide  fusion  ICP  and  ICP-MS  method  recovers  the  most  metals,  including  tin  and tungsten, especially for the lower grade samples (between 0.05 to 0.2 Wt% grades), but the Fusion XRF technique of Actlabs appears to be more precise and should be seriously considered as the technique to be used in future exploration work;
- · For the 2010 drilling program, check assays done by ADEX at SGS on original Actlabs pulps agree reasonably well, with R2-values ≥0.92 for arsenic, bismuth, tin, molybdenum,

<!-- image -->

and zinc; copper, indium  and tungsten have R2-values of 0.87, 0.70 and 0.61, respectively;

- · For the 2011 drilling program, check assays done by ADEX at SGS on original Actlabs pulps agree very well (R2-values ≥0.98) for all metals;
- · Comparison of Actlabs' analytical results on 32 split-core samples with SGS' results for quartered-core samples from the same intervals, shows reasonable correlation between the two analytical laboratories for arsenic, copper, molybdenum, tin, and zinc, with R2-values ≥0.90; however, R2-values for bismuth, lead, indium and tungsten are 0.85, 0.85, 0.77, and 0.04, respectively.  The low R2-values most likely reflect inhomogeneous distribution of  mineralization  in  the  core,  because  the  two  laboratories  are  in  good  agreement  for results on the same samples; and
- · Actlabs' analytical data for the 2010 and 2011 drilling programs are quite good for most elements,  with  the following  caveats. Arsenic  values  are  likely a bit too high; molybdenum  values,  especially  in  molybdenum-rich  samples,  and  zinc  values  are probably too low.

For the Mineral Resource estimates, the following conclusions are made:

## The North Zone

The North Zone Mineral Resources occur in a zone of variable mineralisation, which has the potential for economic extraction of several elements.  The elements reported for this estimate include Sn, Zn and In.  Values for other  elements are tabulated in this report as they have potential implications for metallurgical purposes but those elements are not considered as part of the current NI 43-101 compliant Mineral Resource estimate and they do not contribute to any of the economic parameters used for the estimate.  The minimum cut-off grade and block size used for the estimate were applied with the assumption that a resource with potential bulk mineable  characteristics  has  been  appropriately  estimated  using  these  parameters.  Mineral Resource estimates are summarised in Tables 65 and 66.

## The Fire Tower Zone

Tungsten-molybdenum deposits in the Fire Tower Zone mainly occur in the lower part of the breccia pipe and the upper part of the underlying fine-grained granite, and to a lesser extent in associated volcanic rocks (Kooiman et al, 2005

Mineralization occurs as veinlets and disseminated grains in breccias mainly located within the  Mount  Pleasant  porphyry.    The  principal  "economic-type"  minerals  are  fine-grained wolframite and molybdenite, along with minor amounts of native bismuth and bismuthinite. The gangue minerals consist of cassiterite, arsenopyrite, löllingite, quartz, topaz and fluorite.

SRK  has  classified  the  Fire  Tower  Mineral  Resource  estimate  as  Indicated  and  Inferred. Summary of the Mineral Resource estimate is presented in Table 67.  The mined out stope areas have been excluded from the resources calculations.

## 26.  RECOMMENDATIONS

Based  upon  the authors' knowledge  of  the Mount  Pleasant Property, the following recommendations are offered.

The  proposed  work  plan  and  budget  for  the  Mount  Pleasant  Property,  excluding  the  Fire Tower Zone, as prepared by the authors in collaboration with ADEX, amounts to $4,000.000. This plan is outlined below and further documented in Table 68:

- · Re-assay  more  historical  drill  core  samples  obtained  by  Mount  Pleasant  Mines  in  the 1960s-70s  because  descriptions  from  drill  logs  and  recorded  Zn  and  Sn  assays  suggest potential for expanding the size of the indium resource in the North Zone.  Focus will be on  re-sampling  and  assaying  of  core  from  the  vicinity  of  the  #1-3  and  #5  Tin  Lode subzones,  where  few  assays  for  In  exist.  Since  2008,  the  re-assaying  of  pulps  and sampling  of  historical  core  has  increased  the  In  coverage  of  the  North  Zone  from approximately 15% to 33%; however within the identified mineralized subzones, the In coverage is approximately 43%.  The assaying of an additional 1,500 samples will raise this coverage to approximately 50% and allow WGM to make a reasonable estimate of the In  content  in  the  remaining  holes  that  are  missing  In  analyses  within  the  mineralized bodies;
- · Re-assay  sample  pulps  that  returned  poor  assay  repeats  at  SGS  or  Actlabs,  i.e.,  those samples  identified  in  Section  12.0  (Data  Corroboration),  at  the  alternate  ISO  certified laboratory to determine which assay results are the most accurate;
- · Additional  re-sampling  and  re-analysis  of  historical  underground  drill  core  and  other sample material  from  Lac  Minerals  Tin  Project  in  the  late  1980s  should  be  undertaken since  the  original  data  are  suspect  because  of  quality  control  issues  at  the  on-site laboratory  facility  used  by  Lac.    Specifically,  focus  should  be  on  those  LNZ  series samples that were not re-analysed during 2008-09 Technical Review;
- · Re-assay selected samples that reported anomalously high Pb, Zn and Cu for their Ag and Au  contents,  which  include  historical  and  2008-11  drill  core  intersections  plus  bulk sample material collected in 2009;
- · Continue  environmental  monitoring  of  Mount  Pleasant  mine  site  and  tailings  pond infrastructure;

- · A 7,500 metre diamond drilling program is recommended to further define the North Zone to the Northeast, East and Southeast towards the Saddle Zone; to delineate the limits of the Saddle Zone and determine its continuity with the Fire Tower Zone; and to test the Mount Pleasant East  area  for  the  presence  of  another  Saddle  Zone  type  intrusion.  This drilling program  is  to  follow  up  on  wide,  high  grade  WO3-MoS2-Bi  intersections encountered during the 2011 drill program, and its main purpose is to increase the amount of WO3-MoS2-Bi resource on the Mount Pleasant Property.  Based upon the results of this technical review it will be necessary to plan a drill spacing of no greater than 30 metres in order to potentially qualify these mineralized bodies as 43-101 Indicated Resources and thus qualify the resources for feasibility study.

- · Open and re-activate the 600 Adit, which drives through the North Zone at approximately 80 metres depth, in order to improve access to the #1-3 and #4 Tin Lode subzones.  The adit  workings  will  serve  as  a  platform  for  underground  drilling  of  the  North  Zone  at &lt;200 metres  depth  and  re-sampling  of  underground  workings  in  order  to    increase understanding of the In distribution in these areas where coverage is historically poor;
- · Conduct  a  pre-feasibility  study  of  the  North  Zone  based  upon  the  results  of  the Preliminary Assessment (Thibault et al. 2010) but with a much larger production scenario in mind. This study would utilize environmental work, market studies, geotechnical and definition drilling, and bench and pilot metallurgical work completed to-date on the North Zone. Note:  The PEA Study is no longer current and should not be relied upon ;
- · Upgrade  ADEX's  GEMCOM  modelling  software  in  order  to  complete  pre-feasibility level  work  and  mine  planning  at  Mount  Pleasant.    Training  of  personnel  to  operate  the program at basic to intermediate levels will be required;
- · Input lithological information from both recent and historical drillholes into the GEMCOM database to better understand the rock associations in the mineralized zones and allow for the better interpretation of their  local  trends.    In  addition,  RQD  and  core recovery data, drill core sample tag numbers, assay certificate numbers, referee samples and other check assays should be added to this database; and
- · Carry out detailed specific gravity measurements of drill core and bulk sample material to validate the historical information and to characterize each zone or rock type accordingly.

The following recommendations are specific to the current Mineral Resource estimates for the North Zone:

- · Assay  unsampled  intervals  for  In  (covered  in  part  by  the  general  recommendations above);
- · Enter    pertinent  litho  data  from  old  and  future  holes  into  the  database  to  aid  in  the subsequent modelling of the mineralized zones;
- · Enter pertinent RQD and core recovery data from old holes (if available) and record and enter pertinent RQD and core recovery data from future holes; and
- · Sample previously un-sampled, archived core intervals for additional elements that may be of interest in holes that might contribute to potential Mineral Resources.

The proposed work plan and budget for the Mount Pleasant Property  Fire Tower  Zone, as prepared by the authors in collaboration with ADEX, amounts to $4,400.000. This  plan  is outlined below and further documented in Table 69:

- · Additional diamond drilling is required to further define the limits of the FTN and FTW sub-zones where the zones currently remain open; and,
- · Quantitative  section  (deep  penetration)  IP  surveying  to  determine  if  the  tungstenmolybdenum mineralization is continuous between the Fire Tower Zone and Saddle Zone, and to explore for deeper mineralization beneath Granite II (explore for stacked porphyry deposits at depth under Mount Pleasant).  Also, to explore for additional mineralization at Hornet Hill.  IP surveying may also be useful in conjunction with the evaluation of nearsurface tin-indium potential.

WGM recommends that ADEX considers carrying out additional exploration programs on the Property  in  the  future.    To  date,  there  has  been  no  significant  effort  to  explore  for  gold mineralization on the Property. Freewest Resources continues to explore for gold mineralization on the Clarence Stream Property 10 km west of Mount Pleasant.  In the shortterm, ADEX should consider cutting an exploration grid and conducting a geological mapping and sampling program on the Property in search of new mineralized targets.

Most of the exploration work has been concentrated on the Fire Tower Zone and North Zone (including the Deep Tin Zone).  ADEX believes that the Granite II is continuous between the Fire  Tower  Zone  and  the  North  Zone  where  limited  drilling  has  taken  place  and  where  a number  of  tin  mineralized  cupolas  may  exist.    Therefore,  additional  exploration  work  to identify drill targets along this trend may be warranted.

ADEX should also consider initiating a base line environmental study of the Property in the near future.

## SUMMARY OF 2010 DIAMOND DRILLHOLES

The following drillhole summaries were prepared by ADEX consulting geologist, Mr. Gustaaf Kooiman.

Hole AM10-01 (North Zone, #4 Lode)

Mine Coordinates:

E 15448.986 N 13875.778

Elev.  1245 m

AM10-01 was drilled vertically, 7.5 m west of AM08-44, to probe the western extension of the #4 lode.  The hole intersected quartz-feldspar porphyry (QFP) from surface to the contact with  feldspar  porphyry  (FP)  at  11.40  m;  FP  from  11.40  -  93.35  m;  granite  and  granite porphyry (GP) from 93.35 - 127.81 m; more FP from 127.81 - 223.5 m, and granite again from 223.5 m to the end of hole at 231 m.

Weak, widespread tin-zinc-indium  mineralization  was  encountered  in  FP  from  132  -177 m assaying 0.11% Sn, 1% Zn and 58 ppm In.

## AM10-02 (west of North Zone)

Mine Coordinates (estimated):

E 14715

N 13500

Elev.  1165 m

Geotechnical  hole  AM10-02  was  drilled  to  investigate  the  thickness  of  overburden  and ground conditions at a potential portal site for a new North Zone decline.  The proposed ramp is  to  be  driven  -16%,  magnetic  east  to  intersect  historical  hole  MPS-227,  which  is  located approximately 723 m east of AM10-02 at E15438.

The track drill augured 6 m of overburden, consisting mostly of sandy ablation till (including some  gravel)  and  a  compact  basal  till  (clay  rich)  from  4.8  -  5.4 m.    Ground  water  was encountered at a depth of 3 m.  Coring started at 6.35 m in broken sedimentary rocks of the Sand Brook Formation.  Core recovery was poor at the start, was approximately 40% at 20 m, and improved to 50% by the end of the hole at 35 m.

The  terrain  around  AM10-02  is  relatively  flat,  the  area  is  relatively  wet  and  the  ground conditions  are  not  particularly  good.    Consequently,  this  site  is  considered  unsuitable  as  a location for a new portal into the North Zone.

## AM10-03 (west of Saddle Zone)

Mine Coordinates: E 15063.423 N 13066.239 Elev.  1191 m

Geotechnical  hole  AM10-03  was  drilled  to  investigate  overburden  thickness  and  ground conditions near another potential portal site for a new North Zone decline.  In this case, the new decline is to be driven northeast to intersect historical hole MPS-227.

The track drill encountered only 3 m of overburden, comprising silt and sand.  Coring began at 3.05 m and continued to the end of hole at 50 m.  Broken sedimentary rocks of the Sand Brook Formation were encountered in the upper part of the hole and core recovery was poor but it improved with depth to 60 % at the end of hole.

The terrain in the vicinity  of AM10-03 is more favourable for a portal site than that in the vicinity  of  AM10-02.    Furthermore,  the  area  is  not  as  wet.    This  site  is  considered  to  be suitable for the new portal and North Zone decline.

## AM10-04 (North Zone, #1 Lode) Mine Coordinates: E 15516.151 N 13741.271 Elev.  1262 m

AM10-04  was  drilled  at  -45°  south  (magnetic)  to  undercut  the  #1  lode  encountered  in historical hole DDH-91  (drilled in 1963  by Mount  Pleasant Mines). AM10-04  is approximately 19 m southeast of hole E-9 (drilled in 1985 by Billiton).  The hole intersected highly  altered  and  brecciated  feldspar  porphyry  (FP)  that  is  intruded  by  narrow  dikes  of granite porphyry (GP).  The hole bottomed at 91 m.

Tin-zinc-indium  mineralization  was  intersected  from  40  -  67  m,  assaying  0.44% Sn, 1.61% Zn and 63 ppm In over the 27 m.  This intersection is 26 - 47 m vertical depth from surface and correlates well with the shallower intersection (10 - 25 m vertical depth) in hole DDH-91.  This 27 m intersection contains a core, from 52 - 58 m, that assayed 3.03% Zn and 128 ppm In.  Within this 6 m interval, sphalerite is abundant in the matrix of brecciated FP and as banded masses filling late cavities.

## AM10-05 (North Zone, #1 Lode)

Mine Coordinates: E 15551.477 N 13730.241 Elev.  1261 m

AM11-05 was drilled at  -50°  south  (magnetic)  to  undercut  the  #1  lode  beneath  the  quarry where this lode was bulk sampled in 1963.  This hole, similar to AM10-04, was entirely in altered  and  brecciated  feldspar  porphyry  (FP)  that  is  intruded  by  narrow  dikes  of  granite porphyry (GP).  The hole bottomed at 52 m.

Low grade, tin-zinc-indium mineralization was intersected in AM10-05 over a 36 m interval, from 13 - 49 m, which assayed 0.21% Sn, 1.81% Zn and 35 ppm In.  This intersection occurs at 11  to  42 m  vertical  depth,  and  correlates  with  a  19 m  wide  interval  of  low  grade mineralization  in  Trench  4  (2010),  which  assayed  0.20% Sn,  0.45% Zn  and  21 ppm  In. Trench 4 starts 9 m south of the collar of AM10-05, and the mineralized zone is 19 - 38 m south of the collar.

## AM10-06 (North Zone, #1 Lode) Mine Coordinates: E 15567.652 N 13752.944 Elev.  1267 m

AM10-06 was also drilled in the quarry area of the #1 lode.  The hole was drilled at  -41° south  (magnetic)  to  probe  the  down-dip  continuation  of  good  tin  mineralization  found  in Trench 3, dug in October 2010.  This trench started 27 m south of the collar of AM10-06 and encountered  a  15 m  wide  zone,  starting  at  the  beginning  of  the  trench,  which  assayed 0.47% Sn, 0.79% Zn and 31 ppm In.  The hole bottomed at 72 m.

Hole AM10-06 intersected a 3 m interval, from  51 - 54 m, assaying 0.15% Sn, 0.47% Zn, 0.46% Cu and 159 ppm In.  This interval starts at a vertical depth of 35 m below surface.

## AM10-07 (North Zone, North Adit Subzone or 'zone') Mine Coordinates: E 15346.921 N 13850.604 Elev.  1239 m

AM10-07  was  collared  approximately  25 m  east  of  hole  AM08-01  to  further  investigate mineralization previously encountered in the North Zone Adit.  The hole mostly intersected feldspar porphyry (FP), with granite sections from 141 - 164.85 m and 186 - 194.68 m.  The hole bottomed at 207 m.

Tin mineralization is limited to a 6 m interval, from 117 - 123 m within FP, which assayed 0.97% Sn and 1.91% As.  Cassiterite occurs as fine grained aggregates in pale brown fluoritearsenopyrite  veins;  it  also  occurs  within  feldspar  pseudomorphs,  as  disseminations  and clusters.

Two intervals of W-Mo-Bi mineralization, mostly within stockwork veins, occur from 129 147 m and 189 - 207 m.  These two 18 m intervals assayed 0.32% WO3, 0.15% MoS2 and 0.1% Bi, and 0.31% WO3, 0.19% MoS2 and 0.05% Bi, respectively.  They constitute part of the 'Y body' W-Mo-Bi mineralization in the western part of the North Zone (Brunswick Tin Mines 1976).

## AM10-08 (North Zone, #1 Lode) Mine Coordinates: E 15629.019 N 13764.654 Elev.  1269 m

AM10-08 was drilled -50° south (magnetic) to undercut two mineralized zones encountered in hole DDH-166, drilled -42.5° south in 1964.  This historical hole intersected one 6 m interval, from 9 - 15 m, assaying 0.27% Sn, 3.87% Zn, 0.20% Cu and 168 ppm In, and a second 9.2 m interval, from 79.2 - 88.4 m, assaying 0.29% Sn, 2.97% Zn, 0.26% Cu and 372 ppm In.  Hole AM10-08 bottomed at 108 m.

Hole AM10-08 intersected both mineralized intervals, which are hosted by brecciated feldspar porphyry  (FP)  wall rock and  a granite porphyry  (GP)  dike, i.e. typical lode-style mineralization.    An  upper  3 m  interval,  from  9  -  12  m,  yielded  0.12% Sn,  3.46% Zn, 0.10% Cu and 215 ppm In, and a lower 6 m interval, from 96 - 102 m, yielded 0.24% Sn, 0.89% Zn,  0.12% Cu  and  118 ppm  In.    The  lower  interval  occurs  approximately  20 m vertically below the intercept in hole DDH-166.

## AM10-09 (North Zone, #3 Lode) Mine Coordinates: E 15634.914 N 13671.959 Elev.  1276 m

AM10-09 was drilled at -67° south (magnetic) to intersect  #3  lode  mineralization  that  was encountered  in  underground  hole  U-111  and  surface  hole  DDH-60.    This  hole  intersected feldspar  porphyry  (FP)  that  is  cut  by  granite  porphyry  (GP)  dikes  and  plugs  from  25.61  70.83 m, 108.39 - 124.08 m, 127.75 - 128 m, and 134.40 - 135.42 m.  End of hole was at 141 m.  No significant mineralization was encountered in hole AM10-09.

## AM10-10 (North Zone, northeast) Mine Coordinates: E 15695.281 N 13565.161 Elev.  1284 m

AM10-10 was collared at the site of historical hole MPS-112 in the northeast part of the North Zone.  It was drilled at -60° toward 260° (magnetic), the same azimuth as MPS-112 that was drilled  at  -45°.    Hole  MPS-112  intersected  a  57.91 m  interval,  from  45.72  -  103.63  m, assaying  0.07% Sn,  2.81% Zn  and  0.09% Cu.    No  indium  assays  are  available  for  this intercept.

Hole AM10-10 encountered feldspar porphyry (FP) from surface to 64.67 m, granite porphyry (GP) from 64.67 - 149.05 m, and siliceous granite from 149.05 m to the end of hole at 160 m. A 4 m, massive sulphide interval, from 110 - 114 m, within chloritized GP assayed 4.67% Sn, 14.5% Zn,  0.56% Cu,  and  984 ppm  In.    This  intersection  also  yielded  0.83% Bi  and 5.28% As.

## AM10-11 (North Zone, North Adit Subzone or 'zone') Mine Coordinates: E 15333.832 N 13814.098 Elev.  1238 m

AM10-11  was  collared approximately 35 m SSW  of  AM10-07  to further delineate mineralization previously encountered in the North Zone Adit.  This vertical hole started in feldspar porphyry (FP) and entered granite at 75.8 m and stayed in granite to the end of hole at 210 m.

AM10-11 intersected a 21 m interval, from 138 - 159 m, assaying 0.35% Sn.  Cassiterite in this intercept is associated with arsenopyrite and some fluorite.  The mineralization occurs in granite  adjacent  to  granite  porphyry  (GP)  dikes  with  unidirectional  solidification  textures (USTs).

<!-- image -->

## AM10-12 (North Zone, #1 Lode) Mine Coordinates: E 15614.593 N 13707.015 Elev.  1272 m

AM10-12 was drilled  vertically  to  further  investigate  widespread  tin-copper  mineralization near the 101-East Drift, which is off the 600 Adit.  Underground holes U-24, U-84 and U-87 also intersected this mineralization.

Hole AM10-12 was collared in feldspar porphyry (FP) and stayed in FP to the end of hole at 90 m.  The bottom 23 m (67 - 90 m) assayed 0.52% Sn, 0.35% Zn, 0.21% Cu and 62 ppm In. This intercept is within brecciated (angular fragments) and siliceous FP.  Cassiterite, some of it colloform, occurs in stockwork veins cutting FP or as disseminations in FP and is associated with sphalerite, chalcopyrite and arsenopyrite.

## AM10-13 (North Zone, North Adit Subzone or 'zone') Mine Coordinates: E 15286.865 N 13825.971  Elev.  1235 m

AM10-13  was  collared  approximately  30 m  southwest  of  hole  E-12  (drilled  in  1985  by Billiton) to further delineate mineralization in the North Zone Adit area.  This vertical hole collared in feldspar porphyry (FP) and entered granite at 123.34 m and stayed in granite to the end of hole at 210 m.  The FP/granite contact dips at 40° with respect to the core axis.

Tin  mineralization  occurs  in  veins  within  granite  from  135  -  162 m.    This  27 m  interval assayed 0.79% Sn, 0.19% Zn, 0.23% Cu, and 50 ppm In.  The veins are steeply dipping and contain  purple  fluorite,  abundant  arsenopyrite,  and  coarse  grained  cassiterite.    One  3 m intercept, from 141 - 144 m, within this interval assayed 0.39% Bi.

The vein mineralization in AM10-13 is similar to two intersections in historical hole E-12. The  first  5.19 m  intercept,  from  222.50  -  227.69  m,  assayed  3.88% Sn,  0.19% Cu  and 0.69% As.    The  second  9.14 m  intercept,  from  310.90  -  320.04  m,  assayed  1.10% Sn  and 1.71% As.

## AM10-14 (North Zone, #1 Lode) Mine Coordinates: E 15614.354 N 13722.960 Elev.  1272 m

AM10-14 was collared approximately 16 m north of hole AM10-12 in the quarry area of the #1 lode.  This hole was drilled at -75° south (magnetic); it intersected the 101-East Drift (off the 600 Adit) at 88.5 m and ended there.  Hole AM10-14 encountered chloritic, silicified and sericitized feldspar porphyry (FP) that is cut by a granite porphyry (GP) dike, from 49.32 53.45 m.

Significant tin mineralization was intersected from 75 - 88.5 m; this 13.5 m intercept assayed 0.76% Sn.  Within this intercept, sphalerite, galena and chalcopyrite are distributed erratically and  some  cassiterite  was  observed.    Some  of  the  tin  mineralization  may  be  contained  in stannite, rather than cassiterite.

Hole AM10-14 undercut Trench 1 (2010) that started near the collar of this hole and extended south  towards,  and  past,  the  collar  of  AM10-12.    A  2 m  interval  within  the  trench,  from approximately  0  -  2 m  south  of  the  collar  of  AM10-14,  yielded  0.34% Sn,  0.63% Zn, 0.12% Cu, and 162 ppm In.

## AM10-15 (North Zone, North Adit Subzone or 'zone') Mine Coordinates: E 15274.599 N 13875.810 Elev.  1232 m

AM10-15  was  collared  25 m  west  of  AM08-27  and  drilled  vertically  to  further  delineate mineralization in the North Zone Adit area.  It intersected feldspar porphyry (FP) from surface to 136.4 m; quartz-feldspar porphyry (QFP) from 136.4 - 196.95 m; and sedimentary breccia (Bx) from 196.95 m to the end of hole at 202 m.

One 9 m interval in hole AM10-15, from 69 - 78 m, assayed 0.27% Sn.  The mineralization consists of disseminated cassiterite in siliceous FP.

AM10-16 (North Zone, Deep Tin Subzone or 'zone') Mine Coordinates: E 15573.126 N 13593.244 Elev.  1260 m

AM10-16 was drilled vertically to help delineate the Deep Tin Subzone.  The hole collared in highly altered granite and stayed in granite to the end of hole at 118 m, where the hole was abandoned because of bad ground that started at 112 m.

The  only  significant  mineralization  in  AM10-16  is  near  the  end  of  the  hole,  from  112  118 m.    This  6 m  interval  assayed  0.44% Sn,  6.5% Zn,  0.4% Cu,  and  753 ppm.    The  core recovery in this interval was approximately 40%.

## AM10-17 (North Zone, North Adit Subzone or 'zone') Mine Coordinates: E 15303.061 N 13909.210 Elev.  1235 m

AM10-17 was collared approximately 31 m north of hole AM08-27 and drilled vertically to further delineate mineralization in the Adit subzone.  The hole intersected feldspar porphyry (FP) from surface to 193.15 m and quartz-feldspar porphyry (QFP) to the end of the hole at 230 m.

The  only  significant  mineralization  in  hole  AM10-17  occurs  near  the  FP/QFP  contact  in  a chlorite-fluorite replacement. This replacement  contains abundant  arsenopyrite, some sphalerite  and  fine  grained  cassiterite  aggregates.    Some  mineralization  extends  from  the replacement into the adjacent FP.  One 3 m interval, from 192 - 195 m, assayed 0.94% Sn, 0.68% Zn, 7.06% As, and 63 ppm In.

## AM10-18 (North Zone, Deep Tin Subzone or 'zone') Mine Coordinates: E 15543.164 N 13528.680 Elev.  1255 m

AM10-18 was collared approximately 52 m southwest of AM10-16 and drilled vertically to help delineate the Deep Tin subzone.  This hole intersected variably altered granite, ranging from sericitized and chloritized to highly silicified and brecciated, from surface to the end of hole at 250 m.

Tin mineralization was intersected in hole AM10-18 from 202 - 208 m.  This 6 m interval assayed 1.74% Sn, 7.01% Zn, 0.21% Cu, and 520 ppm In.  The mineralization is hosted by chloritic and brecciated granite that is cut by stockwork veins and replacement patches that contain  fine  grained,  locally  colloform,  cassiterite.    Some  of  the  veins  are  dominantly composed  of  chlorite and cassiterite; others are sulphide-fluorite rich with abundant sphalerite, and minor chalcopyrite, arsenopyrite, and fine-grained bismuth minerals.

Significant W-Mo-Bi mineralization was encountered at the bottom of hole AM10-18, which is part of the 'Y body' of Brunswick Tin Mines (1976).  The last 6 m of this hole, from 244 250  m,  assayed  0.31% WO3,  0.08% MoS2  and  0.17% Bi.    This  mineralization  occurs  in chlorite-brown-fluorite-  bearing  veins,  pods  and  disseminations  in  the  matrix  of  brecciated granite.

## AM10-19 (North Zone, North Adit Subzone or 'zone') Mine Coordinates: E 15324.628 N 13907.429 Elev.  1236 m

AM10-19  was  collared  approximately  22 m  east  of  AM10-17  and  drilled  vertically  as  a 'delineation hole' for the North Adit Subzone.  It was the sixth and last hole to be drilled in this area during the 2010 program.  Hole AM10-19 intersected feldspar porphyry (FP) from surface  to  196.67 m  and  quartz-feldspar  porphyry  (QFP)  from  there  to  the  end  of  hole  at 200 m.  A granite porphyry (GP) dike cuts FP from 46.93 - 56.20 m.

The only mineralization in AM10-19 occurs in an interval from 57 - 63 m.  This 6 m intercept assayed 0.26% Sn, 3.58% Zn, 0.29% Cu, and 205 ppm In.  This mineralization is situated in the footwall of the GP dike, within quartz-purple fluorite-chlorite replacements and massive sulphide pods containing minor arsenopyrite and pale brown, fine grained cassiterite.

AM10-20 (North Zone, Deep Tin Subzone or 'zone') Mine Coordinates: E 15460.305 N 13470.735 Elev.  1245 m

AM10-20 was collared approximately 16 m west of AM08-03 and drilled vertically to test the continuity of the best zinc-indium mineralization found (in the latter hole) during the 2008 drill  program.  Hole  AM10-20 collared in altered granite and stayed in altered, and locally brecciated, granite to the end of hole at 200 m.

| 183 - 189      |            6 |  0.26 | 10.52 |  0.91 |     1856 |

The  best  intersection  in  the  hole,  the  6 m  intercept  from  183  -  189  m,  is  within  siliceous granite that is cut by stockwork veins and replacements, containing chlorite, purple fluorite, sphalerite  (locally  massive  in  short  sections),  and  minor  chalcopyrite.    There  is  also  some brecciated  granite  that  contains  disseminated  mineralization.    Weakly  altered,  stockwork veined, yellowish to pinkish grey granite occurs in both the hanging wall and footwall of this intercept.

## AM10-21 (North Zone, Deep Tin Subzone or 'zone') Mine Coordinates: E 15477.084 N 13485.607 Elev.  1246 m

AM10-21 was collared approximately 15 m north of AM08-03 and drilled vertically to further test the continuity of the zinc-indium mineralization in the latter hole.  Hole AM10-21 also collared in altered granite and stayed in it to the end of hole at 225 m.

The best intersections in AM10-21 are as follow:

| Interval (m)   |   Length (m) |   Sn% |   Zn% |   Cu% |   In ppm |
|----------------|--------------|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 69 - 129       |           60 |  0.13 |  2.94 |  0.09 |      131 |

## AM10-22 (North Zone, #1 Lode) Mine Coordinates: E 15442.468 N 13769.634 Elev.  1251 m

AM10-22 was drilled at -60° south (magnetic) to a depth of 65 m to undercut historical hole DDH-156 at -44° south.  The latter hole had a near-surface, 10 m intercept grading 0.26% Sn and 3.69% Zn.  No indium values are available for DDH-156.  AM10-22 intersected typical lode-style tin mineralization near the bottom of the hole, where a granite porphyry (GP) dike cuts brecciated and silicified feldspar porphyry (FP).

A 5 m interval, from 60 - 65 m, assayed 0.17% Sn, 2.12% Zn, 0.31% Cu, and 235 ppm In. This  mineralization  is  in  the  GP  dike  and  adjacent  FP,  where  it  occurs  as  disseminated sphalerite, as replacements of purple fluorite and kaolin containing assemblages of sphalerite, arsenopyrite and pyrite, and as aggregates of fine grained arsenopyrite and sphalerite.

## AM10-23 (North Zone, #1 Lode) Mine Coordinates: E 15461.478 N 13779.470 Elev.  1265 m

AM10-23 was drilled at -55° south (magnetic) to a depth of 90.2 m to undercut historical hole DDH-91 at -45° south.  The latter hole intersected widespread tin-zinc mineralization at 34 58 m (vertical) below surface.  AM10-23 collared in and ended in feldspar porphyry (FP).  A few thin granite porphyry (GP) dikes cut the FP.

Hole AM10-23 intersected mineralization similar to that in DDH-91.  An 18 m interval, from 50 - 68 m, assayed 0.16% Sn, 1.65% Zn, 0.12% Cu, and 280 ppm In.  A check-assay (SGS) of the  same  interval  yielded  0.19% Sn,  1.52% Zn,  0.13% Cu,  and  274 ppm  In.    This mineralization is within GP and adjacent FP wall rocks, both of which are brecciated, and it consists  of  disseminated  sphalerite  in  the  breccia  matrix,  associated  with  arsenopyrite, fluorite, pyrite, and minor chalcopyrite.  The same mineral assemblage also occurs as small replacements.    This  interval  correlates  with,  and  is  comparable  in  thickness  to,  the  one  in DDH-91 indicating an approximate dip of 60° to the north for the zone and a true width of approximately 18 m.

## AM10-24 (North Zone, #1 Lode)

Mine Coordinates:

E 15496.360 N 13660.737 Elev.  1259 m

AM10-24 was drilled at -45° north (magnetic) to a depth of 70.4 m to undercut historical hole DDH-72 (Mount Pleasant Mines 1963).  The latter hole, drilled in at -30° north, intersected 20 m of tin-zinc mineralization at approximately 25 m (vertical) below surface.  Hole AM1024 encountered feldspar porphyry (FP) cut by two granite porphyry (GP) dikes, from 23.9 32.5 m and 42.16 - 44.7 m.

Disseminated sphalerite mineralization was intersected over a 9 m interval in hole AM10-24. This  interval,  from  60  -  69  m,  is  within  brecciated  and  silicified  FP;  it  assayed  0.22% Sn, 2.92% Zn and 104 ppm In.  This interval correlates with the shallower intersection in DDH72, indicating a steep dip for the zone.

## AM10-25 (North Zone, northeast)

Mine Coordinates: E 15674.439 N 13562.926 Elev.  1281 m

AM10-25 was collared  approximately  20 m  west  of  AM10-10  in  the  northeast  part  of  the North Zone, and drilled at -45° towards 260° (magnetic) to a depth of 120 m.  It was drilled to duplicate a significant intersection reported in historical hole MPS-112, also drilled at -45° towards 260°.  Hole AM10-25 encountered feldspar porphyry (FP) to 40 m, and then granite from there to the end of the hole.

The only significant mineralization in AM10-25 is near the granite contact.  A 3 m interval, from 66 -69 m, assayed 0.32% Sn,  15.3% Zn,  0.27% Cu,  and  291 ppm In. The mineralization occurs in veins, veinlets and replacements containing reddish brown sphalerite, purple  fluorite,  and  minor  amounts  of  arsenopyrite,  chalcopyrite  and  pyrite.

correlates with an intercept of similar apparent thickness in hole AM10-10 and with a much wider intercept in MPS-112.

## AM10-26 (west of North Zone) Mine Coordinates: E 15222.668 N 13251.651 Elev.  1210 m

AM10-26 was drilled vertically in the path of a proposed new decline into the North Zone, to investigate ground conditions and to determine if any mineralization occurs in this area.  The hole was collared approximately 330 m southwest of target hole MPS-227, located at the end of the proposed new decline.  Hole AM10-26 intersected feldspar porphyry (FP) from surface to 34.16 m; quartz-feldspar porphyry (QFP) from 34.16 - 66.0 m; sedimentary breccia (Bx) from 66.0 - 123.53 m and then more QFP to the end of the hole at 200 m.

Minor mineralization was encountered in hole AM10-26 but no assays are available.  A few fluorite veins containing some galena, chalcopyrite, pyrite, arsenopyrite, and sphalerite were observed.  Some W-Mo mineralization occurs in the last 11 m of the hole, from 189 - 200 m. This mineralization is in veins and veinlets within chloritized and sericitized QFP.

## SUMMARY OF 2011 DIAMOND DRILLHOLES

The following drillhole summaries were prepared by ADEX consulting geologist, Mr. Gustaaf Kooiman.

## AM11-01 (North Zone)

Mine Coordinates:

E 15554.883 N 13575.548 Elev.  1264 m

AM11-01 was drilled 5 m ENE of AM96-10 to obtain samples for future metallurgical testwork. The 1996 hole intersected widespread tin-zinc-indium mineralization grading 0.30% Sn,  1.16% Zn  and  175 ppm  In  over  106.68  m,  from  143.26  -  249.94 m.    Similar mineralization  was  intersected  in  hole  AM11-01  but  it  is  of  lower  grade  at  0.23% Sn, 0.59% Zn and 107 ppm In over 75 m, from 162 - 237 m.

Tin  mineralization  is  mostly  in  sulphides  that  occur  in  narrow  veins,  veinlets,  replacement zones,  and  as  disseminations  in  silicified  granite.    Minor  coarse-grained  cassiterite  (up  to 4 mm) was observed in fluorite-filled vugs.

## AM11-02 (North Zone)

Mine Coordinates:

E 15647.406 N 13456.215 Elev.  1281 m

AM11-02 was drilled 48.4 m east of hole E-16 (Billiton, 1985), to explore the southern part of the North Zone.  This hole encountered granite porphyry (GP) and granite II (G2) to a depth of  200  m;  sedimentary  breccia  (Bx)  from  200.4  -  271.25  m;  and  quartz-feldspar  porphyry (QFP) from 271.25 m to the contact with granite III (G3) at 397.75 m.  The hole continued in this granite until the end-of-hole at 426 m.

The best mineralization in AM11-02 was found from 351 -357 m.  This 6 m interval assayed 1.73% Sn,  0.24% Cu  and  38 ppm  In.    Abundant  fine-grained  cassiterite  occurs  in  greenish black chlorite-fluorite-garnet filled, stockwork-veins associated with chalcopyrite.

## AM11-03 (Saddle Zone)

Mine Coordinates: E 15849.368 N 12988.047 Elev.  1302 m

AM11-03 intersected quartz-feldspar porphyry (QFP) from surface to the contact with granite II (GR2)  at  396.43 m.    The  QFP/granite  contact  is  sub-horizontal  with  unidirectional solidification  textures  (USTs)  immediately  below  the  contact.    Minor  cassiterite,  including some wood tin at  406 m,  occurs  in  the  top  10 m  of  the  granite.    A  granite/granite  contact (possibly GR2a/GR2b) was noted at 537.37 m.  The hole bottomed at 540 m.

Most of the mineralization is up-hole from the granite in silicified and chloritized QFP.  A 6 m  interval,  from  159  -  165  m,  assayed  0.31% Sn,  1.82% Zn  and  171 ppm  In  and  a  3 m interval, from 222 -225 m, yielded 0.36% Sn, 19% Zn and 354 ppm In.  One 12 m interval, from 294 -306 m, assayed 0.13% Sn, 3.65% Zn and 191 ppm In; another 12 m interval, from 345 - 357 m, yielded 0.68% Sn, 0.27% Zn and 31 ppm In.

## AM11-04 (North Zone)

## Mine Coordinates: E 15600.030 N 13407.602 Elev.  1270 m

AM11-04, collared approximately 44 m south of Billiton hole E-16, was drilled to look for a southern extension to the known mineralization.  The hole intersected feldspar porphyry (FP) from surface to 87.90 m; quartz-feldspar porphyry (QFP) from 87.90 - 176.80 m; sedimentary breccia (Bx) from 176.80 - 220.40 m; granite from 220.40 - 240.95 m; another QFP from 240.95 - 340.45 m; granite II  (GR2) from 340,45 - 397.30 m, and granite III (GR3) from 397.30 to the end of hole at 402 m.

Historical hole E-16 intersected a 36.6 m zone, from 350.5 - 387.1 m, of granite-hosted WMo-Bi  mineralization, which  assayed  0.44% WO3  and  0.17% MoS2.    Hole  AM11-04 intersected similar mineralization, from 342 - 372 m, grading 0.47% WO3, 0.28% MoS2 and 0.21% Bi.  This zone is characterized by coarse-grained wolframite (up to 4.5 cm), in steeply dipping  veins,  and  a  moderate  arsenopyrite  content  (0.55% As).    At  shallower  depth,  from 114  -  132  m,  an  18 m  wide  Sn-As  zone  was  intersected,  which  assayed  0.78% Sn  and 6.5% As.  Several 3 m intercepts were also encountered, with the best interval, from 270 273 m, grading 2.0% Sn.

## AM11-05 (North Zone)

Mine Coordinates: E 15648.779 N 13506.370 Elev.  1279 m

AM11-05 was collared approximately 50 m north of hole AM11-02.  Granite porphyry (GP)/ granite II (GR 2) was intersected from surface to 192.40 m; quartz-feldspar porphyry (QFP), from 192.40 - 206.95 m; sedimentary breccia (Bx) from 206.95 - 255.10 m; and  QFP from 255.10 m to the end of hole at 404 m.

The only significant mineralization in the hole was a 3 m massive sulphide zone, from 53 -56 m, which assayed 1.17% Sn, 10.4% Zn, 1.41% Cu, and 505 ppm In.

## AM11-06 (North Zone)

Mine Coordinates: E 15697.270 N 13452.498 Elev.  1287 m

AM11-06 was collared 50 m east of AM11-02 and approximately 100 m east of hole E-16.  It is  the  most  eastern  hole  drilled  to  date  in  the  southern  part  of  the  North  Zone.    This  hole intersected feldspar porphyry (FP) from surface to 67.55 m; granite porphyry (GP) and granite from 67.55 - 116.80 m; quartz-feldspar porphyry (QFP) from 116.8 - 203.20 m; sedimentary breccia  (Bx)  from  203.20  -  244.95  m;  more  QFP  from  244.95  -  371.20  m;  and  chloritic granite from371.20 m to the end of hole at 426 m.

No significant mineralization was encountered in hole AM11-06.

## AM11-07 (Saddle Zone)

Mine Coordinates: E 15749.880 N 13000.759 Elev.  1292 m

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

AM11-07 was collared 50 m west of discovery hole LNZ-15 (1988), approximately half way between LNZ-15 and LNZ-17.  This hole intersected quartz-feldspar porphyry (QFP) from surface  to  289  m,  where  a  brecciated  and  silicified  contact  with  granite  was  observed.    A granite/granite contact (possibly 2a/2b) at 473.95 m is marked by 'feathery' feldspar layers and  well  developed  unidirectional  solidification  textures  (USTs)  in  the  rock  just  below  the contact.  The rock immediately up-hole from the contact has a pinkish orange colour due to feldspathic alteration.  The hole bottomed at 513.5 m in granite (GR2b).

Significant  tin  mineralization  was  intersected  in  silicified  granite  immediately  below  the QFP/GR2a contact.  A 33 m interval, from 290 - 323 m, assayed 0.34% Sn and 1.35% As, including an upper 18 m interval (from 290 - 308 m) that yielded 0.47% Sn and 1.18% As. The cassiterite in this interval is fine grained, pale coloured, and associated with arsenopyrite. A  second  interval  was  intersected  deeper  in  the  hole,  from  371  -  383  m,  which  assayed 0.8% Sn over 12 m and 1.24% Sn over the upper 6 m.  The fine  grained cassiterite in this interval is hosted by steeply dipping fluorite-chlorite veins that also contain minor arsenopyrite, sphalerite and chalcopyrite.

Up-hole from the QFP/GR2a contact, low-grade zinc mineralization is widespread.  A 129 m interval, from 158 - 287 m, assayed 0.57% Zn and 28 ppm In.  Both zinc and indium values drop off rapidly below this contact.

## AM11-08 (Saddle Zone)

Mine Coordinates: E 15799.705 N 12947.163 Elev.  1300 m

AM11-08 was collared approximately 50 m south of hole LNZ-15 (1988) and approximately 50 m north of hole NMR-89-1 (drilled by NovaGold).  It intersected quartz-feldspar porphyry (QFP) from surface to 251.82 m, where granite was encountered.  The contact dips at a 60° angle indicating that the hole entered the apical part of the granite cupola in the Saddle Zone. A granite/granite contact (possibly 2a/2b) was encountered at 473 m and the hole bottomed at 500 m.

A wide interval of bismuth-arsenopyrite mineralization was intersected near the QFP/granite contact, from 233 - 260 m.  This 27 m interval assayed 0.19% Bi and 1.25% As.  Also, two sphalerite-rich intervals were encountered within the granite; one from 272 - 275 m and the second from 353 - 362 m.  The first 3 m interval assayed 0.44% Sn, 3.27% Zn and 132 ppm In, whereas the second 9 m interval yielded 0.36% Sn, 1.09% Zn and 231 ppm In.

## AM11-09 (North Zone) Mine Coordinates: E 15551.498 N 13401.293 Elev.  1254 m

AM11-09 was  collared  46.5 m  south  of  hole  AM08-06;  it  is  one  of  the  deepest  and  most southerly holes in the North Zone.  This hole intersected feldspar porphyry (FP) from surface to  85.64  m;  quartz-feldspar  porphyry  (QFP)  that  is  cut  by  thin  granite  dikes,  from  85.64  175.15 m, sedimentary breccia (Bx), from 175.15 - 195.85 m; more QFP, from 195.85 - 315 m; chloritized and silicified granite (GR2), from 315.0 - 386.44 m; and relatively unaltered granite (GR3), from 386.44 m to the end of hole at 414 m.

<!-- image -->

Molybdenite mineralization, from 171 - 204 m, occurs in Bx and QFP.  This 33 m interval assayed 0.21% MoS2 but other metal values are low, i.e.  0.08% As, 0.47% Zn and negligible amounts of tin and tungsten.

Both  tin  and  tungsten  mineralization  are  restricted  to  narrow  intervals.    The  best  tin intersection,  from  204  -  207 m  in  QFP,  assayed  0.18% Sn,  10.1% Zn,  0.29% Cu,  and 694 ppm  In.    The  best  tungsten  intersection,  from  357  -  360 m  in  granite,  assayed 0.25% WO3,  0.22% MoS2  and  0.15% Bi.    The  latter  intersection  probably  correlates  with wider W-Mo-Bi intersections in holes E-16 and AM11-04, which are farther east of AM11-09 and also hosted by granite.

## AM11-10 (North Zone)

Mine Coordinates: E 15482.218 N 13464.536 Elev.  1246 m

AM11-10, drilled to obtain samples for metallurgical test work, was collared approximately 6 m south of historical hole MPS-195 and 7 m southwest of AM08-03, drilled in 1973 and 2008, respectively.  This hole intersected fine-grained granite at surface and stayed in granite until it bottomed at 377 m.  Granite porphyry (GP) dikes cut fine grained granite in the upper part of the hole and a diffuse or gradational granite/granite contact (GR2a/2b) occurs around 372.20 m.  The contact is not sharp because GR2b appears to have partially assimilated GR2a.

The two historical holes intersected high grade tin mineralization in the Deep Tin Zone and AM11-10  also  intersected  extensive  tin-zinc-indium  mineralization.    The  mineralization  is mostly  in  sulphide-rich,  magmatic-hydrothermal  breccia,  massive  sulphide  replacement zones, and veins.  Sphalerite, arsenopyrite and chalcopyrite are the main sulphide minerals, with  fluorite  and  chlorite  as  the  principal  gangue  minerals.    The  best  intercepts,  based  on visual examination, are as follow: 17 - 20 m, 32 - 38 m, 56 - 59 m, 83 - 86 m, 140 - 143 m, 164 -167 m, 179 - 182 m, and 221 -230 m.  The core has not been split or assayed yet.

## AM11-11 (North Zone)

Mine Coordinates: E 15482.116 N 13465.899 Elev.  1246 m

AM11-11  was collared 1.4 m north of AM11-10  to obtain additional material for metallurgical test work.  This hole bottomed at 75 m and is entirely in brecciated and silicified granites.

AM11-11  intersected  a  few  narrow  intervals  with  tin-bearing,  sulphide-rich  breccia  and replacements.  Based on visual inspection, the best intervals are as follow:  12 -15 m, 18 -21 m, 36 - 39 m, and 72 -75 m.  The core has not been split or assayed yet.

<!-- image -->

## AM11-12 (North Zone) Mine Coordinates: E 15435.308 N 13557.825 Elev.  1246 m

AM11-12 was collared  half  way  between  historical  hole  MPS-189  and  its  twin  AM08-35. The  latter  two  holes,  which  are  approximately  5 m  apart,  intersected  some  of  the  best  tin mineralization  (Deep  Tin  Zone)  on  the  property.    Hole  AM11-12  only  intersected  granite, mostly  brecciated,  silicified  and  chloritized  fine  grained  granite  that  is  intruded  by  granite porphyry bodies from 19 - 54 m and 156 - 178 m.

Tin  mineralization  is  invariably  associated  with  massive  sulphide  veins  and  replacements, consisting mostly of sphalerite, arsenopyrite and minor chalcopyrite.  Fluorite and chlorite are the most common gangue minerals.  The best intercepts, based on visual inspection, are as follow: 122 -137 m, 179 - 182 m, 212 - 215 m, 236 - 239 m, and 263 - 269 m.  The core has not been split or assayed yet.

## AM11-13 (Saddle Zone)

Mine Coordinates: E 15800.723 N 13048.131  Elev.  1301 m

AM11-13  was  collared  approximately  51 m  north  of  hole  LNZ-15.    It  intersected  quartzfeldspar porphyry (QFP) from surface to 293.52 m, where granite was encountered.  The hole bottomed in granite at 491 m.  Unidirectional solidification textures (USTs) are abundant in the top 12 m of granite; they are mostly at a very low angle to the core axis, indicating a very steeply dipping granite contact.

The best tin mineralization in the hole is in granite, from 296 - 317 m.  This 21 m interval assayed 0.36% Sn.  However, a second narrow intercept occurs in QFP, from 125 - 128 m. This intercept assayed 0.34% Sn, 1.36% Zn, 0.36% Cu, and 251 ppm In.

## AM11-14 (North Zone)

Mine Coordinates: E 15574.367 N 13598.356 Elev.  1271 m

AM11-14 was collared approximately 5 m north of abandoned hole AM08-16 that ended at 118 m due to bad ground conditions.  This hole also encountered bad ground at 106 m and drilling was suspended until the end of the 2011 drilling program.  At that time, the hole was re-entered and successfully completed to a depth of 405 m as AM11-14 Ext.  The hole mostly intersected  highly  altered  granite  and  granite  porphyry  (GP)  dikes,  but  one  interval,  from 277.75 - 320.54 m, of sedimentary breccia (Bx) was also encountered.

Both tin and tungsten mineralization occur in AM11-14.  A sulphide-rich replacement zone, from 189 -192 m, assayed 0.59% Sn, 6.32% Zn, 0.35% Cu, and 1480 ppm In.  A W-Mo-Bi bearing  porphyry  zone  (the  tungsten  zone)  was  intersected  from  234  -  309 m.    This  75 m interval assayed 0.19% WO3, 0.33% MoS2, 0.21% Bi, and 0.83% As.  Two tin-bearing zones are superimposed on this W-Mo-Bi zone, one in granite from 234 -246 m and the other in Bx from 267 - 279 m.  These 12 m intercepts assayed 0.58% Sn and 0.90% Sn, respectively.

<!-- image -->

## AM11-15 (North Zone) Mine Coordinates: E 15653.398 N 13548.574 Elev.  1279 m

AM11-15 was collared 42 m north of AM11-05 and approximately 26 m south of historical hole MPS-160 (drilled in 1971 and deepened in 1972), in the eastern part of the North Zone. It intersected feldspar porphyry (FP) from surface to 38.60 m; granite and granite porphyry, from  38.60  176.10  m;  quartz-feldspar porphyry  (QFP)  from  176.10  -  228.75  m; sedimentary breccia (Bx) from 228.75 - 270.35 m; more QFP from 270.35 - 430.69 m; and granite (GR3) from 430.69 m to the end of hole at 444 m.

Mineralization was encountered in three intervals in AM11-15.  One 3 m interval within FP, from 24 - 27 m, assayed 0.50% Sn, 4.92% Zn, 0.48% Cu, and 335 ppm In.  This interval may correlate with similar type mineralization in holes AM10-10 and AM10-25.  A 6 m interval within  Bx,  from  255  -  261  m,  yielded  0.43% Sn  and  1.12% Zn  but  no  indium;  the mineralization  is  actually  in  garnet-chlorite-fluorite  veins  that  cut  the  Bx.    Another  6 m interval, from 363 - 369 m, in similar veins cutting QFP assayed 0.88% Sn.

## AM11-16 (Saddle Zone) Mine Coordinates: E 15752.124 N 12954.860

Elev.  1292 m

AM11-16 was collared on the west side of a topographic high, approximately 46 m south of AM11-07 and 48 m west of AM11-08.  It intersected quartz-feldspar porphyry (QFP) from surface to 216.55 m, which is cut by a number of granite porphyry (GP) dikes, from 177.75 189.30  m,  189.66  -  189.78  m,  191.33  -  193.22  m,  and  213.59  -  214.90 m.    Granite  was encountered at 216.55 - 335.12 m, 365.60 -367.40 m, 373.50 - 373.73 m, and from 383.28 m to the end of hole at 501 m.  The missing intervals from 335.12 - 383.28 m are occupied by QFP indicating that the QFP/granite contact is steeply dipping in this area.

Hole AM11-16 has several narrow mineralized intervals, both in QFP and granite.  The most important ones are:

from 12 - 15 m assaying 0.25% Sn, 2.76% Zn, 0.34% Cu, and 51 ppm In;

from 42 - 45 m assaying 0.17% Sn, 2.12% Zn, 0.23% Cu, and 155 ppm In;

from 246 - 249 m assaying 0.95% Sn, 1.84% Zn, 1.84% Cu, and 378 ppm In;

from 288 - 291 m assaying 0.25% Sn, 1.06% Zn, 0.11% Cu, and 147 ppm In; and

from 339 - 342 m assaying 0.88% Sn, 0.08% Zn, 0.01% Cu, and 5 ppm In.

## AM11-17 (Saddle Zone)

Mine Coordinates: E 15750.338 N 12903.176 Elev.  1292 m

AM11-17 was collared 51.7 m south of hole AM11-16.  The hole was abandoned at 84 m because the drill rods got stuck.  It intersected quartz-feldspar porphyry (QFP) from surface to the end of the hole.

<!-- image -->

Mineralization occurs as disseminations, in stockwork veins, and as small massive-sulphide replacements  that  also  contain  fluorite  and  chlorite.    One  6 m  interval,  from  39  -  45  m, assayed 0.20% Sn, 1.91% Zn, 0.27% Cu, and 78 ppm In.

## AM11-17a (Saddle Zone)

Mine Coordinates: E 15754.478 N 12901.222 Elev.  1293 m

AM11-17A  was  collared  approximately  54 m  south  of  AM11-16,  and  40 m  west  of  hole NMR-89-1 (drilled by NovaGold).  It was drilled to test the southwestern part of the Saddle Zone.  This hole intersected quartz-feldspar porphyry (QFP) from surface to 402.10 m, and granite from there to the end of hole at 455 m.

Mineralization  mostly  occurs  within  the  QFP.    Sphalerite-cassiterite  mineralization  was encountered at two intervals from 206 - 209 m and 227 - 230 m.  The first assayed 0.60% Sn, 1.8% Zn  and  42 ppm  In;  the second assayed 0.38% Sn,  6.51% Zn  and  179 ppm  In. Significant  W-Mo-Bi  mineralization  was  encountered  within  silicified  and  brecciated  QFP from  308  -  365 m.    This  57 m  interval  assayed  0.29% WO3,  0.20% MoS2,  0.17% Bi,  and 2.97% As.  The style and setting of this mineralized interval are similar to that of W-Mo-Bi bodies  in  the  Fire  Tower  North  Zone.    Fine  to  coarse-grained  wolframite  crystals  occur  as disseminations  in  stockwork  veins  and  within  massive  sphalerite-arsenopyrite  pods  and replacements.    The  veins  and  veinlets  also  contain  abundant  fluorite.    Visible  bismuth (bismuthinite?) is also present in this interval.
