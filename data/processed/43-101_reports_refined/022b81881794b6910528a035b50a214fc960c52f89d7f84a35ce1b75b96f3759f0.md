## 1 Summary

This  report  was  prepared  as  a  feasibility-level  Canadian  National  Instrument  43-101  (NI  43-101) Technical Report (Technical Report) for NioCorp Developments, Ltd. (NioCorp or the Company) by SRK Consulting (U.S.), Inc. (SRK), Tetra Tech, Inc. (Tetra Tech), MineFill Services, Inc. (MineFill Services),  SMH  Process  Innovation  LLC  (SMH),  and  Olsson  Associates  (Olsson)  (collectively referred to as the Consultants) on the Elk Creek Niobium Project (Elk Creek or the Project) located in southeast  Nebraska.  NioCorp  was  formerly  known  as  Quantum  Rare  Earth  Developments  Corp. (Quantum), but changed its name to NioCorp effective March 3, 2014.

## 1.1 Property Description and Ownership

Elk Creek is an exploration project located in southeast Nebraska, USA. It is located approximately 65 miles southeast of Lincoln, Nebraska (the state capital), and 80 miles south of Omaha, Nebraska. The mineralization is centered about 40°16'0.3.5' N latitude and 96°11'08.5' E longitude. The area is well developed with direct access to roads, rail, supply and distribution companies, and a local work force  including  heavy  equipment operators. Geologists can be sourced from local universities. An experienced mining related workforce can be found in Denver Colorado (eight-hour drive west of the Project). The deposit is located within the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Tecumseh Quadrangle Nebraska  SE  (7.5  minute  series)  mapsheet  in  Sections  1-6,  9-11;  Township  3N;  Range 11  and Sections 19-23, 25-36; Township 4N, Range 11.

The Property consists of 21 option agreements covering approximately 1,749 hectares (ha). Option agreements  are  between  NioCorp's  subsidiary  Elk  Creek  Resources  Corp.  (ECRC)  and  the individual land owners. ECRC is a Nebraska based wholly owned subsidiary of NioCorp. NioCorp retains 100% of the mineral rights to the Project and is the operator. The agreements are in the form of  five  year  pre-paid  Exploration  Lease  Agreement  (ELA),  with  an  Option  to  Purchase  (OTP)  the mineral rights and/or the surface rights at any time during the term of the agreement. The individual land owners have title to the surface and subsurface rights, and the agreements are primarily with respect  to  only  the  mineral  and  surface  interest  of  each  property.  The  agreements  convey  to  the Company adequate surface rights to access the land and to complete mineral exploration work. The options  agreements  that  the  company  currently  holds  include  all  of  the  indicated  and  inferred resources described in this report.

## 1.2 Geology and Mineralization

The Project includes the Elk Creek Carbonatite (the Carbonatite) that intruded older Precambrian granitic and  low  to  medium  grade  metamorphic  basement  rocks.  Both  the  Carbonatite  and Precambrian rocks are interpreted to be unconformably overlain by approximately 200 meters (m) of Paleozoic marine sedimentary rocks of Pennsylvanian age. As a result of this thick cover, there is no surface outcrop within the Project area of the Carbonatite, which was identified and targeted through magnetic surveys and confirmed through subsequent drilling. The available magnetic data indicates dominant northeast, west-northwest striking lineaments, and secondary northwest and north oriented features that mimic the position of regional faults parallel and/or perpendicular to the Nemaha Uplift.

The  Carbonatite  hosts  significant  niobium  (reported  as  Nb2O5),  titanium  (reported  as  TiO2)  and scandium (reported as Sc) and is composed predominantly of dolomite, calcite and ankerite, with

lesser  chlorite,  barite,  phlogopite,  pyrochlore,  serpentine,  fluorite,  sulfides  and  quartz.  Niobium  is contained  primarily  within  the  mineral  pyrochlore,  and  rare  earth  element  (REE)  mineralization  is reported  to  occur  as  bästnasite,  parisite,  synchysite  and  monazite.  Niobium  has  been  the  main element  of  interest  for  the  current  study,  but  developments  since  the  November  2014  Technical Report within the metallurgical test work indicated the potential to recover TiO2 and Sc2O3 as part of the  proposed  process  flowsheet.  Based  on  the  work  completed  to  date  SRK  considers  all  three elements  to  have  potential  for  economic  extraction  and  therefore  are  discussed  in  the  Technical Report, and included in the Mineral Resource Estimate.

## 1.3 Status of Exploration, Development and Operations

Drilling at the Project was conducted in three phases. The first was during the 1970's and 1980's by the Molybdenum Company of America (Molycorp), the second in 2011 by Quantum, and the third and latest program in 2014 by NioCorp. To date, 129 diamond core holes have been completed for a total of 64,981 m over the entire geological complex. Of these a total of 48 holes (33,909 m) have been completed to date in the mineralized area and used in the current Mineral Resource Estimate.

Five holes for a total length 3,353.1 m, of additional drilling been drilled since the completion of the April 28, 2015 Mineral Resource Estimate. This drilling has been for the purpose of Hydrogeological and Geotechnical studies. No sampling has been completed of these holes to date and therefore they have not been considered for the Mineral Resource.

All drilling has been completed using a combination of Tricone, Reverse Circulation (RC) or Diamond Drilling (DDH) in the upper portion of the hole within the Pennsylvanian sediments. All drilling within the underlying Carbonatite has been completed using DDH methods.

SRK  reviewed  and  validated  the  electronic  database  provided  and  concludes  that  the  sampling methods, Quality Assurance/Quality Control (QA/QC), and database management  practices employed by NioCorp are all at or above industry standards, and are suitable for use in resource estimation.

## 1.4 Mineral Resource Estimate

Mineral Resources have been estimated in conformity with generally accepted Canadian Institute of Mining (CIM) Estimation of Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserves Best Practices guidelines, and are reported in accordance with the CIM Definition Standards - For Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves, May 10, 2014.

The drillhole database used in the estimation is of high quality and has been independently verified by  SRK.  A  three-dimensional  geologic  model  was  constructed  using  ARANZ  Leapfrog®  Mining Software  (Leapfrog®).  The  geological  modeling  was  based  on  logged  geology  in  the  drilling database, using a combination of geological controls and niobium grade shells. The grade estimation was confined  to  a  hard  boundary  of  three  grade  shell  domains  defined  at  0.3%,  0.4%  and  0.5% niobium pentoxide (Nb2O5%), with the estimation using only the composited samples from the same domain.

Developments in the metallurgical test work indicated the potential to recover TiO2 and Sc based on a revised flowsheet. Further, the Company completed a re-assay program of historical pulps, which were not included in  the  original  2011/2012  re-assay  programs.  The  updated  database  has  been

provided  to  SRK  who  completed  a  review  of  the  database  and  the  QA/QC  information  for  the additional elements to ensure their inclusion in the estimation process. External laboratory checks showed  a  bias  between  SGS  and  Actlabs  laboratories,  with  Actlabs  returning  higher  values  for Nb2O5.  The  slight  high  bias  confirms  the  slight  over  reporting  noted  in  the  routine  submissions  of standard  reference  materials  (SRMs),  which  SRK  estimates  to  be  in  the  order  of  4.0%  to  4.4% (based on the SRMs). The external duplicate bias reports a slight increase in the bias to 8.7%. SRK considers the level of bias to be within acceptable levels for use in the current Mineral Resource. In 2016 NioCorp completed a re-assay program on historical samples which had not previously been assayed for  TiO2  and  Sc.  SRK  considers  the  database  acceptable  for  use  in  the  current  Mineral Resource Estimation.

Mineral  Resources  utilized  all  the  assay  information  from  historical  drilling  and  the  NioCorp  2014 drilling  program  and  2016  re-assay  program.  Search  distances  were  determined  from  directional variograms  calculated  using  the  capped  and  composited  samples.  A  nested  search  ellipse estimation method consisting of three passes was used. The search ellipse has been rotated into the main dip and strike orientation of the deposit.

The  grade  estimation  (Nb2O5%,  TiO2%,  Sc  ppm)  utilized  an  Ordinary  Kriging  (OK)  algorithm supported by 5 m sample composites for all the mineralized units, with Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW)  to  a  power  of  2,  and  a  nearest  neighbor  estimate  completed  as  cross  checks.  Search distances were determined from directional variograms calculated using the capped and composited samples.  A  nested  search  ellipse  estimation  method  consisting  of  three  passes  was  used.  The search ellipse has been rotated into the main dip and strike orientation of the deposit.

Density has been estimated based on density determination values taken during the 2014 resource estimation program, using a combination of weight in air/weight in water, and volumetric analysis. Based on a statistical review of the density measurements and the assay results from the whole rock analysis, which including Fe2O3% and TiO2%, a general trend of higher density with higher grade was identified  and  therefore  an  Ordinary  Kriged  estimate  of  density  was  chosen  as  the  preferred option. Resources are reported as Nb2O5%, TiO2% and Sc (ppm).

SRK  has  validated  the  Mineral  Resource  Estimates  using  a  number  of  different  validation techniques:

- · Inspection of block grades in plan and section and comparison with drillhole grades;
- · Comparative statistical study vs. composite data and alternative estimation methods; and
- · Sectional interpretation of the mean block and sample grades (swath plots).

In the opinion of SRK, the Mineral Resource Estimate reported herein is a reasonable representation of the global Nb2O5, TiO2 and Sc grades, which provide a reasonable underground mining target at the Project.

The Mineral Resources are classified under the categories of Indicated and Inferred according to CIM guidelines. Due to a lack of dense drilling (in the order of 35 m x 35 m), no Measured Mineral Resources have been assigned at this stage.

Classification  of the  resources  reflects  the  relative  confidence  of  the  grade  estimates.  This classification is based on several factors including sample spacing relative to geological and geostatistical observations regarding the continuity of mineralization, data verification to original sources,

specific gravity determinations, accuracy of drill collar locations, accuracy of the topographic surface, quality of the assay data, and many other factors.

For  the  Indicated  resource  classification,  a  solid  shape  was  constructed  around  the  core  of  the deposit where most drillholes are spaced approximately 60 to 70 m apart, and blocks have been estimated with a minimum of two boreholes.

SRK  completed  a  Preliminary  Economic  Assessment  report  in  2015  titled,  'Amended  NI  43-101 Technical Report, Updated  Preliminary Economic  Assessment,  Elk Creek Niobium Project, Nebraska,  Effective  Date:  August  4,  2015,  Original  Report  Date:  September  4,  2015,  Amended Report Date: October 16, 2015' (2015 PEA). In the 2015 PEA SRK estimated the Mineral Resource using a cut-off grade (CoG) based on Nb2O5 only, but on-going work by the Company since the 2015 PEA  has  resulted  in  a  change  in  approach  to  CoG,  which  is  now  based  on  a  NSR  basis.  The economic parameters were selected based on experience and benchmarking against similar projects and work completed by the Company.

The Mineral Resources have been confined to estimated blocks within the Carbonatite. In order to determine the quantities of material offering 'reasonable prospects for economic extraction' by an underground mining method, SRK has defined an underground mining CoG based on metal pricing, assumed  costs  and  metallurgical  recoveries.  The  blocks  above  the  mining  CoG  form  contiguous mining targets without isolated blocks that would be unlikely to warrant the cost of development.

The  Mineral  Resource  has  been  filtered  to  show  all  blocks  above  the  mining  cut-off  to  ensure estimates form suitable mining targets. Any isolated blocks of material reporting above cut-off can be removed as they will unlikely warrant the cost of development. No such cases existed at the Project and  all  material  within  the  geological  wireframes  above  a  cut-off  of  US$180/t  NSR  has  been considered to have reasonable prospects of being mined via underground methods.

SRK defined a Mineral Resource on receipt of a validated database, to account for these additional revenue streams. No additional resource definition drilling has been completed since the October 2015 press release and therefore the drilling and sampling information presented in this technical report  remain  unchanged.  The  updated  Mineral  Resource  is  based  on  an  additional  203  pulp samples, 374 pulverized pulps, and 90 chip samples re-assayed from historical holes, which had not previously  been  assayed  for  TiO2%  or  Sc  (ppm).  The  Mineral  Resource  also  accounted  for  an estimate of the density values, as a relationship has been identified by SRK for higher density values at higher Nb2O5, TiO2 and Fe2O3 grades.

The Mineral Resource Statement in Table 1-1 has been determined using a net smelter return cut-off value based on economic parameters defined as part of the current study. This should be considered the latest estimate for the Project and be used in any future studies.

A summary of the sensitivity of the tonnage and grade to CoG is shown in Table 1-2.

- (1) Mineral Resources are reported inclusive of the Mineral Reserve. Mineral Resources are not Mineral Reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability. All figures are rounded to reflect the relative accuracy of the  estimate and have been used to derive sub-totals,  totals  and  weighted  averages.  Such  calculations  inherently  involve  a  degree  of rounding and consequently introduce a margin of error. Where these occur, SRK does not consider them to be material. All  composites have been capped where appropriate. Historical samples have been validated via re-assay programs, and  all  drilling  completed  by  NioCorp  has  been  subjected  to  QA/QC.  All  composites  have  been  capped  where appropriate,  and  estimates  completed using Ordinary Kriging.  The Concession is wholly owned by and exploration is operated by NioCorp Developments Ltd

There has been no material change to the block estimates in this current update as no additional drilling has been completed. The only two differences between the models have been:

- · The addition of TiO2 and Sc assays which were previously absent; and
- · Change in the reporting criteria from using a 0.3% Nb2O5 CoG to an NSR basis.

Overall  the  result  has  been  an  increase  in  the  tonnage  in  both  the  Indicated  and  the  Inferred categories as more marginal material is considered economic. The Indicated portion of the Mineral Resource has increased by 13% in terms of tonnage, while the Inferred has increased by 34%. In terms of the contained Nb2O5 metal the latest model represents an increase of 5% in the Indicated and  15%  in  the  inferred  respectively,  while  the  TiO2  and  Sc  increase  approximately  9%  in  the indicated, and 29% and 24% in the Inferred respectively.

## 1.5 Mineral Processing and Metallurgical Testing

## Mineral Processing

The feasibility-level comminution test work was completed in two stages at SGS Canada Inc. (SGS) in Lakefield, Ontario.

The test work results indicate that the Project ore is categorized as soft to moderately hard in terms of ore hardness, and amenable to standard grinding as well as an HPGR operation.

## Hydrometallurgical Testing (Hydromet)

Metallurgical test work was conducted at SGS, Hazen Research and Kingston Process Metallurgy (KPM) throughout 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017 to properly design the required process units for the conversion of the ore into a niobium concentrate suitable for further treatment into ferroniobium as well  as  marketable  products  of  titanium  dioxide  and  scandium  trioxide.  Test  work  consisted  of multiple  bench  and  pilot  scale  hydrometallurgical  test  programs  aimed  at  further  refining  the  final

flowsheet using different reagents and technologies. Pilot test programs showed that high recovery rates of the niobium, scandium and titanium could be achieved and that recycling and regeneration of reagents  was  also  possible;  thus,  minimizing  fresh  reagent  input  and  waste  generation. Recoveries  of  85.8%  Nb2O5  and  93.1%  Sc2O3  have  been  demonstrated  while  achieving  40.3% recovery of TiO2.

## Pyrometallurgical Processing (Pyromet)

Pyrometallurgical test work has been carried out at Kingston Process Metallurgy (KPM) in Kingston, Ontario, Canada. The testing performed has demonstrated that:

- · The aluminothermic reduction of Nb2O5 precipitate to produce FeNb alloy regardless of the high level of TiO2 in the precipitate;
- · 96 % niobium recovery from the Hydromet precipitate;
- · Hematite powder (Fe2O3) can be used as the iron source for the aluminothermic reduction.

## 1.6 Mineral Reserve Estimate

The  Project  is  currently  in the  exploration  phase  and  has  not  been  developed.  Based  on geomechanical information and mineralization geometry an underground longhole stoping method (LHS) is suitable for the deposit. Paste backfill will be used to allow for a high recovery of material.

The stopes will be 15 m wide and stope length will vary based on mineralization grade. A spacing of 25 m between levels has been used. The deposit is mined in blocks where mining within a block occurs from bottom to top with the use of paste backfill. Sill pillars are left in situ between blocks. The backfill will have sufficient strength to allow for mining adjacent to filled stopes, thus eliminating the need for dip pillars.

The  mine  will be shaft access to minimize development  through water bearing horizons. Mineralization  will  be  transported  from  stopes  to  the  shaft/hoist  system  by  underground  trucks.  A single ventilation raise will serve as a dedicated exhaust raise and will be raisebored conventionally. Intake air will be down the shaft with fresh air entering a dedicated ventilation drift above the loading pocket. As levels are developed lower in the deposit short slot raises will be developed connecting levels for ventilation purposes.

A 3D mine design has been created representing the reserve areas. The underground mine design process results in mine plan resources of 31.7 Mt (diluted) with an average grade of 0.79% Nb2O5, 2.81% TiO2, and 72 ppm Sc.

This estimate is based on a mine design using elevated CoGs and applying the US$180/t NSR CoG to material within the design. These numbers include a 94% to 100% mining recovery based on type of  opening  (stope,  development,  etc.)  to  the  designed  wireframes  in  addition  to  a  0%  to  6% unplanned dilution. A portion of the dilution does include grade as described in Section 15.2.1. An additional development allowance of 14% was applied to main ramps and 12% to level accesses to account for detail currently not in the design.

Mineral Reserves were classified using the 2014 CIM Definition standards. Table 1-3 summarizes the underground Mineral Reserves. This Mineral Reserve Estimate is as of May 15, 2017.

- · Sc: 93.1% is metallurgical recovery, 100% payability, US$3,500 kg is selling price per kg of scandium oxide, with a conversion of 0.652 is the amount of Sc in Sc2O3.
- · Price assumptions for FeNb, Sc2O3, and TiO2 are based upon independent market analyses for each product.

## 1.7 Mining Methods

## Geotechnical

A  geotechnical  field  characterization  program  has  been  undertaken  to  assess  the  expected  rock quality. This program included logging core, laboratory strength testing, in situ stress measurements and oriented core logging of jointing. The results of this program have provided adequate quantity and quality data for feasibility-level design of the underground workings.

A geotechnical assessment of the orebody shape and ground conditions has determined that longhole  open  stoping  mining  is  an  appropriate  mining  method.  Stopes  have  been  sized  to  maintain stability once mucked empty. A primary/secondary extraction sequence with tight backfilling allows optimization of ore recovery while maintaining ground stability. Primary stopes will be backfilled with cemented  pastefill, while secondary  stopes  will be  backfilled with low-cement  pastefill and uncemented waste rock from underground development activities.

The design has been laid out using empirical design methods based on similar case histories. The stability  of  the  design  has  been  checked  with  3D  numerical  stress-strain  models  of  the  workings which included consideration for mine-scale faulting. The modeling results confirm that stopes and access drifts are predicted to remain stable during active mining.

## Mine Design

Stope optimization was completed in Vulcan™ using a minimum mining stope width of 15 m, a stope height of 25 m, variable length along strike, and an NSR CoG of US$180/t. The stopes and block model are oriented to match the direction of in situ stresses, which are elevated (~1.5H:1V). This stope orientation optimizes stress distribution and allows for mining of larger openings.

The  highest  CoG  possible  was  used  for  the  design  where  the  deposit  would  hold  together reasonably  for  mine  design  purposes  in  order  to  achieve  the  highest  practical  Nb2O5  grade.  This elevated cut-off was approximately the US$500 optimization. SRK notes that the stope optimization results  show  that  there  is  a  significant  amount  of  material  between  the  elevated  cut-off  and  the economic cut-off of US$180/t.

Stope optimizer shapes were used as a basis for the design work. Each stope has a 4.5 m x 4.5 m access located at the bottom of the stope. Top accesses are designed to give access to stopes on the next level and to allow for backfilling. The stopes are drilled from the top and rings are blasted from the end of a stope toward the footwall access. The blasted material is remotely mucked from the  stope  access.  A  primary/secondary  stoping  sequence  will  be  used.  The  stope  accesses  are connected to a level access located in waste or low grade material. The level accesses connect to the  main  ramp  which  is  offset  at  least  75  m  from  stoping  into  the  footwall.  Each  level  access  is connected to an intake and exhaust ventilation system.

The  underground  mine  will  be  accessed  through  a  7.5 m  shaft  system  that  will be  sunk conventionally.  A  5.5 m  exhaust  air  raise  is  raisebored  and  outfitted  with  an  emergency  egress system.

The production and development schedule was completed using iGantt software. A delay of 28 days was used prior to driving on paste fill or mining adjacent to a paste filled stope. A production rate of 2,760 t/d was targeted with ramp-up to full production as quickly as possible. Shaft sinking activities begin in May, 2019 with mine development occurring from the end of 2019 through 2020. Stoping begins late in 2020, with a ramp up period through Q1 - 2021, after which the mine and plant are operating at full capacity.

Figure 1-1 shows the mine production schedule colored by year.

The mine utilizes jumbo drills for lateral development and tophammer and down-the-hole drills for vertical  development  and  production  stoping.  Bolters  are  used  for  ground  support.  The  mine  will operate a fleet of 40 t haul trucks being loaded by 14t LHDs. The ore is fed through a grizzly with rock breaker into an underground crusher and via a material handling system to the surface. The mine has full infrastructure underground including ventilation, pumping system, electrical substation and distribution system, warehousing, explosives storage, communications system, and maintenance  shops.  The  mine  will  have  a  staff  of  approximately  239  people  at  the  peak  of production.

## 1.8 Recovery Methods

## Mineral Processing

The Mineral Processing building will house all of its equipment within a single large building. This building will be an engineered steel structure with dimensions approximately 203 ft x 153 ft with a 104 ft eave height.

The primary driver of the comminution circuit design is the dry processing of ore. The process design relies upon two things; receiving a primary crusher product with a characteristic particle size of (P80) 115  mm  at  the  comminution  circuit  feed  bin  and  producing  feed  material  for  the  downstream hydrometallurgical processing at a characteristic particle size of (P80) 1.1 mm.

The primary crusher product will be fed to the secondary cone crusher system, operating in closed circuit with a double deck screen. The screen undersize from the cone crusher system will be fed to a  HPGR  unit,  operating  in  closed  circuit  with  another  double  deck  screen.  The  HPGR  screen undersize is the comminution product that will report to the hydrometallurgical process.

## Hydrometallurgical Processing (Hydromet)

The Hydromet Plant building is a very large multi-level engineered steel structure with dimensions approximately 550 ft x 200 ft with a 100 ft eave height. The building will house the equipment on two levels  for  the  12  individual  processes  required  to  separate  the  three  recoverable  minerals.  The Hydromet Plant is supported by a Hydrochloric Acid Regeneration (HCL) plant and a Sulfuric Acid Plant.

The Acid Regeneration (HCL) plant is composed of a large open air tank farm type equipment area with containment capability situated next to a single large building. The open air tank farm area will contain the reactors, agitated tanks, heat exchangers and absorber columns needed for the

The  Sulfuric  Acid  Plant  will  primarily  be  used  to  regenerate  off  gas  coming  from  the  Hydromet calciner (SO2). It is composed of a large open equipment area with dimensions approximately 269 ft x 237 ft. Within this general area is a containment area that contains the absorber and drying towers, acid  coolers,  acid  dryers  and  pumps.  The  remaining  open  area  will  contain  the  heat  exchangers, superheater, converter and blowers used for the regeneration of sulfuric acid.

## Pyrometallurgical Processing (Pyromet)

The Pyromet building will house most of its equipment within a single building. This building will be an engineered steel structure with dimensions approximately 150 ft x 150 ft with a 75 ft eave height.

The purpose of the pyrometallurgical (Pyromet) plant is to reduce the niobium pentoxide coming from the Hydromet feed by converting it into a saleable ferroniobium (FeNb) metal. Pyromet enhances the purification of the FeNb by eliminating the Ti co-precipitated with the Nb.

The aluminothermic reduction has been selected as the technology to convert the hydrometallurgical Nb2O5 precipitate into a FeNb metal. Aluminum shots and iron oxide pellets will be introduced on a continuous  basis  along  with  the  fluxing  agents  to  initiate  and  complete  the  exothermic  chemical reduction  of  the  Nb2O5.  This  reduction  is  performed  in  a  single  electrical  arc  furnace  with  a continuous feed of precipitate, additives and fluxes to produce a saleable a FeNb metal alloy.

## 1.9 Project Infrastructure

The Project is a greenfield site located approximately 65 miles southeast of Lincoln, Nebraska and 80 miles south of Omaha, Nebraska. There are several local communities near the Project including Elk Creek and Tecumseh that will provide local housing for the Project. There are a number of other communities within driving distance and the large cities of Lincoln and Omaha are within reasonable driving distance. Both cities have substantial regional airports.

The site has no existing infrastructure except being adjacent to the Nebraska state highway 50 and County Road 721. The Project will be accessed from County Road 721 through a guard gate into the Project property.

The  Project  will  incorporate  surface  and  underground  infrastructure,  as  well  as  tailings  storage facilities. The offsite infrastructure includes a new high voltage transmission line constructed by the local  utility  company  and  providing  power  to  an  on-site  primary  sub-station  and  a  natural  gas  28 miles pipeline built by the owner of the interstate pipeline.

On-site power will include a 44 kV transmission line between the primary substation and the mine substation, along with a 13.8 kV on-site power distribution network. Telecommunications service will be provided by the local telecom supplier with on-site telecommunications distribution consisting of a combination of hardwire and fiber optics systems.

The on-site surface infrastructure will include an electrical substation and distribution system, on-site telecommunications, fuel storage and dispensing system for above ground vehicles, as well as diesel storage  and  pipeline  transmission  to  underground  mine  fuel  storage,  truck  scale,  process  water system,  potable/process  reverse  osmosis  (RO)  water  treatment  Plant,  potable  water/fire  water system including tankage, distribution and hydrants supplied from the water treatment plant, sanitary waste water collection system with lift stations discharging into above grade tanks for transport/disposal to a local municipal waste water plant, natural gas distribution to site loads, access roads to the site with parking, fencing and security.

Infrastructure building facilities will include the following: leased modular trailers for the administration  building  and  security  gate  house,  assay  laboratory,  combination  warehouse  and maintenance  shop,  modular  warehouse/maintenance  shop  offices,  process  water  treatment  plant building, paste backfill plant, and mine change house.

The mining related facilities will include a lined mine waste rock and ore storage area, growth media storage area, surface water control facilities, and tailings impoundment. The mine surface facilities include a headframe, hoist, and associated facilities. The underground will be serviced by a shaft and a ventilation raise. The return air raise will be served by a fan system underground and will be equipped with an emergency hoist.

The  underground  facilities  will  include  a  shop,  warehouse,  fuel  storage  and  filling  area,  offices, explosives  storage  areas,  electrical  distribution  system,  water  pumping  and  discharge  system, service water, compressed air distribution, backfill distribution system, and ventilation system. The underground material handling system includes a grizzly, feeder, crusher, storage bins, conveyors, and a skip loading system that loads skips in order to hoist the mined material to the surface facility.

Active mine dewatering will be required and will begin prior to the installation of the mine shaft. Mine dewatering operations will include a series of deep groundwater pumping wells that will dewater the

mine and discharge into  a  lined  collection  pond.  The  water  will  then  be  pumped  to  both  a  water treatment plant for on-site us and through a 53 km discharge pipeline to a discharge point at the Missouri River.

## 1.9.1 Tailings

The  tailings  produced  by  the  process  plant  will  consist  of  filtered  water  leach  residue,  calcined excess oxide, and slag tailings. The four tailings storage facilities (TSF) will be constructed to contain the tailings, the first three cells in the Plant Site area, later in the mine life Area 7. The Plant Site TSFs would contain approximately 8.2 Mt of tailings. The Area 7 TSF would contain an additional approximately  5.3 Mt  of  tailings.  The  tailings  facilities  have  been  designed  to  incorporate  two independent  areas:  a  composite-lined  tailings  solids  storage  area;  and  an  area  with  double  lined containment including a leak collection and recovery system for management of stormwater runoff and  drainage  from  the  tailings  solids.  The  TSFs  will  store  predominantly  dry  (i.e.,  not  in  a  slurry consistency)  tailings  from  the  plant  with  embankment  construction  based  on  a  'downstream' construction method. Facility closure is considered in the design.

## 1.10  Environmental Considerations

NioCorp  has  developed  information  and  conducted  a  number  of  environmental  studies  related  to baseline characterization for the Project. These include:

- · Soils;
- · Climate/Meteorology/Air Quality;
- · Cultural and Archeological Resources;
- · Vegetation;
- · Wildlife;
- · Threatened, Endangered, and Special Status Species;
- · Land Use;
- · Hydrogeology (Groundwater);
- · Hydrology (Surface Water);
- · Wetlands/Riparian Zones; and
- · Geochemistry.

Of  these,  perhaps  the  most  critical  to  the  Project  are  the  studies  related  to  hydrogeology  and geochemistry,  given  the  current  plan  to  discharge  underground  dewatering  water  to  the  Missouri River, over 30 miles away. The geochemistry of this water will dictate the terms and conditions of the discharge  permit,  and  any  additional  management  (active  or  passive)  that  may  be  required.  The geochemistry of the ore and waste materials (including the final process waste streams making up the  bulk  of  the  tailings  mass),  directly  influences  the  management  of  these  materials  given  the presence of naturally occurring radioactive materials (NORMs) (i.e., uranium and thorium) and the potential for limited reaction to contact with water (see below). Given the presence of low levels of NORMs and this  potential  reactivity,  NioCorp  will  take  the  conservative  approach  of  placing  this material on a double-lined containment facility from which any surface water runoff or seepage can be controlled and managed. It is not anticipated that any of mine development or waste rock would remain exposed on the surface post closure.

Characterization  of  the  various  tailings  materials  has  included  both  the  Toxicity  Characteristic Leaching  Procedure  (TCLP)  and  the  Synthetic  Precipitation  Leach  Procedure  (SPLP),  which  are designed to determine the mobility of both organic and inorganic analytes present in liquid, solid, and multiphasic  wastes,  and  assist  in  the  proper  classification  of  waste  materials.  The  most  recent tailings  material  testing  showed  negligible  mobility  of  regulated  constituents  (indicating  a  nonhazardous  classification),  although  the  pH  of  the  TCLP/SPLP  extracts  remained  high.  While  the calcined tailings are likely to produce heat when exposed to atmospheric moisture and precipitation (i.e.,  exothermic  hydration),  this  reaction  is  not  'violent'  as  defined  under  40  CFR  §  261.23(2) Characteristic of reactivity [for hazardous wastes] (adopted by the State of Nebraska under Title 128 - Nebraska Hazardous Waste Regulations). Given the limited quantities of ore available for testing, further characterization of these materials is recommended in order to establish representativeness of the deposit as a whole with respect to waste classification.

There are currently no known environmental issues that could materially impact NioCorp's ability to extract  the  Mineral  Resources  or  Mineral  Reserves at  Elk  Creek.  However,  there  are  several  key permitting  risks  and  uncertainties  that  could  affect  the  Project  financing  and  schedule.  These  are outlined below.

Overburden  developed during mine construction will be excavated, crushed and used as construction material. Small quantities of waste rock will be temporarily stored on the surface (on a lined  pad)  prior  to  final  disposal  underground  or  within  the  lined  tailings  impoundment.  The  water leach residue tailings will be returned to the underground mine as backfill, along with a portion of the oxide tailings. The remaining oxide tailings and slag will be deposited within double-lined, surface storage facilities.

For the first several years of construction, the advancement of the shaft and underground workings will require subsurface dewatering. The initial volumes of saline water from testing of the dewatering wells will be stored in the lined Mine Water Pond during construction of the discharge waterline to the Missouri River. During operations, clean water produced from the process plant RO system will be used in  the  process  plant,  and  the  reject  concentrate  will  be  transferred  to  the  Mine  Water  Pond where it  will  mix  with  the  dewatering  water  and  be  discharged.  NioCorp  is  currently  working  with state regulators to ensure that the overall discharge permit limitations to the Missouri River account for this additional brine concentration.

Upon  cessation  of  mining,  dewatering  operations  will  be  halted  and  the  wells  will  be  abandoned according to state regulations. Until such time that the final TSF closure cover can be constructed, and  any  residual  water  or  seepage  eliminated,  the  TSF  contact  water  will  require  management. Whether  the  singular  TSF  brine  stream  from  the  RO  plant  can  continue  to  be  discharged  the Missouri River or if another disposal method considered (i.e., disposal in the deep mine workings), will be evaluated during the final years of operation.

Engagement  of  local,  state  and  federal  regulators  has  already  begun,  and  three  major  areas  of permitting have been initiated, including CWA Sections 404 and 408 permitting with the USACE, as well as Section 402 discharge permitting and air quality permitting with the Nebraska Department of Environmental Quality (NDEQ). Initiation of the balance of permitting for the Project is dependent upon the completion of the mine plan and surface facilities being developed as part of this technical document,  as  well  as  additional  characterization  of  the  waste  materials  and  potential  worker exposures under the jurisdiction of the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS)

and U.S. Department of Labor - Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA), both of whom will have primary oversight of worker safety and monitoring programs with respect to the presence of NORMs in the ore and waste rock. A comprehensive table of requisite permits and authorizations is presented in Section 20.3.

Stakeholder engagement has been undertaken in parallel with field operations in Nebraska and has included town hall discussions and individual meetings. Some early communications have occurred between NioCorp and Johnson, Pawnee, Nemaha and Richardson County representatives (including the county commissioners) as well as the Southeast Nebraska Development District (SENDD).

Without specific hardrock mining regulations, there are limited obligatory requirements for reclamation and closure of mining properties in Nebraska. There are provisions, however, within the applicable  regulatory  framework  that  are  likely  to  be  applied  to  the  Project  during  the  permit  and licensing  processes,  specifically  those  associated  with  the  TSF  and  mineral  processing  facilities. This will include the provision of financial surety for proper closure and reclamation of the site. The currently estimate costs for closure and reclamation of the Project is US$39 million.

Overall, the Project appears to be sufficiently advanced to initiate the submission of formal permit applications which will govern the construction, operation, and closure of the mine.

## 1.11  Capital Cost Estimate

Table 1-4 shows the breakout in life-of-mine (LoM) initial and sustaining capital estimates which total US$1,505 million. An overall 11.1% contingency factor has been applied to the initial capital estimate while a smaller 1.4% contingency was applied to the sustaining capital estimate. The preproduction period is defined from June 2017 to the end of construction in December 2020 plus a three month ramp up period through the end of March 2021. Commercial production is then to be declared on April  1,  2021.  The  initial  capital  estimate  of  US$1,088  million  can  be  partially  offset  by  a  Gross Preproduction Revenue Credit of US$79 million (generated by preproduction product sales) to net to a cost of US$1,008 million.

## 1.13  Economic Analysis

Project metrics are summarized in Table 1-6 and show a pre-tax NPV 8% result of US$2,291 million and 24.3% IRR with undiscounted payback from start of commercial production of 3.4 years as well as an after tax NPV 8% result of US$1,666 million and 21.7% IRR with undiscounted payback from start of commercial production at 3.7 years. With an estimated effective income tax rate of 24.1%, the Project is expected to generate over US$284 million in annual free cash flow over its operational life,  for  a  cumulative  total  of  approximately  US$7,885  million.  The  effective  tax  rate  was  derived utilizing  current  federal,  state  and  local  tax  rates  along  with  statutory  deductions  for  which  the company qualifies.

The Project NPV is most sensitive to changes in Sc2O3 and Nb pricing as shown in Figure 1-2. It should  also  be  noted  that  on  a  pre-tax  basis,  operating  costs  have  a  slightly  greater  effect  than capital costs, but on an after-tax basis both have equal effect.

## 1.14  Project Implementation Plan

A Project Implementation Plan (PIP) is developed that communicates the overall execution strategy for  the  Project  construction.  The Project objective is to reach 80% of production capacity within a total  budget  of  US$1,086  million.  The  Project  timeline  is  based  on  First  Metal  42  months  after Authorization to Proceed, plus an additional 3 months of Ramp-up to 80% of production capacity for a total of 45 months.

The PIP execution is based on use of two contractors, one with responsibilities for the underground related  work  and  the  second  with  site-wide  responsibilities.  Certain  portions  of  the  work  will  be performed with EPC contracts awarded to specialty contractors for process-and technology related packages,  such  as  the  acid  plant.  This  approach  is  reflected  in  the  capital  cost  estimate  for  the Project.

Key early works for the Project include finalizing the contracting approach and contracting the key contractors; optimization metallurgical studies; completing key permitting activities for early works; conduct  hydrogeological  confirmation  testing  and  installing  the  active  dewatering  well  system; conduct confirmatory geotechnical drilling for shaft and vent raise; detailed and procurement of long lead time equipment for shaft, headframe, and mine substation; detailed engineering, geotechnical and  procurement  of  long  lead  time  waterline  materials  and  equipment;  site  preparation  for  early works  activities;  and  finalize  contract  and  commence  construction  on  the  third  party  natural  gas pipeline and electric power supply.

The Owner's Project team organization will mirror the EPCM management structure. The Owner's team  will  have  environmental,  safety,  and  permitting  staff,  personnel  for  engineering,  finance, controls,  procurement  oversight,  construction  management  including  scheduling  and  reporting personnel. The commissioning personnel will include key vendors and NioCorp operations personnel that will continue after the construction effort to operate the plant.

The PIP further  identifies  and  defines  project  and  document  control  systems  and  responsibilities, engineering activities, supply chain and procurement activities, construction management activities and responsibilities, and the commissioning and operational readiness strategy. There are a number of facilities that will be in operated by NioCorp or third parties while the remaining construction efforts are completed. These facilities include the active dewatering well system, waterline to the Missouri, natural  gas  distribution,  mine  electrical  substation  and  later  the  main  substation,  temporary  and permanent electrical distribution, and the water treatment plant.

## 1.15  Opportunities and Risks

An opportunity / risk session was conducted for the Elk Creek Feasibility Study (FS).

Opportunities identified during our review session show that no significant change was required to the  Project  to  add  a  significant  value  and  improve  the  Project  execution  strategy,  improve  the schedule and improve the site layout taking into consideration the construction schedule, temporary facilities and laydown areas.

An  opportunity  was  identified  after  the  risk  session,  late  in  backfill  testing  to  potentially  reduce cement content that would potentially reduce backfill cost.

Two major group of risks rated high were identified during the session and were tagged having a Mitigation Plan.

- · Risks associated with market development of the scandium;
- · Risks associated with a new hydrometallurgical process.

For those risks, the mitigation measures are planned to be put in place during the next phase of the Project. NioCorp should continue and expand its efforts to engage potential offtake customers for all of its three products, in particular Sc2O3.

## 1.16  Key Conclusions

## 1.16.1 Geology and Mineral Resource

SRK has constructed mineralization models for the deposit, based upon all of the available drilling information. Modeling has initially been completed in Leapfrog® by modeling the grade shells at 0.3, 0.4,  0.5  Nb2O5 % intervals. The use of structural trends has been utilized to mimic the geological interpretation and the grade shells have been cross checked against the geological interpretation to select the optimum parameters.

SRK has undertaken a statistical study of the data, which demonstrates adequate splitting/domaining of the deposit. High grade statistical outliers have been controlled in the estimation through grade capping.

SRK has interpolated Nb2O5 grade data using OK into a block model of dimensions 5 m x 15 m x 5 m,  using  appropriate  search  and  estimation  parameters.  The  resultant  block  model  has  been validated and no material bias identified.

SRK  has  classified  the  Mineral  Resource  in  the  Indicated  (51%)  and  Inferred  (49%)  Mineral Resource categories, mainly on the basis of the geological and grade continuity and the relatively wide drillhole spacing of up to 60 to 120 m on average.

The deposit remains open both along strike to the northwest and southeast and at depth as well as in the center, which SRK considers to have the best possibility to add additional material to the mine plan  in  the  short  term.  The  highest  grades  are  associated  with  mineralization  at  depth  and  there remains potential to increase the current Mineral Resource further.

The Mineral Resource Estimate has been defined based on an NSR CoG to reflect the increased knowledge in the processing methodology and the assumed revenue streams from Nb2O5, TiO2 and Sc for the deposit. At a US$180/t NSR cut-off, the Indicated Resource is 90.9 Mt at 0.66% Nb2O5, 2.59% TiO2, and 70 g/t Sc; and an Inferred Resource of 133.6 Mt at 0.48% Nb2O5, 2.23% TiO2, and 59 g/t Sc. Mineral Resources are reported inclusive of the Mineral Reserve. Mineral Resources are not Mineral Reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability.

## 1.16.2 Mineral Processing and Metallurgical Testing

## Mineral Processing

The test work results indicate that the Project ore is categorized as soft to moderately hard in terms of ore hardness, and amenable to standard grinding as well as an HPGR operation.

## Hydromet

Pilot test programs showed that high recovery rates of the niobium, scandium and titanium could be achieved and that recycling and regeneration of reagents was also possible; thus, minimizing fresh reagent  input  and  waste  generation.  Recoveries  of  85.8%  Nb2O5  and  93.1%  Sc2O3  have  been demonstrated while achieving 40.3% recovery of TiO2.

## Pyromet

Pyrometallurgical  testing  has  demonstrated  the  aluminothermic  reduction  of  Nb2O5  precipitate  to produce FeNb alloy regardless of the high level of TiO2 in the precipitate and 96 % niobium recovery from the Hydromet precipitate.

## 1.16.3 Mining and Reserves

Longhole  stoping  with  paste  backfill  is  seen  as  the  appropriate  mining  method  for  the  deposit geometry and known geotechnical conditions.

An NSR approach was used and considers revenue for three elements (Nb2O5, TiO2, and Sc) and generates three separate products (FeNb, TiO2, and Sc2O3). The 3-D mine design was completed on an elevated CoG, over twice the actual calculated cut-off. Three mining blocks were designed, giving a 32 year mine life, although additional material, classified as Indicated, exists below the mine plan presented here.

The underground mine is accessed through a conventionally sunk 7.5 m diameter shaft system.

Tonnage and grades presented in the reserve include dilution and recovery and are benchmarked to other similar operations. Equipment used in this study is standard equipment used worldwide with only standard package/automation features.

## 1.16.4 Recovery Methods

## Mineral Processing

The primary crusher product will be fed to the secondary cone crusher system, operating in closed circuit with a double deck screen. The screen undersize from the cone crusher system will be fed to a  HPGR  unit,  operating  in  closed  circuit  with  another  double  deck  screen.  The  HPGR  screen undersize is the comminution product that will report to the hydrometallurgical process.

## Hydrometallurgical Plant

Further understanding of the process was achieved with respect to the kinetics of each unit operation which suggested that the design be adjusted from what was initially shown in the 2015 PEA. Among the changes the following are of particular interest:

- · The temperature of the HCl Leach was adjusted to control leaching of the iron. The Fe to Nb ratio in the Leach residue has an impact on the precipitation of Nb and the co-precipitation of titanium.
- · Acid Bake total mixing and reaction time was reduced to 2.5 hours.
- · Iron  reduction  step  was  optimized based on actual reduction of Fe 3+   which  resulted  in  an improved iron consumption.

- · Dilution  ratio  in  the  Niobium  Precipitation  was  reduced  from  5:1  to  0.6:1  thus  reducing reagent consumption and equipment size. This however comes at the expense of a slight reduction in Nb recovery and an increase in Ti co-precipitation.
- · Secondary scandium recovery from the barren sulfate solution was developed. A selective precipitation of the scandium over impurities was achieved.
- · A scandium purification step was added that provided a 99.9% scandium product (as Sc2O3).
- · HCl Acid Regeneration development proved that a recovery of chlorine in excess 99% is achievable.
- · Further  test  work  and  development  provided  the  basis  to  greatly  reduce  the  need  for neutralizing reagents while increasing the recovery of sulfur; therefore, greatly reducing the need for sulfur import.
- · Mixed sulfur oxide gas is treated and cleaned prior to being sent to the Acid Plant therefore reducing the size and cost of the Acid Plant.

## Pyrometallurgical Processing (Sylvain H)

Pyrometallurgical test work has been performed at Kingston Process Metallurgy (KPM) in Kingston, Ontario, Canada. Since some of the process modifications were discussed in the Hydromet section, the ratio Nb2O5/TiO2 has significantly gone up to a point where the removal of the slag during the aluminothermic reaction in the future daily operation will have to be considered as the main task. The issue concerns the fluidity of the slag which prevents the FeNb particles from reaching the niobium alloy underneath of the slag. However, despite the high viscosity of the slag, testing has shown the following:

- · Regardless of the high amount of TiO2 in slag, Nb2O5 precipitate has been reduced to FeNb;
- · The level of recuperation for niobium recovery reached 96% from the Hydromet precipitate;
- · Hematite powder (Fe2O3) can be used as the iron source for the aluminothermic reduction;
- · Temperature of the furnace will have to be set at 1900oC since it has a positive effect on the fluidity of the slag; and
- · Further test work will have to be performed to develop a flux that will be more fluid and allow easier migration of the FeNb particles towards the niobium alloy in the bottom of the furnace.

Additional test work must be completed on refractory material selection to increase the resistance of the refractory and eliminate or reduce the amount of MgO that has been added into the flux during previous testing.

## 1.16.5 Project Infrastructure

The Project infrastructure definition meets the requirements of a feasibility level. Further improvements will be added in the detailed engineering phase.

The on-site surface infrastructure will include an electrical substation and distribution system, on-site telecommunications, fuel storage and dispensing system, as well as transmission to underground mine  fuel  storage,  truck  scale,  process  water  system,  potable/process  water  treatment,  potable water/fire  water  systems,  sanitary  waste  water  collection  system,  natural  gas  distribution,  access roads  and  parking,  fencing  and  security.  Infrastructure  buildings  (all  buildings  except  for  Process buildings) will be a combination of constructed and leased. The mining related facilities will include a lined mine waste rock and mineralized material storage area, growth media storage area, surface

water control facilities, and tailings impoundment. The mine surface facilities include a headframe, hoist, and associated facilities. The underground mine will be serviced by a shaft and a ventilation raise served by a fan system underground and will be further equipped with an emergency hoist.

Underground mine facilities will  include  complete  standalone  facilities,  independent  of  the  surface mining facilities, as well as their own material handling system.

Active mine dewatering will commence prior to the installation of the mine shaft and include a series of deep groundwater pumping wells discharging to either the Missouri River, 50-km away, or the onsite water treatment facility for on-site water use.

## 1.16.6 Active Dewatering

The numerical groundwater model developed for the Project defines dewatering requirements for the proposed underground mine. The model was satisfactorily calibrated to the 10-day airlift and 30-day injection  tests  and  used  for  predictive  simulations.  Model  predictions  were  completed  for  both passive inflow and active dewatering scenarios. If the operator allows passive inflow of groundwater to the underground mine as it develops, without active dewatering, the model predicts a maximum inflow rate of 620 L/s; SRK is of the opinion that it is not feasible, safe or economic to dewater from the underground in this fashion. Alternatively, with an active dewatering approach, the model base case predicts a maximum dewatering rate of 757 L/sec (12,000 gpm) from 12 wells (63 L/sec per well)  is  reached  in  pre-mining  Year  -1  and  maintained  through  Year  4.  After  five  years  of  active pumping at 757 L/s, pumping requirements begin to decrease, gradually tapering off to approximately  230  L/s  at  the  end  of  mine  life.  All  discharged  water  will  be  pumped  to  a  lined dewatering storage pond on site, and then 50 km to a diffuser on the Missouri River. LoM Capital Cost for the active dewatering system is approximately US$61.5 million and LoM Operating Cost is approximately US$134 million.

## Waterline to Missouri

The  waterline  to  the  Missouri  is  a  critical  element  to  the  Project  to  allow  discharge  from  the dewatering  process  that  will  be  required  to  construct  and  operate  the  mine.  The  waterline  to  the Missouri will require the installation of a 914 cm (36 inch) diameter pipeline within County Right-ofWay (ROW) of four  Counties  in  southeast  Nebraska,  the  crossing  of  State  Highways  as  well  as railroad  crossings.  The  waterline  will  also  require  multiple  pump  stations  and  a  diffuser  structure constructed  in  the  Missouri  River.  A  majority  of  the  waterline  and  associated  facilities  will  be constructed  within  ROW  while  portions  will  require  acquisition  of  property  from  private  property owners.

The  Project  will  require  multiple  permits  in  order  to  construct  and  operate  the  system  and  to discharge the water to the Missouri River. The process of obtaining the 404 permit and the permit to discharge to the Missouri River are underway. Permits associated with occupying or crossing ROW and railroads as well as the NDEQ construction permit will be prepared during the preliminary and final  design  phases  of  the  Project.  Risks  associated  with  the  waterline  have  been  evaluated  and have  been  determined  to  be  low  to  medium.  The  waterline  construction  schedule  has  been evaluated and deemed to be feasible in regard to the overall construction schedule for the mine. Certain activities related to data collection and preliminary design of the waterline should commence in the near future to facilitate the overall Project schedule.

The  waterline  will  be  installed  following  typical  Nebraska  waterline  construction  and  will  take approximately 12 months after detailed engineering. The cost of the waterline will be approximately US$63.9 million and an annual operating cost of US$3.9 million.

## 1.16.7 Economic Analysis

The indicative economic results summarized in this section are based upon work performed by SRK, or  received  from  NioCorp,  in  2016-17.  They  have  been  prepared  on  both  an  annual  pre-tax  and after-tax basis, a 100% equity basis with no Project financing inputs.

The Project design is a 1.0 Mt/y operation that would cost an estimated US$1,088 million to build (or US$1,008 million after a US$79 million net preproduction revenue credit). The Project is expected to produce annually 7,055 t of ferroniobium, 11,455 t of TiO2, and 103 t of Sc2O3 over a 32 year mine life. On an NbEq basis, cash costs are expected to be US$12.14/kg NbEq.

Project  metrics  include  a  pre-tax  NPV  8%  result  of  US$2,291  million  and  24.3%  IRR  with undiscounted payback from start of commercial production of 3.4 years as well as an after tax NPV 8% result of US$1,666 million and 21.7% IRR with undiscounted payback from start of commercial production  at  3.7  years.  With  an  estimated  effective  income  tax  rate  of  24.1%,  the  Project  is expected to generate over US$284 million in annual free cash flow over its operational life, for a cumulative  total  of  approximately  US$7,885  million.  The  effective  tax  rate  was  derived  utilizing current  federal,  state  and  local  tax  rates  along  with  statutory  deductions  for  which  the  company qualifies.

The Project will obviously benefit from becoming a stable, domestic US producer of Nb and Sc2O3 where  currently  all  supplies  must  be  imported  from  abroad.  Nb  sales  (32%  of  gross  revenue generated) as modelled would cover the cost of production for all three commodities but Sc2O3 sales will be required to generate positive cash flow to cover any Project loan principal repayments/interest expense and meet investment criteria for stakeholders.

At  the  time  of  the  report,  NioCorp  has  entered  into  two  offtake  agreements  covering  ferroniobium production from the Project. Although 75% of Nb sales in the first 10 years are currently covered by the  offtake  agreements,  the  revenues  generated  under  those  contracts  are  still  sensitive  to  the benchmark  Nb  price  currently  set  in  the  technical  economic  model  at  US$40/kg  for  LoM.  The benchmark price is exposed to competitive pressure. No offtake agreements have been executed at the  time  of  the  report  for  titanium  dioxide  and  scandium  trioxide  products  from  the  Project.  The Project  IRR  is  most  sensitive  to  changes  in  Sc2O3  and  Nb  prices  on  both  a  pre-tax  and  after-tax basis.

## 1.17  Recommendations

No additional  work  is  identified  other  than  that  included  in  the  workplan  provided  for  the  detailed engineering  phase  of  design,  and  the  Total  Installed  Cost  (TIC)  estimate  included  within  the  FS capital estimate. The following are some of the key early work recommendations included in the next steps of the Project Execution.

## 1.17.1 Process

## Mineral Processing

Further pilot testing should be conducted prior to the detailed engineering stage. The results from further pilot testing will be used to confirm unit energy consumption, optimize the HPGR operating variables, and to confirm the size of HPGR required.

## Hydromet

Adequate test work was conducted to support a feasibility-level design for the hydromet plant and all sections of the process have been successfully tested at the pilot scale required for a FS. However, optimization was not achieved in all areas and certain areas would benefit from further 'post FS' test work, preferably before or during the early portion of the detailed engineering activities begin. Further testing would also be beneficial for vendor guarantee.

## Pyrometallurgical Processing

The following items should be addressed during the detailed design stage:

- · Perform  optimization  testing  for  the  processes  in  the  Hydromet  plant  to  enhance  the separation concentration ratio of Nb2O5/TiO2;
- · Perform  larger  scale  testing  to  demonstrate  the  on-going  success  of  the  Nb2O5  reduction with a lower Nb2O5/TiO2 ratio of 0.48;
- · Perform larger scale reduction test work to clearly demonstrate the efficiency of the EAF and its benefits on the separation of FeNb alloy from the slag; and
- · Develop the proper composition for the fluxes in order to ensure a long service life of the refractory and not compromise the availability of the Pyromet plant.

## 1.17.2 Geotechnical

Tetra Tech recommends further geotechnical investigation and subsequent design recommendations for  deep  foundations,  specifically  for  the  larger  process  building  columns,  as  well  as  the  larger process  equipment.  This  investigation  would  include  geotechnical  borings  in  the  final  locations  of buildings and large process equipment.

To  advance  to  the  final  mine  design,  additional  characterization  data  will  be  required  to  reduce geotechnical uncertainty. SRK recommends the following characterization activities:

- · Drillholes at the final shaft and ventilation raise location to confirm ground conditions for the shaft ground support;
- · An additional 4 to 6 geotechnical drillholes in the footwall infrastructure and planned stope mining areas to verify the range of expected ground conditions. This includes collecting:
- o RMR/Q data;
- o Structural orientation data;
- o Updating the structural model and geotechnical models; and
- o Updating mine design parameters.

Additional  geotechnical  drillholes  to  characterize  ground  conditions  for  the  final  alignment  of  the ramps  and  footwall  drives.  These  holes  should  be  drilled  from  underground,  after  the  shaft  is constructed and the initial access drives are mined.

## 1.17.3 Infrastructure

Tetra Tech notes the current site layout has been designed to feasibility level, but recommends that a site layout optimization be conducted during detailed engineering to optimize layout and ensure minimum  cost.  The  site  layout  optimization  should  be  based  on  constructability,  construction sequencing, and early operations activities to minimize interfaces that would reduce cost.

## 1.17.4 Active Dewatering

SRK recommends a post-FS field program be conducted to reduce uncertainty in the hydrogeological aspect of the Project. Phase 1 of the proposed program would include installation of two  prototype,  16  inch  diameter  dewatering  wells,  completion  of  spinner  logs  to  assess  vertical contribution of water to the well, a step test in each well, and a 30-day pumping test in each well. The first well would be installed in the vicinity of the proposed shaft to a depth of 850 m. The second well would be located either near the shaft, or on the southeast edge of the deposit in a location thought to  encounter  multiple  mapped  faults.  A  minimum  30-day  pumping  test  would  require  a  discharge option. The dewatering pond would be constructed immediately, and water during the 30-day test would be discharged to the lined pond for storage. Following the discharge phase, SRK recommends monitoring  of  recovery  for  a  minimum  of  60  days,  longer  if  possible,  due  to  the  need  to  assess changes in storage during rebound. Phase 2 of the program would involve testing of the carbonatite and the granite at the eleven locations. SRK advises that Phase 2 be implemented concurrent with Phase 1, so that some of the new observation wells can be utilized as monitoring points during the 30-day test period. The holes would be drilled with a PQ diameter core bit, and packer testing should occur along the majority of the hole.

## 1.17.5 Economic Analysis

SRK makes the following recommendations about the Project:

- · NioCorp should continue and expand its efforts to engage potential offtake customers for all of its three products, in particular Sc2O3;
- · Seeing that Nebraska government officials are very supportive of the job generating potential of the Project in a rural part of the state, continue to engage and lobby for local, state and federal regulatory agencies for further tax deductions and credits; and
- · Investigate  joint  academic-industry  research  efforts  into  developing  new  uses  for  Nb  and Sc2O3.

The current  Mineral  Resource  is  wholly  contained  within  parcels  Woltemath003J  and  Beethe008, and agreements covering both of these properties have been secured. Negotiations for additional lands to support various configurations of the surface operations have been completed.

## 4.3.1 Nature and Extent of Issuer's Interest

As part of the exploration option agreements where required the Company has also secured surface rights, which allow for access to the land for drilling activities and associated mineral exploration and Project development work.

The agreements that involve mineral rights include a 2% Net Smelter Return (NSR) royalty attached with  the  OTP.  The  agreements  grant  the  operator  an  exclusive  right  to  explore  and  evaluate  the property  for  a  period  of  60  months,  with  an  OTP  the  mineral  rights,  the  surface  rights  or  a combination of the mineral and surface rights at any time during the term.

## 4.4 Royalties, Agreements and Encumbrances

The leases covering the Project are 100% owned by NioCorp and, with the exception of a 2% NSR royalty attached with the OTPs that include the mineral rights, have no other outstanding royalties, agreements or encumbrances.

## 4.4.1 Required Permits and Status

The exploration work conducted to date on the Project has been completed under an Exploration Permit NE0211001 issued by the State of Nebraska, Department of Environmental Quality, which

provided the Company with the right to have ten open boreholes active at the Project at any given time.  In  addition  to  the  exploration  permit,  the  Company  acquired  an  exemption  letter  from  the Department of Health and Human Services for the use of a handheld held Niton X-Ray Florescence Analyzer (Niton), used in 2014 on drill core for preliminary analysis onsite.

Subsequently, the proposed Project will be held to permitting requirements that are determined to be necessary by Johnson, Pawnee, Richardson and Nemaha Counties, the State of Nebraska, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

## 4.5 Other Significant Factors and Risks

There  are  no  known  other  significant  factors  or  risks  which  could  have  a  material  impact  on  the ability to affect access, titles or the right to perform exploration work on the property.

## 5 Accessibility, Climate, Local Resources, Infrastructure and Physiography

## 5.1 Accessibility and Transportation to the Property

The  Property  is  easily  accessible  year  round  as  it  is  situated  approximately  75  km  southeast  of Lincoln (State Capital), Nebraska and approximately 110 km south of Omaha, Nebraska. Access to site can be completed via road or from one of the regional airports. There are several regular flights to both Lincoln and Omaha; however, the Project is most easily accessible from Lincoln (Figure 5-1).

Source: Dahrouge, 2014

From Lincoln Municipal Airport, the Property is accessed via paved roads on the main network and a secondary network of gravel roads by following:

- · Interstate Highway 80 south for approximately 3.5 km to the Beatrice exit;
- · Then join Highway 77 south for approximately 41 km;
- · Then join Highway 41 south for approximately 47 km; and,
- · Then  join  Highway  50  south  for  approximately  16  km  to  the  approximate  center  of  the Elk Creek deposit.

The drive from the Lincoln Municipal Airport to the property is typically 1 hour and 15 minutes, and from Omaha's Eppley Airport the drive is approximately 1 hour and 45 minutes.

Geologists can be sourced from local universities. An experienced mining related workforce can be found in Denver Colorado (eight hours drive west of the Project).

## 5.2 Climate and Length of Operating Season

Southeast  Nebraska  is  situated  in  a  Humid  Continental  Climate  (Dfa)  on  the  Köppen  climate classification  system.  In  eastern  Nebraska  this  climate  is  generally  characterized  by  hot  humid summers and cold winters. Average winter temperatures vary between -10.4°C to 1.6°C. Average summer temperatures vary between 18°C to 32°C. Exploration may be conducted all year round.

Average monthly precipitation (rain and snowfall) varies between 22 and 127 mm. Average yearly precipitation is between 800 and 850 mm with an average yearly snowfall of approximately 72 cm (Table 5-1). Nebraska is located within an area known for tornados which runs through the central U.S. where  thunderstorms  are  common  in  the  spring  and  summer  months.  Tornadoes  primarily  occur during the spring and summer and may occur into the autumn months.

## 5.3 Sufficiency of Surface Rights

The  Company  has  negotiated  surface  rights  as  needed  as  part  of  the  ELAs.  There  is  sufficient suitable  land  area  available  within  the  mineral  claims  for  mine  waste  disposal,  for  future  tailings disposal, a processing plant, and related mine infrastructure.

## 5.4 Physiography

The local topography of eastern Nebraska is relatively low-relief with shallow rolling hills intersected by  shallow  river  valleys.  Elevation  varies  from  about  325  to  390  meters  above  sea  level  (masl). Bedrock outcrop exposure is nonexistent in the Project area.

The majority of the Project area is used for cultivation of corn and soybeans, along with uses as grazing land. Native vegetation typical of eastern Nebraska is upland tall-grass, prairie and upland deciduous forests.

## 6 History

The following section provides a brief summary of the history of the Project and SRK has relied upon information provided in the 2012 NI 43-101 Technical Report produced by Tetra Tech for Quantum, entitled  'Resource  Estimate  and  Technical  Report  for  the  Elk  Creek  Nb-REE  Project,  Nebraska, USA', with an Effective Date of April 23, 2012.

## 6.1 Ownership History

Initial regional geological work was completed by the USGS. The details of the initial ownership of the complete Project area are not clear, but it is reported that land packages were initially controlled by Cominco American Inc. (Cominco American) and Molycorp during the early 1970's.

The majority of the historical exploration over the Project area was completed by Molycorp prior to 1984.  (ECRC).  On  May  4,  2010  Quantum  announced  the  acquisition  of  the  mineral  rights  to  the Project. On March 3, 2013 Quantum announced an official name change from Quantum Rare Earth Developments  Corp.  to  NioCorp  Developments  Ltd.  (NioCorp).  NioCorp's  focus  is  to  develop  the Project.

## 6.2 Exploration History

## 6.2.1 USGS, 1964

Between November 1963 and January 1964, the USGS flew three airborne magnetic surveys over southeast Nebraska. A total of 6,590 line km were flown (836, 209 and 5,544 line miles, respectively) along east-west direction at a flight line spacing of 2 miles and at altitude of 305 m (1,000 ft) above ground (USGS website: OFR 99-0557). Figure 6-1 shows the area covered by the airborne survey.

The  wide  spacing  of  the  flight  lines  illustrates  only  regional  features  and  does  not  locate  local anomalies (e.g., Elk Creek Nb-REE anomaly). Details of the aeromagnetic survey may be found in USGS Publication 73-297, which was unavailable at the time of writing. Results of the aeromagnetic survey are shown in Figure 6-2.

## 6.2.2 Discovery, 1970-1971

Further  investigation  of  the  Project  was  not  completed  until  1970,  when  the  Elk  Creek  gravity anomaly  was  initially  identified  during  a  reconnaissance  gravity  geophysical  survey  of  southeast Nebraska by the Conservation and Survey Division (CSD) of the University  of  Nebraska-  Lincoln (UNL).  During  the  same  time  period  the  UNL  geology  department  (operating  independently),  was mapping the magnetic expression of the Nemaha Arch and the Humboldt Fault.

A comparison of the two geophysical survey results showed a positive anomaly that was coincident with  a  positive  gravity  anomaly  over  the  area  now  defined  as  the  Elk  Creek  gravity  anomaly (Anzman,  1976).  The  geophysical  gravity  survey  outlined  a  near-circular  anomaly,  along  with  a concurrent  magnetic  anomaly,  approximately  7  km  in  diameter.  Analysis  of  the  geophysical  data provided a model of a cylindrical mass of indefinite length with a radius of 1,700 m (5,500 ft; Burfeind et al. 1971). Figure 6-3 and Figure 6-4 illustrate the results of the two surveys.

In 1971, the Nebraska Geological Survey (NGS) commissioned a test drillhole 2-B-71 to determine the source of the near circular gravity anomaly. With some support from the United States Bureau of Mines (USBM) the test hole was deepened. The test hole 2-B-71, later renamed NN-1 by Molycorp, encountered 191 m (628 ft) of marine sediments, followed by a carbonate-rich rock (carbonatite) to the end of the hole at 290 m (952 ft) (Brookins et al., 1975) in what is now referred to as the Elk Creek Carbonatite.

## 6.2.3 Cominco American, 1974

The earliest known reference to Cominco American operating within the Elk Creek gravity anomaly area is from 1974. It is unclear precisely when Cominco American first acquired the mineral rights in the Elk Creek anomaly area. It is believed that between 1971 and 1973 both Cominco American and Molycorp held mineral rights over selected portions of the Elk Creek gravity anomaly.

In  1974,  Cominco  American completed five drillholes  (CA-1  to  CA-5)  within the  Elk  Creek  gravity anomaly. Details  of  the  Cominco  American  drillholes  and  exploration  activities  within  the  property were not available.  The  information on drilling  activities  stated  here  was  taken  from  the  Molycorp database. SRK has not reviewed or included any information from Cominco American as part of the current study.

## 6.2.4 Molycorp, 1973-1986

The earliest  known reference  to  Molycorp  operating  within  the  Elk  Creek  gravity  anomaly  area  is from 1973. It is unclear precisely when Molycorp first acquired the mineral rights in the Elk Creek anomaly area.  Molycorp  completed  a  number  of  phases  of  exploration  on  the  Project  during  this period  including  more  detailed  geophysical  surveys,  regional  drilling  (mineralization  limits)  and focused drilling on the Project area. The exploration program focused on understanding the potential for  rare  earth  elements  of  economic  significance  at  the  Project,  with  results  showing  a  niobium anomaly at Elk Creek.

Between 1986 and 2011, no further exploration had been recorded on the property.

## 6.2.5 Geophysical Surveys

In 1973, a detailed aeromagnetic survey was flown by Olympus Aerial Surveys Inc. (Olympic Aerial Surveys), of Salt Lake City, Utah, USA, for Molycorp, with the aim of locating drill sites. Flight lines within the Elk Creek anomaly area were spaced at 200 m, and outside the anomaly at 400 m. A total of  50,764 ha were covered by 2,090 line km (Anzman, 1976). The altitude of the survey was not stated in Anzman 1976.

In 1980, an extensive regional geophysical program was made in southeastern Nebraska including the Elk Creek anomaly. The program consisted of 6,437 line km of aeromagnetics and approximately 4,000 gravity station readings. The aeromagnetic survey was contracted by Olympus Aerial Surveys.

The gravity geophysical survey was conducted by the CSD-UNL, which undertook approximately a quarter  of  the  station  readings,  and  by  Molycorp's  in-house  Geophysical  Services  Group,  which undertook the remaining three quarters of the gravity station readings.

## 6.2.6 Drilling

Between 1973 and 1974, Molycorp completed six drillholes: EC-1 to EC-4, targeting the Elk Creek anomaly and two other holes outside the Elk Creek anomaly area (Anzman, 1976). Drillholes were typically  carried  out  by  RC  drilling  through  the  overlying  sedimentary  rocks  and  diamond  drilling through the Ordovician-Cambrian basement rocks.

Molycorp continued their drill program from 1977 and, in May 1978, Molycorp made its discovery of the current Project with drillhole EC-11. EC-11 is located on Section 33, Township 4N, and Range 11. The Carbonatite hosting the Project was intersected at a vertical depth of 203.61 m (668 ft).

Molycorp continued its drilling program through to 1984, which mainly centered on the Project within a radius of roughly 2 km. By 1984, Molycorp had completed 57 drillholes within the Elk Creek gravity anomaly area, which included 25 drillholes over the Project area.

From 1984 to 1986, drilling was focused on the Elk Creek gravity anomaly area. The anomaly area is roughly 7 km in diameter and drilling was conducted on a grid pattern of approximately 610 by 610 m (roughly 2,000 by 2,000 ft.) with some closer spaced drillholes in selected areas.

By 1986, a total of 106 drillholes were completed for a total of approximately 46,797 m (153,532 ft). The deepest hole reached a depth of 1,038 m (3,406 ft) and bottomed in carbonatite.

## 6.2.7 Molycorp Data Verification, 1973-1986

Verification work on the historical database has been completed by Dahrouge Geological Consulting Ltd  (Dahrouge),  who  was  contracted  by  Quantum  to  compile  and  verify  the  historical  database between 2010 and 2011. Work included data capture from historical drilling logs, verification drilling and reanalysis of historical samples.

The following  excerpt  was  taken  from  McCallum  and  Cathro  (Technical  Report  on  the  Elk  Creek Property, 2010).

'In  some  of  the  analytical  log  sheets  available  to  the  Authors,  it  appears  that  Molycorp analyzed niobium through their exploration division laboratory at Louviers, Colorado. They also analyzed the same interval at another, unspecified, commercial laboratory. It is unclear to  the  Authors  what  material  the  duplicate  analyses  were  derived  from  (coarse  reject

duplicate,  pulp  duplicate,  or  ¼  core  duplicate).  As  discussed  in  Section  15,  Molycorp  Inc. utilized  some  standards  to  establish  the  calibration  curve  of  the  x-ray  refraction  (XRF) instruments. It is unclear if Molycorp also utilized inserted standard reference samples to test the analytical accuracy of their own laboratory or external commercial laboratories.

Molycorp utilized  the  commercial  laboratory,  Skyline  Labs  Inc.,  of  Wheat  Ridge,  Colorado between  1980  and  1986,  with  analysis  by  ICP  spectrographic  methods  and  unknown preparation  methods.  According  to  analytical  reports  and  certificates  available  at  UNL, values of lanthanum, cerium, neodymium, barium, sodium, thorium, lead, thorium, uranium, potassium,  titanium,  zinc,  vanadium,  niobium,  phosphorous,  beryllium,  zircon,  strontium, lithium, yttrium, silver, chromium, copper, iron, manganese, nickel and cobalt were tested. The intervals  tested  are  comprised  of  commonly  100  ft  intervals,  presumably  composited from the pulverized material of the 10 ft intervals.

In  the  'Niobium  Analytical  Standardization'  report,  dated  June  1983,  by  Sisneros  and Yernberg, it was noted that the routine XRF analysis performed by Molycorp's exploration division  laboratory  at  Louviers  generated  niobium  values  that  were  higher  than  other analytical techniques. This difference in niobium values was concluded not to be a product of preparation  techniques,  but  a  result  of  the  standardization  errors  in  the  XRF  analytical technique. A set of fifteen composites was prepared from Elk Creek drill-core samples and analyzed with varying methods including XRF, ICP emission spectrometry and DC plasma emission spectrometry at ten laboratories. It was concluded that the difference was caused by high barium and iron within the matrix of the sample, with the largest deviations found in the coarse-grained material. The deviation of Molycorp's routine analytical method compared to the recommended value ranges from 20% to just below 50% (with the exception of one sample deviating 1%). The recommended value was based on a statistical analysis of the round-robin results.

The correction for the effect of barium  and iron on the given Louviers niobium value was calibrated with the XRF instrument at Molycorp's Louviers, Colorado exploration laboratory, and many of the previously analyzed samples were re-tested with the new calibration. The samples that have received the Ba+Fe correction have been noted on the historic Molycorp analytical logs; however in the later series of holes, it is not identified on the assay log. It is expected that all holes drilled after 1983 were analyzed with the newer calibration.

Subsequent to the 1983 'Niobium Analytical  Standardization'  report,  Molycorp  had  100  ft composite intervals of the majority of the drillholes (EC-1 to EC-105) sent to Metric Labs of Ste-Marthe-Sur-Le-Lac, Quebec for check analysis of niobium.'

## 6.3 Historic Resource Estimates

## 6.3.1 Molycorp Internal Estimates

During the review of historical documentation and the previous NI 43-101 Technical Report, it has been noted that Molycorp produced an internal estimate of the tonnage and grade within the Project. This  estimate  is  not  considered  to  be  compliant  with  CIM  terms  and  conditions,  nor  was  it documented  to  an  NI  43-101  standard.  The  estimate  is  based  on  assay  analysis  conducted  by

Molycorp  at  its  own  laboratory  at  Louviers,  Colorado,  USA  and  other  analytical  work  at  several commercial laboratories.

On February 5, 1986, in an internal Molycorp memo (Cook and Shearer, 1986) from the two principle project geologists (Cook and Shearer) states:

'Niobium Resource Lands (Elk Creek Section 33)

These  lands  include  the  Section  33  niobium  resource  and  adjacent  untested  lands.  The resource contains 39.4 million tons of 0.82% Nb2O5 and is open to the north, west and at depth.'

Tetra  Tech  commented  in  its  NI  43-101  Technical  Report  (April  2012)  that  the  memo  is  the  only evidence of an historic resource conducted on the property. There are no documents available to explain or support how this resource was estimated. Tetra Tech concluded during its investigation that it was apparent that the historic resource may have been estimated by a polygonal method.

## 6.3.2 Tetra Tech Wardrop Estimate (April 2012)

In  April  2012,  Tetra  Tech  produced  an  NI  43-101  Technical  Report  for  the  Project  based  on  the results  of  verification  work  completed  by  Quantum  through  Dahrouge.  The  Tetra  Tech  Mineral Resource  Estimate  for  the  Project  was  prepared  in  accordance  with  CIM  Best  Practices  and disclosed in accordance with NI 43-101, with an Effective Date of March 21, 2012.

The Mineral Resource was estimated by the OK interpolation method using capped grade values. The  Mineral  Resource  for  the  Project  was  classified  as  having  Indicated  and  Inferred  Resources based on drillhole spacing, drillhole location and sample data population.

The Mineral Resource Estimate for the deposit, at 0.4 Nb2O5% CoG, reported an Indicated Resource of 19.3 Mt at 0.67 Nb2O5%; and an Inferred Resource of 83.3 Mt at 0.63 Nb2O55%.

Table 6-1 and Table 6-2 present the Tetra Tech Indicated and Inferred Resource estimates for the Project at various Nb2O5% cut-offs between 0.35 and 0.70 Nb2O5%.

Tetra Tech concluded that the Project warranted further investigation and development.

## 6.3.3 SRK Estimates (September 2014 - August 2015)

In  September  2014,  SRK  produced  an  NI  43-101  Technical  Report  for  the  Project  based  on  the historical drillhole information and the results from Phase I of the 2014 NioCorp drilling program. The Mineral Resource Estimate for the Project was prepared in accordance with CIM Best Practices and disclosed in accordance with NI 43-101, with an Effective Date of September 9, 2014.

The Mineral Resource was estimated by the OK interpolation method using capped grade values. The  Mineral  Resource  for  the  Project  was  classified  as  having  Indicated  and  Inferred  Resources based on drillhole spacing, drillhole location and sample data population.

The Mineral Resource Estimate for the deposit, at 0.3 Nb2O5% CoG, is an Indicated Resource of 28.2 Mt at 0.63 Nb2O5%; and an Inferred Resource of 132.8 Mt at 0.55 Nb2O5%.

Table  6-3  presents  the  Indicated  and  Inferred  Resource  estimates  for  the  Project,  and  Table  6-4 shows the grade tonnage sensitivity at various Nb2O5% cut-offs between 0.35 and 0.70 Nb2O5%.

SRK  concluded  that  the  Project  warranted  further  infill  drilling  to  increase  the  current  level  of confidence,  and  commencement  continuation  of  other  technical  disciplines  investigations  such  as geotechnical and hydrogeological to improve the investigation and development of the Project.

In  February  2015,  an  initial  estimate  of  the  Nb2O5  Mineral  Resource  was  completed  by  SRK Consulting on the Elk Creek deposit (Table 6-5). The estimate was based on the certified assays for Nb2O5 only, with the estimate subsequently updated on receipt of the TiO2 and Sc\_ppm assays to produce the current Mineral Resource dated April 28, 2015.

This statement includes the estimated Mineral Resources for Nb2O5, TiO2 and Sc for the deposit and was disclosed on February 23, 2015, with an Effective Date of April 28, 2015.

The estimated cost information presented here is used as a guide to assist in the preparation of a Mineral Resource Statement and to select an appropriate resource reporting CoG. The calculated Nb2O5 CoG is based on a fixed relationship between Nb2O5 and TiO2 of 3.5 TiO2:1 Nb2O5. Similarly, a Nb2O5 and Sc fixed relationship of and 9 Sc: 1 Nb2O5 was used for the CoG calculation.

The Mineral Resource was filtered to show all blocks above the mining cut-off to ensure estimates form suitable mining targets. Any isolated blocks of material reporting above cut-off can be removed

as they will unlikely warrant the cost of development. No such cases existed at the Project and all material  within  the  geological  wireframes  above  a  cut-off  of  0.3  Nb2O5%  has  been  considered  to have reasonable prospects of being mined via underground methods.

As a result of positive indications from the company's ongoing metallurgical testing and development program,  titanium  (TiO2)  and  scandium  (Sc)  were  added  to  the  Mineral  Resource  Statement  in February 2015. Both of these metals can be recovered with simple additions to the existing process flowsheet,  and  would  provide  additional  revenue  streams  that  would  complement  the  planned production of ferroniobium.

The Mineral Resource Statement in Table 6-6 has been determined using the economic parameters as defined in from the 2015 PEA. The Mineral Resource was disclosed on February 23, 2015.

## 6.4 Historic Production

There has been no historical production from the Mineral Resource at the Project.

## 7 Geological Setting and Mineralization

## 7.1 Regional Geology

The Nebraska Precambrian basement predominantly comprises granite, diorite, basalt, anorthosite, gneiss,  schist  and  clastic  sediments.  A  series  of  island  arcs  sutured  onto  the  Archean  continent created the basic framework of the area. This suture left a north-trending intervening boundary zone ancestral  to  the  Nemaha  Uplift,  providing  a  pre-existing  tectonic  framework  which  controlled  the trend of the later Midcontinent Rift System (1.0 to 1.2 Ga) (Carlson &amp; Treves, 2005). The Carbonatite is located at the northeast extremity of the Nemaha Uplift.

The Midcontinent Rift System, or Keweenawan Rift, comprises mafic igneous rocks and forms a belt over 2,000 km long and 55 km wide that is exposed at surface in the Lake Superior Region and extends southwards through the states of Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, Nebraska and into Kansas (Carlson, 1992). Both basalt and associated red clastic sedimentary rocks are found in the Precambrian basement of southeastern Nebraska. These rocks are very similar to those found in the Lake Superior region and are thus considered to be a product of the Keweenawan rifting (Burchett and  Reed,  1967;  Treves  et  al.,  1983).  Figure  7-1  illustrates the major  rock  types  of the Midcontinental Rift system.

The  Nemaha  Uplift  (300  Ma)  extends  southward  as  a  narrow  belt  from  southeastern  Nebraska across Kansas along the midcontinent rift system (King, 1969) (Figure 7-1). Along the northern and eastern  margins  are  complex  fault  zones  and  steeply  dipping  units.  Regional  north-northeast  to northeast  striking  faults  are  locally  transected  by  northwest  trending  ones,  including  the  Central Plains mega shear (Central Missouri Fault) to the north and the Oklahoma mega shear to the south (McBee, 2003). The Carbonatite body intruded near to the axis of the Nemaha uplift and has similar dates to a cluster of carbonatites north of Lake Superior that are in the range of 560 to 580 Ma. (Woolley, 1989; Erdosh, 1979). Temporally the Carbonatite occurs near the boundary between the Penokean Orogen (approximately 1,840 Ma) and the Dawes terrane (1,780 Ma) of the Central Plains Orogen (Carlson and Treves, 2005).

Figure 7-2 shows a merged airborne magnetic anomaly map of Nebraska, Kansas and Oklahoma states (USGS, 2004) showing the Midcontinent Rift and Nemaha Uplift systems.

Showing the Midcontinental Rift and Nemaha Uplift.

Regional geophysical data and drilling have confirmed the presence of kimberlitic intrusive bodies in northern Kansas to the southwest of the Carbonatite. These kimberlites were emplaced along the rift system during Cretaceous time (Berendsen and Weis, 2001).

The  Paleozoic  rocks  overlying  the  Carbonatite  region  are  dominated  by  approximately  200  m  of essentially flat-lying Pennsylvanian marine strata consisting of carbonates, sandstones and shales. The  eastern  portion  of  Nebraska  was  glaciated  several  times  throughout  the  early  Pleistocene (Wayne, 1981), resulting in the deposition of approximately 50 m of unconsolidated till.

## 7.2 Property Geology

The  property  includes  the  Carbonatite  that  has  intruded  older  Precambrian  granitic  and  low-  to medium-grade metamorphic basement rocks. The Carbonatite and Precambrian rocks are believed to  be  unconformably  overlain  by  approximately  200  m  of  Paleozoic  marine  sedimentary  rocks  of Pennsylvanian age (ca. 299 to 318 Ma).

As a result of this thick cover, there is no surface outcrop within the Project area of the Carbonatite, which  was  identified  and  targeted  through  magnetic  surveys  and  confirmed  through  subsequent drilling. The available magnetic data indicates dominant northeast, west-northwest striking lineaments and secondary northwest and north oriented features that mimic the position of regional faults parallel and/or perpendicular to the Nemaha Uplift.

## 7.3 Elk Creek Carbonatite

The  Elk  Creek  Carbonatite  is  an  elliptical  magmatic  body  with  northwest  trending  long  axis perpendicular  to  the  strike  of  the  1.1  Ga  Midcontinent  Rift  System,  near  the  northern  part  of  the Nemaha  uplift  (Burchett,  1982;  Carlson,  1997).  It  was  first  discovered  by  drilling  in  1971  and tentatively  identified  as  a  carbonatite  on  the  basis  that  it  resembled  rocks  of  the  Fen  District  of Norway (Treves et al., 1972a and 1972b). The definitive confirmation of carbonatite was completed using Rare Earth Element (REE), P205 and  87 Sr/ 86 Sr isotope analysis (Brookins et al., 1975). The Carbonatite has also been compared to the Iron Hill carbonatite stock in Gunnison County, Colorado on the basis of similar mineralogy (Xu, 1996).

The Carbonatite consists predominantly of dolomite, calcite and ankerite, with lesser chlorite, barite, phlogopite, pyrochlore, serpentine, fluorite, sulfides and quartz (Xu, 1996). It is, however, believed from stratigraphic reconstruction based on drill core observation in the area that the carbonatite is unconformably  overlain by approximately 200  m  of essentially flat-lying Palaeozoic marine sedimentary rocks, including carbonates, sandstones and shales of Pennsylvanian age (ca. 299 to 318 Ma).

Current studies suggest that the Carbonatite was emplaced ca. 500 Ma (Xu, 1996) in response to stress  along  the  Nemaha  Uplift  boundary  predating  deposition  of  the  Pennsylvanian  sedimentary sequence (ca. 299 to 318 Ma). However, observations on drill cores from the Project site show that the  contact  between  the  Carbonatite  body  and  the  Pennsylvanian  sediments  is  a  sheared  but oxidized contact suggesting that the Carbonatite is intrusive in the Pennsylvanian sequence (Figure 7-3 and Figure 7-4). Furthermore, both rock types appear to have been affected by at least one main brittle-ductile  deformation  event  resulting  in  formation  of  fault  structures.  Microstructures  including sub-vertical and sub-horizontal tension veins, together with related sheared veins and fault planes displaying  sub-vertical  and  sub-horizontal  slickensides  along  drill  cores  are  indications  for  the presence of extensional and oblique to strike-slip faults  (Figure  7-3  and  Figure  7-4).  These  faults could correspond to the magnetic lineaments present in the area. Investigations aiming to define the location, as well as the orientation and kinematics of these structures are discussed in more detail in Section 7.6.

Microstructures  presented  in  Figure  7-3  suggest  the  presence  of  extensional  and  strike-slip  to oblique faults in the area as follows: (A) Spaced foliation and breccia in the contact zone between the  Carbonatite  and  the  Pennsylvanian  sequence;  Subvertical  (B)  and  subhorizontal  (C)  tension veins  and  associated  sheared  veins  in  the  carbonatite;  Fault  planes  showing  subvertical  (D)  and oblique  (E)  slickensides  in  the  carbonatite.  Note  that  observations  were  made  on  cores  from subvertical holes (about 70° plunge).

## 7.3.1 Age Dating

An original hypothesis suggested that the Elk Creek Carbonatite was of Keweenawan age (Treves et al., 1983) or ca. 1,100 Ma. However, in 1985, Paterman, of the USGS Isotope Laboratory, provided a K-Ar age of 544 (±7) Ma (Cambrian) from biotite within the Carbonatite. Two more K-Ar dates were provided  by  Georgia  State  University  (M.  Ghazi  (date  unknown))  which  also  provided  dates  from biotite samples. The ages of 464 (±5) Ma and 484 (±5) Ma, respectively, are Ordovician and thus much  younger  than  the  Midcontinent  Rift  System.  Whilst  these  radiometric  dates  provide  a generalized time range for the Carbonatite intrusion, additional age dating is needed to establish a more precise date.

## 7.4 Carbonatite Lithological Units

The lithological units present in the carbonatite complex were defined by Molycorp during their drill programs and simplified by Dahrouge for interpretation purposes during each stage of the Project (2011 and 2014). The units in Table 7-1 (youngest at the top) represent the data captured during the 2011 field program. The information was compiled from the drill logs and the corresponding geology reports for each drillhole.

A  study  of  six  Molycorp  drillholes  by  Xu  (1996)  identified  two  main  phases  within  the  area,  a carbonate phase and a silicate phase. The study was based on drillholes 2-B-71 (also known as 'NN1'), EC-40, EC-42, EC-50, EC-70 and EC- 82.

The carbonate phase was classified into two main units (defined by texture, massive or brecciated) and several sub-units (defined by mineralogy as presented below).

## Massive Carbonatite

- · Dolomite carbonatite;
- · Apatite-bearing dolomite carbonatite and pyrochlore-bearing carbonatite;
- · Apatite-dolomite carbonatite;
- · Hematite-dolomite carbonatite; and
- · Magnetite-dolomite carbonatite.

## Brecciated Carbonatite

The silicate phase was also classified into several units as follows:

- · Altered basalt;
- · Altered lamprophyre; and
- · Altered syenite.

In the 2014 drilling, the Dahrouge geologists have split the dolCarb units down into a number of key units using the information of the different phases of carbonatite. The main Carbonatite lithologies used are:

- · Dolomite Carbonatite - dolCarb;
- · Dolomite Carbonatite Breccia - dolCarbBc;
- · Hematite-dolomite Carbonatite - hemdolCarb;
- · Magnetite-dolomite Carbonatite - mdolCarb; and
- · Magnetite-dolomite Carbonatite Breccia - mdolCarbBc.

SRK considers  the  more  detailed  split  of  the  Carbonatite  units  to  be  relevant  to  determining  the distribution of different grade populations as supported by statistics (discussed in Section 14.3). The most significant difference is the change in the logging codes between dolCarb and mdolCarb, in terms of the major rock types.

## 7.5 Marine Sedimentary Rocks

The State of Nebraska-wide test hole database contains information for about 5,500 test holes drilled since 1930 by the CSD, School of Natural Resources (SNR), UNL (UNL-CSD/SNR), and cooperating agencies.  Test  hole  location  data,  as  well  as  lithological  descriptions,  stratigraphic  interpretations and geophysical log records are included in the database. In addition, UNL-CSD/SNR maintains an extensive collection of geologic samples obtained from the drilling process (UNL-CSD/SNR website).

The overlying sedimentary units on the Project are of Pennsylvanian age. The CSD's 1971 test hole 2-B-71, also labelled NN-1 by Molycorp, intersected several formations of overlying Pennsylvanian strata (Table 7-2).

## 7.6 Structural Geology

On  the  basis  of  data  provided  to  carry  out  this  structural  study,  SRK  concludes  that  the  Project contains  five  main  sets  of  brittle  faults  variably  cutting  through  the  Pennsylvanian  rocks  and  the carbonatite boundary which appears to be tectonic. The orientations of the faults were determined by comparing  Acoustic  Televiewer  (ATV)  logs  with  specific  SRK  customized  structural  core  logging data, and by undertaking a preliminary interpretation of the provided geophysics images.

SRK has used this data to model the fault pattern in 3-D for use in further resource estimation and geotechnical studies. The overall fault model included approximately 28 structures with the vicinity of the Project with varying levels of confidence. Based on a review within the mineralization at least three  key  northeast  trending  faults  have  been  identified  and  used  during  the  geological  model process.

The joints and veins define orientation sets comparable to the fault trends. Hematite veins, which may be up to a meter thick, represent the weakest fault and joint  infilling  material  which  may  be problematic for mining and should therefore be given more attention during any future geotechnical studies.

## 7.7 Mineralization

The  property  hosts  niobium,  titanium,  and  scandium  mineralization  as  well  as  REE  and  barium mineralization  that  occur  within  the  Elk  Creek  Carbonatite. The  current  known  extents  of  the Carbonatite unit are approximately 950 m along strike, 300 m wide, and 750 m in dip extent, below the unconformity. For the purposes of this report, niobium, titanium and scandium are considered the main  elements  of  interests,  within  additional  background  on  REE  mineralization  included  and discussed below.

In the Molycorp database, nearly every drillhole contains a separate geological report summarizing rock  types, assay results and associated petrographic descriptions identifying niobium and/or REE minerals.  Niobium is reported to be hosted in pyrochlore and REE mineralization is reported to occur as  bästnasite,  parisite,  synchysite  and  monazite.  SRK  highlighted  during  the  2014  NI  43-101 Technical Report that the level of detail shown in the geological reports has not been transferred to the  electronic  database  in  completeness.  This  has  been  improved  in  the  revised  database  by  a Dahrouge geologist familiar with the current logging codes, conducting a review of the historical logs, reports and available drill core to provide an updated geological database.

## 7.7.1 Niobium Mineralization

The  deposit  contains  significant  concentrations  of  niobium. Based  on  the  metallurgical  test  work completed to date at a number  of laboratories using QEMSCAN®  analysis,  the  niobium mineralization  is  known  to  be  fine  grained,  and  that  77%  of  the  niobium  occurs  in  the  mineral pyrochlore, while the balance occurs in an iron-titanium-niobium oxide mineral of varying composition.

## 7.7.2 Additional Elements of Economic Interest

Within the Elk Creek Carbonatite a host of other elements exist with varying degrees of concentration. The Company has completed both whole rock analysis and multi-element analysis on all samples for the 2014 program, plus resampling of selected historical core/pulps between 2011 and 2014.

As the metallurgical test work advanced during 2014 and 2015, the ability to obtain a titanium dioxide (TiO2) and scandium (Sc) product became apparent. TiO2 is typically found to be related to the niobium grades with a range of 3:1 to 4:1 found within the core of the deposit. The scandium mineralization does not directly correlate to niobium mineralization, but does show a grade increase with increasing niobium at low grades, but then a scatter of grades (on average considered higher grades 60 to 80 ppm), within the mdolCarb units.

## 7.7.3 Rare Earth Element Mineralization

Within  the  Elk  Creek  Carbonatite  complex  there  are  several  occurrences  of  REE  mineralization, including the Project.  REE mineralization within the Carbonatite occurs within the following minerals:

- · Bästnasite ([Ce,La,Y]CO3F);
- · Parisite  (Ca[Ce,La]2[CO3]3F2);
- · Synchysite  (Ca(Ce,La)[F|CO3]2); and
- · Monazite ([Ce,La]PO4).

A review of historic documents for drillhole EC-93, and part of Quantum's re-sampling program due to the high grade REE mineralization as noted in the Molycorp drill logs includes an excerpt as follows:.

'Barite beforsite is the predominant lithology from 149.4 to 304.8 m. It contains xenoliths of syenite, older mafic rocks, and apatite beforsite  I, and is intruded by  younger mafic rocks.  Intervals 33  m (100 ft) long contain 2.13% to 2.75% LnO from 149.4 to 274.3 ft.  An interval 18.3 m long at 179.8 to 198.1 ft contains 3.89% LnO. The highest grade mineralization intercepted was 3.0 m at 4.72% LnO at  155.4  to  158.5 m. Lanthanide  minerals  occur  as  radial  patches  and  random  aggregates  of needles, irregular patches and vein-like aggregates.  The aggregates occur with and without quartz. The aggregates appear as light-gray patches in reddish-brown, hematite-altered beforsite.  Although individual  lanthanide  mineral  grains  are  in  the  micrometer  size  range,  aggregates  of  lanthanide minerals range from 0.23 to 8.0 mm. in maximum dimension. Monazite and bästnasite have been identified in the aggregates, and EDX spectra show Ce &gt; La.'

It  should  be  noted  that  Molycorp  term's  LnO,  or  rare-earth  oxides  (REO)  incorporates  lanthanum, cerium and neodymium along with the other 12 rare earth elements.

Present day nomenclature for REE is shown in Table 7-3.

## 8 Deposit Type

The Project is hosted within the Elk Creek Carbonatite.  By definition a carbonatite is an igneous rock body  with  greater  than  50%  modal  carbonate  minerals,  mainly  in  the  form  of  calcite,  dolomite, ankerite, or sodium- and potassium-bearing carbonates.  Carbonatites commonly occur as intrusive bodies,  such  as  isolated  sills,  dikes,  or  plugs,  although  rarely  occur  as  extrusive  rocks. Many carbonatites are associated with alkali silicate rocks (for example, syenite, nepheline syenite, ijolite, urtite,  pyroxenite,  etc.). Carbonatites  are  usually  surrounded  by  an  aureole  of  metasomatically altered  rocks  called  fenites. Carbonatite-associated  deposits  can  be  classified  as  magmatic  or metasomatic types (Richardson and Birkett, 1996).

Carbonatites have been classified based on chemical classification into four classes (Woolley and Kempe, 1989; Wyllie  and  Lee,  1998),  and  further  subdivided  based  on  mineralogical  and  textural characteristics:

- · Calcio-carbonatite coarse-grained: sövite , and finer-grained: alvikite;
- · Magnesio-carbonatite dolomite-rich: beforsite , and ankerite-rich: rauhaugite;
- · Ferro-carbonatite (iron rich carbonates); and
- · Natro-carbonatite (sodium-potassium-calcium carbonates).

The use of a chemical classification of carbonatites should be used with caution when replacement, or  metasomatic,  processes  have  altered  the  primary  composition  of  the  carbonatite  rock  (Mitchell, 2005).

The majority of carbonatite deposits are located within stable, intra-plate crustal units, although some are linked with orogenic activity, or plate separation.  It is also important to note that carbonatites tend to  occur  in  clusters,  and  in  many  places  there  has  been  repetition  of  activity  over  time  (Woolley, 1989).

Worldwide,  carbonatite  deposits  are  mined  for  niobium,  REE,  iron,  copper,  phosphate  (apatite), vermiculite and fluorite; with barite, zircon/baddeleyite, tantalum and uranium as common by-products (Richardson and Birkett, 1996).

## 9 Exploration

The Carbonatite is covered by approximately 190 to 200 m of Pennsylvanian sedimentary rocks. No surface exploration has been completed with the 2014 exploration program focusing on infill drilling of the existing Mineral Resource using diamond drilling methods. The following section provides a summary  of  the  2012  NI  43-101  Technical  Report  for  the  exploration  work  completed  by  the Company since acquiring the Project in 2010.

## 9.1 Quantum, 2010-2011

## 9.1.1 Data Compilation, 2010-2011

During  2010,  the  Company  contracted  Dahrouge  to  undertake  a  compilation  of  all  Molycorp  hard copy  data  and  digitize  all  paper  files,  including  drill  logs  and  accompanying  drill  core  geological reports, internal memos and other historic reports.

The  historic  drill  core  logs  feature  almost  all  the  106  Molycorp  drillholes,  and  four  (out  of  five) Cominco  American  drillholes.  Eight  historic  Molycorp  drill  logs  were  not  available  in  the  historic database.

The information  gathered  by  Dahrouge  has  been  compiled  into  a  central  database  (or  Elk  Creek Database) using CAE Mining Fusion software.

## 9.1.2 Quantum Re-sampling Program, 2010

Commencing in November 2010, the Company contracted Dahrouge to undertake a re-sampling of the historic drill core pulps as part of a QA/QC program to ascertain the reliability of the historic drill core  assay  results  and  to  obtain  more  detailed  analysis  of  the  REE  content  of  the  samples.  The samples  were  re-analyzed  separately  by  XRF.  The  Nb2O5  assay  results  were  validated  and incorporated into the Project database.

SRK  has  reviewed  the  results  of  the  program  and  confirms  that  it  has  followed  current  industry standards in the preparation and correlation of the database.

## 9.2 Quantum, 2011-2012

## 9.2.1 Airborne Gravity and Magnetic Geophysical Survey, 2011

In April 2011, Quantum commissioned Fugro of Ottawa, ON, to conduct high-resolution FALCONTM airborne  gravity  gradiometer  (gD)  and  Total  Magnetic  Intensity  (TMI)  geophysical  surveys.  The results of the gravity and magnetic geophysical surveys are shown in Figure 9-1 and Figure 9-2.

The survey area was centered on the Project and covered a total area of approximately 110 km 2 (approximately 10 by 11 km) around the deposit. A total of 1,176 line km were flown. Flight lines were  oriented  000/180°  azimuth  on  a  nominal  line  spacing  of  100  m.  Five  tie  lines  were  flown, oriented  at  090°/270°  azimuth,  spaced  2,750  m  apart.  All  flight  lines  were  flown  at  a  nominal clearance of 100 m (Fugro, 2011).

## 9.3 Significant Results and Interpretation

It has been noted that the 2011-2012 geophysical surveys closely match the results of the CSD and UNL geophysical surveys in the early 1970's confirming the original gravity anomaly.

Subsequently, in October 2011, Colorado-based Condor Consulting Inc. (Condor) was retained by the Company to process and analyze the FALCON™ gravity and magnetic geophysical survey data. Condor noted coincident gravity and magnetic anomalies traversing 1,200 m to the east from the known  Project.  Several  anomalies  of  higher  relative  density  and  magnetization  have  also  been identified outside of the drilled prospect area (Condor, 2011).

No further geophysical studies targeting the Elk Creek Carbonatite have been completed as part of the  current  phase  of  exploration.  SRK  considers  the  exploration  programs  completed  at  the Elk Creek deposit to date to be appropriate for the style of mineralization.

## 10 Drilling

## 10.1  Type and Extent

Mineral  Resource  definition  drilling  at  the  Project  was  conducted  in  three  phases.  The  first  was during the 1970's and 1980's by Molycorp, the second in 2011 by Quantum, and the third and latest program in 2014 by NioCorp. To date, 129 diamond core holes have been completed for a total of 64,981 m (Figure 10-1). All drilling  has  been  completed  using  a  combination  of  Tricone,  Reverse Circulation  (RC)  or  Diamond  Drilling  (DDH)  core  in  the  upper  portion  of  the  hole  within  the Pennsylvanian  sediments.  All  drilling  within  the  Carbonatite  has  been  completed  using  diamond coring methods.

To  date,  local  labor  has  been  used  by  drilling  contractors  when  preparing  the  drillhole  pads.  All drilling  has  been  completed  using  standardized  procedures  which  are  in  line  with  international standards of best practice. The drilling completed by Molycorp was completed by using company owned equipment and sampling procedures. The drilling companies used by the Company during the 2011 and 2014 drilling programs are detailed below:

- · 2011: Black Rock Drilling, LLC (BRD Personnel and Leasing Corp.), 17525 E Euclid Ave, Spokane Valley, WA 99216;
- · 2014: Envirotech Drilling LLC, 900 East 4 th  Street, Winnemucca, NV 89445
- · 2014: West-Core Drilling, LLC, 561 W Main Elko, NV 89801 USA; and
- · 2014: Idea Drilling, 1997 9th Avenue North, Virginia, MN 55792.

The  drilling has been  completed  using conventional techniques, using experienced drilling contractors. A portion of the 2014 drillholes used RC drilling within the Pennsylvanian sediments, to increase  the  efficiency  in  drilling  through  the  cover  material,  within  areas  of  strong  geological confidence.

The  following  sections  provide  a  brief  summary  of  the  resource  drilling  completed  by  Molycorp, Quantum and NioCorp (as shown in Table 10-1).

During 2015 five holes, for a total length 3,353.1 m, were drilled and were not included in the April 28, 2015 Mineral Resource Estimate. This drilling has been for the purpose of Hydrogeological and Geotechnical studies. The drilling has been completed by Idea Drilling and Envirotech Drilling LLC. No  sampling  of  these  holes  has  been  completed  to  date  and  therefore  they  have  not  been considered in the Mineral Resource, and are excluded from Table 10-1. Inclusive of these holes the total drilling on the Project is 134 holes for 68,334.1 m.

Not  all  of  the  drillholes  within  the  Project  were  used  in  the  Mineral  Resource  Estimation  that accompanies  this  report,  as  many  do  not  intersect  the  Nb2O5  anomaly  and  are  located  at  a significant distance away from the deposit. Of the 129 total drillholes within the Project, 48 drillholes are  within  the  Elk  Creek  deposit  area.  Table  10-2  summarizes  the  drillholes  used  for  the  Mineral Resource Estimation.

## 10.2  Molycorp, 1973-1986

Between 1973 and 1986, Molycorp completed a regional scale drill program over approximately 7 by 7  km  gravity  anomaly  that  includes  the  Elk  Creek  deposit.  The  total  program  consisted  of  106 drillholes for a total of approximately 46,078 m. Outside the Elk Creek deposit area, the regional drill

program was conducted on a regular grid of 610 by 610 m (2,000 by 2,000 ft) with some closely spaced holes in selected areas within the gravity anomaly.

Included in this total, some 27 holes for 16,108 m were drilled over the deposit. Drilling orientations varied considerably.

The Molycorp drillhole locations centered over the Elk Creek deposit are presented in Figure 10-1 (shown in blue).

## 10.3  Quantum, 2011

In April 2011, Quantum conducted a preliminary drill program (three holes) on the Elk Creek deposit along with two REE exploration targets (two holes). The REE holes which have been excluded from the  current  Mineral  Resource  Estimation,  as  they  do  not  intersect  the  Nb2O5  anomaly  and  are located to the east. The objectives of the drill program over the Project were to verify the presence of higher grade niobium mineralization at depth, and to infill drill the known niobium deposit in order to upgrade the resource category of the previous resource estimate and expand the known resource. The  drill  program  was  also  established  to  collect  sufficient  sample  material  for  metallurgical characterization and process development studies of the niobium mineralization.

The 2011 program consisted of five inclined drillholes, totaling 3,420 m of NQ size diameter core. Inclusive of this total, three drillholes, totaling 2,318 m were drilled into the known Elk Creek deposit. The summary of the 2011 drill program is listed in Table 10-3.

DDH  NEC11-001  targeted  the  eastern  portion  of  the  deposit  below  historic  drillhole  EC-11  and between vertical holes EC-27 and EC-30. DDH NEC11-002 was drilled into the northwestern portion of the deposit. DDH NEC11-003 was drilled into the southeastern portion of the deposit. Drillholes NEC11-004 and 005 drilled into regional REE targets and are not subject to this report and have been excluded from the Mineral Resource Estimate.

The Quantum 2011 drillhole locations centered over the Elk Creek deposit are presented in Figure 10-1 (shown in green).

Results  from  the  2011  drilling  program  provided  additional  information  on  areas  of  the  deposit  at depth  where  limited  information  was  previously  available.  The  drillholes  confirmed  the  high-grade potential of the niobium mineralization, as indicated by previous drilling completed by Molycorp.

## 10.4  NioCorp 2014 Program

No  new  drilling  for  the  purpose  of  Mineral  Resource  definition  has  been  completed  since  the February 20, 2015 Mineral Resource Estimate.

NioCorp commenced drilling on the Project using a three phased program with the aim of increasing the confidence in the 2012 Mineral Resource Estimate from Inferred to Indicated. The three phased program was originally based on 14 drillholes for approximately 12,150 m (announced in a press release on April 29 2014), but was subsequently expanded during the program to 18 drillholes for approximately  15,482  m.  Three  of  the  18  drillholes  were  drilled  for  the  purpose  of  metallurgical characterization  and  process  development  studies.  Two  of  these  drillholes,  NEC14-MET-01  and NEC14-MET-02 were not assayed, while NEC14-MET-03 was quarter cored with one quarter being assayed  and  the  remainder  used  for  metallurgical  test  work.  The  drilling  has  been  orientated  to intersect the geological model from the southwest and northeast (perpendicular to the strike), with the  exception  of  NEC14-011  and  NEC14-012,  which  were  oriented  southeast  and  northwest, respectively.

The NioCorp 2014 drillhole locations (shown in Table 10-4) are presented in Figure 10-2 (shown in red). The gray lines in Figure 10-2 are the mineral lease boundaries.

## 10.5  Procedures (NioCorp 2014 Program)

Detailed descriptions of Molycorp's drilling, sample procedures, analyses and security have not been documented and reviewed by SRK. Given Molycorp's position as a leader in the rare earth industry at the time, it is likely Molycorp applied industry best practice for the time period. The 2011 drilling campaign was managed by Dahrouge and SRK under the same quality and procedures used in the current study. The 2014 drilling program includes a quality control program to ensure the results can be  used  to  verify  earlier  drilling  results  and  add  confidence  to  the  overall  understanding  of  the deposit.

For  the  2014  drilling  program  planned  drillhole  collars  were  initially  located  using  a  handheld GarminTM Global Positioning System (GPS) and marked with wooden stakes. A tracked excavator was  used  to  construct  the  drill  pad  and  collars  were  then  relocated  using  the  GPS  with  wooden stakes after pad construction. A geological compass and an Azimuth Pointing System (APS) were used to sight in the drill to the planned azimuth and inclination.

The  2014  core  drilling  was  conducted  by  both  West-Core  Drilling  and  Idea  Drilling,  both  private contractors. West-Core used both an AVD R40 track-mounted core drill and an Atlas Copco CS-14 track-mounted core drill, while Idea used an Atlas Copco CT-20 truck-mounted core drill. Overburden was cased in all drillholes to depths ranging from 18 to 37 m. The Pennsylvanian limestones and mudstones  overlying  the  target  carbonatite  were  drilled  PQ-sized  core  and  HQ-sized  core  for drillholes  NEC14-020  to  NEC14-023.  The  Carbonatite  was  drilled  with  HQ-sized  core,  with  the

exception of the three metallurgical holes (NEC14-MET-01, NEC14-MET-02 and NEC-14MET-03), which were drilled completely using PQ-sized core. Core size reduction took place just beneath the Pennsylvanian-carbonatite  contact  at  depths  ranging  from  206  to  238  m.  The  core  drilling  rigs operated 24 hours/day and 7 days/week, with typical progress of 40 m/day.

During  the  drilling  operation,  the  core  is  retrieved  from  the  core  barrel  and  laid  sequentially  into wooden core boxes by the drilling contractor. Interval blocks are then placed at all run breaks. Once the box is full, the ends and top of the box are labeled with drillhole identification and the sequential box number. Upon completing a box, it is stacked on a pallet or on a truck bed at the drill rig. At the end of each drilling shift, the boxes of core are transported by the drilling contractor in a pickup truck to the NioCorp field office. At this point, the core is in the custody of Dahrouge Geological Consulting Ltd.  (Dahrouge).  Eight  of  the  2014  drillholes  had  piezometers  installed  in  them  after  drilling  was complete. For these drillholes, surface completion consisted of surface casing capped with a locking steel cover, a 1.2 m 2 cement pad around the surface casing and a steel name plate attached to the casing. Surface completion for the drillholes that did not have piezometers installed consisted of a steel marker post and attached name plate. All name plates include drillhole number, total depth and orientation. Abandonment of the drillholes consisted of cementing from total depth to surface in the non-piezometer drillholes and from total depth to the bottom of the piezometers in the other drillholes with piezometer installations.

## 10.5.1 Collar Surveys

All drillhole collars were initially surveyed prior to drilling using a handheld GPS. On completion of the  drillhole  an  external  contractor  ESP  INC.  (Engineering/Surveying/Planning),  based  in  Lincoln, Nebraska, has been used to provide a detailed survey of the collar location using a using a Sokkia GS2700 IS GPS, which has 10 mm horizontal and 20 mm vertical accuracy. Data has been provided to SRK in digital format in UTM (NADS83 Zone 14) grid coordinates.

The location of 24 of the 29 Molycorp drill collars, have been re-excavated as required to confirm the collar  coordinates  from  2011  over  Elk  Creek,  by  CES  Group  P.A.  Engineers  &amp;  Surveyors  (CES), based in Kansas City, Missouri. All collars were surveyed using the same UTM coordinate system.

## 10.5.2 Downhole Surveys

Initial collar surveys of dip and azimuth have been taken using compass measurements for all holes (RC and DD). Downhole surveying has been undertaken on historical  Molycorp  holes  drilled  into below the Pennsylvanian sediments at an interval of 30.48 m (100 ft).

The 2011 drilling program was surveyed at 3.05 m (10 ft) intervals, based on the drilling rod lengths used  at  the  time.  All  drillholes  were  surveyed  immediately  after  completion  of  drilling.  Downhole deviations, subsurface azimuth and dip, were mapped using a Devico DeviFlex survey tool, which is a nonmagnetic, electronic, multi-shot tool. The DeviFlex tool consists of two independent measuring systems, while three accelerometers and four strain gauges used to calculate inclination and change in azimuth.

The  DeviFlex  tool  communicates  with  a  PDA  and  the  survey  results  can  be  viewed  on  the  PDA immediately after completion of the survey. Dahrouge geologists checked the downloaded data for possible errors and inconsistencies and some readings were removed for quality control purposes.

The DeviFlex output contains a column for possible tool movement during surveying. In the event there was potential tool movement, that particular reading was removed from the dataset.

The  DeviFlex  tool  records  changes  in  azimuth,  as  opposed  to  absolute  azimuth  measurements. Because of this an initial  (surface)  survey  azimuth  is  required  to  calibrate  the  DeviFlex  downhole azimuth readings. CES surveyed all initial drillhole azimuths by surveying the azimuth of the drill rods extruding from the ground during drilling. These initial azimuth readings were used to calibrate the DeviFlex downhole change in azimuth readings and calculate absolute azimuth measurements.

The 2014 drilling program was surveyed at 6.1 m (20 ft) intervals using a Reflex GYRO survey tool. Dahrouge  geologists  operated  the  GYRO  and  collected  the  surveys. Downhole  deviations, subsurface azimuth and dip, were mapped with the GYRO, which utilizes a digital MEMS-gyro nonmagnetic  assemblage.  The  Gyro  tool  is  used  to  mitigate  magnetic  deviation  caused  by  metal equipment,  or  naturally  occurring  minerals  such  as  magnetite  and  pyrrhotite  which  occur  in  the deposit.

These  surveys  are  synchronized  electronically  with  a  receiver  at  surface,  and  recordings  are collected every 30 seconds, after the tool has had a chance to equilibrate. The Reflex GYRO has an integrated Azimuth Pointing System (APS) that is used to orientate the True North azimuth, a GPS position  and  degree  of  inclination.  Downhole  surveys  are  completed  through  the  drill  rods  and location data points are collected every 6.1 m (~20 ft).

SRK considers the methods used for the downhole surveying during the 2011 and 2014 campaigns to be in line with industry best practice. Given the long hole lengths of over 700 m, the Company has used suitable techniques to provide a continuous (ranging from 3 to 6 m), measure of the drillhole trace  from  the  base  of  the  hole.  The  use  of  a  Gyro  has  avoided  any  potential  issues  due  to  the magnetic  nature  of  the  rocks.  The  confidence  in  the  drillhole  location  of  the  Molycorp  drilling  is considered  lower  due  to  their  historic  nature  and  the  wider  measurement  spacing.  Overall  SRK consider the level of confidence in the downhole surveys to be sufficient for the declaration of an Indicated level of Mineral Resource.

## 10.6  Interpretation and Relevant Results

No new drilling has been completed since the previous NI 43-101 Technical Report for the purposes of Mineral Resource definition. The updated estimates have been based on the results of re-assays of TiO2 and Sc, which were not available at the time of the previous estimate. The only significant change  is  in  the  database  due  to  the  re-assay  of  766  samples  (inclusive  of  98  quality  control samples), from the edge of the defined mineralization limits which had not previously been assayed for TiO2 or Sc.

The drilling  has  been  conducted  by  reputable  contractors  using  industry  standard  techniques  and procedures. This work has confirmed the presence of niobium, titanium and scandium mineralization hosted  in  dolomite-carbonatite  and  lamprophyre  rocks.  In  general,  the  Lamprophyre  is  niobium depleted, but contacts between Lamprophyre and Carbonatite may be enriched.

The  historic  drillholes  within  the  deposit  and  Mineral  Resource  area  were  not  conducted  on  a systematic  grid  and  drill  spacing  varies  from  25  to  225  m.  The  major  drilling  direction  used  by NioCorp has been towards the northeast (Figure 10-3). Two sets of scissor holes were drilled to the

southwest on separate drilling lines within the central portion of the deposit, to confirm that there is no directional bias in the selected drillhole orientation.

The majority of the holes have inclinations in the order of 60° to 70°. The use of scissor holes has confirmed the sub vertical nature of the southwest contact (Figure 10-3).

SRK is of the opinion that the drilling operations were conducted by professionals using industry best practice that the core was handled, logged and sampled in an acceptable manner by professional geologists, and the results are suitable for support of a NI 43-101 compliant resource estimation.

## 11 Sample Preparation, Analysis and Security

The following section summarizes the sampling methodology used by Molycorp and the Company during the historic drilling, the 2011 and the 2014 drill programs.

## 11.1  Molycorp, 1973-1986

Detailed  descriptions  of  Molycorp's  sample  procedures,  analyses  and  security  have  not  been documented and reviewed by SRK. However, given the detailed nature of the historic drill logs and reports for the individual drillholes, and Molycorp's position as a leader in the rare earth industry at the  time,  it  is  considered  likely  that  Molycorp  applied  the  same  standards  to  their  sampling procedures.

A  review  of  previous  Technical  Report  details  by  Ms.  Beverly  Beethe,  a  sampling  technician  for Molycorp, recalled the following procedures:

- · The drill core was photographed;
- · The drill core was split with a hydraulic core splitter;
- · The core was crushed on-site, before sending samples to the lab (the crusher is no longer on site); and
- · The core crusher was cleaned between samples by using limestone blank material.

Complete  details  of  the  sampling  procedures  were  unclear  as  to  whether  the  procedures  had changed  over  the  period  of  the  drill  programs.  Photographs  of  the  core  were  not  included  with Molycorp's available historic records.

Molycorp built two well-insulated, steel buildings, located on the property of Ms. Elda Beethe (Option to  Purchase  Beethe008),  within  100  m  of  the  known  deposit.  The  buildings  were  ceded  to  Ms. Beethe  when  Molycorp  abandoned  the  Project.  The  following  italicized  text  is  excerpted  from McCallum and Cathro 2010, which provides the best detail on the known and assumed methods used during Molycorp drilling:

'It is also uncertain what methods were used to crush, pulverize, blend and split any of the original 10' intervals and composite intervals. In order to confirm some of the analyses of Molycorp's internal laboratory, some of the 10' intervals were split and combined into either 50' or 100' composites and sent  to  commercial  laboratories  for  independent  assays.  The  procedure  of  creating  the  larger composites is unknown at this time.'

Drill core samples collected were sent to Molycorp's exploration laboratory at Louviers, Colorado for niobium and LnO analysis. The analytical methods are described in an internal memo by Sisneros and Yernberg, 1983, where '…Niobium was analyzed by wavelength dispersive XRF on pressed powder  pellets,  following  pulverization  to  -325  mesh.  Molycorp  did  include  some  quality  control methods. Standardization was provided by using a variety of Elk Creek samples, which had been analyzed  by  alternative  methods  at  other  internal  Molycorp  laboratory  facilities.  Over  the  Project duration, the number and/or identification of the standards used changed several times. In 1981, the instrumentation changed from a Philips PW1212 to a PW1400.' (Sisernos and Yernberg, 1983)

The  assay  tables  from  some  of  the  holes  (EC-27  and  EC-30)  indicate  a  'tentative  test'  (XRF)  of niobium value from Louviers laboratory, and a 'commercial lab test' (XRF) of niobium values. It is

unclear which commercial laboratory conducted these tests, although the 1983 Niobium Analytical Standardization  report  mentions  that  the  Molycorp  exploration  department  occasionally  utilized Bondar-Clegg.  Notes  on  the  assay  tables  indicate  that  the  commercial  laboratory  utilized  one standard  (from  hole  EC-11)  for  its  XRF  analysis,  whereas  Louviers  utilized  19  standards  from drillhole EC-11.

The drill core, crushed (coarse reject), and pulverized material are currently being stored at a facility managed by the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL). This facility is located approximately 8.5 km south of the town of Mead, Nebraska, and approximately 63 km northeast of Lincoln, Nebraska. The core was stored at two other storage facilities on UNL property, prior to its current location. Prior to the acquisition of the core by UNL in the early 2000's, the core was stored in the steel sheds on the property of Elda Beethe.

SRK completed a site visit to the Mead Core facility by Mr. Cody Bramwell on April 15, 2014. An inventory  of  the  core  was  spot  checked  against  a  2011  core  inventory  list  originally  compiled  by Dahrouge and no discrepancies were found. The core investigation concentrated on 27 drillholes within the resource area. Table 11-1 is an inventory of core at the Mead facility filtered to include only the 26 drillholes within the resource area.

An investigation  of  the  drillholes  within  the  resource  area  at  the  Mead  facility  led  to  the  following conclusions:

- · Core boxes were generally in good condition and labeled well;
- · Not all of the historical core made it to the Mead facility with most drillholes missing between six and 26 of the first core boxes (Table 11-1);
- · No  drill  core  of  the  Pennsylvanian  strata  exists,  hence  no  information  on  the  strata  was gathered;
- · Drill core is typically NQ and some noted as being BQ;
- · All drill  core had been hydraulically split, removing the option of sampling for geotechnical purposes;
- · Accurate geotechnical and hydrogeological parameters were difficult to estimate due to the core appearing to have been hydraulically split; and
- · Identifying mineralization was difficult due to the fine grained nature of the rock and a lack of differences between mineralized and non-mineralized rock.

In addition to the drill core, there also exists an unknown inventory of sample pulps and rejects at the Mead facility.

## 11.2  Quantum Re-Sampling, 2010

The 2010/2011 re-sampling program utilized a total of 1,861 samples of pulverized material from the Molycorp drillholes that were prepared by the analytical division of Molycorp. Samples were derived from 1.52 m (5 ft) or 3.05 m (10 ft) intervals of split NQ or HQ diameter size core. The samples were selected based on the geological interpretation at the time and in areas of elevated Nb2O5 values. Not all samples have been selected continuously within each drillhole. SRK confirmed evidence of the resampling during the site inspection to the Mead Core facility.

A  rigorous  QA/QC  protocol  was  used,  and  included  the  routine  insertion  of  field  duplicates, laboratory  pulp  duplicates,  blanks  and  niobium  certified  reference  standards.  Samples  were transported to the ALS Chemex (ALS) facility in Reno, Nevada, and prepared for analysis at the ALS testing facility in North Vancouver, B.C., using method XE-XRF10, whereby samples are prepared by pulverizing to 90% passing -70 µm, then decomposed utilizing a lithium borate flux, and analysis by XRF. A portion of niobium results were checked with Hazen of Golden, Colorado (Quantum news release February 22, 2011).

## 11.3  Quantum Drilling Program, 2011

For  the  2011  sampling  program,  a  rigorous  quality  assurance  and  quality  control  protocol  was established.  It  involved  the  routine  insertion  of  field  duplicates,  laboratory  pulp  duplicates,  blanks, and  certified  reference  standards.  All  samples  were  shipped  to,  and  analyzed  by  Activation Laboratories  (Actlabs)  of  Ancaster,  ON.  An  eight-major  oxides,  rare  earths,  and  trace  element package was selected and samples were analyzed via fusion inductively coupled plasma (ICP) and inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) in addition to niobium by XRF, and fluorine by method 4F-F (news release, September 21, 2011).

## 11.4  NioCorp Drilling Program, 2014

Different  drilling  techniques,  such  as  DDH,  RC  and  tricone  drilling,  have  been  employed  to  drill through the overlying geological rock units (limestone &amp; mudstone), but all carbonatite intervals have been diamond cored. All drilling contractors at Elk Creek utilized DDH conventional wireline drilling techniques. Two drilling diameters have been used during the program with the upper portions of each cored hole drilled using PQ diameter (85 mm) for geotechnical testing and HQ diameter (63.5 mm) through the Carbonatite, with the exception of NEC14-MET-01, NEC14-MET-02 and NEC14MET-03, which were drilled entirely with PQ. Geological and geotechnical logging is completed prior to mark-up and splitting of the core and completed by onsite geologists with the number of geologists used limited to ensure consistency in the logging codes used.

SRK is responsible for the geotechnical logging. Rock quality was determined using the Q-system (Q=(RQD/ Jn )* ( Jr/ Ja)* (Jw/SRF), where RQD= Rock quality designation; Jn= Joint set number; Jr= Roughness of the most unfavorable joint or discontinuity; Ja= Degree of alteration or filling along the weakest joint; JW= Water inflow; SRF= Stress reduction factor. SRK personnel also record hardness and weathering to aid in geotechnical parameters for the future mine design.

## 11.4.1 Core Recovery

Core recovery and RQD were generally good for most drill core. Core recovery has been recorded in the data base and is measured in the field at the drilling rig by the geologist. The borehole name is noted and the drilling interval, this is compared to the actual core recovered to back calculate the recovery. The recovery information is then loaded into the sample database.

SRK has reviewed the drill core recovery results and comments that while the recoveries per hole may be as low as 2%, but the typical minimum recovery is in the order of 47% to 100%, with the average recovery per drillhole ranging from 93% to 99%.

Drill core was digitally photographed under natural outdoor or fluorescent indoor lighting prior to core cutting. All digital photos are of high resolution and stored in a digital archive format. The geological logging included observations of color, lithology, texture, structure, mineralization, and alteration. All geological information is collected at sample interval scale and recorded in a digital logging program that  has  been  custom  formatted  for  carbonatite  deposits.  Detailed  geological  core  logging  of  the Carbonatite intervals, alteration zones and its relationship to other intrusions allows sampling to be restricted by unique geological boundaries.

## 11.4.2 Sample Preparation for Analysis

Trained staff was  involved at all stages of the sampling, sample  packaging  and  sample transportation process. Day to day logging tasks were split between Dahrouge and SRK, whereby Dahrouge completed all geological and sampling related tasks, while SRK focused on geotechnical logging  requirements.  During  the  diamond  drilling  program  (including  the  RC  pre-collar  drilling  of RC/DD holes), staff members were based full time at the drill Project site to supervise the drilling and data collection including geological and geotechnical properties. Geological sampling was completed by geologists (Dahrouge), under the supervision of qualified professional geologists. Between four and six trained geologists acted as samplers.

Core sampling method and approach has been consistent through the 2011 and 2014 drill programs. Core was boxed on site and delivered each day to a core facility on the Project site where the core

was  logged  and  split.  For  the  2014  diamond  drilling  program,  up  to  three  coring  drill  rigs  were monitored  by  two  qualified  professional  geologists,  one  drill  supervisor  and  an  experienced geological  team.  Drill  core  was  boxed  and  transported  from  each  drill  rig  to  the  core  processing facility  (distances  up  to  800  m),  at  the  end  of  each  12  hour  shift.  Core  logging  involved  detailed geotechnical and geological information. All key geological features have been logged comprehensively.  A  Project  database  which  contains  the  relevant  rock  codes  and  lithology descriptions has been created. A total of 22 detailed rock codes have been used during the logging, which is reduced to 10 codes under a simplified logging code defined as 'MAJOR' in the database (Table 11-2). DDH core was sampled and assayed at predominantly 1 m intervals.

The drill core within each core box was marked up and then split along orientation marks. Cutting was completed using one of three electric-powered, water-cooled diamond-bladed BD 3003E core saws at the Project sample preparation and storage facility. HQ and minor intervals of PQ core were halved for assay. Drillhole NEC14-MET-03, a PQ-sized hole, was quartered with one quarter being assayed, and the remaining core packaged for metallurgical testing.

Infrequent broken or soft sections of the core (typically the iron oxide altered zones) were sampled by the geologists and an equal sample split was taken from this material. These intervals account for a  significantly  small  portion  of  the  sampled  material.  Core  not  used  for  assaying  or  metallurgical testing is stored at the Project site.

A summary of the sampling procedure used to collect core samples at the Project is as follows:

- · The entire carbonatite intersection was sampled, including the geologically logged low-grade niobium carbonatite intervals of the footwall or hangingwall, for all holes with the exception of NEC14-020 to NEC14-023 where approximately 10 m of the hangingwall was sampled;
- · Sample intervals,  generally  1  m  in  length,  were  marked  on  the  core  and  recorded  in  the geological database (Fusion Database);
- · Sample intervals were assigned a unique sample number;
- · Specific gravity measurements were performed at approximately 6 m spacing;
- · Hand-held  Niton-XRF  measurements  were  collected  on  the  core  to  assist  geological  and sample divisions;
- · Magnetic susceptibility measurements were performed on the core to assist geological and sample divisions;
- · Clearly marked sample intervals were split in half by a wet diamond saw;

- · Split intervals were cleaned prior to bagging and cutting equipment was regularly cleaned;
- · Sampled intervals were placed in durable barcoded sample bags that were clearly labelled and contain back up sample tags within each bag;
- · Sample  bags  containing  original  core  sections  and  field  inserted  control  samples  were barcode scanned and secured in 5 gallon plastic shipping pails;
- · Detailed shipping logs and preparation requests were sent in hard copy and digitally to the primary analytical laboratory;
- · Sampled core sections and blind control samples were shipped for analysis in secured pails and transferred using a bonded trucking company; and
- · The unsampled half of the core is stored in labelled wooden core boxes at the Project site for reference or further sampling.

Core samples and the core library are securely stored at the Project facility work area. This material is stored inside locked metal buildings when the Project is not operating.

## 11.4.3 Security Measures

NioCorp has rigorous security measures in place to prevent any tampering of the core or samples before and during the transport process. These measures include redundant sample identification, appropriate sample bag closures and shipment of sample bags inside pails with lids. SRK is of the opinion that these measures are consistent with or in excess of current industry best practices for projects at this scale of exploration.

## 11.4.4 Sample Analysis

The 2011 and 2014 sawn core samples were shipped to Activation Laboratories Ltd. (Actlabs) 1336 Sandhill drive, Ancaster, Ontario, Canada. Actlabs is the primary laboratory for sample preparation and for analysis of the 2011 and 2014 drill core samples. Actlabs regularly participates in proficiency testing  and  maintains  formal  approval  of  CAN-P-1578,  CAN-P-1579,  CAN-P-1585,  CAN-P-4E (ISO/IEC  17025:2005)  accreditation  from  Standards  Council  of  Canada  and  maintains  current certification  issued  March  5,  2014  and  valid  through  February  27,  2018.  Actlabs  maintains  ISO 17025 standards, which is obtained through experienced peer audits that ensure they conform to recognized  analytical  standards  and  that  the  accredited  method  validation  verifies  a  number  of analytical  variables  designed  to  ensures  that  data  obtained  from  these  methods  are  defensible. Actlabs maintain a custom Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) system to provide the traceability necessary for today's stringent reporting requirements.

The 2014 sampling program employed SGS as an external check laboratory. SGS is an integrated geochemistry, mineralogy and  metallurgy laboratory in Lakefield, ON,  which  has  extensive experience with Nb2O5 and REE analysis for both exploration and metallurgy projects. SGS Lakefield is ISO17025 accredited for the analysis methods used on this Project (GO\_XRF76V &amp; GE\_ICP90A).

Core samples were shipped to Actlabs, where they were received, weighed, prepared, and assayed. Sample preparation is completed using Actlabs' RX1 preparation package that has been modified to meet the Project requirements. A summary of the process is detailed below:

- · Samples were received and cataloged;
- · Collect as received sample weight (kg);
- · Drying of the whole sample at 60°C for 12 hours, in a customized high air flow drying room;

- · Collect dry sample weight (kg);
- · Crushed in a jaw crusher (Boyd crushers) to 90% passing -10 mesh (2 mm), with quartz cleaner between each sample;
- · Riffle split (RSD splitters or option of Jones Riffle split) coarse crushed sample and extract a 250 g sample;
- · Pulverized  250  g  sample  using  ESSA  pulverizers  with  ring  and  puck  bowls  to  95%  -200 mesh (75 µm), with quartz cleaner between each sample;
- · Laboratory internal coarse-reject duplicates (1 in 50 ) and Pulp duplicates (1 in 30) are also routinely prepared; and
- · Quality  of  the  rejects  and  pulps  are  routinely  monitored  to  ensure  proper  preparation procedures are performed.

During the preparation procedure coarse-reject splits and pulp-splits are extracted from the original core  sections  for  primary  laboratory  and  secondary  (external)  laboratory  check  analysis.  These samples  are  then  inserted  into  the  sampled  sequence  and/or  shipped  to  the  external  check laboratory, SGS (Lakefield), for analysis.

Core samples were systematically assayed at Actlabs for niobium (Nb2O5) and tantalum (Ta2O5) by XRF analysis, using a Panalytical Axios-mAX, following a lithium metaborate/tetraborate fusion of a 2 g sample. All XRF analysis followed procedures outlined in Actlabs '8-XRF' package, with selected analytical results provided for Nb2O5 and Ta2O5. Whole Rock analysis and 43 Major Elements were completed using ICP and ICP/MS (by a Perkin Elmer Sciex ELAN 6000, 6100, 9000 ICP/MS) finish following  a  Lithium  metaborate/tetraborate  fusion  preparation  as  defined  by  analytical  Actlabs' '8-REE Major Elements Fusion ICP(WRA)/Trace Elements Fusion ICP/MS(WRA4B2)' package.

Additional analysis was performed for fluoride, using analytical package '4F-F'. Fluoride content is quantified  using  a  fluoride  ion  electrode  to  directly  measure  fluoride-ion  activity,  when  a  prepared fuseate is dissolved in dilute nitric acid and its ionic strength adjusted in ammonium citrate buffer. Prior  to  analysis  sample  is  prepped  using  a  combined  fusion  with  lithium  metaborate  and  lithium tetraborate  in  induction  furnace.  Fluoride  analysis  was  completed  for  2014  drillholes,  NEC14-006, NEC14-007, and NEC14-008.

All QC data are registered in the LIMS system and Assay results have been returned to NioCorp and the overseeing professional geologists in electronic format and loaded into the sample database with the batch number and date of assay recorded after review for QA/QC.

External  pulp  check  samples  were  submitted  to  SGS  (Lakefield)  Labs,  as  a  third  party  analytical result confirmation. Pulp samples and their control samples were prepared by Actlabs and shipped to SGS (Lakefield), where they were received, evaluated for sample quality and re-homogenized, and assayed. SGS (Lakefield) prepared and re-homogenized samples prior to analysis using MISC80 package prior to analysis. During preparation SGS completed a 10% sieve check (SCR32 package) to ensure 95% sample pulverization passes 200 mesh (75 µm) preparation requirements. Samples were assayed using an XRF analysis for Nb2O5 and 13 major Whole Rock oxides, following a borate fusion  as  defined  under  SGS  package  'GO  XRF76V  -  ORE  GRADE'  (Table  11-3).  Scandium analysis has been completed at SGS laboratory using GE\_ICP90A package which has a detection limit of 5 ppm.

## 11.4.5 NioCorp 2016 Re-assay Program

During the 2015 Mineral Resource Estimate completed by SRK, it was noted that a portion of the database did not have TiO2 and Sc grades for use in the estimate. The samples have been sourced from the Company storage facility in Mead and submitted to Actlabs using the same, Code 8-Nb2O5 &amp; Ta2O5 - XRF Option, and ICP/MS methods described in Section 11.4.4 of this report.

The sourced samples are a combination of chips, pulps and pulverized samples from the original ½ NQ core samples. The samples have been selected based on sample lists of absent values from the 2015 Mineral Resource Estimate, and were located under the guidance of the Company geologist. SRK has been supplied with a detailed list of each sample, with a description of the original sample type. In addition to the resubmitted samples NioCorp have also included QA/QC samples in the form of standards and duplicates. In total 766 samples were included in the program of which 44 where pulp  duplicates  and  55  were  standard  reference  material.  A  summary  of  the  submissions  for  the 2016 program are shown in Table 11-4.

## 11.5  Quality Assurance/Quality Control Procedures

The Company has integrated a series of routine QA/QC procedures throughout the sampling and analytical analysis for both the 2011 and 2014 drilling programs, to ensure a high level of quality is maintained throughout the process. SRK has not reviewed any QA/QC data for the Molycorp drilling program, as no information has been detailed in the database. Definition of quality of the historical assays  has  been  based  on  resampling/verification  work  completed  by  Dahrouge  during  2010  to 2011.

- · A  total  of  1,861  samples  (approximately  44%  of  the  original  assays)  were  selected  for reanalysis during the program and subjected to the current QA/QC protocols. The selection for re-assay was based on available material and proximity to the mineralization wireframe used during that study.
- · In  2015  another  re-assay  program  was  completed  which  consisted  of  1,335  pulps,  which previously were absent for scandium.
- · In 2016 a final re-assay program of 668 historical pulps (plus 98 QA/QC submissions) was completed.

The following control measures were used to monitor both the precision and accuracy of sampling, sub-sampling, preparation and assaying. For the 2011 and 2014 sampling the QA/QC consisted of the  insertion  of  duplicate  samples  taken  from  various  stages  of  the  process,  insertion  of  known control samples (Standards Reference Material (SRM) and Blanks), plus an external check at a SGS laboratory. A summary of the type of samples, source and level of insertion is included in Table 11-5 and  Table  11-6.  Note  percentages  are  reported  as  proportion  of  samples  vs.  the  original submissions, unless otherwise noted.

In addition to the QA/QC Program which accompanied the 2014 drilling program, there was also a QA/QC Program which accompanied the 2014 re-assay program which was undertaken to increase the database size for both titanium and scandium analysis. The 2014 re-assay program consisted of submitting  1,335  historic  Molycorp  pulps  for  scandium  analysis.  QA/QC  for  the  re-assay  program consisted of the insertion of pulp duplicate samples and SRMs. A summary of the type of samples, source and level of insertion for the re-assay program is included in Table 11-7.

SRK  highlighted  in  2015  that  due  to  the  timing  of  the  relatively  recent  developments  within  the metallurgical database the routine submission of 2014 pulps did not include a scandium SRM. The lack  of  scandium  SRM  has  been  addressed  during  the  2016  submissions.  In  the  absence  of scandium  SRM's  for  the  previous  submissions  SRK  relied  on  the  analysis  of  duplicate  results  to assign confidence. SRK is comfortable that the quality of the assays during these submissions is sufficient to define a Mineral Resource. The 2016 re-assays program by NioCorp have used a SRM sourced from Geostats which has a certified value for Sc and Ti (%).

The following section provides details of the types of samples used at each section of the sampling process,  followed  by  a  discussion  of  the  results.  The  QA/QC  data  was  analyzed  by  the  Project geologist  on  a  routine  basis  prior  to  entering  the  data  into  the  central  database.  Failures  were reported directly back to the laboratory with systems in place for reanalysis (e.g., 10 samples before and after a failed standard).

SRK has been supplied with all the raw QA/QC data and has completed an independent check of the results for all NioCorp sampling. SRK identified no significant errors in terms of precision or accuracy during the checks and therefore considers the sampling database provided to be of sufficient quality for the definition of Mineral Resources.

## 11.5.1 Actions

The Company has a defined list of action points to review all QA/QC results. To review field quartz blanks a limit of 20 x ICP-MS detection limits and 2 x XRF detection limits, depending on the element being analyzed are applied. Results which report above this value are reported to the laboratory as having potential contamination.

The  SRM  has  been  sourced  from  Dillinger  Hutte  Laboratory  (Germany).  SRK  has  reviewed  the certificates for each of the SRMs and notes that no standard deviation has been supplied and only a confidence interval of 95% is shown on the certificates (based on three laboratory round robin test work). Due to a lack of information in the certificate the Company has elected to use a 5% error as a caution  limit,  and  a  10%  error  as  a  failure.  While  this  is  not  generally  accepted  as  best  practice, which would be based on 2x or 3x standard deviations for caution or failure, SRK agrees that the limits applied  are  reasonably  tight  which  provide  a  reasonable  level  of  control  in  assigning confidence  to  the  assay  results.  SRK  noted  no  significant  difference  in  the  potential  pass/fail decisions  using  either  the  10%  or  3x  95%  confidence  limits  from  the  certificate,  and  therefore considers the current limits to be acceptable.

In terms of the duplicate samples, no re-assay are requested based on the field duplicates, which are  monitored  for  sample  fluctuations  and  local  variability.  The  reject  and  pulp  duplicates  are reviewed and re-assays requested on values in excess of 20% difference using the equation:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

When Duplicates or SRMs fail, the 10 sequential samples on either side of the QC Sample are reanalyzed or re-analysis of the entire batch is requested, depending on the fail type, location, and sample range.

## 11.5.2 Field Sample Collection, Identification, Labeling, Insertion of Field Controls and Shipment

Sample tickets were assigned initially at the core shed using barcodes with duplicate tickets placed in  the  bag  and  on  the  outside  of  the  bag,  In  addition  to  the  routine  samples  a  number  of  check samples  (QC)  were  routinely  inserted.  Trained  staff  was  involved  at  all  stages  of  the  sampling, sample packaging and sample transportation process.

Sample  identification  was  confirmed  using  barcode  labeling  and  visual  sample  type  comparisons prior  to  sample  shipment.  Utilization  of  barcoded  samples  ensured  both  shipment  forms  and analytical labs used accurate information. Two types of QC samples were inserted at this stage of the process which includes the following:

- · Field  ¼-core  duplicates  -  1  in  20  (5%),  inserted  to  test  mineralization  and  sampling variability;
- · Field quartz blanks - 1 in 20 (5%) Blanks were inserted within or immediately after samples collected from mineralized intervals, targeting zones of elevated visual mineralization, where possible; and
- · SRM material - 1 in 20 (5%) is inserted in the field with the sample sequence.

## 11.5.3 Sample Preparation and Insertion of Pre-Selected and Quality Control Samples: Actlabs

Samples were dispatched to the laboratory via commercial transport. The laboratory received and weighed  the  samples.  Receiving  logs  were  monitored  by  Dahrouge,  which  were  then  checked against original sample lists to ensure accuracy.

The standard sample preparation at the laboratory targeted the criteria of 95% passing 200 mesh (-200 mesh). The high passing rate and the fine mesh are required to ensure the niobium minerals are sufficiently liberated for sub-sampling due to the fine size fractions known from metallurgical and petrographical studies.

To  ensure  quality  throughout  the  sample  preparation  phase,  NioCorp  (via  Dahrouge)  utilized  the insertion  and  splitting  of  pre-selected  control  and  duplicate  samples,  based  on  the  insertion  rates shown previously in Table 11-7.

## 11.5.4 Results

## Standards (SRMs)

The 2014 Program included 496 SRMs inserted in Actlabs batches as part of the routine sample submissions. The material was sourced from Dillinger Haute laboratory (Germany). A summary of the  defined  limits  and  results  for  Nb2O5 and  TiO2 are  shown  in  Table  11-8  and  Table  11-9, respectively. The 2016 program included 55 SRMs inserted in Actlabs batches with a summary of the  sample  types  and  results  included  in  Table  11-10.  The  2016  submissions  included  certified values for scandium. The tables show the mean assay grades versus the assigned, plus a summary of the number of samples returned outside of the warning and acceptable limits.

The results for Nb2O5 (Figure 11-1) from the SRM submissions have been within acceptable limits, with results generally reporting slightly above the assigned grades (between 2.4% and 4.4%). This can be seen in SX18-02 with the assay values typically reporting above the assigned value of the SRM. In general these range between the assigned value and the ±5% caution line. Statistically the results indicate a slight high bias across all grade ranges with the differences between the mean and assigned grades ranging from 2.4% to 4.4%. A total of six samples have reported outside the failure level of ±10%.

Analysis of the selected SRM used for Nb2O5 assay certificates also provides an expected value and associated range for TiO2, for all four SRM's selected (Figure 11-2). The most significant issue to note is that the grade range of the TiO2 in the SRM is in the order of 0.25% to 0.30%, which is an order of magnitude lower than the typical grade ranges at the Project of 2.0% to 3.5% within the geological wireframe. The results from the low-grade analysis shows the analyses are typically below the assigned grade within 5% to 10%. The lowest performance is noted in SX-18-04 where a number of the assays report less than 10% low.

Given the low-grade nature of the assays in the TiO2 SRMs SRK has relied more heavily on the duplicate assays and external checks by SGS, and the results of the 2016 re-assay program.

The routine sample submissions to Actlabs (pre-2014), were focused on Nb2O5, which predates the 2016 changes in the metallurgical flowsheet for TiO2 and Sc recovery. The revised focus on TiO2 and Sc the company conducted a re-assay program of 2011 sample pulps which had not previously been analyzed for TiO2 or Sc. Since this date:

- · 67  scandium  SRM  submissions  have  been  analyzed  during  the  2014  submission  (Figure 11-3).; and
- · 55 scandium SRM submissions have been analyzed to during the 2016 submission.

The  results  indicate  good  correlation  between  the  laboratory  scandium  values  and  the  expected grade with a difference in the mean of 0.36 ppm or 0.4%. A total of three samples have reported above the guideline line of 3 standard deviations during the study.

Results from the 2016 re-assay program included a total of 55 SRMs and have been reviewed by SRK. The results for the TiO2 and Sc are presented in Figure 11-4.

which shows that the majority of sample are within the 10% control lines used by NioCorp, and that most also report within the tighter 5% control (warning) lines used.

Overall the review shows the laboratory has over reported Nb2O5% based on routine submitted SRM in the order of 2% to 4%, which is within acceptable levels of error. While the TiO2 and Sc ppm are underreporting  within  similar  ranges  in  comparison.  Overall  SRK  considers  that  the  SRM's  have performed within acceptable levels of error for the reporting of Mineral Resources.

## Blanks

Coarse natural clear quartz blanks (sourced from an optical quality quartz quarry) were also included in order to:

- · Pass through the same sample preparation system as the real samples and highlight any potential contamination; and
- · Be  indistinguishable  from  real  samples  and  prevent  these  samples  being  treated  in  a different manner to real samples at the laboratory.

The following certified natural blanks were inserted within batches of samples sent to the laboratory. In  total,  454  natural  blanks  (4.7%  total  submissions)  were  inserted  at  regular  intervals  within  the sample suite which represents 4.7% of total sample submissions from the 2014 drilling program. The detection limits for Nb2O5 and TiO2 are 0.003% and 0.001% respectively. SRK has assigned control limits (approximately 10x detection) at 0.01% and 0.03% for both Nb2O5 and TiO2.

SRK  notes  that  cluster  assays  (Figure  11-5),  during  the  early  stages  of  the  drilling,  displayed potential  sample  contaminations  but  SRK  does  not  consider  this  to  be  material  to  the  Mineral Resource Estimate.

SRK notes for the TiO2 data (Figure 11-6) more variability is noted than within the Nb2O5 database, but overall the majority of the samples are less than 0.01% control line which is the equivalent of 10x the detection limit, above which potential contamination maybe identified. Overall SRK considers that the blank material has performed within acceptable levels of error and there is limited evidence of any major contamination issues at the laboratory.

## Duplicates

A total of 419 field duplicate samples, comprised of ¼ core, were resubmitted to Actlabs as part of the routine sample  submission  from  DDH  samples,  which  represent  4.3%  of  total  sample submissions from the 2014 drilling program. The results are shown in Figure 11-7, Figure 11-8 and Figure 11-9, and indicate a reasonable comparison between the original and duplicate assays. SRK has also compared the base statistics for the two datasets and found the difference in the mean grades to be 1.3% for Nb2O5 and 1.0% for TiO2, 0.4% for Sc (ppm), which indicates an acceptable level of precision at the laboratory.

260  reject  duplicate  samples,  comprising  a  second  riffled  sample  split  taken  after  crushing,  were submitted  to  Actlabs  for  reanalysis  (blind)  as  part  of  the  routine  sample  submission  from  DDH samples, which represent 2.7% of the total sample submissions from the 2014 drilling program. The results  are  shown  in  Figure  11-10,  Figure  11-11  and  Figure  11-12,  and  indicate  a  reasonable comparison between the original and duplicate assays. SRK has also compared the base statistics

for the two datasets and found the difference in the mean grades to be 0.0% for Nb2O5 and 0.3% for TiO2, 0.0% Sc (ppm) which indicates an acceptable level of precision at the laboratory.

SRK has reviewed all the data available using XY Scatter Plots, QQ-Plots and ARD vs. percentage rank charts. Based on the review SRK concludes that no significant issues in terms of the precision exists from the Actlabs assays in the database, with all phases of the sample preparation displaying strong  correlations  between  the  original  and  duplicate  assays.  The  results  confirm  the  expected trend  of  greater  precision  within  pulp  duplicates  vs.  field  duplicates,  which  have  more  potential

variability from  the  sample  itself (geology), through  the  entire sampling  process  (laboratory precision).

## 11.5.5 Check Analysis SGS vs. Actlabs

A total of 462 pulp duplicate samples, comprising a second riffled sample split of pulverized material, taken  at  the  same  time  of  extraction  as  the  primary  pulps,  were  submitted  as  part  of  the  routine sample  submission  to  a  check  laboratory  (SGS).  The  total  number  of  samples  represents  the equivalent of approximately 5% of the original submissions.

The  SRM material  submitted  to  SGS  returned  assays  which  were  very  close  to  the  SRM  values indicating  slightly  better  accuracy  than  Actlabs  for  both  Nb2O5  (Figure  11-16)  and  TiO2  (Figure 11-17). The charts indicate that similar to Actlabs the SRM's return values at or above the assigned grades  for  Nb2O5  and  values  at  or  below  the  assigned  grades  for  TiO2.  In  SRK's  opinion  both laboratories provide sufficient accuracy for Indicated Mineral Resources.

A review of the XY Scatter plot (Figure 11-18) for Nb2O5 shows Actlabs reporting consistently higher across  all  grade  ranges.  SRK  assumes  this  indicates  some  difference  either  in  the  method  or equipment accuracy at one of the laboratories. A comparison of the mean Nb2O5 grades indicates an 8.7% high bias at Actlabs compared to SGS. Review of the SRM charts submitted during the routine submissions to Actlabs show that while the assays reported higher than the expected grade, the bias may exist it is likely lower than the 8.7% shown, and closer to 2% to 4 %.

The  bias  is  consistent,  and  SRK  recommends  NioCorp  follow-up  with  both  Laboratories  to understand the fundamental difference in the sampling methods and identify the source of the bias. SGS used a borate Fusion with and XRF finish, compared to a lithium metaborate/tetraborate fusion, which  Actlabs  reports  to  provide  improved  reliability. Additional differences  noted  include  a rehomogenization of the pulp using mat rolling prior to sub-sampling at SGS.

The results  of  the  insertion  of  SRM  material  to  the  two  laboratories  indicate  that  SGS  in  general reports better accuracy than Actlabs, but the dataset is limited to 49 (SGS) submissions versus 492 (Actlabs)  submissions at Actlabs respectively. The results to date from SGS indicate the possible presence  of  bias  in  the  Nb2O5  assays,  and  SRK  recommend  that  a  more  comprehensive  set  of samples are submitted to SGS with SRMs, specifically focusing on mid to high grades, so that a correction can be built into the Actlabs assays for future estimates if required. SRK does not suspect this  will  have  a  material  impact  on  the  overall  Mineral  Resource  and  the  difference  will  be  within acceptable level of errors of the current classification system.

A review of the XY Scatter plot (Figure 11-19) for TiO2 shows a slight low bias exists between the two datasets with Actlabs reporting consistently lower across all grade ranges. SRK assumes this indicates  some  difference  in  either  method  or  equipment  accuracy  at  one  of  the  laboratories.  A comparison of the mean grades indicates a low bias towards the Actlabs results in the order of -4.6% on the mean grades (Actlabs reporting lower grades).

A  review  of  the  XY  Scatter  plot  (Figure  11-20)  for  Sc  shows  good  correlation  between  the  two datasets with Actlabs reporting slightly lower grades across all grade ranges. A comparison of the mean grades indicates good correlation with Actlabs results in the order of -0.5% of the mean grades (Actlabs reporting lower grades).

In addition to the pulp duplicates a further 44 samples were submitted which were further duplicates of the external laboratory pulp submissions. SRK has reviewed this information and does not note any significant bias.

After  considering  the  performance  of  the  two  laboratories  for  SRM  material  submitted,  SRK concludes that a slight high bias exists in Nb2O5 assays for the 2014 database, with Actlabs returning higher  assays  than  SGS.  The  bias  has  been  reported  to  the  laboratory  and  investigations  into probable  cause  are  ongoing.  No  conclusion  on  the  source  of  the  bias  is  available  at  the  time  of writing.

SRK concludes that while a bias exists it is currently within acceptable levels of error and therefore will not materially impact on the Mineral Resource. SRK has accepted the database as presented by Actlabs, and has not made any adjustments to the assay information provided.

## 11.6  Specific Gravity

NioCorp  collected  specific  gravity  (SG)  measurements  in  2011  and  2014  program,  covering  the spatial  and  temporal  aspect  of  all  drill  campaigns  and  considering  the  various  lithologies  present. Two methodologies have been implemented, (1) water immersion specific gravity measurement and (2) volumetric dry density measurement. Initially only the water immersion measurements were taken but during the site inspection by SRK it was recommended that a volumetric wet and dry density

measurements should also be taken, due to the porous or vuggy nature of some of the core causing possible errors in the water immersion method. The two methods used are described below:

Water immersion method determines the specific gravity by the following formula:

SG = (weight in air) / (weight in air - weight in water)

A 10 to 20 cm piece of whole, dry, HQ core was weighed dry on an Ohaus Scout Pro scale and the weight recorded. The weight in water is determined by attaching the core by a long nylon fishing line to the Ohaus balance, lowering the core piece into a large plastic tub located immediately below the scale and filled  with  purified  water.  The  weight  of  the  core  while  immersed  is  then  recorded,  and applied to the formula for determining the SG. Porous core samples of altered carbonatite cannot be accurately  measured  using  this  method  and  are  better  represented  by  using  the  dry  density measurement.

Dry Volumetric method determines the Density by the following formula:

## SG= [(weight in air)]/ [(π) (core length) (core radius) ] 2

A 10 to 15 cm piece of whole, HQ or PQ core, was dried in a convection oven for 60 minutes at 200°F. If the core still  has  moisture,  it  was  left  in  the  oven  for  a  longer  period  of  time.  The  exact length of the core was measured with a caliper and recorded. The sample was then weighed dry in air by suspending the core by a long nylon fishing line from an Ohaus Scout Pro balance and the weight of the core recorded. It is assumed the radius remains constant for each size of drill core: 31.75  mm  for  HQ  and  41.50  mm  for  PQ.  These  measurements  are  applied  to  the  formula  for determining  the  SG.  Calibration  weights  were  occasionally  used  to  verify  the  accuracy  of  the balance. The table used to complete the measurements is made of wood construction and tested for level by the technician.

A total of 1,225 samples have been analyzed using both method and a comparison between the two methods (Figure 11-21) shows that the water immersion method returns higher density values. A statistical  analysis  of  the  mean  grades  of  the  two  populations  where  both  methods  have  been recorded show a difference of approximately 1%. The correlation shown on the XY scatter indicates a strong correlation for the majority of cases, but for some samples there are significant differences with the volumetric density returning higher grades. This may be a result of voids, porous material.

SRK does not consider the difference to have a material impact.

## 11.7  Opinion on Adequacy

SRK comments that the decision for re-assays of the SRMs/standards is based on a percentage and not  the  typical  2  x  standard  deviation,  or  3  x  standard  deviation  which  is  generally  accepted  as industry best practice. SRK has reviewed the original certificates for the SRMs submitted as part of the  2014  program  and  notes  that  no  standard  deviation  is  shown  on  the  certificate.  The  current method of using a ±5% and ±10% limit, while not ideal provides a reasonable level of confidence in the control samples, and the Company has addressed this issue by including an additional certified reference  sample  GRE-04,  which  provides  certified  standard  deviations  which  form  the  basis  of control lines.

SRK is of the opinion that these measures are consistent with or in excess of current industry best practices for projects at this scale of exploration.

## 12 Data Verification

The geological database has been provided to SRK by Dahrouge who have been involved with the Project since the Company acquired the Project, under its former name of Quantum. In addition to the  digital  database  SRK  has  been  provided  access  to  historical  copies  of  the  data  captured  in scanned format for the drilling logs. SRK has worked along-side Dahrouge during the 2014 and 2015 work programs, completing further validation where possible to ensure a high level of confidence in the  database.  SRK  was  provided  with  extracts  from  the  database  for  the  Project  compiled  by Dahrouge and electronic copies of the original logging and assay reports.

During  the  period  of  ownership  by  the  Company  a  number  of  validation  exercises  have  been completed  on  the  database  to  provide  a  high  level  of  confidence  in  the  data  available  for  the geological modeling and associated Mineral Resource Estimate.

A re-sampling program using pulverized material from Molycorp drilling has been completed during 2010 and 2011. Initially 639 samples were selected in 2010 which was increase to a total of 1,796 samples upon completion of the program. The distribution of the re-assayed samples is throughout the deposit and not limited to a single area, and therefore SRK determined to be representative of the  entire mineralized  body.  In  2016  a  further  re-assay  program  of  766  samples  including approximately 13% QA/QC submissions was completed.

Samples were transported  to  the  ALS  Chemex  (ALS)  facility  in  Reno,  Nevada,  and  prepared  for analysis  at  the  ALS  testing  facility  in  North  Vancouver,  BC,  using  method  XE-XRF10,  whereby samples are prepared by pulverizing to 90% passing -70 µm, then decomposed utilizing a lithium borate flux, and analyzed by XRF.

For  the  2016  re-assay  program,  the  original  samples  (pulps,  pulverized  pulps  and  chip  samples) have been collected by NioCorp employees and transported to Actlabs for analysis, using the RX1 preparation  package,  whereby  samples  are  received,  dried,  crushed  to  90%  passing  -10  mesh (2 mm), the pulverized (250 g) to 95% passing 75 µm. All XRF analysis followed procedures outlined in Actlabs 8-XRF package with selected analytical results provided for Nb2O5. Whole Rock analysis and  43  major  elements  were  completed  using  ICP  and  ICP/MS  (by  a  Perkin  Elmer  Sciex  ELAN 6000, 6100, 9000 ICP/MS) finish following a Lithium metaborate/tetraborate fusion preparation as defined  by  analytical  Actlabs'  8-REE  Major  Elements  Fusion  ICP(WRA)/Trace  Elements  Fusion ICP/MS(WRA4B2) package.

Dahrouge employed a rigorous QA/QC protocol, and included the routine insertion of field duplicates, laboratory pulp duplicates, blanks and niobium certified reference standards. SRK was provided with an extract from the database for review.

The  following  Section  provides  a  summary  of  the  previous  verification  exercises  completed  by Dahrouge  and  Tetra  Tech  (as  part  of  the  previous  NI  43-101  Technical  Report),  plus  additional verification work completed by SRK as part of the current study.

## 12.1  Tetra Tech Data Verification, 2012

Tetra Tech reviewed the database of drillholes within the Project area and found:

- · The database consisted of 29 drillholes, totaling 18,159.15 m. Twenty-seven of the twentynine drillholes, totaling 17,057 m, were used in the interpretation of the Project;

- · Tetra  Tech  performed  an  internal  verification  process  of  the  Project  database  against  the original logs, surveyor reports, and laboratory-issued assay certificates;
- · The data verification process examined the collars (easting, northing, elevation), lithologies (interval, rock type), and assays (sample number, Nb2O5% value);
- · No errors were found in the collar, lithology, and assay files;
- · A  number  of  holes  (EC-25,  EC-33,  EC-34,  EC-35,  EC-36  and  EC-37)  were  missing downhole survey information; however, these holes appear on the southwestern limit of the deposit and were only used in the interpretation of the deposit, not in the resource estimate;
- · Quantum's 2010 to 2011 re-sampling data compared to historic values was less than 1% different in all cases except for one where the tolerance was less than 2% (SRK repeated this exercise and reported similar conclusions);
- · REE assay values were not included in the 2012 Mineral Resource Estimate and therefore were excluded from the verification analysis;
- · The  results  of  the  verification  study  found  the  following:  During  Quantum's  2011  drilling program, seven historic Molycorp drill collars were uncovered to survey the collar locations. The entries in the survey reports were recorded in imperial units (feet) and a factor of 0.3048 was used to convert the values into a metric system (meters). The database entries were verified against these converted values from the survey reports, and no inconsistencies were found;
- · Completed  verification  of  the  digital  database  against  the  assay  certificates  for  the  three holes drilled within the Project (NEC11-001, NEC11-002, and NEC11-003), accounting for 1,195 of the  total  6,078  samples,  or  19.66%  of  the  entire  sample  dataset.,  and  no  errors were observed;
- · It was noted that when assaying yielded results below detection limit, half the detection limit (i.e. less than 0.003 Nb2O5%) was entered in the database for samples from 2011 drillholes, whereas a value of 0 was entered for all such occurrences in holes drilled prior to 2011. SRK has utilized a value of half the detection limit for all such occurrences;
- · Completed verification on the lithological logging for potential transcription errors for NEC11001, NEC11-002, and NEC11-003. It was noted that overburden depths were not recorded in the logs but were, however, entered in the database;
- · Sixteen of the historic Molycorp drillholes were attributed with a negative azimuth value in the survey file. All drillholes were vertical therefore rendering the azimuth insignificant, and all such negative values were corrected to zero;
- · Tetra Tech identified a number of cases where minor intervals where logged in the field but were not transcribed into the database;
- · All errors were correct by Tetra Tech prior to importing into technical software;
- · The  header,  lithology,  survey,  and  assays  tables  from  the  database  were  imported  into Gemcom  GEMS™  software,  which  has  a  routine  that  checks  for  duplicate  intervals, overlapping intervals, and intervals beyond the length of the hole. No errors were identified; and
- · Completion of a site inspection on February 8 to 9, 2012, which included the inspection of Quantum's 2011 drillhole locations and of the core logging, sampling and storage facility.

Independent check samples were collected during the site visit by Tetra Tech. Four ¼ core samples were collected from the available drill core at the core storage site at Quantum's core logging and sampling facility.

- · The samples were sent to Actlabs in Ancaster, ON for analysis. The sample preparation was carried  out  by  crushing  the  sample  with  the  entire  sample  passing  a  10  Mesh  (1.7  mm) screen. The sample was then split and 250 g pulverized with hardened steel to 95% passing a 150 Mesh (106 µm) screen (Actlabs code RX1). Analysis for niobium was conducted using XRF analysis;
- · The Tetra Tech check sample analysis correlates well with Quantum's assay results for the same sample intervals in three of the four cases; and
- · Tetra Tech concluded that the analytical results for Nb2O5% have been confirmed and that they are adequate for purposes of the 2012 Technical Report.

## 12.2  SRK Validation

SRK geologists  under  the  guidance  of  Cody  Bramwell  and  David  MacDonnell  were  on  site  on  a rotational basis during the 2014 drilling program conducted by NioCorp.

## 12.2.1 Site Inspection

In  accordance  with  NI  43-101  guidelines,  Martin  Pittuck  (Qualified  Person)  visited  the  Project between June 17 and 19, 2014. The main purpose of the site visit was to:

- · Ascertain the geological and geographical setting of the Project;
- · Witness the extent of the exploration work completed to date;
- · Inspect the drilling rig(s);
- · Review the sample preparation methodology;
- · Inspect core logging and sample storage facilities;
- · Discuss geological interpretation and inspect drill core;
- · Assess logistical aspects and other practicalities relating to the exploration property; and
- · Review all five holes drilled for validation purposes during the 2011 drilling program.

SRK  was  able  to  verify  the  quality  of  geological  and  sampling  information  and  develop  an interpretation  of  niobium  grade  distributions  appropriate  to  use  in  the  Mineral  Resource  model.  A basic  review  of  the  electronic  database  against  a  number  of  drillhole  intersections  was  also completed.

In addition to the site inspection by Martin Pittuck SRK has had a continual involvement reviewing data, interpretation and modeling outcomes.

## 12.2.2 Procedures

To  verify  the  database  SRK  has  looked  at  all  aspects  of  the  data  collection.  SRK  checked  the coordinates  of  all  drillholes  via  handheld  GPS  for  NioCorp  2014  drillholes.  SRK  notes  that  the drillholes  are  well-located  and  have  been  surveyed  by  an  external  company  using  high  precision equipment.

## Survey Information

During the review of the historical database a number of potential transcription errors between the historical  locations  and  the  captured  information  have  been  identified.  This  in  part  has  been attributed to the collars co-ordinates being captured from detailed historical maps during the original data capture, which may potentially have had a different datum. Where possible historic collars (24 drillholes) were re-surveyed, but given the agricultural nature of the land were not always located at surface.  Where  this  occurred,  holes  were  re-located  using  metal  detectors  and  dug  out  using  a backhoe, and re-surveyed. The results showed a consistent shift between the historical collars used in  the  2014  estimates.  The  difference  in  the  UTM  coordinates  is  consistently  4.7  m  in  the  X coordinate and approximately 7.85 m in the Y coordinate (as shown in Table 12-1).

Based  on  the  investigation  SRK  has  adjusted  the  collar  locations  accordingly  to  account  for  the higher confidence in the differential global positioning satellite (DGPS) measurements.

## Logging Codes

SRK completed further validation of the historical database, on an on-going basis with input from the Dahrouge  geological  team.  During  the  initial  geological  modeling  exercises  SRK  noted  some difficulty in linking the geological interpretation between the NioCorp and historical database. At the request  of  SRK  a  relogging  program  was  completed  by  the  same  Dahrouge  geologist  to  ensure consistent logging codes have been used.

## Historical Assay Information (Adjustments in Molycorp Assays)

During a review of the historical assays against the raw Molycorp database obtained by Dahrouge since  SRK's  2014  estimate,  an  issue  was  noted  where  by  a  proportion  of  the  Molycorp  assay database  had  been  factored  (original  assays  factored  by  80%).  No  clear  explanation  has  been defined within these cases as to the reason for the factored assay results.

The latest  database  export  provided  to  SRK  included  information  for  the  historical  assays  broken down into the following categories:

- · Nb2O5\_%\_Orig-XRF (Molycorp data, not always reported);
- · Nb2O5\_%\_Corr-XRF (Molycorp laboratory corrected data, not always reported); and
- · Nb2O5\_%\_ALS (2010 re-assay).

Within the 2012 data compilation the general format has been to adjust any results which contained only the original Molycorp XRF data by the aforementioned 80%.

SRK estimates this has been completed for approximately 10% of the assays within the 0.3% grade shell limit, and decreasing to &lt;4% within the 0.4% grade shell. Based on a study of the mean grade using the original vs. the adjusted values the influence on the mean grade is negligible (&lt;0.5%).

As no defined reason for the adjustment has been noted, SRK has only used the original data where no re-assays (due to pulps not being located) during the 2011/2012/2016 verification programs has been completed. SRK does not anticipate the use of the factored or unfactored historical assays will have a material impact on the current Mineral Resource Estimate.

During 2016 NioCorp completed a re-assay program of historical holes which were not previously assayed for TiO2 and Sc (ppm).

## Review of 2010 - 2011 Reassay Program

SRK reviewed the 2010-2011 reassay program to confirm that the conclusions drawn by Tetra Tech are reasonable. A total of 1,796 sample pairs were used for the analysis. The results are shown in terms of summary statistics (Table 12-2), XY Scatter plots (Figure 12-1) and a half absolute relative difference (HARD) plot (Figure 12-2). Overall SRK noted the difference in the mean values to be less than 2% with the Molycorp values reporting slightly higher. SRK does not consider the difference to be material.

## Database Information

The database used for the resource estimate was constructed by Dahrouge and is stored in CAE Mining Fusion Database, and is considered to be of good quality. The use of a commercial database is considered industry best practice with the following key advantages:

- · The system facilitates fast and accurate data collection and can be configured (via pick-lists) to meet all specific data schemes and logging standards relevant to each site;
- · Drillhole related data can be recorded directly at the worksite on a touch-screen tablet or a notebook computer;
- · Data is  stored  locally  and  synchronized  to  a  single  central  database  for  the  Project  via  a network connection. Transfer to and from the Central Database provides an audit trail for any edits made to the database;
- · The  QA/QC  system  allows  users  to  achieve  immediate  data  validation  as  information  is captured.  Only  valid  field  values  and  labels  are  accepted,  ensuring  consistent  logging standards are applied across multiple staff or sites;
- · Importing laboratory results can be done directly to avoid potential transcription errors. The import function can proactively detect problems with analytical results; and
- · Export routines can be created to provide the required data for use in technical software in a consistent format.

SRK has been supplied with exports from the database covering, collar, survey, lithology,  assay, alteration  and  key  structural  indicators.  SRK  has  used  importing  routines  within  Datamine  Mining Software (Datamine) and Aranz Leapfrog® Geo software. During the importing routine the following errors have been noted:

- · Assay values in the Molycorp database where Nb2O5% values are set to zero. These are assumed by SRK to represent values below detection limits and so SRK reset the values to half of the respective half detection limit;
- · A search for sample overlaps or significant gaps in the interval tables, duplicate samples, errors  in  the  length  field,  anomalous  assay  and  survey  results  has  been  completed.  No material issues were noted in the final sample database;
- · The original signed electronic copies of the laboratory certificates were also spot verified for selected holes in the final electronic assay database and no errors were found; and
- · Within the multi-element database a number of cases exist in the Molycorp assays have yet to be re-assayed for TiO2 or Sc, as they were not included in the 2010 verification program. SRK  has  assumed  that  this  is  due  to  the  original  samples  not  being  located  for  resubmission. SRK has ignored all cases where this occurs and inserted a default 'NNS' for use in Leapfrog® during the geological modeling process.

## Absent TiO2 and Sc assays

In the 2015 Mineral Resource Estimate SRK noted a total 6.0% and 7.1% of the assays within the mineralized  wireframes  contain  absent  values  for  TiO2  and  Sc  respectively.  The  average  Nb2O5 grade for the absent values is approximately 0.3% Nb2O5.

SRK requested the Company locate the historical samples for these absent assays and complete a re-assay program primarily using ICP/MS to establish valid TiO2 and Sc grades. A total of 203 pulp

samples, 374 pulverized pulp, and 90 chip samples were located at the Mead facility and submitted to Actlabs for analysis.

The  re-assays  were  validated  by  SRK  and  the  database  updated  accordingly.  SRK  completed  a statistical analysis on the assays to note the changes prior to estimation. SRK initially compared the results from the historical Nb2O5 assays and the latest assays which indicated a slight drop in the mean grade from 0.31% to 0.29%, between the two datasets (7% reduction). SRK has used the latest assays in the current estimate to ensure no overestimation occurs within these areas.

Source: SRK, 2016

SRK  compared  the  'assumed'  grades  from  the  2015  regression  analysis  and  the  2016  Actlabs assays. The results indicated an increase in the TiO2% grades from 1.10% to 1.59%, and a decrease in  the  Sc  (ppm)  grades  from  59  to  55  ppm.  Analysis  on  XY  scatter  plots  (Figure  12-4),  shows  a reasonable  correlation  between  the  2015  values  and  Actlabs  assays  for  Sc,  but  in  general  the assumed values over-estimated the levels of Sc, but due to more aggressive capping within these values  the  maximum  Sc  values  are  higher  in  the  Actlabs  assays.  Analysis  of  the  TiO2%  data indicates the more consistent 3.5:1 ratio noted from the entire database is higher within these areas. SRK attributes these increased levels to the presence of more lamprophyric units within these areas, where a higher ratio of TiO2:Nb2O5 appears to occur.

For the latest Mineral Resource update SRK has used only assayed values and removed the coding of absent values from the estimation process.

## 12.2.3 Limitations

SRK was not limited in its access to any of the supporting data used for the resource estimation or describing the geology and mineralization in this report.

The database verification is limited to the procedures described above. All Mineral Resource data relies on the industry professionalism and integrity of those who collected and handled the database.

## 12.3  Opinion on Data Adequacy

SRK  is  of  the  opinion  that  appropriate  scientific  methods  and  best  professional  judgment  were utilized  in  the  collection  and  interpretation  of  the  data  used  in  this  report.  However,  users  of  this report are cautioned  that  the evaluation  methods  employed  herein  are  subject  to  inherent uncertainties.

SRK comments that the issues raised between SGS and Actlabs warrants further investigation to improve the accuracy of the estimates, but that changes in the impacted Nb2O5 grades should not be considered material in terms of the block values (Nb2O5, + TiO2 + Sc), and SRK has therefore used the Actlabs assays as presented in the database for the current estimate.

In summary, SRK has accepted the sample database as provided by the Company and concludes that the data is sufficiently reliable to support Mineral Resource Estimation. SRK recommends that the issues raised previously between the umpire laboratory checks should be further reviewed.

SRK would consider the work programs laid out above, in conjunction with further infill drilling will be required to gain confidence in the database to possibly delineate a Measured Mineral Resource.

## 13 Mineral Processing and Metallurgical Testing

Metallurgical test work has been conducted at SGS Canada Inc. (SGS), Hazen Research (Hazen) and  Kingston  Process  Metallurgy  (KPM)  throughout  2014,  2015,  2016  and  into  2017  to  properly design  the  required  process  units  for  the  conversion  of  mined  ore  into  niobium,  titanium  and scandium  products.  The  preliminary  test  work  was  performed  on  flotation  concentrate  which  has since been abandoned due to the poor recovery it offered. Test work then focused on whole ore as a feed and consisted of extensive exploratory bench and pilot scale hydrometallurgical test programs aimed at defining and proving out a final flowsheet using different reagents and technologies. The final process flowsheet was therefore established and proven by test work and piloting performed in all of the process units.

## 13.1  Mineral Processing

The feasibility-level comminution test work was completed in two stages at SGS Canada Inc. (SGS) in  Lakefield,  Ontario.  The  primary  stage  test  work  (SGS  2016a)  was  conducted  on  six  composite samples and 13 variability samples and included:

- · Bond Rod Mill Work Index (RWi) testing;
- · Bond Ball Mill Work Index (BWi) testing;
- · Bond Abrasion Index (Ai) testing;
- · Bond Low-energy Impact (CWi) testing;
- · JK Drop Weight (JKDW) testing; and
- · Semi-autogenous grinding (SAG) Mill Comminution (SMC) test.

The second stage of comminution  test  work  (SGS  2016b)  was  conducted  on  a  single  composite sample, using a LABWAL high-pressure grinding roll (HPGR) semi-pilot scale test work program.

The test work results indicate that the Project ore is categorized as soft to moderately hard in terms of ore hardness, and amenable to standard grinding as well as an HPGR operation.

## 13.2  Hydromet

## 13.2.1 Testing and Procedures

## Sample Representativeness

Three different whole ore samples were received and tested at SGS Minerals Lakefield site, for the development of the process described in this report:

- · Master Whole Ore Composite Sample (originally on site from previous test work and further described in previous reporting at the PEA level):
- o Assay reject sample from exploration activity, all passing 10 mesh. These samples were received at SGS Lakefield from the 2014 core drilling program and were used as feed material to test the pre-feasibility in preliminary test work programs. A total of 800 kg of feed  samples  were  processed  by  SGS  Lakefield.  A  total  of  ten  (10)  representative samples  representing  different  areas  of  the  mine  that  could  be  reasonably  expected

during  production  were  combined  into  a  composite  sample  and  used  as  feed  to  the hydrometallurgical program.

- · 2016 Pilot Plant Ore (received April 2016):
- o Assay reject sample from exploration activity, all passing 10 mesh. Approximately 2,640 kg of coarse reject material was processed by SGS Lakefield.
- · Quarter Core (received April 2016). Approximately 1,068 kg of Quarter Core material was processed by SGS Lakefield.

The received quarter core sample was stage crushed to ¾ inch and blended. Sub-samples of the quarter core sample were further stage crushed to 100% passing 6 mesh and 10 mesh and used in the test work. Head assays of the three ore samples are summarized in Table 13-1. The assay reject based samples were very similar in composition, while the quarter core sample was slightly lower in niobium, titanium, and scandium content.

## Hydrochloric Acid Leach (605)

There were a number of preliminary hydrochloric acid leach tests performed at the bench scale level using different hydrochloric acid concentrations, temperature and residence times in order to confirm the  leachability  of  the  Sc  and  material  in  the  ore.  The  operating  conditions  were  adjusted  to maximize Nb recovery as well as the Nb to Ti selectivity in the processes downstream. A pilot test program including two pilot campaigns (PP1-013 &amp; PP2-013) was performed.

PP1-013 ran for 80 hours while PP2-013 ran for 88 hours for a total of 168 hours and processed a total  of  1,680  kg  of  ore  samples. The objective of the Hydrochloric Acid Leach pilot circuit was to leach out impurities and a large portion of the scandium from the ore, while maintaining conditions to maximize Nb recovery as well as Ti selectivity. The PLS from the WPL circuit was collected for future test work aimed at the recovery of the leached scandium. The remaining solids were collected for

future  test  work  of  downstream  circuits  aimed  at  recovering  niobium,  titanium,  and  unleached scandium.

A summary of the results from PP1-013 and PP2-013 can be found in Table 13-2 and Table 13-3 respectively. A summary of the design conditions and elemental extraction chosen for the FS can be found in Table 13-4.

## Acid Bake (610) and Water Leach (615)

The residues from the Hydrochloric Acid Leach testing were used in a series of Acid Bake tests, directed  to  extracting  the  niobium  after  sulfation  using  sulfuric  acid  at  elevated  temperature. Following the preliminary bench scale test work, two pilot campaigns were performed on the Acid Bake. A first campaign (PP1-015) was performed using a pug mill followed by a rotary kiln feeding into the Water Leach. Excessive abrasion and corrosion wear on the pug mill due to inappropriate material  of  construction  forced  the  second  campaign  (PP2-015)  to  be  operated  with  batch  acid mixing followed by a continuous run of rotary kiln feeding into the Water Leach. Metal extraction is different between a batch and continuous operation. For this reason, PP2-015 results were excluded from the design data of the Acid Bake and Water Leach. PP1-015 ran over the course of 103 hours and produced a total of 159 kg of solids fed to Water Leach. Table 13-5 shows a summary of the results from PP1-015 Acid Bake and Water Leach.

The  results  from  PP1-015  were  used  to  derive  the  design  conditions.  A  summary  of  the  design conditions and elemental extraction chosen for the FS can be found in Table 13-6.

## Integrated Operation Iron Reduction (620), Niobium Precipitation (625) and Titanium Precipitation (635)

The  water  leach  liquors  were  processed  in  a  series  of  preliminary  tests  in  the  Iron  Reduction, Niobium Precipitation and Titanium Precipitation aimed at producing and confirming the operating conditions  to  be  used  in  the  pilot  campaign.  An  integrated  pilot  plant  (PP3-015)  was  operated continuously from August 28 to September 2, 2016, providing approximately 111 hours of operation.

The  campaign  processed  water  leach  liquor  that  was  produced  in  the  PP1-015  and  PP2-015 campaigns.

## Iron Reduction (620)

A summary of the design conditions is provided in Table 13-7.

## Niobium Precipitation (625)

Additional pilot scale tests on Iron Reduction (IR) and NbP were conducted in November 2016 to investigate  different  physical  aspects  of  the  process,  and  follow-up  pilot  plant  campaigns  were conducted  in  December  2016  and  March  2017.  All  test  work  was  carried  out  under  continuous operating conditions.

The  feed  to  the  continuous  NbP  test  campaigns  was  produced  by  processing  Hydrochloric  Acid Leach residue from an earlier pilot campaign (PP1-013) which was processed through Acid Bake and Water Leach steps. The Water Leach filtrate was then advanced to continuous testing of the Iron Reduction (IR) and NbP processes. The conditions for IR were left unchanged from the latest bench and pilot work. Based on the established conditions, a full pilot campaign (PP1-018) was conducted over five days in December 2016. The overall dilution ratio was decreased to 2 (effective ratio of ~2.3 based on flow differential) resulting in a drop from 96% to 94% niobium recovery. Following the March  2017  pilot  campaign  (PP2-018)  calculations  and  investigations  confirmed  that  a  91.51% extraction of Nb could be achieved at a dilution ratio of 0.6:1. To conservatively design the plant two additional tanks were included to increase the residence time. While being lower than the 96% at 5:1 or the 94% at 2:1, a reduced dilution ratio of 0.6:1 is preferable by greatly reducing the equipment size and the reagent consumption.

Figure 13-1 show the trends in Nb and Ti recoveries in the NbP as a function of the dilution ratio. The trend  shows  that  the  0.5-0.8  dilution  ratio  is  in  the  greatest  inflection  portion  of  the  curve.  A regression  based  on  the  results  provides  the  required  verification  that  91.51%  recovery  can  be achieved with a 0.6:1 dilution ratio.

## Caustic Leach - Phosphate Removal

The  Niobium  Precipitates  were  used  in  a  series  of  caustic  leach  tests,  aimed  at  confirming  the process for reducing the phosphate concentration in the final Niobium Precipitate. Ten (10) caustic

leach tests looked into a selection of NaOH solutions at various concentrations, temperatures and contact times. A summary of the retained design conditions is presented in Table 13-9.

## Titanium Precipitation (635)

A continuous neutralization circuit was operated from August 29 to September 2, 2016, providing approximately 86 hours of operation. The circuit processed filtrate from the NbP circuit. Feed was pumped  into  the  circuit  and  as  the  purpose  of  the  pilot  campaign  was  to  test  the  titanium precipitation, Sodium carbonate was added to lower the acidity from approximately 100 g/L sulfuric acid in the feed to between 15 g/L and 20 g/L in the discharge of the circuit with a target of 15 g/L.

The use of Sodium carbonate was initially considered for the full-size Plant along with magnesium carbonate but was later discarded due to the high cost of the reagent and the difficulty to regenerate. Further  testing  was  performed  using  lime  and  limestone  that  confirmed  a  significant  amount  of scandium is being trapped in the gypsum formed by the partial neutralization of the NbP filtrate. To counter the significant scandium losses and the high cost of reagent, a 'Calcium Loop' was designed that uses a small amount of fresh lime with recycled lime to partially neutralize the NbP filtrate. A purge back to HCl Acid Leach controls the scandium concentration inside the loop and recovers any elements that may have been trapped. This loop uses a calciner in the same fashion as with the sulfates  coming  from  the  Acid  Regeneration  and  the  Tailings  Neutralization  to  regenerate  and recycle lime out of the gypsum. As these were tested in continuous pilot scale operation, no further piloting was performed on the 'Calcium Loop' calciner.

The neutralization was followed by a continuous Titanium Precipitation circuit that was also operated from August 29 to September 2, 2016, providing approximately 81 hours of operation.

Table 13-10 shows design basis of the TiP in terms of elemental extraction.

## Scandium Precipitation (628)

The Titanium Precipitation filtrate solution was used in a series of scandium precipitation tests. The limited quantity of scandium contained in the filtrate restricted the number and size of test programs. In  all  9  bench  scale  tests  and  2  bulk  campaigns were performed. A total of 659 L of filtrate were treated producing a combined 970 g of precipitate.

A Summary of the results can be found in Table 13-11. From these tests and bulk campaigns, design conditions  were  determined.  A  summary  of  the  retained  design  conditions  is  presented  in  Table 13-12.

## Sulfate Calcining and Mixed Oxides Handling (630)

Sulfate calcining was tested at 3 facilities all using the Hydrochloric Acid Regeneration solids. Solids were initially calcined at SGS using equipment available. The wet filter cake from the Hydrochloric Acid  Regeneration  pilot  plant  was  processed  through  a  rotary  kiln  at  a  temperature  of  1100°C  at SGS. The temperature limit was set by the available equipment and not by the process requirement. At such a temperature, it was expected that the Calcium sulfate in the feed material would not be converted, while the free sulfuric acid and any iron sulfate or magnesium sulfate would be converted. In  bench  tests  under  similar  conditions,  typically  70-80%  total  sulfur  removal  was  noted.  The continuous pilot plant operated for 91.5 hours. Overall, the pilot was successful, resulting in 53 kg of calcine produced (from 183 kg of wet filter cake fed). Total sulfur removal was calculated to be 80%, as expected. The calcined product from the pilot at SGS was primarily gypsum with associated iron and magnesium oxides. It was however, desired to convert the remaining sulfur associated with the gypsum. This led to test work being performed at Hazen Research in Golden, Colorado as well as at Kingston Process Metallurgy Inc. in Kingston Ontario Canada.

Tests campaigns were initiated at Hazen using calcined material from the pilot campaign at SGS Lakefield.  Conditions  were  set  to  provide  a  reducing  atmosphere.  This  allowed  for  a  better conversion  of  the  gypsum  into  an  oxide  mix  at  lower  temperature  than  is  normally  required  for gypsum under an oxidizing atmosphere.

Bench scale tests were initiated  followed  by  a  bulk  pilot  campaign  processing  a  total  of  45  kg  of calcined  material  producing  14.5  kg  of  mixed  oxide  material  and  6  kg  of  kiln  cleanout  material containing mixed oxides and a small amount of etched refractory.

Table 13-13 provides a summary of the results of both the bench scale tests and the pilot campaign. The pilot campaign showed that gypsum was essentially completely converted to oxides with only a trace amount of sulfur left in the mixed oxide material.

## Scandium Extraction (640)

The  pre-leach  liquors  were  treated  in  a  series  of  scandium  extraction  (ScSx)  tests  and  a  pilot campaign, aimed at confirming the process for extracting scandium from leach liquors. Within the overall flowsheet, 62.5% of the available scandium is dissolved in the Hydrochloric Acid Leach circuit at design conditions. Scandium that is not dissolved in the HCl Leach circuit is further recovered and eventually is combined in the Pregnant Leach Liquor and fed to the solvent extraction circuit. Two successful  and  separate  solvent  extraction  pilot  plant  campaigns  (PP2  and  PP3)  were  performed and  the  circuit  operated  for  a  total  215  hours  and  approximately  3800  L  of  PLS  was  processed, producing 118 g of scandium solids containing on average 42.9% Sc (77.7 g of Sc2O3 equivalent content).

The extractant used was Di-(2-ethylhexyl) phosphoric acid (D2EHPA) prepared with tridecanol (as modifier) in Orfom SX80.

Scandium extraction averaged more than 99% throughout the two campaigns with scandium levels in the  raffinate consistently  below  analytical  detection  limit  (&lt;0.07  mg/L).  Thorium  and  iron extractions averaged 0.1%. Titanium extraction extent averaged 93 and 95%, which showed that no selectivity  against  titanium  took  place  in  the  extraction  circuit.  However,  titanium  was  efficiently removed in the scrub circuit. A single wash stage was included in which more than 55% of the iron and more than 20% of the thorium was removed from the loaded organic. Some of the titanium, 7%, was also removed; less than 0.1% scandium was removed in this circuit. The wash liquor was mixed with the PLS and put back into the extraction circuit.

The  scrubbing  circuit  was  designed  to  remove  the  remaining  iron,  thorium  and  titanium  from  the washed organic using a solution of H2SO4 and H2O2. More than 99% of the iron was removed from the  washed  organic.  Thorium  in  the  scrubbed  organic  was  below  detection  limit  (&lt;2.5  mg/L) throughout the campaigns. Titanium and scandium scrubbing reached 98% and 7%, respectively. The scrubbed scandium is combined with the Ti Precipitation feed liquor, where titanium is recovered as TiO2 and scandium is subsequently recovered via precipitation from the Ti Precipitation filtrate and brought back into the Scandium SX circuit as impure re-leach liquor.

The strip circuit used a NaOH solution to strip the scandium from the scrubbed organic and at the same time precipitate scandium hydroxide. The aqueous phase was sent to a filter to remove the scandium solids and recycle the strip liquor as strip feed (after adjusting its NaOH concentration).

Overall recovery of scandium to the solids, ranged from 93% to 95% at the beginning of the PP2 campaign and 91% during PP3. Approximately 8% of the total scandium reported to the scrub liquor. This scandium fraction is recovered in the Scandium Precipitation circuit (628). Therefore, overall scandium recovery in the Solvent Extraction (to solids and to the scrub liquor) is greater than 99%. Table  13-14  and  Table  13-15  provide  a  summary  of  the  overall  deportment  of  metals  in  the Scandium Solvent Extraction unit pilot campaigns PP2-014 and PP3-014.

## Scandium Refining (645)

The scandium hydroxide [Sc(OH)3] produced in the Scandium Solvent Extraction test work was used in the steps to test the Scandium Refining portion of the process. A number of leaches both in HCl and H2SO4 were performed with the intent of testing the removal of impurities such as titanium and niobium from the scandium produced. HCl was initially tested but was rejected due to poor results. H2SO4 was retained in a combination with a solvent extraction step. A series of Sc(OH)3 re-leaches tests using H2SO4 were performed in order to provide approximately 5 L of Sc rich solution. Then the Solvent Extraction was tested in a series of 6 campaigns treating a total of 5 L. Alamine 336 was first used and provided best results for Zr but only partially removed Ti and Nb. Aliquat 336 was then used and provided a very good result for Ti and Nb but only partially removed Zr. A mix of Alamine 336 and Aliquat 336 is finally used to get the best removal of Zr, Ti and Nb.

A summary of the retained design conditions is presented in Table 13-16.

Table 13-16: Scandium Refining - Impurity Extractions

| Criteria      |   Value | Unit   | Comment             |
|---------------|---------|--------|---------------------|
| Zr extraction |    98.8 | %      |                     |
| Ti extraction |    91.3 | %      |                     |
| Nb extraction |    94.9 | %      |                     |
| Sc extraction |    99.3 | %      | Only traces loading |

The Sc rich raffinate was then mixed with an oxalic acid solution in a batch wise fashion to form scandium oxalate crystals. A series of 15 tests were performed to crystallize scandium oxalate. The initial solution used came from the initial re-leach with HCl. The solution used was later changed to a sulfate  based  scandium  re-leach  following  the  development  in  the  impurities  removal  steps.  The crystallization proved to be straight forward and provided very good recovery of scandium oxalate well  above  98-99%.  Scandium  oxalate  was  further  filtered,  washed  and  calcined  to  produce scandium trioxide with a purity of 99.9%. The limited quantity of scandium available prevented large scale testing of filtration or calcining.

## Hydrochloric Acid Regeneration (660)

Using scandium solvent extraction raffinate, a five-day continuous pilot plant seeking to regenerate HCl from the raffinate  using  sulfuric  acid  (H2SO4)  was  conducted  between  October  18,  2016  and October 22, 2016. Two separate runs (PR1, PR2) were operated. The process was successful and showed that 99.94% of the chlorides in the feed stream were converted to HCl into the vapor phase. All of the Calcium and most of the iron and magnesium were precipitated as insoluble metal sulfates, forming a filter cake of 50-60% moisture under pilot conditions.

When collecting the HCl without any water addition, the HCl content was calculated to exceed the azeotropic  point  of  HCl,  reaching  28%  HCl  by  weight  prior  to  the  shutdown  of  the  pilot  plant. Reaching  even  higher  concentration  would  have  required  increased  cooling  capacity  at  lower temperature. This represents a significant opportunity to reduce the upgrading requirement prior to recycling the stream to pre-leach.

The feed solution averaged 40 g/L Fe, 24 g/L Mg, 56 g/L Ca, and 300 g/L Cl, while the discharge solution from AR6 averaged 0.9 g/L Fe, 3.5 g/L Mg, 0.2 g/L Ca, and 39 mg/L Cl. This represents a major decrease in the amount of dissolved metal, and a near complete removal of chloride from the feed. Table 13-17 shows the composite solid discharge assay.

In  total,  290  kg  (or  223  L)  of  Scandium  Solvent  Extraction  raffinate  was  processed  and  the  pilot generated ~230 kg of wet solids ranging from 40-56% solids, resulting in approximately 106 kg of dry equivalent.

## Tailings Neutralization (665)

Two bulk neutralization campaigns were performed on tailings solution. In all 511 L of tailings solution were  neutralized  with  limestone  locally  obtained  from  a  mine  in  Weeping  Water,  NE.  Neutralization proved to follow theoretical models. Tailings Neutralization solids were also calcined in bulk to provide samples that were used in the sulfate calcining campaigns performed at Hazen Research.

## 13.2.2 Relevant Results

A  number  of  individual  extractions  were  compiled  to  define  the  total  recovery  of  each  of  the  pay metals. A summary of the results and design conditions is shown in Table 13-18.

## 13.2.3 Significant Factors

Adequate test work was conducted to support a feasibility-level design for the hydromet plant however optimization was not achieved in all areas. Certain areas will certainly benefit from further 'post FS' test work, preferably before detailed engineering activities begin. For instance, the test work performed for the  FS  shows  indications  that  several  factors  influence  the  precipitation  of  niobium  as  well  as  the selectivity with respect to titanium. Test work indicates that an increase in Fe/Nb ratio positively affects Nb precipitation while also promoting selectivity against Ti. Precipitant (dilution water) acidity inversely affects  Nb  precipitation  but  increases  the  selectivity  against  Ti  precipitation.  Final  free  acid  titration ('FAT')  has  very  little  effect  on  the  Nb  precipitation  but  it  greatly  increases  the  selectivity  against  Ti precipitation.  The  above  factors  have  not  been  optimized  in  this  study  and  further  testing  will  be required to achieve optimal results. Such optimization could also be achieved with performing process simulation  of  the  yearly  or  monthly  elemental  feed  composition  using  the  METSIM  model  and  the compositions from the mine plan.

## 13.3  Pyrometallurgy

Pyrometallurgical test work has been carried out at Kingston Process Metallurgy (KPM) in Kingston, Ontario, Canada. Since the Hydromet plant testing has shown higher levels of TiO2 at the exit of the NbP section, the purpose of the Pyromet testing has been changed slightly from its original scope. The objective of the Pyromet has always been to produce a saleable FeNb metal, but in addition, it will  play  a  role  of  purification  by  eliminating  the  excess  TiO2  left  by  the  Hydromet.  The  testing performed at KPM facilities was required to demonstrate the capability of the Pyromet to produce an acceptable  quality  of  FeNb  alloy  that  meets  the  product  specifications  of  the  present  FeNb producers. The testing performed at the KPM facilities has demonstrated several points which are listed below:

- · The  aluminothermic  reduction  of  Nb2O5  precipitate  to  produce  FeNb  alloy  has  been demonstrated regardless of the high level of TiO2 in the precipitate;
- · Niobium recovery from the Hydromet precipitate reached 96% at the exit of the Pyromet; and
- · Hematite powder (Fe2O3) was successfully added as the iron source for the aluminothermic reduction.

## 14 Mineral Resource Estimate

## 14.1  Introduction

This  section  describes  the  Mineral  Resource  estimation  methodology  and  summarizes  the  key assumptions considered by SRK. In the opinion of SRK, the Mineral Resource Estimate reported herein is a reasonable representation of the global Nb2O5, TiO2, and Sc Mineral Resources found at the  Project  at  the  current  level  of  sampling.  No  additional  drilling  has  been  completed  since  the previous Mineral Resource Estimate, but a series of re-assays (766 pulps) have been completed on samples which did not previously have TiO2 or Sc assays. SRK has updated the Mineral Resource estimation, to reflect the updated database, with no other changes to the geological model used in the 2015 PEA. The Mineral Resource has an Effective Date of May 15, 2017 which is the date upon which the final metallurgical recoveries were determined to define the CoG used. The date of the last assays received from Actlabs for the re-assay program is August 16, 2016.

The Mineral Resources have been estimated in conformity with generally accepted CIM 'Estimation of Mineral  Resource  and  Mineral  Reserves  Best  Practices'  guidelines  and  are  reported  in accordance  with  NI  43-101.  Mineral  Resources  are  not  Mineral  Reserves  and  do  not  have demonstrated economic viability. There is no certainty that all or any part of the Mineral Resource will be converted into Mineral Reserve.

Martin Pittuck is the Qualified Person (QP) responsible for the resource estimation methodology and the resource statement. Mr. Pittuck has been assisted by Ben Parsons, MAusIMM (CP) a Principal Consultant at SRK Consulting (U.S.) Inc., who has constructed the geologic model and completed the grade estimation under the close supervision and review of Martin Pittuck. Mr. Parsons has 14 years  in  geological  model  and  resource  estimation  and  has  completed  the  estimation  using  a combination of Leapfrog®, for geological modeling and CAE Mining Datamine software (Datamine) for grade estimation and reporting.

The methodology used for preparation of the Mineral Resource Statement was as follows:

- · Database verification;
- · Construction of Nb2O5 mineralization wireframe models;
- · Definition of resource domains;
- · Preparing of data for geostatistical analysis and variography (capping and compositing);
- · Block modeling and grade interpolation;
- · Resource classification and validation;
- · Assessment of 'reasonable prospects for economic extraction' and selection of appropriate CoG;
- · Preparation of a Mineral Resource Statement for Nb2O5;
- · Database verification of the multi-element assay database;
- · Verification/validation of the defined wireframes to the TiO2 and Sc database;
- · Block modeling and grade interpolation;
- · Resource classification and validation; and
- · Preparation  of  a  Mineral  Resource  Statement  using  Nb2O5, as  the  primary  economic assumption for determining the CoG.

The Effective Date of the Mineral Resource Statement is May 15, 2017.

## 14.2  Drillhole Database

The drillhole database was constructed by Dahrouge from Molycorp data and raw data captured by Dahrouge during the 2011 and 2014, drilling campaigns. The information has been exported from the Central  Database  and  provided  to  SRK  in  .csv  format.  SRK  determined  the  data  to  be  of  good quality.  The  database  provided  in  Microsoft  Excel ®   .csv  spreadsheets  containing  collar  locations surveyed in UTM coordinates, downhole deviation surveys, assay intervals with elemental analyses, geologic  intervals  with  rock  types,  alteration  and  key  structures.  SRK  has  assigned  appropriate codes for missing samples and no recovery for use during the modeling procedures.

The complete database which covers the entire NioCorp concession area contains information from 129 diamond-core drillholes totaling approximately 64,981 m of drilling. There are no obvious gaps in the  naming  sequence  of  drillholes.  The  maximum  drillhole  depth  is  950.4  m  and  the  average  is 501.7 m. Focusing on Elk Creek a total of 48 holes have been completed (inclusive of one wedged hole) for  a  total  of  33.908.7  m  of  drilling.  A  summary  of  the  holes  by  drilling  phase  (Company)  is shown in Table 14-1.

## 14.3  Geologic Model

The drill log lithology data contains four major rock types based on the geologic observations of drill core, which based on the latest logging codes can be broken down into 19 sub-lithologies. The four main units considered during the analysis are:

- · Overburden;
- · Sediments;
- · Carbonatite; and
- · Mafic Units/Lamprophyre (low-grade domain).

The primary logging codes have been imported into Leapfrog® to create geological horizons for the base of overburden/till, plus the contact between the Pennsylvanian Sediments and the underlying Carbonatite  (Figure  14-1).  The  models  have  been  used  by  creating  contact  points  within  each drillhole at the contact between these major units.

During the September 2014 geological model SRK did not consider the detail in the geological logs of the historical drilling to have sufficient detail to enable modeling of the geological units. Primarily this was due to a mixed population of higher grade magnetitedolomite-carbonatite (mdolCarb), and lower  grade  dolomite-carbonatite  (dolCarb),  within  material  logged  as  dolCarb.  As  a  result  of  this conclusion the decision was taken to review the historical information in addition to the collection of new drilling information, as discussed in Section 10 of this report.

Using the updated database SRK has completed a statistical analysis of the Nb2O5% grades per lithology using classical statistical methods. The database was then analyzed for relative abundance and Nb2O5 based on the main lithologies as shown in Figure 14-2. The box-whisker plot highlights the  significant  difference  in  the  grade  distributions  between  mCarb  (pink  square)  and  Carb  (blue square). The MCARB and MCARB-LAMP account for 51% of the samples logged vs. 33% for the CARB and CARB-LAMP, which indicates these four codes cover 84% of the logged intervals. The other  unit  of  significance  in  terms  of  logged  intervals  is  the  Lamporpyre  units  which  accounts  for 12%. The weighted average for all units is shown on the right of the chart.

The highest grades both in terms of values and mean grades, are found within the MCARB units with the next highest mean recorded in the MCARB-LAMP. The MCARB has grades in excess of 0.3% Nb2O5 for over 93% of the logged assays, while the MCARB-LAMP 79% of the logged values is greater than 0.3%. In comparison the CARB has 80% of the database below a nominal cut-off of

0.3% Nb2O5. The results confirm the importance of accurate geological logging and the improvement in geological domaining based on the relogging of the historical drilling.

In addition to the lower grades in the CARB units, SRK also noted lower grades within the MAFIC, INT  and  LAMP  units.  SRK  has  focused  on  trying  to  define  these  lower  grade  units  via  sectional analysis to domain these areas out of the geological model.

Historically  within  the  historical  database  all  early  or  late  stage  intrusives  not  defined  as  dolCarb have been assigned a mafic rock code. The NioCorp database shows a split between units logged as  Mafic  (considered  to  be  late  stage)  which  in  general  are  low  grade  to  barren,  compared  to Lamprohyre units which are shown to carry a mixture of low and high grades, which tend towards higher grades where units have been logged with a breccia texture. Given the nature of the rocktypes  and  their  similar  properties,  SRK  consider  there  could  remain  a  degree  of  mixing  of  data populations within  these  units.  To  improve  the  validation  of  the  geological  domaining  for  the  lowgrade a study of the multi-element database would increase the confidence required. SRK does not consider  this  to  materially  impact  on  the  current  geological  model,  but  could  provide  additional confidence when looking to define Measured Mineral Resources.

SRK considers the presence of potentially late stage low/barren mafic units to be important. To be able  to  understand  the  distribution  of  Nb2O5  within  the  CARB  and  MCARB  units  SRK  has  first modeled the mafic units (Figure 14-3). To complete the model SRK has primarily used the lithology logging  but  has  also  used  for  guidance  areas  of  low-grade  to  Nb2O5  and  the  overall  trend  of  the mineralization. SRK notes that while the low-grade domain remains relatively easy to identify within cross-sections, the ability to link the structures between sections is difficult. In the September 2014 model SRK modeled a total of 6 units, but in comparison a total of 14 units have been modeled in the current update, with the strike length ranging from 150 to 650 m.

The resultant geological features have been imported into Datamine with the associated boreholes coded  by  the  relevant  geological  units.  The  coding  allows  these  units  to  be  filtered  from  the geological modeling of the Carbonatite units.

Using  log  histograms  and  log-probability  plots  SRK  has  confirmed  the  box-whisker  analysis  that more than one sample population is present (Figure 14-4) at Elk Creek. The two main populations can be described as low-grade population ranging between 0.1% and 0.5% Nb2O5, and a highergrade population in excess of 0.5% Nb2O5. The contact between the two populations is not clear on the charts and therefore SRK assumed some degree of transition between these two domains may exist.  SRK  has  assumed  that  the  lower  grade  population  is  defined  by  the  CARB  units,  with  the higher grades indicating the presence of MCARB.

The results indicated a slight change in the histogram compared to the September 2014 geological model, but overall supported the conclusions made at that time. The February 2015 geological model shows a more defined change in the trend for the higher grade domain, plus the transitional zone between the two main populations, can be seen by a third peak in histogram in the range of 0.3% to 0.4% Nb2O5.

February 2015 Model Source: SRK, 2014/2015

Using Figure 14-4 and the assumption of a nominal lower grade cut-off of 0.3% Nb2O5, SRK has created grade shells at 0.3%, 0.4% and 0.5% Nb2O5. SRK found visually the best fits (in terms of correlation of grade and known higher-grade geological units), when using the 5 m composite data. At  the  shorter  intervals,  areas  comprising  of  less  than  five  continuous  meters  of  low  grade  were producing isolates holes in the geological wireframes. SRK preferred the option to model larger more consistent  wireframes,  and  are  instead  accounted  for  as  internal  dilution  of  lower-grade  samples within the estimated blocks.

SRK  tested  multiple  scenarios  based  on  the  raw  and  composite  data  to  mimic  the  changes  in niobium  distributions  between  the  CARB  and  MCARB  beneath  the  unconformity,  in  addition  to creating interpretations based solely on geological logging. Given the close relationship between the higher grades and the MCARB unit SRK has based the geological wireframe for the MCARB using an  indicator  methodology.  To  define  the  indicator  model,  values  in  the  database  are  assigned  a value of 0 or 1 based on a set criteria (such as 0.3% Nb2O5, 0.4% Nb2O5 and 0.5% Nb2O5). This criteria is then used as the mathematical basis for the definition of a grade shell within Leapfrog®. The aim in using an indicator over a traditional grade shell is it removes the influence of the grades (where  higher  grades  may  push  further),  and  relies  on  the  underlying  relationship  between mineralized  (value  equals  1)  and  non-mineralized  (value  equals  0)  material,  which  in  SRK's  view better mimics the geology at the Project. SRK initially used an indicator cut-off of 0.4% Nb2O5 using a range  of  thresholds  between  0.25  and  0.5,  with  the  resultant  Leapfrog®  grade  shells  validated against the geological logging, and a 0.35 threshold (isovalue), providing the best visual correlation.

To evaluate the preferred interpretation for the geological/grade shells boundaries, SRK has been provided with a series cross-sections and one long section by onsite geological staff (Dahrouge). SRK has also held technical meetings with the senior Project Geologist to assist in defining the key geological controls on the deposit. The interpretation remains consistent with the previous model, which has been supported by confirmation drilling during Phase II and Phase III programs at Elk Creek.

To improve the continuity in the geological interpretation SRK has used two dominant trend surfaces. The southwest contact has been modeled using a strong sub-vertical trend (shown in blue), while the northeast of the deposit has followed moderate dipping trends (shown in black) parallel to the lowgrade mafic units (shown in green) as shown in Figure 14-5.

Boreholes show geology and assays (red histograms), used for validation.

SRK has investigated the  potential  cause  for  the  sharp  contact  on  the  southwestern  edge  of  the deposit, to determine if the contact is structurally controlled. Based on a review of the drill core and ATV surveys completed to date no fault has been established. SRK therefore assume that this forms a sharp igneous lithological contact.

During the geological modeling SRK noted that the 0.4% Nb2O5 defined domain closely correlates to the  logged  MCARB  intervals,  while  the  0.3%  Nb2O5  limit  defines  the  edges  of  the  mineralization, which is defined as CARB.

SRK noted a number of cases where the indicator model created significant volumes on the edge of the  deposit  in  areas  of  limited  drilling.  SRK  assumes  these  volumes  lack  sufficient  geological confidence for  the  definition  of  the  Mineral  Resource.  SRK  has  limited  the  extent  of  the  indicator wireframes in these cases to a corridor of mineralization bound by the steep southwest contact and a shallower northeast contact. The northeast contact has been based on geological and assay values at depth and projected to the unconformity (shown in brown on Figure 14-5).

The  final  wireframes  (Figure  14-6)  selected  have  been  imported  into  Datamine  and  cropped accordingly  to  mimic  the  unconformity  between  the  Carbonatite  and  the  overlying  Pennsylvanian sediments, to domain the drillhole information and for the generation of the geological block model.

## 14.4  Assay Capping and Compositing

Prior  to  the  undertaking  of  a  statistical  analysis,  an  outlier  analysis  has  first  been  completed  and samples need to be composited to equal lengths for constant sample volume, in order to honour sample support theories.

## 14.4.1 Outliers

Outlier analysis has been completed for Nb2O5, TiO2, Sc assays and density data per domain. The raw assay data was first plotted on histograms (Figure 14-7) and cumulative distribution plots (Figure 14-8)  to  understand  its  basic  statistical  distribution.  High-grade  capping  was  applied  based  on  a combination  of  these  plots,  plus  log  histogram  information.  To  create  the  plots  the  domained samples for all zones have been created in Datamine and imported into Snowden Supervisor v8.3 (Supervisor) for analysis.

The plots can be used to distinguish the grades at which additional samples have significant impacts on the  local  estimation  and  whose  affect  is  considered  extreme.  Using  this  methodology  top-cuts have been defined for each domain by reviewing the information from the different sample types.

The  spatial  occurrence  of  the  capped  values  was  visually  verified  to  determine  if  they  formed discrete zones which could potentially be modeled separately.

Using the above method SRK has applied the capping based on the domain coding:

- · KZONE10: Nb2O5=0.75, TiO2=4.25, Sc\_ppm=80
- · KZONE 13: Nb2O5 = 1.0, TiO2=4.25, Sc\_ppm=100
- · KZONE 14: Nb2O5 = 1.5, TiO2=4.50, Sc\_ppm=120
- · KZONE 15: Nb2O5 = 3.0, TiO2=7.50, Sc\_ppm=160
- · KZONE 21: Nb2O5 = 1.0, TiO2=3.5, Sc\_ppm=65

Once the samples have been capped the dataset has undergone a composite analysis study, with the impact of the capping and compositing highlighted in Table 14-5.

The  influence  of  the  capping  has  been  reviewed  by  SRK,  to  confirm  the  potential  impact  on  the number of samples capped and the mean grades within each estimation domain (Table 14-3). Figure 14-8 provides an example of the study which reviews the number of samples capped within the 0.5% grade shell. The results show that approximately 0.2% of the database has been capped, with the mean grade reducing from 0.829% to 0.825% Nb2O5. SRK considers the capping to be appropriate for the style of mineralization.

## 14.4.2 Compositing

SRK has undertaken a sample composite analysis (Table 14-4) in order to determine the optimal sample  composite  length  for  grade  interpolation.  The  analysis  investigated  both  changes  in composite length and minimum composite lengths for inclusion. Results are compared by reviewing the resultant mean grade against the length weighted raw sample mean grades, and the percentage of samples excluded applying the minimum composite length.

SRK has utilized  a  function  in  Datamine  where  all  samples  are  maintained  during  the  composite routine (MODE=1). MODE 1 forces all samples to be included in one of the composites by adjusting the composite length, while keeping it as close as possible to the 5 m interval selected by SRK. A review of the composite lengths per domain shows on average the mean length of the composite within the Carbonatite is in the order of 1.0 to 1.5 m, while the thinner mafic units average closer to 1.25 m. A comparison of the mean Nb2O5% grades shows the impact of the composite and capping routines  results  in  slightly  lower  means  at  &lt;0.4%  in  the  Carbonatite.  The  reduction  in  mafic  units reports larger differences of up to 15% but this is typically due to the low numbers in the samples populations.  SRK  assumes  the  differences  in  the  mafics  can  be  explained  by  differences  in  the logging of Molycorp drilling, and while this may have a degree of conservatism, the overall tonnage of the mafic units is low in comparison to the Carbonatite. SRK deemed the capping satisfactory, and no bias has been introduced during the capping and composite processes.

Table 14-5 shows a comparison of the mean grades within each zone based on the grade capping applied.  Within  the  Carbonatite  units  the  reduction  in  the  mean  is  less  than  0.5%  for  the  Nb2O5 assays, while the difference in the means are more variable within TiO2 and Sc database. Overall the reduction  in  the  means  is  deemed  acceptable  by  SRK  and  appropriate  given  the  sampling distributions noted for each element.

## 14.5  Density

Dahrouge  conducted  density testing on the drill core to support the resource estimation. Approximately  2,045  samples  were  tested  from  the  2014  drilling  program,  completed  using  a combination  of  volumetric  density  (1,777  samples)  determination  and  water  immersion  (1,493 samples) for confirmation. The density data was subdivided by the major lithologic groups used in the geologic model, and averages were calculated for each group.

The results are presented in Table 14-6. Density was assigned in the block model based on each block's lithology. Blocks outside of the resource estimation with unclassified lithology, were assigned a density of 2.82 g/cm 3 , the average value for all the measurements taken.

During the February 6, 2015 Mineral Resource Estimate (Nb2O5 reported only), which formed the basis for the press release dated 09 February 2015, SRK assumed an average density based on the major  geological  units.  The  average  density  assigned  is  shown  in  Table  14-7.  The  breakdown  of density has been based on the estimation domain (KZONE), with higher density values within the higher grade domains based on the relationship within higher magnetite content associated with the higher grades.

On receipt of the whole rock analysis database and prior to updating the Mineral Resource for the TiO2% and Sc (ppm) estimates SRK conducted a review of the variability within the density values to determine/confirm if a relationship existed between the higher FeO2% and the Nb2O5% (Figure 14-9). The study indicated that while a direct correlation is not established there is a trend for high density associated with high FeO2% and Nb2O5%. Further review of the histograms for the density data per zone show variation in the density, and large enough sample populations, for SRK to consider the estimation of density into the block model to be appropriate. SRK has assumed in terms of search orientations that the density values are associated with the same search orientations as the Nb2O5% distributions. To complete the analysis SRK has reviewed the histograms (Figure 14-10) and applied capping to the density values per domain as appropriate. SRK has used the same methodology for reviewing outliers as discussed in Section 14.4.1 of this report.

- (1) Used assigned density from previous study

In summary the change from the use of a single density per zone compared to the estimated density for the estimated domains (13, 14, 15, 21), reported a difference of 229,200,000 t vs. 228,200,000 t which is in the order of 0.5% (at a 0% Nb2O5 cut-off) which SRK does not consider to be a material change.  SRK  considers  the  use  of  estimated  density  to  be  more  reasonable  given  the  variable nature based on higher Nb2O5% and Fe2O3% (disclosed on February 23, 2015).

## 14.6  Variogram Analysis and Modeling

Variography is the study of the spatial variability of an attribute (in this case Nb2O5%, TiO2%, Sc). Datamine and Supervisor have been utilized to test the geostatistical  relationship  for  the  deposit. Variogram analysis was performed on the capped and composited data filtered to include only the carbonatite domain. No stable semi-variograms have been achieved within the mafic units.

In completing the analysis the following has been considered:

- · Azimuth and dip of each zone was determined;
- · The down-hole variogram was calculated and modeled to characterize the nugget effect;
- · Experimental  raw  and  pairwise  relative  semi-variograms,  were  calculated  to  determine directional variograms for the along strike, cross strike and down-dip directions;
- · Directional  variograms  were  modeled  using  the  nugget  and  sill  defined  in  the  down-hole variography, and the ranges for the along strike, cross strike and down-dip directions; and
- · All variances were re-scaled for each domain to match the total variance for that zone

A triple spherical structure was used to model the variograms for all three elements. A lag of 25 m was  used  with  a  variable  separation  based  on  the  extents  of  the  data.  The  semivariogram parameters are presented in Table 14-9. The experimental semi-variogram data is shown in Figure 14-11  fit  with  the  model  semi-variogram  parameters  listed  in  Table  14-9.  The  results  indicate  a reasonable nugget variance, but then a significant portion of the variability is within a short range (first sill) of between 7 to 20 m. SRK attributes the short scale variability to changes in the geological units between  mdolcarb  and  dolcarb.  Improving  the  geological  model  and  hence  geological domaining may improve the continuity noted within each of this units, which should be considered during  the  next  Mineral  Resource  update  with  further  infill  drilling  to  define  higher  levels  of confidence (Measured).

## 14.7  Block Model

The block model was constructed within the UTM grid (NADS83 Zone 14) coordinate limits listed in Table 14-10. A 5 m x 15 m x 5 m (x, y, z) block size was chosen as an appropriate dimension based on the current drillhole spacing and a potential underground smallest mining unit (SMU), compared to  a  drill  spacing  in  the  order  of  60  m  x  60  m  within  infill  drilled  sections.  Sub-blocking  has  been allowed along the boundaries to a minimum of 0.5 m along strike, 2.5 m across strike and 1.0 m in the vertical direction, to maintain the geological interpretation. The block size has been based on the SMU, but it is SRK understanding that mine planning for the stopes will likely occur at a larger scale and not be based on individual blocks. The current block size will allow the mine planning to have the required level of flexibility when running the stope optimization. The topographic surface was created from the aerial survey of the topography and verified against the drill collars.

All modeling was conducted in Datamine for the Project grade estimation. The top of the carbonatite surface  is located approximately  200  m  below  surface  and  is  overlain  by  a  sequence  of Pennsylvanian sediments which have been modeled in Leapfrog®. All grade estimates are cropped to this contact.

SRK previously used a rotation to improve the geometric representation of the deposit. A rotated block model was created using a strike of 120º (set to -60º using Datamine convention). Based on work completed on the geotechnical aspects of the Project this rotation is noted to be oblique to some of the principal stresses, which have been supported by the fault model, and a specialized horizontal stress test completed as part of a geotechnical program. To improve the potential mine design and to reduce the potential for dilution, SRK has rotated the block model to align with the key stress orientations.

To ensure no bias has been introduced in terms of dilution across the geological block model SRK has run the same model parameters using three different scenarios:

- · Block  model  set-up  based  on  key  geological  orientations  (maximize  grade  continuity between blocks);
- · Block model rotated 15  towards (half the required rotation) the principal stress orientation; ⁰ and
- · Block model rotated 15  towards (full rotation) into the principal stress orientation. ⁰

SRK noted that the difference in the global grades and tonnages between all three scenarios was negligible. Given the significant potential for improvement for the mine design (stope orientations), SRK elected to use the fully rotated prototype which aligns to the principal stress.

SRK has maintained the 5 m block size across strike as used in the geological model to ensure the vertical variation in the zones is modeled. A comparison of the block model dimensions used in 2014 and 2015 are shown in Table 14-10 and Table 14-11.

## 14.8  Estimation Methodology

The  grade  estimation  has  been  completed  using  hard  boundaries  for  the  lithological  (mafic)  and mineralization (carbonatite grade shell) domains. Only the composites from the same domain have been  used  during  estimation.  This  boundary  corresponds  to  the  geologic  model  presented  in Section 14.3.  The  block  model  was  first  coded  so  that  all  blocks  within  this  solid  were  flagged according  to  the  relevant  estimation  domain  (KZONE).  The  use  of  a  soft  boundary  within  the Carbonatite between the 0.4% and 0.5% limits has been tested during the September 2014 Mineral Resource Estimate, the findings of which indicated that the higher grades within the MCARB were smoothing into lower grade carbonatite material. The findings from the study showed in a previous iteration of the geological wireframe that removing the hard boundary increased the tonnage by 2% and the grade by 5% at a cut-off of 0.3% (Nb2O5%). This increased at higher cut-offs to 32% more tonnage for a reduction of 7% in the grade. SRK concluded that the hard contact provided a better visual comparison to the raw sampling information. A review of the drillhole logs and core indicate a relatively sharp increase in the levels of magnetite and hence the definition of MCARB material. SRK considers this assumption to remain appropriate to the current geological model and estimation.

The Nb2O5% grade estimation used an Ordinary Kriging (OK) algorithm supported by the 5 m sample composites  for  all  units  and  elements,  and  density.  A  check  estimate  using  Inverse  Distance Weighting (IDW) to a power of 2 and nearest neighbor analysis has been completed for the Nb2O5 estimates for validation purposes. A nested search method consisting of three passes was used. The search ellipse has been rotated into the main dip and strike orientation of the deposit (Table 14-12).

| Domains   |   Rotation Angle 1 | Axis of Rotation   |   Rotation Angle 1 | Axis of Rotation   |

Due to observed variations in the dip of the carbonatite and mafic units the search ranges have been rotated  to  best  fit  the  semi-variogram  orientation  and  the  geological  model  (Figure  14-12).  The search ranges are based on the results of the variography as well as the average drillhole spacing.

In  the  first  search  passes  for  the  Carbonatite,  the  estimation  required  a  minimum  of  six  and maximum  of  16  composites  to  assign  grade  to  each  block.  A  lower  maximum  number  of  12 composites has been used in the mafics to account for the lower sample density and that commonly the mafics are represented by a single composite across the width of the wireframe. For the second pass, a minimum of three and max of 12 composites were required to assign grade. In the third pass the minimum number of samples has been reduced to one sample and a maximum of 12 samples were required to assign grade. A maximum of three composites from a single drillhole were allowed for all passes, thus at least two drillholes were used for the first search pass. No blocks estimated in subsequent  passes  were  allowed  to  overwrite  the  prior  passes  of  estimation.  No  octant  search restriction was applied.

The  number  of  composites  and  drillholes  used  to  estimate  each  block  were  stored  during  the estimation.  Each  pass  of  estimation  was  also  recorded  to  show  which  blocks  were  estimated  in which pass. The results show that an average of eight composites (using at least two holes) are used within the first two passes, which represents 73% of the number of blocks estimated. A detailed breakdown of the estimation parameters for the Carbonatite in each pass is shown in Table 14-13.

## 14.9  Model Validation

SRK has undertaken a thorough validation of the resultant interpolated model in order to: confirm the estimation  parameters,  check  that  the  model  represents  the  input  data  on  both  local  and  global scales, and check that the estimate is not biased. SRK has undertaken this using a using a number of different validation techniques:

- · Inspection of block grades in plan and section and comparison with drillhole grades;
- · Comparative Statistical study vs. composite data and alternative estimation methods; and
- · Sectional interpretation of the mean block and sample grades (Swath Plots).

## 14.9.1 Visual Comparison

The local validation of the interpolated block model on a local block scale has been assessed by using visual assessments and validation plots of sample grades verses estimated block grades. A thorough  visual  inspection  of  cross-sections,  long-sections,  and  bench/level  plans  comparing  the sample  grades  with  the  block  grades  has  been  undertaken.  The  review  demonstrated  a  good comparison between local block estimates and nearby samples, without excessive smoothing in the block  model.  Figure  14-13  shows  an  example  cross-section  of  the  visual  validation  checks  and highlights the overall block grades corresponding with raw samples grades. Additional cross-sections showing the block estimates vs. the composite grades are shown in Appendix C.

The same process has been completed for all three key elements and in SRK view the correlation between the blocks and the composite grades are reasonable for the current level of the drilling.

## 14.9.2 Comparative Statistics

SRK compared the composite grades to the estimated block grades within the wireframes for each domain. The comparison has been completed for Nb2O5, TiO2 and Sc\_ppm estimates.

The composite grades are presented using the declustered weighting for comparison to the block statistics.  Declustering  was  conducted  using  a  cell-declustering  algorithm,  with  default  cell  size  of 20 m x 20 m x 20 m. The comparison of the composite assays versus the block estimates are shown in Table 14-14 for all three elements.

Comparison of mean grades highlighted in gray Source: SRK, 2016

The results show acceptable levels of correlation between the mean blocks and declustered means for the Carbonatite domains. The 0.4 Nb2O5% and 0.5 Nb2O5% which combined for the majority of the metal above cut-off show difference in the mean grades typically reporting less than ± 2.5%, which SRK deems within acceptable levels.

The highest differences in the mean grades are noted within the 0.4 Nb2O5% grade shell, with the block model  grades  reporting approximately 5.5 %  higher than the declustered (10x10x10) composite mean. The estimates of the Sc grades show the highest variability from the raw mean, with  the  highest  differences  were  noted  in  the  KZONE  13  grade  shell  (Sc\_ppm  grades),  which reported 6.0% lower than the composite means. Overall within the core of the deposit the differences are within ± 3.3%, with the estimates reporting lower. A comparison between the TiO2 estimates and composites  show  these  estimates  perform  the  best  of  the  three  elements  estimated.  SRK  still considered  these  levels  of  error  to  be  within  acceptable  levels  of  error  for  the  current  level  of confidence and drillhole spacing.

In addition to the statistical analysis comparative histograms (Figure 14-14), distribution plots have been  reviewed  to  evaluate  the  degree  of  smoothing.  The  result  indicates  the  mean  grade  of  the deposits are relatively close (as confirmed in the statistical analysis), with the block models typically smoothed towards the mean and a reduction in higher end of the distribution. SRK considers the level  of  smoothing  to  be  appropriate  for  the  style  of  deposit  and  current  level  of  understanding.

During  the  2014  Mineral  Resource  update  SRK  noted  within  the  mafic  units  (KZONE  21)  the differences between  the  composite  and  block  estimates  were  more  significant  than  in  the Carbonatite units. SRK attributed the differences to two main factors:

- · The relatively small sample populations; and
- · The data populations within the mafic units were more highly skewed and the influence of individual high grades on the overall statistical mean should be considered higher.

SRK highlights that the mafic units represent a relatively small tonnage compared to the other units and any differences are not considered material to the global Mineral Resource.

SRK has therefore remodelled these units based on the revised geological logging codes and infill drilling information. SRK considers the confidence in the mafic units geological interpretation remains lower than the Carbonatite, but the majority of the estimates fall below the economic cut-off. A review of the statistical comparison between the composite grades and the block estimates does show an improvement in the 2015 block estimates (Table 14-15). SRK still considered these levels of error to be within acceptable levels of error.

## 14.9.3 Swath Plots

Swath plots were generated, which show the mean grades in the block model as a function of their distribution along particular orientations.

The swaths compare the composite grades to the block grades, with the intention of ensuring that there are no significant deviations between the two which might mean that some bias exists in one

part of the deposit. SRK calculated mean grades for composites and blocks within these swaths for all domains.

The  resultant  plots  show  a  good  correlation  between  the  block  model  grades  and  the  composite grades,  with  the  block  model  showing  a  typically  smoothed  profile  of  the  composite  grades  as expected. The plots for Nb2O5%, TiO2%, Sc (ppm) generally confirm no indication of any significant bias introduced during the estimation, and generally display an adequate degree of smoothing.

Based on the results of the analysis SRK has accepted the grades in the block model. Examples of the Nb2O5 swath analysis for the Carbonatite grade shells are shown in Figure 14-15, Figure 14-16 and Figure 14-17.

## 14.10  Resource Classification

The Mineral Resources are classified under the categories of Indicated and Inferred according to CIM guidelines. Due to a lack of dense (&lt;35 m x 35 m) drilling and pending further analysis of the Actlabs vs. SGS accuracy issues no Measured Mineral Resource has been assigned at this stage for the Project.

SRK's  classification  mainly  reflects  the  relative  confidence  of  the  geological  model  and  the associated grade estimates. This classification is also based on:

- · Sample  spacing  relative  to geological and  geo-statistical observations  regarding  the continuity of mineralization;
- · Data verification to original sources;
- · Specific gravity determinations;
- · Accuracy of drill collar locations;
- · Accuracy of topographic surface; and
- · Quality  of  the  assay  data  and  many  other  factors,  which  influence  the  confidence  of  the mineral estimation.

No single factor controls the resource classification; rather, each factor influences the result.

For the resource classification, a solid shape was constructed around the relatively well drilled core of the deposit resulting from the NioCorp Phase I to Phase III programs, where most drillholes are spaced approximately 60 to 70 m apart which allows typically three holes to be used for the first estimation search pass.

All blocks located within this area were classified as Indicated Mineral Resource (Figure 14-18). All blocks estimated outside of the perimeter of drillholes are classified as Inferred Mineral Resource, which typically extends 100 to 150 m beyond the drilling.

## 14.11   Mineral Resource Statement

The  following  section  defines  the  updated  Mineral  Resource  Statement  for  the  Project.  This statement  includes  the  estimated  Mineral  Resources  for  Nb2O5,  TiO2  and  Sc  for  the  deposit  the Effective  Date  of  Mineral  Resource  is  May  15,  2017,  which  is  the  date  the  final  metallurgical recoveries  were  determine  for  use  in  the  CoG  calculation.  This  represents  the  latest  Mineral Resource for the Project.

CIM Definition Standards for Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves (May 2014) defines a Mineral Resource as:

'(A)  concentration  or  occurrence  of  diamonds,  natural  solid  inorganic  material,  or  natural  solid fossilized organic material including base and precious metals, coal, and industrial minerals in or on the  Earth's  crust  in  such  form  and  quantity  and  of  such  a  grade  or  quality  that  it  has  reasonable prospects  for  economic  extraction.  The  location,  quantity,  grade,  geological  characteristics  and continuity  of  a  Mineral  Resource  are  known,  estimated  or  interpreted  from  specific  geological evidence and knowledge'.

Portions of a deposit that do not have reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction must not be included in a Mineral Resource.

The 'reasonable prospects for economic extraction' requirement generally implies that the quantity and grade estimates meet certain economic thresholds and that the Mineral Resources are reported at an appropriate CoG taking into account extraction scenarios and processing recoveries. Based on this  requirement, SRK considers that major portions of the Project are amenable for underground extraction with a processing method to recover FeNb (as the saleable product of Nb2O5), TiO2 and Sc2O3 products.

The result of positive indications from the company's metallurgical testing and development program, titanium (TiO2) and scandium (Sc) were added to the Mineral Resource Statement in February 2015. Both of these metals can be recovered with simple additions to the existing process flowsheet, and would  provide  additional  revenue  streams  that  would  complement  the  planned  production  of ferroniobium.

In the previous Mineral Resource Estimate SRK quoted the Mineral Resource using a CoG based on Nb2O5 only, but on-going work by the Company since the 2015 PEA has resulted in a change in approach to CoG, which is now based on a NSR basis. The economic parameters were selected based  on  experience  and  benchmarking  against  similar  projects  and  work  completed  by  the Company (Table 14-16).

SRK  based  price  and  cost  assumptions  on  the  pricing  of  products  at  the  'mine-gate',  with  no additional down-stream costs required. The assumed products are a ferroniobium product (in metal form, approximately 65% Nb and 35% Fe), a titanium dioxide product in powder form, and scandium trioxide in powder form. NioCorp completed market studies (with recognized independent companies)  to  obtain  pricing,  which  SRK  has  reviewed  and  completed  an  independent  review  of FeNb. Based on the review SRK is of the opinion that the prices are reasonable for the determination of potential for eventual economic extraction.

SRK has provided reasonable estimates of the expected costs based on the knowledge of the style of mining (underground) and potential processing methods. The selected metal recovery is based on the current metallurgical test work completed during the FS program.

The reader is cautioned that the results are used solely for the purpose of testing the 'reasonable prospects  for  economic  extraction'  by  underground  mining  methods,  and  do  not  represent  an attempt to estimate Mineral Reserves.

The estimated cost information presented here is used as a guide to assist in the preparation of a Mineral Resource Statement and to select an appropriate resource reporting CoG.

Table 14-16: Economic Assumptions Used to Define Mineral Resource Cut-off Value

| Parameter                   | Value   | Unit          |
|-----------------------------|---------|---------------|
| Mining Cost                 | 50.0    | US$/t mined   |
| Processing                  | 125.0   | US$/t of feed |
| General and Administrative  | 5.0     | US$/t of feed |
| Total Cost                  | 94.50   | US$/t of feed |
| Nb2O5 to Niobium conversion | 69.9    | %             |
| Niobium Process Recovery    | 85.8    | %             |
| Niobium Price               | 38.50   | US$/kg        |
| TiO2 Process Recovery       | 40.3    | %             |
| TiO2 Price                  | 0.88    | US$/kg        |
| Sc Process Recovery         | 93.1    | %             |
| Sc to Sc2O3 conversion      | 153.4   | %             |
| Sc Price                    | 3,500   | US$/kg        |
| Calculated CoG NSR          | 180.0   | US$/t         |

Source: SRK, 2016

The detailed description of the NSR calculation is defined in Section 15.2.4, but in summary, NSR has therefore been calculated as follows:

NSR (US$) = Revenue per block from Nb2O5 + Revenue per block from TiO2 + Revenue per block from Sc

## Tonnes per Block

The  Mineral  Resource  has  been  filtered  to  show  all  blocks  above  the  mining  cut-off  to  ensure estimates form suitable mining targets. Any isolated blocks of material reporting above cut-off can be removed as they will unlikely warrant the cost of development. No such cases existed at the Project and  all  material  within  the  geological  wireframes  above  a  cut-off  of  US$180/t  NSR  has  been considered to have reasonable prospects of being mined via underground methods.

SRK defined a Mineral Resource on receipt of a validated database, to account for these additional revenue streams. No additional resource definition drilling has been completed since the October 2015 press release and therefore changes have been limited to additional information provided from the  2016  re-assay  program  of  historical  pulps.  The  updated  Mineral  Resource  is  based  on  an additional 203 pulp samples, 374 pulverized pulp, and 90 chip samples re-assayed from historical holes which had not previously been assayed for TiO2% or Sc (ppm). The Mineral Resource also accounted for an estimate of the density values, as a relationship has been identified by SRK for higher density values at higher Nb2O5, TiO2 and Fe2O3 grades.

The Mineral Resource Statement in Table 14-17 has been determined using a net smelter return cutoff  value  based  on  economic  parameters  as  defined  in  Table  14-16.  The  Mineral  Resource  was

disclosed on February 23, 2015. This should be considered the latest estimate for the Project and be used in any future studies.

- (3) The Project is amenable to Underground longhole open stoping mining methods. Using results from metallurgical test work,  suitable  underground  mining  and  processing  costs,  and  forecast  product  pricing  SRK  has  reported  the  Mineral Resource at a NSR cut-off of US$180/t.
- (4) NSR uses the following factors
- · Nb2O5: 0.699 is conversion from Nb2O5 to Nb, 1000 is kg conversion, 85.8% is the hydromet plant recovery, 96% is the pyromet plant recovery, and 100% payability, assuming a US$38.5 kg selling price.
- · TiO2: 1000 is kg conversion, 40.3% is metallurgical recovery, assuming 100% payability, assuming a US$0.88/kg is selling price.
- · Sc:  93.1%  is  met  recovery,  100%  payability,  US$3,500  kg  is  selling  price  per  kg  of  scandium  oxide,  with  a conversion of 0.652 is the amount of Sc in Sc2O3
- · Price  assumptions  for  FeNb,  Sc2O3,  and  TiO2  are  based  upon  independent  market  analyses  for  each product.
- (5) SRK Completed a site inspection of the deposit by Mr. Martin Pittuck, MSc, CEng, MIMMM, an appropriate 'independent qualified person' as this term is defined in NI 43-101.

The  Mineral  Resource  presented  has  been  reported  following  CIM  guidelines.  The  current  study includes price and market assumptions concerning an expanded demand in the scandium market.

## 14.13  Comparison with Previous Estimate

There has been not material change to the block estimates in this current updated as no additional drilling has been completed. The only two differences between the models have been:

- · The additional of TiO2 and Sc assays which were previously absent; and
- · Change in the reporting criteria from using a 0.3% Nb2O5 CoG to an NSR basis.

Overall  the  result  has  been  an  increase  in  the  tonnage  in  both  the  Indicated  and  the  Inferred categories as more marginal material is considered economic. The Indicated portion of the Mineral Resource has increased by 13% in terms of tonnage, while the Inferred has increased by 34%. In terms of the contained Nb2O5 metal the latest model represents an increase of 5% in the Indicated and  15%  in  the  inferred  respectively,  while  the  TiO2  and  Sc  increase  approximately  9%  in  the indicated, and 29% and 24% in the Inferred respectively.

SRK is not aware of any environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, marketing, or other factors that could affect resources.

## 15 Mineral Reserve Estimate

## 15.1  Introduction

The  Project  is  currently  in the  exploration  phase  and  has  not  been  developed.  Based  on geomechanical information and mineralization geometry an underground longhole stoping method (LHS) is suitable for the deposit. Paste backfill will be used to allow for a high recovery of material.

The stopes will be 15 m wide and stope length will vary based on mineralization grade. A spacing of 25 m between levels has been used. The deposit is mined in blocks where mining within a block occurs from bottom to top with the use of paste backfill. Sill pillars are left in situ between blocks. The backfill will have sufficient strength to allow for mining adjacent to filled stopes, thus eliminating the need for dip pillars.

The  mine  will be shaft access to minimize development  through water bearing horizons. Mineralization  will  be  transported  from  stopes  to  the  shaft/hoist  system  by  underground  trucks.  A single ventilation raise will serve as a dedicated exhaust raise and will be raisebored conventionally. Intake air will be down the shaft with fresh air entering a dedicated ventilation drift above the loading pocket. As levels are developed lower in the deposit short slot raises will be developed connecting levels for ventilation purposes.

Access and infrastructure  development  underground  was  designed  to  support  the  mining  method and sized based on mining equipment and production rate requirements. Surface infrastructure and tailings were designed on lands which NioCorp has an option to purchase. The general layout of the mine and surface infrastructure is shown in Figure 15-1.

## 15.2  Conversion Assumptions, Parameters and Methods

Indicated  Mineral  Resources  were  converted  to  Probable  Mineral  Reserves  by  applying  the appropriate modifying factors, as described herein, to potential mining block shapes created during the  mine  design  process.  No  Measured  Resources  are  estimated  and,  as  a  result,  no  Proven Reserves are stated.

The undiluted tonnes and grade of each potential mining block is based on the resource block model estimated  by  SRK  as  described  in  Section  14  of  this  report.  All  Mineral  Reserve  tonnages  are expressed as "dry' tonnes (i.e., no moisture) and are based on the density values stored in the block model.

## 15.2.1 Dilution

The  mining  dilution  estimate  for  this  FS  is  based  on  the  equivalent  linear  overbreak/slough methodology (ELOS) (Clark, 1997). ELOS is an empirical design method that is used to estimate the amount of overbreak/slough that will occur in an underground opening based on rock quality and the

hydraulic radius of the opening. For the FS design, ELOS was applied to in situ rock exposed and to the paste backfill walls wherever mining will occur adjacent to a secondary stope. In additional to the ELOS allowances, a percent additional dilution allowance was used to account for other potential sources of dilution (e.g., dilution from the floor when mucking a stope).

ELOS assumptions are shown in Table 15-1.

Table 15-1: Dilution ELOS Assumptions

| Type                 |   ELOS Value (m) |
|----------------------|------------------|
| Sidewalls (rock)     |              0.3 |
| Sidewalls (backfill) |              0.3 |
| Bottom (backfill)    |              0.1 |

Source: SRK, 2017

The rock sidewall dilution material will be mineralized, as the deposit mineralization shows a gradual decrease in grade from the stopes in all directions. To determine the grade that should be used for dilution material 3-D triangulations were generated showing the dilution for a general representative area  of  the  deposit.  Figure  15-2  shows  the  bottom  and  sidewall  dilution  shapes  in  blue  with  the planned stope design shapes in green.

<!-- image -->

Figure 15-2: Bottom and sidewall dilution shapes

<!-- image -->

Grade for the dilution in rock was calculated and compared to the average grade of the stopes and is summarized as follows:

- · Nb2O5 grade of dilution is 83% of the average stope grade
- · TiO2 grade of dilution is 94% of the average stope grade
- · Sc grade of dilution is 89% of the average stope grade

These percentages of average stope grade are applied to each individual stope for the portion of ELOS which would be rock. Stopes are typically above other stopes 75% of the time. 20% of the time the stopes are not adjacent to other stopes. A zero grade is used for backfill dilution.

The ELOS and additional dilution factor gives a total dilution of 6%, with 3% of the dilution having grade from rock adjacent to stopes.

For horizontal development in ore (other than drill drives inside a stope), dilution of 5% was applied at zero grade.

## 15.2.2 Recovery

A stope recovery factor of 94% was used. The following items were used to calculate this factor:

- · Material loss into backfill (floor) or 0.4 m;
- · Material loss to side and endwalls (underblast) of 0.2 m;
- · Material loss to mucking along sides and in blind corners; and
- · Additional loss factor due to rockfalls, misdirected loads, and other geotechnical reasons.

A development recovery factor of 95% was used for all horizontal development.

## 15.2.3 Additional Allowances Factors

Additional ramp allowance factors were used to account for additional excavations not included in the  FS  design.  These  items  should  be  designed  at  the  detailed  planning  stage.  Items  are summarized in Table 15-2 for the main ramps and in Table 15-3 for the footwall accesses. Footwall accesses are assumed to be 500 m long for the percentage calculation.

These factors are applied to the main ramp and footwall accesses length and the volume/tonnage of rock is increased similarly. This captures the development time required to excavate these openings, cost to do so, and reports the expected amount of waste volumes for tracking purposes.

## 15.2.4 Cut-off Grade Calculation

Net Smelter Return (NSR) is a commonly accepted method of evaluating a mineral deposit where revenue  is  generated  from  multiple  elements.  NSR  is  defined  as  the  proceeds  from  the  sale  of

mineral  products  after deducting  off-site processing  and  distribution  costs. NSR  is  typically expressed  on  a  dollar  per  tonne  basis.  For  this  Project,  the  NSR  calculation  takes  into  account revenue for three products, FeNb, TiO2, and Sc2O3. A factor of 0.699 was used to convert Nb2O5 in the block model to Nb contained in the FeNb product. Similarly, a factor of 1.534 (1/0.652) was used to convert Sc to Sc2O3.

Recoveries  used  are  based  on  metallurgical  test  work  discussed  in  Section  13.  The  NSR  was evaluated  for  each  block  in  the  3-D  geologic  resource  block  model.  Table  15-4  shows  NSR parameters and an example NSR calculation for an individual block.

## 15.2.5 Mine Design

Potential mining areas were identified using stope optimization within Vulcan™ software. The stope optimizer output was reviewed on a level by level basis and a 3-D mine design was generated. The design includes stopes, accesses, and necessary infrastructure. Figure 15-4 shows the completed mine design. Note that three mining blocks are included in the design/reserve. There is additional mineralization below block 3, however as these blocks provide an approximate 32 year mine life, additional design was not completed at this time.

## 15.3  Reserves

Mineral  Reserves  were  classified  using  the  2014  CIM  Definition  Standards.  Indicated  Mineral Resources  were  converted  to  Probable  Mineral  Reserves  by  applying  the  appropriate  modifying factors,  as  described  herein,  to  potential  mining  block  shapes  created  during  the  mine  design process.

The underground mine design process results in mine plan resources of 31.7Mt (diluted) with an average grade of 0.79% Nb2O5, 2.81% TiO2, and 72 ppm Sc.

This estimate is based on a mine design using elevated CoGs and applying the US$180/t NSR CoG to material within the design. These numbers include a 94% to 100% mining recovery based on type of  opening  (stope,  development,  etc.)  to  the  designed  wireframes  in  addition  to  a  0%  to  6% unplanned dilution. A portion of the dilution does include grade as described in Section 15.2.1. An additional development allowance of 14% was applied to main ramps and 12% to level accesses to account for detail currently not in the design.

Table 15-6 summarizes the underground reserves as of May 15, 2017.

- (1) The Project is amenable to underground longhole open stoping mining methods. Using results from metallurgical test work,  suitable  underground  mining  and  processing  costs,  and  forecast  product  pricing  SRK  has  reported  the  Mineral Reserve at a NSR cut-off of US$180/t.
- (2) NSR uses the following factors (these factors vary somewhat from the final technical economic model, however SRK is of the opinion that the differences are immaterial):
- · Nb2O5: 0.699 is conversion from Nb2O5 to Nb, 1,000 is kg conversion, 85.8% is the hydromet plant recovery, 96% is the pyromet plant recovery, 100% payability, assuming a US$38.5 kg selling price.
- · TiO2: 1,000 is kg conversion, 40.3% is metallurgical recovery, assuming 100% payability, assuming a US$0.88/kg is selling price.
- · Sc: 93.1% is metallurgical recovery, 100% payability, US$3,500 kg is selling price per kg of scandium oxide, with a conversion of 0.652 is the amount of Sc in Sc2O3.
- · Price assumptions for FeNb, Sc2O3, and TiO2 are based upon independent market analyses for each product.
- (3) All figures are rounded to reflect the relative accuracy of the estimates. Totals may not sum due to rounding.
- (4) Ore reserves have been stated on the basis of a mine design, mine plan, and cash-flow model.
- (5) Mining recovery is applied and ranges from 94% to 100%.
- (6) Mining  dilution  (internal  and  external)  is  included.  External  stope  dilution  is  6%,  and  a  portion  of  the  external  stope dilution is applied using grade values based on average surrounding block information. A development dilution of 5% is used at a 0% grade.

## 16 Mining Methods

## 16.1  Geology Overview

The mine planning work is based on the resource geology and block model, described in chapter 14 of this report. The deposit is hosted within the Elk Creek Carbonatite. Carbonatites commonly occur as intrusive bodies, such as isolated sills, dikes, or plugs, although rarely occur as extrusive rocks. The Carbonatite is covered by approximately 190 to 200 m of Pennsylvanian sedimentary rock and till. niobium (Nb2O5), titanium (TiO2), and scandium (Sc) mineralization are hosted in the carbonatite. The current known extents of the Carbonatite unit are approximately 950 m along strike, 300 m wide, and 750 m in dip extent.

Two dominant trend surfaces have been used in the block model creation process. The southwest contact has been modelled using a strong sub-vertical trend (shown in blue), while the northeast of the deposit has followed moderate dipping trends (shown in black) parallel to the low-grade mafic units (shown in green) as shown Figure 16-1.

In addition  to  the  mineralization,  various  other  elements  were  estimated  into  the  model  for metallurgical purposes.

## 16.2  Mining and Project History

The majority of exploration over the Project area was completed by Molycorp prior to 1984. Starting in 2009, the title of the Project was held by Elk Creek Resources Corp. (ECRC). On May 4, 2010 Quantum announced the acquisition  of  ECRC  and  acquired  the  mineral  rights  to  the  Project.  On March  3, 2013  Quantum  announced  an  official name  change  from  Quantum  Rare  Earth

Developments  Corp.  to  NioCorp  Developments  Ltd.  (NioCorp).  NioCorp's  focus  is  to  develop  the Project.

SRK  completed  a  PEA  for  the  Project  originally  published  on  May  15,  2015  and  Amended  on October 16, 2015.

## 16.3  Geotechnical Design Parameters

From May 21, 2014 to July 30, 2015 SRK completed a geotechnical investigation program on site for the Project. The program was designed to characterize subsurface geotechnical conditions to assist in  the  development  of  a  FS  design  capable  of  meeting  the  requirements  for  basic  engineering design.

The  geotechnical  database  used  for  analyses  includes  data  from  two  geotechnical  borehole databases:  the  2014  program  and  a  previous  2011  program.  A  geotechnical  model  was  created using the characterization information in the databases to estimate rock mass quality, rock strength, and  major  discontinuities  in  the  carbonatite  hangingwall  and  footwall  and  the  Pennsylvanian Formation. The 3-D geotechnical model was built using the Vulcan software, wherein representative volumes of rock mass quality domains were created. The following is a summary of the geotechnical parameters used to assess the mine design.

## Data Collection

The geotechnical field investigation consisted of 23 drillholes, totaling 20,379 m. The program was designed to examine rock mass fabric and structural features in and around the mineralized zone at different depths and orientations. The drilling was conducted  in  three  phases  with  incremental  data  collection  designed  to  fill  knowledge  gaps  on  geotechnical  conditions. Drillholes were drilled at varying orientations into the hangingwall, footwall, and mineralized rock to capture data on rock mass discontinuity variations. The drillholes are shown in Source: SRK, 2017

Figure 16-2 in plan view and the location data are summarized in Table 16-1. The field investigation included  drilling  of  core,  geophysical  borehole  logging  of  structural  features,  geotechnical  core logging, core sample collection for laboratory strength testing, and in situ stress measurements.

Structural  features  (discontinuities)  encountered  during  this  field  investigation  consisted  of  joints, lithological contacts, veins, dikes, foliation, faults, shear zones and fractures. Orientation data was collected using acoustic televiewer (ATV) down-hole equipment. Typical alteration on discontinuity surfaces  was  recorded  in  the  logs  and  included  mineralized  coatings  or  infillings  with  occasional hematite staining. Faulting was interpreted using evidence of slickensided surfaces and the presence of gouge infilling and orientations verified using the ATV orientation data.

## Geotechnical Domains

Four  spatial geotechnical  domains  were  identified  based  on  lithology,  weathering,  structural conditions and rock mass strength similarities. These geotechnical domains include:

- · Pennsylvania Formation in the upper 200 m;
- · Hangingwall material to southwest of the orebody;
- · Mineralized carbonatite orebody; and
- · Footwall material to northeast of the orebody.

These domains, shown on Source: SRK, 2017

Figure  16-3,  were  delimited  based  on  intact  rock  properties  and  in  situ  rock  mass  quality  from characterization  logging.  Characterization  was  based  on  Rock  Mass  Rating  (RMR76)  (Bieniawski, 1976)  and  the  Q-system  (Barton,  1974).  These  values  were  then  used  with  empirical  design methods to assess the basic inputs for underground mine design.

## Structural Faulting

Data on the regional structural geology and the borehole ATV logging data was used to identify 21 major structures in the local mine-scale geology. Source: SRK, 2017

Figure 16-4 shows a plan view section through the Vulcan™ model with the position of the stopes and footwall  accesses  relative  to  the  geologic  structures  on  the  +60  m  elevation  level  in  Block  1 mining stopes.

## Rock Mass Quality

The laboratory testing program included 71 Unconfined Compressive Strength (UCS) tests of intact samples,  17  Triaxial  Compressive  Strength  (TCS)  tests  of  intact  samples,  and  38  Direct  Shear Strength (DSS) tests of jointed rock samples. Triaxial tests were conducted at different confinement levels  (80  tests)  to  account  for  anticipated  variations  in  stress  conditions.  A  set  of  29  static  and dynamic elastic constant measurements were collected to characterize the elastic properties of the rock.  A  total  of  12  Brazilian  Tensile  Strength  (BTS)  tests  were  conducted  to  characterize  tensile strength  of  the  rock  mass.  The  UCS  results  were  used  to  calibrate  the  spatial  variation  of  UCS values interpreted from 2,180 Point Load Tests (PLT) conducted in the field during the core logging program.  The  laboratory  tests  were  sufficient  to  develop  shear  strength  parameters  (intact  and discontinuity) and provide estimates of the statics and dynamics elastic constants.

The majority of the Rock Quality Designation (RQD) values indicate fair to good rock quality (RQD = 80  to  100)  throughout  the  drillholes.  Regions  with  lower  RQD  (RQD  =  10  to  60)  were  generally associated  with  weathered  or  altered  rock  zones  and/or  minor  geological  intrusions.  Fracture frequencies ranged from 0.1 to 9 fractures per meter with an average of 3 fractures per meter.

The core was generally  fresh  to  slightly  weathered  with  weathering  limited  to  the  surfaces  of  the discontinuities  of  slight  rock  mass  alteration.  Field  index  strength  tests  indicate  that  the  core  was

strong on average (R4). The core tended to break along pre-existing planes of weakness such as veins, foliation and healed structural features.

Laboratory  UCS  tests  results  indicate  that  the  carbonatite  and  lamprophyre  strength  ranges  from strong to very strong (UCS = 50 to 250 MPa), whereas the mafic dikes and mudstone and limestone of the Pennsylvania Formation are moderately strong to strong (UCS = 25 to 100 MPa). Table 16-2 shows a summary of the rock mass properties by domain.

The ATV data was used to establish the structural domains and for input to structural model. The oriented  core  investigation  included  a  total  of  16,790  m  of  ATV  scans  of  which  9,494 m  were sufficient  for  discontinuity  interpretation  (i.e.,  57%  of  televiewer  success).  Structural  sets  were identified  for  each  domain  based  on  orientation  clusters  and  discontinuity  type.  Table  16-3  is  a summary of the ATV data obtained in each drillhole.

The RMR76 values ranged from 50 to 70 in the hangingwall rock, with Barton Q' values ranging from 4 to 20 with the majority of the rock mass being of fair to good quality. In the footwall RMR76 values ranged from 50 to 80, with Q' values ranging from 4 to 30 with the majority of the rock mass being of fair to good quality. The mineralized rock had the greatest RMR76 variations, where values ranged from 60 to 80, and Q' values ranged from 5 to 25, but overall the rocks are fair to good quality.

## Pre-Mining Stress Regime

Since no information on in situ stresses was available in the region and this underground mine would be the first in the district, a stress measurement program was undertaken.

In  September  2014,  Agapito  Associates,  Inc.  (AAI,  2014)  performed  downhole  in  situ  horizontal stress testing at the site using the Sigra IST tool. The purpose of the testing program was to estimate the in situ horizontal stress field in the two basic rock types present at the site: the un-mineralized Pennsylvania rock (above 200 m depth) and the mineralized carbonatite ore zone (below 200 m). A total of thirteen tests were conducted; eight of which were successful. The results of the study were as follows:

- · There  is  an  apparent  increase  of  stress  with  depth  of  about  36  kPa/m  for  the  major horizontal stress ( σ H) and 21 kPa/m for the minor horizontal stress( σ h);

## Seismicity

A  high-level  assessment  of  the  local  seismic  earthquake  potential  from  the  International  Building Code suggests a local Peak Ground Acceleration (PGA) of 0.02g for a 50-year return earthquake event. The source of the peak ground acceleration is the 2002 USGS Interactive National Seismic Hazard  Map  (Frankel  et  al,  2003).  It  shows  the  Maximum  Design  Earthquake  (MDE)  with  an expected 1% probability of having an earthquake of magnitude greater than 5.0 in 100 years.

No additional studies of seismicity were conducted since the region is not particularly known for large earthquake activity.

## Mine Layout Parameters

SRK  evaluated  different  mining  methods.  Given  constraints  on  limiting  the  extent  of  surface disturbance, long-hole open stoping with backfilling was selected as the optimal mining method for the orebody. To maximize ore extraction, SRK has selected a primary/secondary stope extraction sequence,  whereby  primary  stopes  are  mined  first  on  first  pass  and  backfilled  prior  to  mining secondary stopes.

The orebody shape is longest in the northwest-to-southeast direction, which is nearly perpendicular to  the  major principal stress ( σ 1).  Considering the principal stress orientations, the major geologic structures, and the local discontinuity orientations, SRK has chosen the stopes orientation to be N 60°E creating the most favorable ground conditions during mining. In this way, the major principal stress  is  redistributed  around  the  smallest  dimension  of  the  primary  stopes.  Figure  16-6  shows  a plan  view  of  stope  orientations  with  the  hangingwall  toward  the  southwest  and  footwall  (with infrastructure) towards the northeast.

To minimize long-term, mining-induced damage to access drifts, the setback distances used in the design of the mine is 25 m for haulage drives and 75 m for the main ramps. These values represent the minimum distance between the drifts and induced stresses from stope mining. These setback distances were verified from the results of 3-D numerical modeling of the mining sequence.

## Stope Dimensions

A stope stability assessment was completed using the stability graph method (Mathews et al., 1981; Potvin, 1988; Potvin and Milne, 1992 and Nickson, 1992) with stope dimensions of:

- · Width: 15 m
- · Height: 30 m
- · Length: 50 m

The method compares the hydraulic radius (area divided by perimeter) of a stope face to a stability index number. The stability index number accounts for the rock mass quality (primarily Q values) with  adjustments  for  local  fracture  orientations,  potential  block  failure  mode  into  the  stope,  and induced  mining  stresses.  The  results  from  the  stability  assessment  indicated  that  the  initial dimensions for stopes are stable. Figure 16-7 and Figure 16-8 show the stability chart of each stope face under slightly weathered and moderately weathered carbonatite conditions, respectively.

A  second  stability  assessment  was  completed  by  using  larger  stope  dimensions  assuming  15% dilution along the walls. Results of this analysis indicate that these diluted stopes should be stable but  may  require  some  support  depending  on  rock  mass  quality.  The  actual  in  situ  rock  mass conditions need to be incorporated in the final stope designs.

Stope stability was verified using 3-D numerical model which simulated the stoping sequence.

## Backfill Strength

An  initial  backfill  strength  assessment  was  completed  for  the  primary/secondary  stopes.  This assessment identified  the  minimum  strength  required  for  the  primary  panels  to  be  self-supporting when  they  are  exposed  on  the  east  and  west  walls.  Two  methods  were  used  to  determine  the minimum  backfill  strengths:  2-D  analytic  vertical  stope  method  and  numerical  modeling  using FLAC3D stope-scale model.

The  analytical  methods  included  Li  and  Aubertin  (2014)  and  Belem  and  Benzaazoua  (2004)  for single  stope  face  of  backfill  exposed  during  secondary  stope  mining  (exposing  two  backfill  faces simultaneously is not planned). Using a factor of safety of 2.0, a 14-day UCS strength of 1.0 MPa was considered the minimum strength for the primary stope panels. The numerical modeling results confirmed  these  values.  The  model  was  also  used  to  verify  that  secondary  stopes  would  remain stable  in  that  no  'sit-down'  failure  mechanism  would  occur  against  two  adjacent  backfilled  stopes during the progressive mining of the secondary stope.

## Dilution

Dilution  was  estimated  using  the  method  developed  by  Clark  and  Pakalnis  (1997)  based  on  an empirical model calibrated to case histories for dilution into open stopes. The method predicts the quantity of unstable wall rock for a given rock mass quality from a given stope size. The parameters plotted on the dilution chart are the stability number, N', and hydraulic radius.

The thickness of external dilution is estimated as an ELOS. Figure 16-9 shows the range of predicted equivalent linear overbreak/slough (ELOS) for moderately weathered carbonatite, and Figure 16-10 shows ELOS for fresh to slightly weathered carbonatite. Sidewall and back dilution is not expected to be  a  problem  because  in  primary  stopes  dilution  (from  secondary  stopes)  will  be  at  grade  and dilution  from  secondary  stopes  is  managed  by  controlling  backfill  strength.  Given  the  low  fracture frequencies (about 3 m / fracture) dilution is anticipated to be variable.

For design purposed, an average of 0.2 m of ELOS dilution has been assumed for endwalls and 0.3 m for sidewalls. In backfilled sidewalls an average of 0.3 m has been assumed.

## Ground Support

Ground  support  requirements  have  been  estimated  using  empirical  support  charts  developed  by Barton  (1974).  The  method  relates  the  rock  mass  quality  (Q)  to  the  equivalent  dimension  of  the excavation (De). De is the ratio of the excavation width (D) to the excavation support ratio (ESR) index.  The  ESR  value  accounts  for  a  degree  of  safety  required  depending  on  the  use  of  the excavation.  Values  ranges  from  ESR=1.6  for  long-term  critical  access  drifts  to  2.5  for  short-term temporary  accesses  into  stopes.  The  recommended  ground  support  consists  of  three  general classes of support levels based on rock mass quality, drift usage and drift dimensions. The threeclass system includes:

- · Support Type 1 - spot bolting for Q&gt;4 (~69% of drifts);
- · Support Type 2 - systematic bolting and 4 to 10 cm of fiber reinforced shotcrete for Q&lt;4 and Q&gt;1 (~24% of drifts); and
- · Support Type 3 - systematic bolting, steel mesh, and 4 to 10 cm of plain shotcrete for Q&lt;1 (~7% of drifts).

Table  16-4  summarizes  the  drift  dimensions  used  to  estimate  ground  support  requirements.  The Support specifications are summarized in Table 16-5.

## Crown Pillar Stability

Crown pillar stability assessment was conducted using the empirical Scaled Span Method (Carter, 1992) and a limit equilibrium analysis in the CPillar software. The results of the empirical analysis indicate that if  the  rock  mass  quality  in  the  crown  has  a  Q  value  greater  than  37,  then  all  stopes could be mined in Level 1 with a Factor of Safety (FOS) of more than 2.0. No additional analyses are required  at  this  time  because  the  stopes  are  planned  to  be  tightly  backfilled  and  the  FOS  will  be much higher.

The results of the 3D numerical model confirm that the crown pillar will remain stable during and after mining. The total predicted surface displacement is anticipated to be less than about 1 cm at the end of mining.

## 16.4  Hydrogeology Design Parameters

The hydrogeology of the deposit is characterized based on three phases of work:

- 1. The first phase of hydrogeological characterization was conducted during phases 1 and 2 of the  core  drilling  program  and  consisted  of  packer  testing,  installation  of  piezometers,  and measurement of water levels. Specifically, the program included:
- o 42 downhole packer-isolated injection and airlift tests in coreholes;
- o Installation of six 2 inch PVC standpipe piezometers isolated in the carbonatite and open to large intervals of the deposit;
- o Installation of two nominal 2 inch PVC standpipe piezometers isolated in the 180 m thick Pennsylvanian aquitard above the carbonatite; and
- o Frequent measurement of water levels in open coreholes and piezometers over a period of six months.
- 2. Following the second phase of resource-related core drilling, a 10-day airlift pumping test was completed using a deep, open, vertical PQ corehole as a pumping well. Water levels from the surrounding piezometers were recorded over the duration of the test and for several weeks following the test.
- 3. The third phase of hydrogeological characterization involved installation of two multi-level, distally-located piezometers and a deep 6 inch diameter injection well completed to depths of 850 m, followed by completion of a nominal 30-day injection test. The piezometers were completed within the carbonatite at distances of 0.6 km and 1.2 km from the center of the injection well at the center of the deposit. The injection test was chosen as a test method over a standard pumping test due to the salinity of the groundwater and the expense of handling the discharge water. During the injection test, surface water from Todd Creek was injected at rates of between 22 and 30 L/sec (350 to 480 gpm) over a period of 33 days, including downtime. Response to the injection test was monitored over the duration of the test and for more than eight weeks following the test.

## Conceptual Hydrogeology

Significant components of the pre-mining conceptual hydrogeology at Elk Creek are:

- · The local geology consists of a thin layer of glacial till overlying 180 m of low-permeability Pennsylvanian-aged shale and limestone resting on top of the carbonatite host rock.
- · The  horizontal  hydraulic  conductivity  (K)  of  the  Pennsylvanian  strata  is  on  the  order  of 10 -4 m/d; the vertical K of the limestone is likely 100 times lower. The Pennsylvanian strata essentially  isolates  the  glacial  till  groundwater  system  from  the  deeper  carbonatite,  and functions as an aquitard.
- · The carbonatite  is  faulted  by  regional  and  local  structures,  and  exhibits  elevated  K  along faults to the full depth of the mapped resource, from 200 m at the limestone contact to at least 850 m  below  ground  surface  (bgs).  The  total  vertical  depth  of  the  permeable carbonatite is unknown. The carbonatite may be micro-karstic in places. Measured K values in  the  carbonatite  range  from  10 -2 m/d  in  undisturbed  rock  to  2  m/d  along  faults.  The distribution of hydraulic conductivity is shown on Figure 16-11.

- · The carbonatite appears to be quasi-isotropic and relatively homogenous, despite being a fractured  rock  unit,  as  illustrated  by  the  inferred  drawdown  observed  at  the  end  of  the injection test shown on Figure 16-12.
- · The carbonatite is surrounded by granite, which is believed to be relatively non-permeable (assumed  K=  10 -2 m/d), and  may  be  regionally faulted, providing limited hydraulic communication laterally into the carbonatite.
- · Water  levels  in  the  Pennsylvanian  strata  are  nominally  50  to  80  meters  below  ground surface (mbgs), while depths to groundwater in the carbonatite are approximately 100 mbgs. There is a downward hydraulic gradient from the limestone to the carbonatite.
- · The heads in the carbonatite require that groundwater flows from the carbonatite to a lowerpressure  'sink',  or  distant  groundwater  or  surface  water  body.  The  Central  Missouri  fault (Central  Plains  Shear  Zone)  may  hydraulically  connect  the  deep  carbonatite  to  a  distant boundary such as the Missouri River in the southeast or a distant oil and gas basin to the east (Forest City Basin).

The  conceptual  model  for  the  Project  is  based  primarily  on  testing  and  water  level  information acquired within the boundaries of the deposit, with the exception of two piezometers located 0.6 and 1.2 km to the south and southeast. The structural features, the granite, and the distal carbonatite surrounding the deposit have not been well characterized, and these hydrogeological units will play a large  role  in  controlling  inflow  to  an  underground  mine.  There  is  a  lack  of  information  on  the carbonatite to the west and north outside of the deposit, and an absence of test data or water levels in the granite. There are also uncertainties with the permeable thickness of carbonatite, as well as with the distribution of K with depth. The presence of a distant, external water source(s) through a geologic structure (Central Plains Megashear) hydraulically connected to the carbonatite groundwater system is not confirmed. A conceptual hydrogeological snap shot of the Project toward the end of the mine life is provided Figure 16-13.

The  conceptual  model  was  refined  and  evaluated  using  a  numerical  groundwater  flow  model (described  below)  of  the  Project,  and  various  alternatives  were  calibrated  adequately  to  data measured in the field.

## Predicted Dewatering Requirements

A fully three-dimensional groundwater-flow model was constructed using the finite difference code -MODFLOW-SURFACT. The Elk Creek numerical model defines dewatering requirements for four years  of  pre-production  and  32  years  of  productive  underground  mining.  Model  predictions  were completed for both passive inflow and active dewatering scenarios.

The model predicts for the Base Case a maximum passive inflow in Year 0 of about 580 L/sec for ungrouted conditions and 385 L/sec in year 14, if grouting of the developments is implemented. The amount of predicted passive inflow to the underground could not be handled effectively with an inmine  sump  system,  and  therefore  active  dewatering  with  wells  will  be  required.  Hydrogeological parameters used for the Base Case are summarized in Table 16-6.

## Active dewatering predictions include:

- · A maximum dewatering rate of 757 L/sec from 12 wells reached in pre-mining Year -1, and maintained through Year 4, as shown on Figure 16-14.
- · Dewatering rates begin to decline in Year 5, and decrease to 230 L/sec by the end of mine life;
- · Initially, approximately 97% of inflow to the wells would come from groundwater storage and 3% from the distal water source. By end of mining, 79% of the total inflow to dewatering wells will originate from the distal water source; and
- · A  maximum  drawdown  of  652  m  will  occur  within  the  mineralized  carbonatite  zone. Drawdown at the carbonatite-granite contact is estimated to range from 445 to 485 m.

Source: SRK, 2017

The largest uncertainties associated with dewatering requirement predictions are associated with the following factors:

- · The thickness of the permeable carbonatite;
- · The K of the granite;
- · The specific yield of the carbonatite; and
- · The  existence  or  absence  of  a  distal,  external  water  source  through  a  geologic  structure (e.g., Central  Plains  Megashear  or  other)  hydraulically  connected  to  the  carbonatite groundwater system.

These uncertainties could be addressed either through a large-scale, long duration pumping test or through the installation and operating of the active dewatering system over an extended period of time. Taking these four factors into account in the modeling predictions, uncertainty analyses were conducted. The Inputs to seven additional uncertainty analyses are summarized in Table 16-7.

The results suggest that the average dewatering rate could be in a range between 342 L/sec and 905 L/sec.  The  base  case  maximum  anticipated  rate  is  757  L/sec  (12,000  gpm),  and  has  been selected as the design basis for the active dewatering system.

## 16.5  Mine Design

## 16.5.1 Selection of Mining Method

Based on geomechanical information and mineralization geometry an underground longhole stoping method (LHS) is suitable for the deposit. Paste backfill will be used to allow for a high recovery of material.

The stopes will be 15 m wide and stope length will vary based on mineralization grade. A spacing of 25 m between levels has been used. The deposit is mined in blocks where mining within a block occurs from bottom to top with the use of paste backfill. Sill pillars are left in situ between blocks. The backfill will have sufficient strength to allow for mining adjacent to filled stopes, thus eliminating the need for dip pillars.

The  mine  will be shaft access to minimize development  through water bearing horizons. Mineralization  will  be  transported  from  stopes  to  the  shaft/hoist  system  by  underground  trucks.  A single ventilation raise will serve as a dedicated exhaust raise and will be raisebored conventionally. Intake  air  will  move  down  the  shaft  with  fresh  air  entering  a  dedicated  ventilation  drift  above  the loading  pocket.  As  levels  are  developed  lower  in  the  deposit  short  slot  raises  will  be  developed connecting levels for ventilation purposes.

The mine design process involved using stope optimization within Vulcan™ software to determine potentially mineable areas based on a CoG and minimum mining dimensions. Dilution and recovery were  added  to  the  designed  tonnage  to  account  for  unplanned  stope  dilution  and  unrecoverable material within the stope.

The mining design was based on a marketing constraint provided by NioCorp to produce no more than 7,500 t/y of ferroniobium and a mine life of at least 30 years. Optimization work indicated that a grade  of  0.8%  Nb2O5  was  the  highest  possible  that  would  sustain  a  consistent  ferroniobium production over the LoM. The final mill production rate was established at 2,760 t/d. Once the final

FS level metallurgical recoveries were applied, an annualized production of approximately 7,055 t of ferroniobium  could  be  produced  per  year.  Scandium  trioxide  and  titanium  dioxide  follows  the ferroniobium  production  in  the  mine  plan.  SRK  used  an  NSR  based  approach  on  production scheduling targeting the annual ferroniobium requirement.

Access and infrastructure  development  underground  was  designed  to  support  the  mining  method and sized based on mining equipment and production rate requirements. Surface infrastructure and tailings were designed on lands which NioCorp has an option to purchase. The general layout of the mine and mill is shown in Figure 15-1.

## 16.5.2 Stope Optimization

Figure  16-15  shows  cross  sections  of  the  resource  block  model  blocks  above  a  NSR  CoG  of US$180/t which have been classified as Measured and Indicated. There is a higher-grade portion of mineralization at depth and the mineralization at those depths is approximately 300 m along strike. Higher in the deposit the mineralization is approximately 600 m in length along strike. This model formed the basis of the stope design.

Stope optimization was completed in Vulcan™ using a minimum mining stope width of 15 m, a stope height of 25 m, variable length along strike, and an NSR CoG of US$180/t. The stopes and block model  are  oriented  to  match  the  direction  of  in  situ  stresses,  which  are  elevated  (~1.2H:1V).  As

discussed in Section 16.3 this stope orientation optimizes stress distribution and allows for mining of larger openings.

To  produce  approximately  7,000  t  FeNb  annually  with  a  process  facility  capacity  of  2,760 t/d  a minimum average grade  of  approximately  0.8%  Nb2O5  must  be  mined.  This  can  be  achieved  by varying  the  mine  design  CoG  somewhat  by  level  to  maintain  the  approximate  average  grade required (and can be further optimized through short term planning). All CoGs used are above the marginal  calculated  CoG  discussed  in  Section  15.2.4.  Using  elevated  CoGs  to  maximize  NPV  or achieve other company goals has the effect of leaving lower grade resource material in situ. SRK notes that using a cut-off of US$180/t would give an average Nb2O5 grade of approximately 0.64%. To achieve an average Nb2O5 grade of 0.8%, the NSR cut-off is raised to approximately US$500/t, which is a significant increase.

Several  stope  optimization  runs  were  generated  using  various  recoveries,  pricing,  and  cut-offs  to determine  sensitivity  of  the  deposit  to  both  recovery  and  prices.  As  an  elevated  Nb2O5  cut-off  is being targeted the purpose of the stope optimization was to determine at what point the deposit no longer holds together well for mining, and to track average Nb2O5 grades to determine the optimal optimization run to generate the desired quantity of FeNb. Figure 16-16 and Table 16-9 shows stope optimization  results  given  fixed  pricing  and  recovery  as  outlined  in  Section  15.2.4.  Note  that dilution/recovery has not been applied to the optimization results.

The  highest  CoG  possible  was  used  for  the  design  where  the  deposit  would  hold  together reasonably  for  mine  design  purposes  in  order  to  achieve  the  highest  practical  Nb2O5  grade.  This elevated cut-off was approximately the US$500/t optimization. SRK notes that the stope optimization results  show  that  there  is  a  significant  amount  of  material  between  the  elevated  cut-off  and  the economic cut-off of US$180/t.

## 16.5.3 Stope Design

Stope optimizer shapes were used as a basis for the design work. Stopes are 15 m wide and 25 m high with varying length. Each stope has a 4.5 m x 4.5 m access located at the bottom of the stope as shown in Figure 16-17. Top accesses are designed to give access to stopes on the next level and to allow for backfilling. The stopes are drilled from the top and rings are blasted from the end of a stope toward the footwall access. The blasted material is remotely mucked from the stope access.

Figure  16-18  shows  a  rotated  view  of  a  typical  level  layout  with  stopes  shown  in  blue  and development  accesses  shown  in  green.  A  level  is  made  up  of  approximately  20  to  30  footwall accesses  and  the  stopes  are  cut  along  strike  to  follow  maximum  geotechnical  lengths.  As  the mineralization is fairly continuous along the length of the stope, there are many instances where 3-4 stopes  are  mined  from  the  same  footwall  access.  Due  to  this,  a  higher  strength  backfill  will  be necessary for a high percentage of stopes.

Source: SRK, 2017

A primary/secondary stoping sequence will be used, where on any given level primary stopes must be separated by a secondary stope. Extraction of the secondary stope can only occur after the two immediately  adjacent  primary  stopes  have  been  mined,  backfilled,  and  have  had  time  to  cure. Backfilling will be an integral part of the (LHS) mining cycle, however with the quantity of stopes on a level and flexibility in sequencing mining should not be limited by backfilling operations. If a shorter level is encountered with fewer stopes then backfilling may be a limiting factor which could reduce mining rates on that level.

## 16.5.4 Development Design

The stope accesses are connected to a level access located in waste or low grade material. The level accesses are offset approximately 25 m from the end of stopes. Each stope access typically connects  to  the  level  access  except  in  cases  where  stopes  are  small  and  long  development  is required to reach the stope. In those instances, a connection from an adjacent stope is included in the design. This minimizes the amount of development, however it limits the sequencing order.

The level  accesses  connect  to  the  main  ramp  which  is  offset  at  least  75 m  from  stoping  into  the footwall. On the southeast side of each level the level access connects to an exhaust air ventilation raise  and  on  the  northwest  side  connects  to  a  fresh  air  raise.  The  fresh  air  raise  serves  as  a secondary means of egress. As the main ramp connection is typically near the middle of a level, a manway raise has been designed at the southeast side of the levels to provide another mean of egress for personnel. Figure 16-19 shows a typical level section.

Figure  16-20  shows  the  completed  mine  design.  Shaft,  raise,  and  underground  infrastructure included in the design are discussed in other sections. Note that 3 mining blocks are included in the design.  There  is  additional  mineralization  below  block  3,  however  as  these  blocks  provide  an approximate 32 year mine life, additional design was not completed at this time.

## 16.5.5 Mine Access

The underground mine will be accessed through a shaft system that will be sunk conventionally. The surface  facilities  include  a  hoist  house,  headframe  structure,  hoisting  system,  compressor  room, Motor  Control  Center  (MCC)  room,  headframe  structure  with  collar  house,  a  mine  electrical substation,  and  a  development  ventilation  system  that  will  be  converted  to  a  ventilation  booster system during production. Shaft heating will also be provided.

The underground system includes the shaft, two cage-over-skips, an auxiliary cage, loading pocket and  skip  loader,  and  a  muck  handling  system  at  the  bottom  of  the  shaft.  An  emergency  escape system is included in the return air raise.

The hoist house contains a two-hoist system, a main production hoist and an auxiliary hoist. The production hoisting system is a 1,415 kW (1,900 HP), double drum system, 5 m in diameter, in a double-clutch  configuration  for  maximum  efficiency.  The  system  allows  for  up  to  5,000  t  of  muck

hoisting  within  a  ten  hour  shift,  in  addition  to  the  use  of  the  light  duty  service  hoist.  The  second hoisting plant will utilize a 447 kW (600 HP), 2.44 m single drum hoisting plant that will serve as light duty service hoist and secondary means of egress during shaft construction. The auxiliary hoist will be connected to the emergency generator included in the plant electrical system, as it serves as an emergency  egress  from  the  shaft.  The  collar  house  provides  a  staging  area  for  personnel  and materials going down the shaft or returning to the surface and for maintenance.

Figure 16-23 and Figure 16-24 show the shaft and raise locations.

## 16.6  Production Schedule

The production schedule is based on the mine design and reserves discussed in previous sections.

## 16.6.1 Productivity

Productivities were developed from first principles. Input from mining contractors, blasting suppliers and equipment vendors was considered for key parameters such as drilling penetration rates, blast hole  size  and  spacing,  explosives  loading  time,  bolt  and  mesh  installation  time,  etc.  The  rates developed  from  first  principles  were  adjusted  based  on  benchmarking  and  the  experience  and judgment of SRK.

The productivity rates used for mine scheduling are shown in Table 16-11, followed by a description of the general and activity-specific parameters upon which the productivity rates are based.

## Main Ramp Development (long-term development openings)

The main ramp is 5.5 m wide by 5.5 m high with an arched back. It will be developed with a twinboom jumbo drilling 41 mm diameter blast holes and 102 mm relief holes. All jumbo holes will be drilled 4.24 m in length, which allows for an effective advance rate of 3.81 m per round (90% pull). The drill pattern provides for 66 charged blast holes and five uncharged relief holes. Drilling times were calculated based on average penetration rates of 1.8 m/min for loaded holes and 1.0 m/min for reamed holes. A 10% redrill factor was assumed.

Use of a bulk emulsion explosive was assumed at a powder factor of 1.03 kg/t. The blasting cycle time considered mobilization, charging and tying in of holes, clean-up, and demobilization.

Loading will be performed with a 6.2 m 3  (14 t) LHD that will transport blasted rock to remuck bays that are spaced 250 m apart. Load, maneuver and dump times were considered and a 95% bucket fill  factor  was  assumed.  The  time  associated  with  loading  haul  trucks  at  the  remuck  bays  was accounted for as an activity that is separate from the main ramp development.

During  the  pre-production  period,  development  waste  rock  that  is  placed  in  a  remuck  bay  will  be loaded into trucks, hauled to the shaft, and skipped to the surface. During the pre-production period, the  temporary skipping system will be able to handle rock that has not been crushed. During the production period, development waste will be placed in empty secondary stopes.

Ground support will be installed as specified in Table 16-14. Time allowances have been included for mobilization and setup, scaling, bolting/meshing/shotcreting as required, and demobilization.

Utility installation includes piping lines, ventilation tube, electrical cable, messenger cable, and leaky feeder. Piping, ventilation and electrical utilities will be installed at the end of every other round.

As shown in Table 16-15, the standard main ramp single heading development rate is 4.63 m/d.

Table 16-15: Main Ramp Average Development Rate

| Task                | Units      |   Value |

## Level Access Drifts (medium-term development openings)

The level access drifts will be 5 m wide by 5.5 m high with arched backs. They will be developed with a twin-boom jumbo drilling 41 mm diameter blast holes and 102 mm relief holes. All jumbo holes will be drilled 4.24 m in length, which allows for an effective advance rate of 3.81 m per round (90% pull). The drill pattern provides for 62 charged blast holes and five uncharged relief holes. Drilling times were calculated based on average penetration rates of 1.8 m/min for loaded holes and 1.0 m/min for reamed holes. A 10% redrill factor was assumed.

Use of a bulk emulsion explosive was assumed at a powder factor of 1.07 kg/t. The blasting cycle time includes mobilization, charging and tying in of holes, clean-up, and demobilization.

Loading will be performed with a 6.2 m 3  (14 t) LHD that will transport blasted rock to remuck bays that are spaced 250 m apart. Load, maneuver and dump times were considered and a 95% bucket fill  factor  was  assumed.  The  time  associated  with  loading  haul  trucks  at  the  remuck  bays  was accounted for as an activity that is separate from the main ramp development.

During  the  pre-production  period,  development  waste  rock  that  is  placed  in  a  remuck  bay  will  be loaded into trucks, hauled to the shaft, and skipped to the surface. During the pre-production period, the  temporary skipping system will be able to handle rock that has not been crushed. During the production period, development waste will be placed in empty secondary stopes. Ground support will be installed as specified in Table 16-14. Time allowances have been included for mobilization and setup, scaling, bolting/meshing/shotcreting as required, and demobilization.

Utility installation includes piping lines, ventilation tube, electrical cable, messenger cable, and leaky feeder. Piping, ventilation and electrical utilities will be installed at the end of every other round.

As shown in Table 16-16, the standard level access single heading development rate is 4.86 m/d.

## Slots- Stope Development

After top and bottom stope development drifts are established a slot will be developed at the far end of the stope. The slot consists of a conventionally blasted drop raise and 28 fan-drilled holes that will be slashed into the void that is created by the drop raise. Including the fan-drilled holes, the overall dimensions of the slot will be 15 m wide by 6 m long by 25 m high.

All blasthole drilling for the slot will be at a diameter of 114 mm (4.5 inches) using a down-the-hole (DTH) drill. A total of 50 holes will be required for the slot (22 holes for the drop raise and 28 holes for  slashing).  The  estimated  penetration  rate  for  the  DTH  drill  is  0.75  m/min  and  the  total  drilling requirement is 1,105 m (including 10% redrill).

The slot will be removed in a series of four blasts using a bulk emulsion product. The first two blasts will remove the bottom 14 m of the drop raise. The third blast will remove the remaining 6 m at the top of the drop raise along with 14 of the fan-drilled slash holes on one side of the drop raise. The fourth and final blast will remove the remaining fan-drilled slash holes on the opposite side of the drop raise. The overall powder factor for the slot will be 1.39 kg/t based on a slot tonnage of 4,162 t. The blasting cycle  time  includes  travel/set  up  time,  charging  and  tying  in  of  holes,  clean  up,  and demobilization.

Slot ore will be mucked with a 6.2 m 3  LHD that will transport blasted ore to remuck bays that will be located, on average, 150 m from the stope. Load, maneuver and dump times were considered and a 95% bucket fill factor was assumed. The time associated with loading haul trucks at the remuck bays was accounted for as an activity that is separate from slot development.

Ore that is placed in a remuck bay will be loaded into trucks and hauled to the grizzlies feeding the underground material handling system.

As shown in Table 16-19, the slot production rate is 881 t/d.

## Stoping

Stopes will be 25 m in height x 15 m in width and will have varying lengths. A tophammer longhole production drill will be used to fan drill the stope from the upper access drift. Blast holes will be 114 mm (4.5 inches) in diameter and the estimated drill penetration rate is 1.2 m/min. The total drilling requirement is 192.8 m per ring (including 10% redrill) and the ore blasted per ring is 3,246 t.

Stope blasting will be performed in a series of three-ring blasts, the number of which will be dictated by the length of the stope. Each three-ring blast will have a total of 39 charged holes (13 holes per ring). A bulk emulsion product will be used and the powder factor will be 0.55 kg/t. The estimated blasting cycle time includes travel/set up, charging and  tying in of holes, clean up, and demobilization.

Stope ore will be mucked with a 6.2 m 3  LHD that will transport blasted ore to remuck bays that will be located, on average, 135 m from the stope. Load, maneuver and dump times were considered and a 95% bucket fill factor was assumed. Ore that is placed in a remuck bay will be loaded into trucks and hauled  to  the  grizzlies  feeding  the  underground  material  handling  system;  however,  the  time associated with loading haul trucks is accounted for as a separate activity.

As shown in Table 16-20, the stope production rate is 2,352 t/d.

## Shaft Sinking

The 7.5 m shaft will be sunk conventionally, to a depth of 440 m, at an average rate of 2.23 m/d. This rate was developed in conjunction with contractors for the material expected to be encountered. The rate includes sinking, lining, and adjustments in rate due to rock types. Material will be removed by the temporary hoisting system and placed in the lined temporary stockpile location adjacent to the shaft.

## Raisebored Raises

The 5.5 m diameter lined ventilation exhaust raise will be raisebored. The raise will be approximately 390 m in depth. The raisebore average advance rate is 2.75 m/d. The rate includes drilling the pilot hole, and reaming the vent raise. Loading will be performed with a 6.2 m 3  LHD that will transport cuttings to a remuck bay that will be located 75 m from the bottom of the raise. Load, maneuver and dump times were considered and a 95% bucket fill factor was assumed. Raisebore cuttings that are placed  in  a  remuck  bay  will  be  loaded  into  trucks  and  hauled  and  skipped  to  the  surface  during preproduction.

The 2.0 m internal raise where the emergency escape hoist will be located will be raisebored by a contractor at an estimated advance rate of 5 m/d.

## Ventilation Connections between Levels with Escapeways - Drop Raises

The  raises  will  be  developed  using  conventional  drop  raising  to  establish  ventilation  connections between the levels. The ventilation raise dimension varies with required ventilation volume for that section of the mine.

Waste from the drop raises will be mucked with a 6.2 m 3 (14 t) LHD that will transport the blasted rock to remuck bays that will be located, on average, 100 m from the bottom of each raise. Load, maneuver and dump times were considered and a 95% bucket fill factor was assumed. The time associated  with  loading  haul  trucks  at  the  remuck  bays  was  accounted  for  as  an  activity  that  is separate from ventilation connection development.

During  the  pre-production  period,  development  waste  rock  that  is  placed  in  a  remuck  bay  will  be loaded into  trucks,  hauled  to  the  shaft,  and  skipped  to  the  surface.  During  the  production  period, development waste will be placed in empty secondary stopes.

In ventilation raises where a ladder escapeway is used, the installation time estimate is 45 days in addition to the time noted in the productivity tables for the ventilation raises. In this document, if the heading notes an escapeway is included the additional time and cost of the manway was included in the feasibility estimate and production schedule.

## 5.5 x 5.5 with Escapeway

A total of 22 holes will be required for the drop raise (16 charged blast holes and 6 uncharged relief holes). The estimated penetration rate for the DTH drill is 0.75 m per minute and the total drilling requirement is 496 m (including 10% redrill).

The drop raise will be removed in a series of three blasts using a bulk emulsion product. The first two blasts  will  remove  the  bottom  13  m  of  the  drop  raise.  The  third  and  final  blast  will  remove  the remaining 7.5 m at the top of the drop raise. The overall powder factor will be 2.21 kg/t based on a tonnage of 1,860 t. The blasting cycle time includes travel/set up time, charging and tying in of holes, clean up, and demobilization.

As shown in Table 16-21, the ventilation drop raise advance rate is 6.80 m/d.

## 16.6.2 Development and Production Schedule

The  production  and  development  schedule  was  completed  using  iGantt  software.  The  production schedule is based on the rate assumptions shown Table 16-11.

A delay of 28 days was used prior to driving on paste fill or mining adjacent to a paste filled stope. These delays account for curing time as well as multiple pours. A 45 day delay to install manways in ventilation raises was also assumed.

The mining operation schedule is based on 365 days/year, 7 days/week, with two 12 hour shifts each day.  A  production  rate  of  2,760 t/d  was  targeted  with  ramp-up  to  full  production  as  quickly  as possible.  The  schedule  timeframe  is  monthly  for  the  pre-production  period  and  for  two  years  or production, then quarterly for three years, and annually for the remainder of the mine life.

Shaft sinking activities begin in May, 2019 with mine development occurring from the end of 2019 through 2020. Stoping begins late in 2020, with a ramp up period through Q1 - 2021, after which the mine and plant are operating at full capacity.

Table 16-26 shows the annual mine production schedule.

## 16.7  Mining Operations

## 16.7.1 Stoping

Stopes will be mined using the longhole open stoping method. Individual stope blocks are designed to be 15 m wide, up to 30 m long, and will have a transverse orientation. Levels are spaced 25 m apart and each stope block will have a top and bottom access (4.5 m x 4.5 m flat back drifts).

Stopes will be drilled downward from the top access using 114 mm diameter holes (stope slots will be drilled with a DTH drill and stope production rings will be drilled with a tophammer drill). A bottom up,  primary/secondary extraction sequence will be followed. Primary stopes will be backfilled with

high  strength  paste  backfill  and  secondary  stopes  will  be  backfilled  with  RoM  waste  from  the underground operation and low strength paste backfill as needed when waste rock is not available.

Stope extraction will occur in two steps. During the first step, a slot will be mined at the far end the stope using a drop raise and 28 fan-drilled slash holes. The slot is required to create sufficient void space for the remainder of the stope to be blasted. During the second step, production rings will be blasted  three  rows  at  a  time  (13  blastholes  per  ring)  until  the  stope  is  completely  extracted.  The number of three-row blasts in a given stope will depend on the length of the stope. All blasting will be performed with bulk emulsion.

Ore will be remotely mucked from the bottom stope access using a 6.2 m 3  (14 t) LHD. The LHD will transport  the  ore  to  a  remuck  bay  to  maximize  the  efficiency  of  the  stope  mucking  operations.  A second LHD and a fleet of 40 t haul trucks will be used to transport ore from the remuck bays to the grizzly feeding the underground material handling system. Multiple remuck bays will be used on each level to avoid interference between the stope loader and the haul trucks.

## 16.7.2 Material Handling System

The underground material handling system is designed to size the rock, provide surge and storage capacity, and be an efficient, automated system for moving the rock from bin to loading pocket to surface via the hoisting plant.

During operations, ore will be brought to the dump point and fed via a rock-breaker protected grizzly into an infeed orepass that loads into the crusher station. A hydrostroke feeder will load a vibratory grizzly which will separate fine and coarse sections and feed the coarse (oversize) material into a jaw crusher. Undersize will be fed via chute to the main transfer conveyor and on to the ore bin.

The  jaw  crusher  will  feed  the  sized  material  via  the  same  conveyor  to  the  ore  bin  which  has  a capacity of 2,500 t, representing approximately one day's production through the mill.

Waste is fed directly, during the pre-production period only, from the dump point into the waste bin, which  also  has  a  2,500 t  capacity,  or  approximately  two  days  waste  requirement  at  maximum development needs. During production, ore will also be fed into the second 2,500 t bin as all waste will be disposed of underground. The two bins will provide slightly less than 2 days processing plant production.

The  bins  are  designed  at  10  m  diameter  from  top  to  bottom,  for  both  ease  of  construction  and maintenance. The bin bottom will be a structural steel platform that can be removed for maintenance in major outages.

The  rock  from  the  loading  pocket  (LP)  conveyor  loads  a  two-flask  loading  pocket,  which  is weightometer measured and controlled via a PLC/PC interface. Control monitoring around the facility will use CCTV cameras located at strategic points, with load sensors, bearing and motor monitors, etc.  Rock breakers will be remotely operated by the hoist operators via joystick and camera. The entire system will be monitored by the hoisting personnel.

Loaded skips will be hoisted to the surface and dumped into a chute with a flop gate that will direct the rock to either a rock bunker (to be placed on the temporary rock storage area) or to a surge bin. The surge bin  has  an  apron  feeder  that  feeds  a  conveyor  to  the  crushed  ore  storage  bin,  which subsequently moves via another feeder onto the conveyor to the mill.

Material in the rock bunker will be transported by loader (or loader and truck) to the temporary lined rock storage area.

## 16.7.3 Development

Lateral development includes interlevel ramps, level accesses, stope accesses, and short connecting drifts for ventilation. The interlevel ramp system will be a (5.5 m wide by 5.5 m high with an arched back) at a maximum 14% gradient. Level accesses will be 5.0 m wide by 5.5 m high with an arched back and will be mined higher at the remuck bays to allow the haul trucks to be loaded by the LHD. Stope access drifts will be flat back 4.5 m wide by 4.5 m high. The short connecting drifts for escapeways will be 3.5 m wide by 3.5 m high with a flat back.

Interlevel ramps and levels accesses will be located in the footwall and have been designed to avoid crossing fault zones to the maximum extent possible. Stope accesses are oriented perpendicular to the strike of the orebody.

The  lateral  development  is  sized  for  the  operation  of  the  mining  equipment  fleet  that  has  been selected for the operation. The development profiles include allowances for ventilation ducting and services.

Conventional  drop  raising  will  be  used  to  establish  ventilation  connections  between  level  access drifts.

## Truck Haulage

The mine plan assumes that 6.2 m 3  (14 t) LHDs will load 40 t haul trucks from remuck bays that will be strategically located throughout the development workings. Ore and waste haulage distances and cycle times were calculated using the haulage profile module in Vulcan and are based on estimated underground truck speeds as shown in Table 16-27. The outputs from the Vulcan haulage profile module are a one-way haulage distance and an average truck cycle time (round trip).

Table 16-27: Truck Hauling Speeds

|        | Road Grade  (%)   |   Speed  (1) (km/hr) |

- (1) Uphill and downhill assumed speeds the same.

The  ore  haulage  distances  were  evaluated  from  the  mine  production  schedule.  Based  on  this evaluation, ore haulage pathways were created to approximate the location of ore development and

stope mining in each time period. Vulcan haulage profile was then used to generate a one-way ore haulage  distance  and  an  average  cycle  time  (round  trip)  using  the  speed  parameters  shown  in Table 16-27.

The  availability  of  mined-out  secondary  stopes  was  evaluated  to  determine  the  quantity  of  low strength  paste  backfill  that  will  be  placed  underground  during  each  time  period.  Based  on  this evaluation, waste haulage pathways were created to approximate the location of development waste mining  and  waste  rock  dumping  for  each  time  period.  Vulcan  haulage  profile  was  then  used  to generate a one-way waste haulage distance and an average cycle time (round trip) using the speed parameters shown in Table 16-27.

The average one-way ore haulage distances are approximately 900 m early in the mine life through 2027, and increase to approximately 1,700 m from 2028-2035, and to 2,600 m for the remainder of the Project life. The LoM average is 1,971. Waste haulage distances vary considerably depending on the time period. At the peak, eight haul trucks are required to transport the ore and waste. Figure 16-26 and Figure 16-27 show the haulage distance and cycle time by period. SRK notes the cycle times reflected in this summary are indicative as there is a fixed component including the loading time, dumping time, positioning time, and additional delays that are included in the productivity and equipment quantity determinations and not included in the information summarized in these figures.

During the pre-production period, prior to mining of stopes and the commissioning of the plant, waste and  mineralized  material  will  be  hoisted  to  surface  and  stored  separately  in  a  designated  lined storage facility. During the pre-production period (prior to 2021), the mine will produce approximately 473  kt  of  waste  and  134  kt  of  mineralized  material.  The  mineralized  material  will  be  fed  into  the processing plant during commissioning.

## 16.7.4 Backfilling

The mine production sequence includes the use of cemented paste backfill to fill the voids left by the stopes to maintain the mine structural integrity. As discussed in Section 16.3.2, the mine utilizes a high strength backfill paste that has a 5% cement content in the primary stopes. A lower strength paste with 2% cement is used to supplement waste rock, whenever waste rock is not available, to backfill  the  secondary  stopes.  Section 18.12 discusses the surface plant and system to move the pastefill underground to the stopes. A backfill operations crew installs barricades in the lower access drift  to  the  stopes, extends the pipe delivery system in the upper access drift into the stopes, and monitors the backfill as the stope fills. Once the stope is filled the backfill is allowed to cure (28 days) to design strength of over 1 MPa prior to blasting on the adjoining stope.

The LoM backfill breakdown by volume and type is shown in Table 16-28.

Table 16-28: Backfill Volume Summary - By Type

| Backfill Type                                            | Volume  (m 3 )   |
|----------------------------------------------------------|------------------|
| Total Backfill                                           | 10,054,817       |
| Low Strength Backfill (Waste rock or 2% Cement Pastefill | 2,726,427        |
| High Strength Backfill (5% Cement Pastefill)             | 7,328,390        |

## 16.7.5 Ground Support

The  current  knowledge  of  the  geotechnical  characteristics  indicate  that  ground  support  will  be required  in  the  ramps  and  primary  access  drifts  as  well  as  the  shaft  and  shop  areas.  The  stope access drifts will require minimum ground support except at brows of the stopes. The ground support plan  includes  use  of  grouted  rebar  and  split  set  style  bolts  as  a  standard.  The  bolting  will  be supplemented with wire mesh, shotcrete, and additional support where required. The plan includes allowances for areas of full shotcrete, but it is not expected to be required in normal operations, just in  areas  encountering faulted or challenging ground conditions. A bolter will be utilized as normal practice and shotcrete equipment are included in the estimate. Additionally, a cable bolter has been included in the equipment fleet to allow for cable bolting if necessary in intersections and at the stope brows. The geotechnical information currently does not indicate this is required, however the cable bolter can also be used to provide additional ground support capacity if needed.

Table 16-14 in Section 16.6.1 shows a simplified operational ground support plan.

## 16.7.6 Grade Control

As part of the routine mining sequence, NioCorp will be infill drilling and will execute a grade control program to monitor the mining production. The infill drilling will be conducted from established drilling stations on each level, with underground diamond drilling using NQ core diameter drilled across the width of the known mineralization. Drilling will be logged for basic parameters and sampled using the current established protocols by NioCorp. SRK envisions up to three holes in a fan pattern can be drilled from each station to gain knowledge for levels above and below as required.

The aim of the grade control program is to deliver the most economic tonnes to the mill via accurate definition of 'ore' and waste. The basis of a successful program in an underground environment will be  completed  via  detailed  geological  mapping  and  grade  sampling  ahead  of  the  mining.  Grade control strategy is related to mining method and orebody type. For underground operations sampling methods include chip, channel and panel samples, grab/muck pile samples, and drill-based samples.

The aim of the program will be to identify variations in dip, strike and width, impact on local scale from  faulting  effects,  and  grade  continuity/  type.  Variations  in  geometry  at  the  edge  of  the mineralization will require geological understanding to ensure optimum grade, minimal dilution and maximum mining recovery.

The current proposed mining methods involve development cross-cuts at regular intervals across the width of the mineralization at the top and bottom of a stope prior to mining. Samples should be taken across the full width of the exposed mineralization with sufficient volume to ensure accurate assay.

The aim of the sampling should be to achieve a sample weight the equivalent of at minimum half NQ core for the sampling interval. The samples should be logged geologically marking the width of the mineralization and any hanging wall or footwall mineralization. The samples should be processed at an onsite facility to enable quick turnaround.

Additionally, blasted material will be available for grab sampling to test grades, which should then be input to a production database and be used to confirm head-grades and for reconciliation purposes. Note  that  grab  sampling  can  result  in  selection  bias  if  not  conducted  following  a  routine  defined protocol.

The mine geologist will perform daily mapping, as well as define the ore/waste contact for the mining teams. The mapping should be incorporated into a digital format to further improve the geological model and enable the development of short term estimation.

SRK recommends that NioCorp create a series of protocols to cover all grade control tasks from mapping to sampling and integration with the database. On-going quality assurance/quality control monitoring and review will allow protocols and staff to be updated as required.

## 16.8  Ventilation

Ventilation modeling work was completed based on the mine design/production schedule described in Sections 16.3 and 16.6. The intake shaft is 7.5 m diameter finished and the exhaust raise (return shaft) is 5.5 m diameter.

## 16.8.1 Airflow Requirements

The  airflow  requirements  were  based  on  vehicle  motor  power  (kW).  A  factor  of  0.08 m /s/kW  of 3 engine  power  was  used  to  ensure  safe  working  conditions  in  areas  with  diesel  equipment.  An additional  65 m 3 /s  of  airflow  is  required  to  provide  shops,  crusher,  and  shaft  bottom  areas  with perceptible movement of air. Minimum airflow requirements were estimated by block based on the equipment list. The minimum airflow required is 420 m 3 /s for block 3, at full production. Additional airflow will be needed to account for leakage and maintain perceptible movement of air in working areas.

Air  velocity  limitations  vary  according  to  airway  type.  In  areas  such  as  return  airways  and  shafts where personnel are not expected to work, higher velocities are acceptable. Typical airflow velocities for various airway types are shown in Table 16-29. The minimum recommended air velocity for an area with workers in a drift is 0.3 m/s, to provide perceptible movement.

Table 16-29: Recommended Airflow Velocities (m/s)

| Airway Type                                    |   Air Velocity   Maximum (m/s) |

## 16.8.2 Ventilation Controls

## Fixed Facilities Controls

The  suggested  controls  for  the  shaft  bottom  area  are  shown  in  Figure  16-28.  Air  from  the  fixed facilities flows directly to the return (so that in the event of a fire fumes can be exhausted from the mine and not contaminate the mine workings). Potentially contaminated air from vehicles, shops and fuel  bays also exhausts directly from the mine Fire doors are included in any fuel bay or shop to prevent the spread of fumes in the event of a fire. Interlocked equipment doors are used to isolate the shaft to prevent dusty air from the shaft area to enter the mine. The connection from the shaft area to the ramp system will need air locking vehicle doors to regulate the airflow allowed into the ramp system.

## Level Ventilation Controls

Air enters the level from the intake raise system and is regulated onto the level. Airflows across the level and portions of the air are picked up and used in each production stope via auxiliary ventilation. The air from the stope exhausts back to the main level. A small portion of air also flows in from the ramp. This system allows mining on other levels in the mine while blast fumes may still be present on the most recently blasted level. The air is then regulated into the return raise system. Air into the escape raises may need to be regulated to prevent excessive air velocities.

Temporary  bulkheads  need  to  be  constructed  when  stopes  are  open  between  levels  to  maintain control of the ventilation system. These temporary bulkheads can be a simple curtain type bulkhead made from brattice material.

When mining of the level is completed the regulators will be bulkheaded off, removing the level from the ventilation circuit.

## 16.8.3 Ventilation Model

Ventsim  Visual  was  used  to  generate  the  ventilation  model  using  resistance  factors  from  similar operations. Air from the surface is forced into the intake plenum at the top of the service shaft. When temperatures are below 4°C the intake air will be heated. The LoM ventilation plan is to supply all of the mine air through the production shaft. A portion of this air is used to supply air to the shaft bottom area to the shops, crusher dumps, crusher, and belt transfers. This air is then transferred directly to the exhaust shaft. Air is also supplied to the ramp to control the direction of airflow on the levels. The majority of air exits the shaft via a ventilation transfer drift and into the intake raise system. Fresh air is then fed to the working levels. Additional air is supplied to each level from the ramp. On the level, the air is distributed to the production faces using auxiliary fans. At the end of each level, the air is exhausted via the return raise system. This return raise system is driven by main return fans on the ventilation  transfer  level  where  the  air  is  exhausted  out  of  the  mine  via  the  return  shaft.  Staged ventilation models were generated for each block of mining.

## Staged Modeling Fan Results - Main Underground Fans

Main  underground  fan  duties  for  each  of  the  ventilation  blocks  are  shown  in  Table  16-30.  This information is used to the size fans and determines power requirements to ventilate the mine. The installed powers were calculated with an assumed fan efficiency of 70% and the required air power. The assumed air density at the fans is 1.18 kg/m 3 .

The operating  pressures  supplied  should  be  considered  applied  pressures,  that  is,  the  pressures reported do not account for losses associated with fan housings, ducts, plenums, or diffusers/evasès.

## Staged Modeling Fan Results - Surface Heating Fans

Low pressure high-quantity fan(s) will be needed on surface for the air heaters. These fans produce just  enough pressure to overcome the losses from the heater, fan, and plenum so that there is a slight positive pressure on the headframe. The total flow through the fans is shown in Table 16-31. The  total  airflow  through  the  heater  fans  will  be  slightly  greater  than  the  underground  mine  fans because  additional  air  will  be  used  to  slightly  upcast  air  in  the  main  intake  shaft  to  put  positive pressure on the head frame.

## 16.8.4 Climatic Modeling

A  climatic  study  was  completed  to  estimate  temperatures  throughout  the  mine  to  ensure  safe working conditions. A wet bulb temperature of 28.0°C was used as the design limit for acclimated workers in areas where personnel will be active. Using the provided weather data from the Project site,  the  barometric  pressure,  relative  humidity,  and  wet  bulb  temperature  at  the  75 th percentile highest dry bulb temperature was determined from weather data. This information was used as the surface  psychrometric  data  for  climatic  modeling.  The  weather  conditions  used  in  the  study  are displayed in Table 16-32.

Table 16-32: Data Determined at the 75 th  Percentile Highest Dry Bulb Temperature

|   Dry Bulb Temperature  (°C) |   Wet Bulb Temperature  (°C) |   Relative Humidity  (%) |   Barometric Pressure  (kPa) |

The  CLIMSIM  program  requires  certain  thermal  properties  for  the  surrounding  rock  mass  to  be established.  A  value  of  32.3  ºC  was  used  as  a  basic  rock  temperature  based  on  drillhole measurements.

The results show that the while temperatures are anticipated to be warm in the mine, the wet bulb temperature is not expected to exceed the practical design limit of 28ºC in the main ventilation areas, however in lower velocity areas ventilated using auxiliary ventilation more airflow may be needed. A single loader in a heading has a minimum airflow requirement of 19.4 m 3 /s of airflow resulting in a velocity too low in the drift to carry heat away fast enough to meet the design limit. Approximately 20% more air  is  necessary  for  head  dissipation  beyond  that  required  for  diesel  exhaust  dilution. Therefore, the minimum airflow in an auxiliary ventilated drift is 23.3 m /s. 3

## 16.8.5 Auxiliary Ventilation

A production heading is assumed to only have one 243 kW LHD requiring 23.3 m³/s (includes 20% more than the minimum for reduction of heat) at a duct length of 75 and 200 m. A second system was specified for general development with one 243 kW LHD and a 405 kW haul truck requiring 51.8 m³/s  of  airflow  at  a  length  of  200  m  and  400  m  These  lengths  are  some  of  the  representative distances for dead end headings to be ventilated with auxiliary ducting. The fan results for typical ventilation headings are shown in Table 16-33 and long development headings in Table 16-34.

## 16.8.6 Recommended Ventilation Infrastructure

## Sensors

Several different types of sensors are recommended to be installed at the mine. These sensors can help predict wear on the fans, alarm in the event of a fire and can tie into the ventilation modeling software.  Listed  in  this  section  are  some  of  the  recommended  sensors  for  the  mine.  Bundled  air quality and quantity sensors are recommended for each fan installation, intake shaft, fixed facilities and each working level. These include fan monitoring, air  quality,  air  quantity,  and  psychrometric sensors.

## Regulators

Drop board regulators consist of large wooden or steel boards which are slotted from the ground up. More boards in place result in a smaller air opening and consequent generation of a higher airway resistance.  This  can  also  form  the  frame  for  a  bulkhead.  Drop  board  type  of  regulators  are recommended to be placed at the intake and exhaust of each level.

Slide  regulators  are  typically  a  piece  of  steel  on  a  slider  that  can  be  adjusted  manually  to increase/decrease the area of an opening in a door or a regulator. These types of regulators are recommended for use where equipment doors require a regulator.

## Bulkheads

For  the  purposes  of  this  study  shotcrete  bulkheads  were  assumed  to  be  constructed.  These bulkheads should have steel man doors placed in them for the purposes of escape and inspection of the raises.

Upper sill levels of a stope may require temporary bulkheads in relatively low pressure situations. These bulkheads can be constructed with fabric or flexible material.

## Equipment Doors

Equipment doors allow passage of personnel, vehicles and materials and prevent air pulsing and short circuiting of air. Air locking doors will be near the main fan installations and shaft bottom area.

## Equipment Doors

Equipment doors allow passage of personnel, vehicles and materials and prevent air pulsing and short circuiting of air. Air locking doors will be near the main fan installations and in to the ventilation drive.

## Air Heaters

Bulk air heaters are required at the surface intake shaft. Low pressure high-quantity fans will also be needed for the air heaters. These fans produce just enough pressure to overcome the losses from the heater, fan, and plenum so that there is a slight positive pressure on the headframe.

## 16.8.7 Ventilation Power Consumption

Based on the fan operating points the total motor power is estimated as shown in Table 16-35. The results only include the power consumption of the main fans and auxiliary fans. The main fans are assumed to be run continuously while auxiliary fans would be turned off in headings when there is no equipment or personnel in the area.

Table 16-35: Total Motor Power Consumption by Block

## 16.8.8 Air Heating

If the outside air temperature drops below 0°C ice can build up along the walls intake airways and shafts and on the fittings of utilities, causing increased resistance to airflow and posing a hazard to personnel and equipment working in or around the intake. Repetitive freeze-thaw cycles can result in severe damage to the integrity of the ground support in airways and shafts.

Based on the weather data shown in Table 16-36, heating is required for five months out of the year.

Table 16-36: Surface Temperatures near the Elk Creek Mine

A heater size of 17.2 MW is required assuming a maximum ventilation scenario with 483 m 3 /s of air to be heated from -23°C to +4°C. Natural gas will be the fuel for the heaters. The combustion of the gas  produces  small  amounts  of  carbon  dioxide,  water  vapor,  and,  in  poorly  maintained  heaters, carbon monoxide. The possibility of creating carbon monoxide means that a gas monitor should be installed downstream of the heater with an alarm and automatic fuel cut-off. A temperature sensor should  also  be  placed  at  an  appropriate  distance  downstream  of  the  heater  to  obtain  accurate readings in fully mixed air.

The total heating required per year for each mining block is shown in Table 16-37. The calculation used the average low temperature per month and summed the results for the entire year.

## 16.9  Mine Infrastructure &amp; Services

## 16.9.1 Mine Dewatering-Shaft and Underground

Mine  dewatering  at  the  Elk  Creek  Mine  will  handle  groundwater  inflows  from  the  shaft  and  mine workings, along with inflows from drill and other operating equipment. Total inflows are estimated to be  approximately  32  L/s  (500  USGPM),  which  includes  service  water.  To  accommodate  for uncertainty in the water model, the design capacity of the Elk Creek Mine underground dewatering system is based on a maximum total flow rate of 63 L/s (1,000 USGPM).

Dewatering at the working face will be handled by submersible pumps which will transfer mine water to the nearest dewatering sump adjacent to the main ramp. The dewatering sumps will be spaced at 80 m  intervals  and  transfer  water  through  HDPE  piping  to  the  400  Level  settling  sump  near  the loading pocket at the shaft. Submersible pumps located in the shaft bottom will handle groundwater inflow from the shaft. The shaft bottom pumps will transfer water to the 400 Level settling sump.

The 400 Level settling sump will be 7.5 m in diameter and 10 m in height with a cone bottom for a working volume of 450 m 3 . The cone bottom will integrate a flush water port to be utilized to assist draining of settled solids to a bin on the 420 Level. A pump station on the 420 Level adjacent to the shaft  will  house  two  centrifugal  pumps,  with  one  operating  and  one  back-up.  The  pumps  receive water from the 420 Level sump which overflows from the 400 Level settling sump through a mesh strainer sized for 1 inch maximum particle size. The pump station on the 400 Level transfers mine water up the shaft to the pump station on the 320 Level. The shaft will house two 6 inch diameter 316LSS schedule 40 pipe columns. Each pump station at the shaft will include a cross-over valve design  to  allow  for  the  standby  and  operating  pumps  to  utilize  either  pipe  column.  The  420  level pumping  system  will  deliver  the  water  up  the  shaft  to  a  surface  pipeline  that  will  feed  the  active dewatering gather pipeline system and then be routed through that system to the active dewatering pond.

The  320  Level  pump  station  will  feature  an  agitated  storage  tank  of  35  m   to  maintain  fines  in 3 suspension.  The  pumps  on  the  320  Level  will  require  two  centrifugal  pumps  in  series  to  transfer water to the 200 Level station. The first pump will be fixed speed and second pump will be furnished with a variable speed drive to reduce flow as demand requires. The 320 Level pump station transfers water up the shaft pipe columns to the 200 Level station, where the pumping strategy will be similar with centrifugal pumps in series. The 200 Level station pumps will discharge water up the shaft pipe columns to the shaft collar, where the piping will transition to 8 inch HDPE routed in a surface trench for approximately 850 m to the holding pond.

## 16.9.2 Compressed Air System

Compressed air will be supplied to the surface mining structures (headframe and hoist house) via twin compressors located within the hoist house. Each compressor will be rated for 0.94 standard m 3 /s  (2,000  cfm)  at  862  kPa  (125  psig),  which  will  ensure  that  the  compressed  air  delivered underground remains above 690 kPa (100 psig). An ASME Section VIII air receiver located within the  hoist  house  will  also  ensure  that  the  compressors  are  not  required  to  cycle  on  and  off excessively.  Surface  branch  connections  will  include  the  hoist  house  and  head  frame  where  a requirement for air driven hand tools exists.

An 8.0 inch nominal (200 mm) carbon steel pipe will deliver the compressed air from the hoist house to the head frame via an underground services trench. This pipeline will then proceed to the shaft, where  it  will  form  part  of  the  services  hung  from  the  shaft  liner,  down  to  the  crusher  level, conveyance level and loading pocket. Each level will have an individual line branched from the shaft line, that will service the level. No additional underground storage will be required, as all main lines serving the levels will be large enough to accommodate the usage.

## 16.9.3 Underground Water Supply

## Process

Industrial or process water supply for drilling and dust control will be supplied via a 4.0 inch nominal (100 mm) carbon steel line within the shaft. Individual branch connections will report to each level that  requires  process water,  including  those  that  require  water  for  dust  suppression.  As  the  static pressure  increases  the  deeper  the  line  extends  (to  the  lower  shaft  stations),  pressure  reducing stations are required.

Pressure  reducing  stations  located  approximately  half  way  down  the  shaft,  as  well  as  the  upper dump (25 m level) lower dump (0 m level), and at the crusher station and loading pocket. Typically, a 4.0 inch diameter (100 mm) Ford figure #12 Pressure Reducing Valve (PRV) with either flanged or grooved ends, will  be  employed  at  each  station.  Ford  figure  #12  PRVs  is  used  to  reduce  supply pressures from a maximum of 2758 kPa (400 psig) to the desired discharge service pressure. The stations will be located as close as possible to the shaft.

## Potable

Potable water, much like process water is fed to the underground via a 2.0 inch diameter (50 mm) nominal shaft pipeline and pressure reducing stations. Potable water can be supplied to the main working level (-45 m level).

## 16.9.4 Underground Fuel Storage and Distribution

Fuel from the surface storage facility will be delivered to the underground storage system via a 2 inch fuel pipe in the shaft. The fuel line will run from the surface, down to the -45 level where the line will be routed to a storage area at a fuel bay for fueling vehicles. The fuel pipe feeds fuel to either of two 3,785 L (1,000 US gallons) storage and distribution systems, located within a cut out on the south of fuel bay, via a motorized three way valve.

Each storage and distribution station will be a bladder type, with up to 150% containment, complete with the following safety functions: 4 hr rated UL approved roll up door, thermal activated fuel shut off valve to dispensing system, anti-syphon valve, and a dry chemical automatic fire suppression system with detection and actuation. Each station will be individually alarmed, by means of a PLC with level alarms, and a level switch.

Additionally, fusible link fire doors are also included in the underground layout, these twin fire doors, upon actuation will isolate the fueling area from the main shops.

## 16.9.5 Workshop, Maintenance Bays, and Warehouse

The maintenance area consists of three large bays, each 30 m long by 7.5 m wide to accommodate vehicular traffic. A service trench runs the length of each bay to allow access to the undercarriage of

the vehicles. Each service trench will be 2.1 m deep to allow headroom for persons walking within the trench. One wash bay is also included in the workshop layout. A drainage trench with covering grating will run the length of the bay to carry water to a nearby oil capture sump. Grading of the area will help reduce the possibility of oil contamination. Each maintenance bay will also come equipped with an overhead crane to help facilitate the maintenance work on vehicles.

Warehouse and tool cribs are also included within walking distance of the maintenance bays.

Three rollup doors will separate the two maintenance bays from the rest of the mine. An office will be located at the end of a drift located in the maintenance area. The workshop, maintenance bays, and warehouse layout is shown in Figure 16-30.

## 16.9.6 Explosives Storage

Underground powder and primer magazines are included in the mine design. The mine explosives will  be  stored  off  site  at  a  vendor  location  and  deliveries  will  be  on  as  needed  basis  with  the underground  magazines  providing  the  capacity  required  for  production  needs.  Explosives  pricing includes the contractor storage and supply totes have been included in the capital estimate per the manufacturer's recommendation.

## 16.9.7 Refuge Stations

Mobile refuge chambers have been included in the design. Each refuge chamber will be sufficiently equipped to house 12 or more persons, depending on location and unit size, for up to 36 hours. The stations are self-sufficient in that they include seating, a chemical toilet, emergency food and water, back-up  power,  lighting,  and  communications  via  external  antenna  and  12V  power  supply.  The breathable  air  system  that  is  incorporated  within  the  refuge  chambers  includes:  a  standard compressed air line tie in, oxygen cylinders connection, as well as an oxygen candle.

Each chamber can be located at the most strategic location as dictated by the mining operation and underground workings. The chambers are easily transported by fork lifts.

## 16.9.8 Hoist House Substation Electrical Distribution

Electrical power will be supplied to the hoist house substation via a 44 kV overhead line from the main  substation.  Power  will  be  stepped  down  to  13.8  kV  by  two  redundant  30  MVA  resistively grounded  transformers.  The  transformers  will  be  kirk-key  interlocked  to  allow  only  one  of  the transformers to be in operation at any given time.

The E-House in the hoist house substation will distribute the 13.8 kV to the hoist drive transformers, shaft feeders (2 x 3C 4/0 AWG), active dewatering well pumping overhead line, and the hoist house electrical room for supplying the 4160 V unit substation and the 480 V unit substation. Connected to the 13.8 kV bus will be an emergency generator, with an attached automatic regenerative load bank, which  will  supply  power  to  all  critical  loads  to  mine  infrastructure  in  the  event  of  a  utility  power outage.

Critical loads will include the auxiliary hoist, auxiliary hoist MCC, compressor #1, downcast fan #1, and the underground mine feeder #1. The Underground Feeder #1 will have critical pumping loads connected to it for dewatering the mine.

The 4160 V bus will distribute and supply power to temporary shaft sinking services, downcast fan #2, and compressor #2.

The 480 V Unit Substation will supply power to all the 480 V motor control centers which will supply power to all other electrical loads in the hoist house, headframe/collar house, hoist house substation and downcast fan heater building. The hoist house MCC will service 480 V loads, ventilation, lighting and low voltage services for the hoist house. The production hoist MCC will supply all loads to all ancillary equipment for the operation of the production hoist. The headframe/collar house MCC will be located in the collar house and will service all 480 V loads in the headframe/collar house including ventilation, lighting loads, and skip handling equipment.

## 16.9.9 Surface Mine Dewatering Electrical Distribution

During the early stage of the mine site development, no utility power is available. Hence, power will need to be generated for construction and mine dewatering. A 15 MW diesel generator farm will be temporarily  constructed  adjacent  to  the  hoist  house  substation  to  facilitate  power  generation  at 13.8 kV. The generator farm will consist of approximately five 3 MW prime generators with a fuel farm and a switchgear building.

A 13.8 kV overhead pole line will be constructed to distribute power to the eight VFD sea-cans for the  mine  dewatering  pumps.  The  pole  line  will  start  from  the  generation  farm  and  run  west.  The westward line will reach out to the water treatment package plant and tee at this point. A short line will run north to service the water treatment package plant and the other branch will head southwest and loop around to pick up the remaining well pumping locations. Near the end of the line, it will branch again. One branch will head west for two pole spans to reach a well station, and the other will span four poles north to service the remaining well stations.

At each of the well pumping locations a riser cable will tap the 13.8 kV line and feed 2 MVA 13.8 kV4160 V transformer that will feed power to a sea-can which will house two 900 HP VFD drives. Each of the drives will then feed a 4160 V, 900 HP well-pump.

After the hoist house substation becomes energized the 13.8 kV overhead line will be connected to the hoist house substation and the generation farm may be taken out of service.

## 16.9.10 Electrical

Two  13.8  kV  shaft  feeders  will  supply  power  underground.  The  cables  will  originate  in  the  hoist house substation, traverse through the hoist house, to the headframe. The cables will then be hung vertically in the shaft with both cables turning into selected levels to distribute power. The cable will be terminated in 15 kV rated junction boxes to provide connection points to the levels required.

At each supplied level, there will be a dual load break switch in order to select which feeder is used to supply power to the level. The cables will turn into the levels and a dual load break switch and 15 kV  junction  box  will  be  used  to  provide  a  junction  point  to  supply  the  necessary  equipment  and provide a point for expansion.

## 16.9.11 Emergency Escape Hoist

An emergency escape hoist is included as a secondary means of egress for the underground mine. This stand-alone hoist will be located at the collar of the 5.5 m diameter exhaust raise. The hoist unit and  boom  are  mounted  on  a  single  pedestal  type  base  that  allows  the  operator  to  rotate  the complete assembly to swing the cage away from the shaft and park it on the ground. The hoist is designed and manufactured in accordance with MSHA requirements.

The hoist is powered by a diesel engine which powers a simple open loop hydrostatic drive system. The hoist typically features two independent automatic braking systems and a simplex controller for over travel and over speed protection. The long structural boom with integral head sheave all form part of the standard arrangement.

Included  with  the  hoist,  and  rope  is  one  cage  assembly.  The  cage  assembly  is  a  completely enclosed  unit  with  dimensions  of  1.2  m  outside  diameter  by  2.4  m  in  height,  and  comes  with  an access door and draw bar ready for rope attachment.

A second emergency hoist is installed in a borehole between levels in the later years of the mine life to provide emergency egress from the lower levels of the mine.

## 16.9.12 Hoist House

Ventilation systems for the hoist house will be broken down into three systems:

- · Main hoist area ventilation;
- · MCC room heating, ventilation and air conditioning; and
- · Control room, lunch and electrical room HVAC.

The main hoist area will be ventilated by means of wall mounted intake fans, and exhaust louvres. Each fan will be operated by thermostat, and will start when a high temperature set point is reached. Each fan will also have a manual mode. Each hoist motor will have a local ventilation system, which will draw room air for motor cooling and will expel the heated air back into the room. Similarly, the compressor  room  will  draw  air  from  the  main  area  in  the  summer,  while  during  winter,  the compressor will be supplied air from the building exterior. Heated cooling air will be exhausted into the main building area.

The MCC room will have a dedicated air handling unit (AHU) which will draw air from the MCC room and cool it (mechanically) before returning it to the source. Additionally, make up air (10%) will be supplied to the MCC room via the AHU unit and the building exterior. The AHU will be appropriately sized to accommodate the heat generated by the electrical equipment.

The control room, lunch room, and electrical/PLC room will be supplied cool air via a separate AHU. Make up air (10%) will be drawn from the building exterior.

Additional local wall mounted heaters will be supplied throughout the building and rooms. Each of the heating units will have dedicated thermostat and will fire natural gas.

## 16.9.13 Dust Suppression System

A multi zoned underground dust suppression system will aid in reducing the amount of air born dust created by the ore/waste handling systems. Each ore/waste transfer point within the underground material handling system will have a set of air/water nozzles fed from both the compressed air and process  water  systems.  The  compressed  air  and  process  water  are  piped  to  a  regulating  station cabinet where the fluids are cleaned (filter and strainer) and pressure regulated. From the cabinet, the  individual  cleaned  and  regulated  process  water  and  compressed  air  are  fed  to  a  set  of strategically placed nozzles which combine the streams and produce a light mist which is enough to drive  air  born  dust  down.  Regulating  stations  will  be  located  at  truck  dump  sites  (2x),  the  hydro stroke in feed area, the crusher station, the transfer area downstream of the crusher, bin conveyor feed area, bin discharge areas, and the flask infeed area.

## 16.9.14 Communications System

The  mine  will  be  equipped  with  a  leaky  feeder  system  that  will  allow  internet,  phone,  and  radio communications underground. The mine will have standard underground call phones with intercom. A control system will allow remote operation of the rock breaker and CCTV system to monitor dump points, crusher, and key material handling locations.

## 16.9.15 Health and Safety

The mine design incorporates MSHA safety standards and includes an emergency hoist in the return air  raise  and  a  secondary  light  duty  hoist  in  the  main  shaft.  Both  hoists  are  connected  to  backup power  generation.  Additionally,  two  12-person  mobile  refuge  chambers  are  included,  and  will  be located in active working areas over the LoM.

The mine will have a communications system that has both mine phones  and wireless communication through a leaky feeder system. A mine rescue team will support the operation. The mine safety program will integrate with local providers in case of any mine emergency. A stench gas emergency warning system will be installed in the mine's intake ventilation system. This system can be  activated  to  warn  underground  employees  of  a  fire  situation  or  other  emergency  whereupon emergency  procedures  will  be  followed.  The  shop  areas  and  underground  fueling  station  will  be equipped with automatic closure doors that will operate in case of fire.

## 16.9.16 Manpower

Manpower  levels  are  estimated  based  on  the  production  schedule  and  equipment  needs.  The productivities used reflect a mix of local and skilled labor with an experienced management team.

The estimate is based on owner mining using an operating schedule consisting of 12 hours per shift, two shifts per day, and seven days per week. The 12 hour shift is supported by a four crew rotation. The management and technical team are planned to work five 8 hour days per week.

Table  16-38  shows  the  required  workforce  at  the  maximum  staffing  level.  The  staff  will  have  55 people on rotating shift and 19 people day shift. Of the 55 rotating personnel, approximately 3 would be  working  on  the  surface.  The  workforce  will  increase  over  time  through  the  addition  of  staff  to operate  additional  equipment.  The  total  number  of  personnel  ranges  from  13  in  2019  to  the maximum of 231 in 2029.

## 16.9.17 Equipment

The underground equipment used, shown in Table 16-39, is typical for a sublevel stoping mining method with  the  number  of  pieces  of  equipment  calculated  from  the  production  rates  and  typical availabilities for underground mines.

The estimate uses an equipment availability of 85%, a job efficiency factor of 83% (50 minute hour), and  an  activity  efficiency  factor  that  varies  by  activity  (85%  to  100%).  Each  shift  of  12  hours  is reduced by 2.25 hours to represent shift change, breaks, lunch, fuel/grease/inspect time, and travel to and from working areas. This provides an equivalent working day of 19.5 hours or 9.75 h hours per shift. The resulting reductions result in 5,931 effective hours per year of mining time. It should be noted that the layout of this mine and mining on multiple levels requires the addition of equipment to reduce equipment move time. This reduces the overall utilization of the equipment fleet.

The equipment totals by pre-production and production year are summarized in Table 16-39. The later years include additional trucks and LHDs due to increasing haul distance.

The mine will also have major fixed equipment that is summarized in Table 16-40.

## 17 Recovery Methods

## 17.1  Process Plant Design Criteria

## 17.1.1 Surface Crushing, Ore Storage &amp; Mineral Processing Plant

The primary driver of the comminution circuit design is the dry processing of ore, which will be used in order to avoid an expensive drying operation prior to acid leaching.

The process design relies upon two things; receiving a primary crusher product with a characteristic particle size of (P80) 115 mm at the comminution circuit feed bin and producing feed material for the downstream hydrometallurgical processing at a characteristic particle size of (P80) 1.1 mm.

The primary crusher product will be fed to the secondary cone crusher system, operating in closed circuit with a double deck screen. The screen undersize from the cone crusher system will be fed to a HPGR unit, operating in closed circuit with another double deck screen. The HPGR screen undersize is the comminution product that will report to the hydrometallurgical process. The process design criteria are provided in Table 17-1.

## 17.1.2 Hydrometallurgical Plant

The  hydrometallurgical  process  design  criteria  have  been  established  based  on  bench  and  pilot scale  test  work,  conducted  by  SGS,  Hazen  and  KPM,  as  well  as  similar  projects,  and  standard industry practices. The key items are listed in Table 17-2.

## 17.1.3 Pyrometallurgical Plant

The  purpose  of  the  pyrometallurgical  (Pyromet)  plant  is  to  reduce  the  niobium  pentoxide  in  the Hydromet feed by converting it into a saleable Ferroniobium (FeNb) metal. The Pyromet also plays an important role in the purification of the FeNb by removing excess Ti in the slag portion of the smelting. Since niobium is commonly alloyed with various high-grade steels to significantly increase their mechanical properties, producing ferroniobium metal is an attractive and suitable option to be created for use in the steel industry.

The  pyrometallurgical  process  design  criteria  have  been  established  based  on  thermodynamic calculations, inspired from test results completed by KPM and supported by the literature available on the aluminothermic reduction as well as on the niobium pyrometallurgy. Table 17-3 presents the Pyromet design criteria.

The aluminothermic reduction has been selected as the technology to convert the hydrometallurgical Nb2O5 precipitate into a FeNb metal. Aluminum shots and iron oxide pellets will be introduced on a continuous  basis  along  with  the  fluxing  agents  to  initiate  and  complete  the  exothermic  chemical reduction  of  the  Nb2O5.  This  reduction  is  performed  in  a  single  electrical  arc  furnace  with  a continuous feed of precipitate, additives and fluxes to produce a saleable FeNb metal alloy.

## 17.2  Flowsheets and Process Description

## 17.2.1 Surface Crushing, Ore Storage &amp; Mineral Processing Plant

The RoM ore will be crushed underground in a primary crusher, and the crushed product with a top size  of  203  mm  and  characteristic  size  (P80)  of  115  mm,  will  be  delivered  to  the  crushed  ore  bin located at the surface. The ore from the bin will be reclaimed by three vibrating feeders with a total capacity of 136 t/h and passed on to the secondary crusher circuit via the secondary crusher screen feed conveyor.

At the secondary crushing stage, the ore will be sized on a dry, double deck screen with a top deck aperture size of 50 mm and bottom deck aperture size of 25 mm. The screen oversize from both decks  will  report  to  the  secondary  crushing  stage.  The  screen  undersize  will  be  conveyed  to  the HPGR circuit.

The screen oversize fractions will be crushed in a single secondary cone crusher operating with a closed side setting of 25 mm. The secondary crushed product will be sized by the same double deck screen with the primary crusher discharge ore.

The screen undersize, at an approximate characteristic particle size (P80) of 22 mm, will be further crushed in the HPGR circuit. The HPGR circuit will consist of a single HPGR crusher and a dual stage de-lumper-type de-agglomeration unit operating in closed circuit, with a separate double-deck vibrating  screen  with  top  and  bottom  deck  aperture  sizes  of  6  mm  and  3  mm,  respectively.  The recirculating load of the HPGR circuit is expected to be in the range of 30 to 40% of the circuit new feed.

The  HPGR  screen  undersize  will  be  the  final  comminution  product  and  is  expected  to  have  a characteristic particle size (P80) of 1.1 mm. The ore will be stored in a fine ore bin, then reclaimed by a vibrating feeder with a design capacity of 132 t/h, and then passed on to the acid leach circuit via the acid leach feed conveyor for further processing. The HPGR conceptual block flow diagram can be seen in Figure 17-1.

## 17.2.2 Hydrometallurgical Plant

The role of the hydrometallurgical (Hydromet) plant is to separate the three pay elements Nb, Ti, Sc, from  the  crushed  Ore,  while  utilizing  processes  to  minimize  the  operating  cost  of  the  plant.  This requires a large amount of acid, both Hydrochloric (HCl) and Sulfuric (H2SO4). The Hydromet plant includes acid recovery processes to lower the operating expense of the process by requiring a small amount of fresh acid and sulfur to be brought onsite. The HCl and H2SO4 recoveries are 99% and 85%  respectively.  The  other  operating  cost  reduction  comes  from  utilizing  impurities  in  the  ore separated  out  in  the  process  as  reagents  in  the  process,  which  minimizes  the  need  for  fresh reagents brought onsite. The added benefit to utilizing impurities as reagents reduces the amount of Tailings from the process that needs to go to the Tails Storage Facility (TSF), reducing the overall size of the storage area.

The hydrometallurgical process is divided into fifteen units:

- 1. Hydrochloric Acid Leach (605)
- 2. Sulfuric Acid Bake (610)
- 3. Water Leach (615)
- 4. Iron Reduction (620)
- 5. Niobium Precipitation and Phosphorus Removal (625)
- 6. Scandium Precipitation (628)
- 7. Sulfate Calcining and Mixed Oxides Handling (630)
- 8. Titanium Precipitation (635)
- 9. Scandium Solvent Extraction (640)
- 10. Scandium Refining (645)
- 11. Product Handling and Packaging (650)
- 12. Sulfuric Acid Plant (655)
- 13. Hydrochloric Acid Regeneration (660)
- 14. Tailings Neutralization (665)
- 15. Tailings Filtration (670)

The  majority  of  the  unit  processes  selected  for  the  hydrometallurgical  flowsheet  have  been extensively reported on in literature and are predominately proven and existing processes. The plant consists of multiple buildings that will house 15 separate physical and chemical processes required to separate the niobium, scandium and titanium that are contained in the ore and to regenerate and recover reagents for reuse.

More details can be found in Figure 17-2 and Section 17.3.2.

## Hydrochloric Acid Leach (605)

The  Hydrochloric  Acid  Leach  unit  is  designed  to  leach  the  majority  of  the  impurities  and  the scandium present in the feed material to reduce the size of subsequent process equipment. The feed coming from the Mineral Processing Plant at a rate of 2,760 t/d (115 t/h) is fed to the HCl Leach Feed  Bin.  The  crushed  ore  is  then  distributed  using  screw  conveyors  to  two  parallel  trains  each consisting of a primary HCl leach tank followed by two secondary HCl leach tanks. Hydrochloric acid from the Hydrochloric Acid Regeneration unit is combined with the crushed ore in each train and reacts  at  a  controlled  temperature.  The  discharge  slurries  (9  wt%  solids)  from  each  train  of hydrochloric  leach  tanks  are  combined  and  fed  to  a  dewatering  and  washing  circuit  consisting successively  of  a  thickener  and  four  parallel  filter  presses.  The  solids  are  washed  in  a  series  of counter current washing stages to ensure removal of the residual chloride ions that may be present in the cake moisture. The filtrate and wash liquors are combined along with the thickener overflow and  sent  to  the  PLS  Aging  section  ahead  of  the  Scandium  Solvent  Extraction  unit  and  the Hydrochloric Acid Regeneration unit. The filter cake is sent to the Acid Bake and Water Leach unit.

The PLS Aging tank receives the combined thickener overflow, leach filtrate and wash liquor along with the secondary scandium re-leach liquor. Titanium and other minor elements contained in the PLS are oxidized with  the  use  of  an  oxidizing  agent,  precipitated  and  are  further  separated  by  a

clarifier.  The  clarified  PLS  is  sent  to  the  Scandium  Solvent  Extraction  unit  for  scandium  recovery while the solids are sent to the Titanium Precipitation unit.

## Sulfuric Acid Bake (610)

The Acid Bake unit is used to convert all of the unleached metal content into sulfate compounds. The Hydrochloric Acid Leach cake is combined with pre-heated sulfuric acid and mixed in a pair of pug mills before being fed into a hollow flight screw and maintained at reaction temperature. The hollow flight provides the necessary reaction time at elevated temperature to convert the metal compounds to sulfate compounds. Offgas from the Acid Bake is sent to a condensing column where the sulfuric acid is condensed and sent to the Hydrochloric Acid Regeneration unit. The Acid Bake discharge is continuously fed through a discharge lump breaker to the Water Leach unit.

## Water Leach (615)

The  Water  Leach  unit  is  used  to  solubilize  all  soluble  sulfates  while  separating  non-soluble impurities.  The  circuit  is  composed  of  a  series  of  three  cascading  agitated  tanks  discharging  to centrifuges. The feed is delivered to the cascading agitated tanks where it is combined with leach water.  The  discharge  from  the  last  cascading  tank  is  pumped  to  dewatering  centrifuges.  The centrate,  which  contains  the  soluble  sulfates,  is  sent  to  the  Iron  Reduction  unit  while  the  cake  is transported via screw conveyor to a three-stage counter-current washing process. The Water Leach residue from the wash centrifuge is transferred by conveyor to the Paste Back Fill Plant.

## Iron Reduction (620)

The Iron Reduction unit is used to reduce iron (III) sulfate (Fe2 (SO4)3) present in the solution to iron (II) sulfate  (FeSO4).  The  titanium  (IV)  oxysulfate  TiOSO4  is  believed  to  also  be  reduced  to titanium (III)  oxysulfate  (Ti2O(SO4)2).  Addition  of  iron  solids  to  the  solution  at  room  temperature reduces iron and titanium compounds. In this unit, the acidic Water Leach discharge is received into the Iron Reduction column where it is contacted with iron. From this reduction column, the liquid is gravity fed to the agitated reduction tank where the reduction is completed with the addition of more iron. The discharge of the Iron reduction tank is sent to the Niobium Precipitation unit.

## Niobium Precipitation and Phosphorus Removal (625)

The Niobium Precipitation unit uses water dilution (RO water) to selectively hydrolyze niobium sulfate and precipitate it as niobium oxyhydroxide. The Iron Reduction discharge is diluted with hot water, acidified with sulfuric acid, and cascaded through a series of agitated tanks. The dilution water to feed  volume  ratio  is  0.6:1  while  the  sulfuric  acid  addition  is  adjusted  to  provide  the  required precipitant acid concentration. The precipitation reaction temperature is maintained at or near boiling by steam jacketed agitated tanks. The discharge of the Niobium Precipitation tanks is pumped to a clarifier.  The  overflow  liquid  is  directed  through  a  polishing  filter  before  being  forwarded  to  the Titanium  Precipitation  circuit.  The  solids  slurry  from  the  clarifier  is  pumped  to  two  centrifuges  for further dewatering. The centrate is sent to the Titanium Precipitation unit while the cake is sent to the direct  fired  Niobium  Calciner  where  water  is  driven  off  and  niobium  oxyhydroxide  is  oxidized  to niobium  pentoxide  (Nb2O5)  at  950°C  while  converting  any  sulfate  trapped  in  the  precipitate  to  an oxide thus liberating SO2 in the offgas. The calcination also converts a portion of the Phosphorus content to a leachable form. The calcined material is cooled in a rotary cooler and then pneumatically transported and fed via a rotary feeder into a series of cascading agitated caustic leach tanks. A Sodium hydroxide solution is added to the calcined niobium concentrate to leach Phosphorus to an

acceptable residual concentration. The caustic leach discharge is pumped to another series of tube presses for dewatering and washing with RO water. The filtrate and wash liquor are combined and sent to the Tailings Neutralization unit, while the cake is sent to a pelletizer before being fed into a sintering kiln. The discharge from the sintering kiln is then conveyed to the Pyrometallurgical plant for further processing.

## Titanium Precipitation (635)

The Titanium Precipitation is achieved through hydrolysis of the titanium oxyhydroxide using heat at a reduced free acid content. The titanium rich solution from the Niobium Precipitation along with the scrubbing  liquor  from  the  Scandium  Solvent  Extraction  are  partially  neutralized  using  fresh  and recycled CaO from the Calcium Loop. The gypsum precipitate containing scandium is filtered on a vacuum belt filter and sent to the rotary kiln where it is calcined back to oxides before being recycled back to the neutralizing tanks. A portion, is purged from the loop to maintain impurity levels and sent back to the Hydrochloric Acid Leach unit where the scandium and any trapped titanium is recovered. The offgas from the Calcium Loop containing the SO2 is combined with the offgases from sulfate calciners, is cleaned and sent to the Acid Plant for sulfur recovery.

The titanium rich filtrate from the vacuum belt filter is heated with steam directly injected in a series of agitated tanks where titanium hydrolyzes and precipitates as titanium oxyhydroxide. The slurry is then pumped to a clarifier. The thickened slurry is then fed to tube presses for additional dewatering and washing with RO water. The overflow from the clarifier along with the filtrate and wash liquor from the tube presses are combined and sent to the Scandium Precipitation circuit. The solids from the tube presses are calcined to drive off any remaining sulfur and water to convert the titanium to TiO2. The titanium dioxide is then sent to the packaging area where it will be loaded into super sacks and/or plastic lined steel drums according to the client's specifications.

## Scandium Precipitation (628)

The Titanium Precipitation filtrate is fed to the Scandium Precipitation unit where it is first mixed with Phosphoric  acid  (H3PO4).  Iron  is  also  added.  Magnesium  carbonate  is  used  to  adjust  the  pH  to ensure the precipitation of the scandium. The slurry is pumped through a clarifier to a filter press where the  liquids  are  separated  and  recycled  to  the  clarifier.  The  clarifier  overflow  is  sent  to  the Tailings  neutralization  circuit.  The  cake  is  conveyed  to  the  Scandium  Re-Leach  tank  where hydrochloric acid is added to re-leach the scandium. The resulting PLS is sent back to the PLS aging tank in the HCl leach circuit before being treated in the Scandium Extraction circuit.

## Sulfate Calcining and Mixed Oxides Handling (630)

The sulfate calcining unit recovers sulfur from the different cakes formed throughout the process. The feed comes from two sources: the Tailings Neutralization filter cake and the HCl Regeneration filter cake. The cake from the Tailings Neutralization unit is processed similarly but separately from the  remaining  sulfate  cake  to  maintain  the  desired  neutralizing  potential  of  the  resulting  mixed oxides.

The initial stage (Primary Kiln) of the calcination of the Acid Regeneration cake operates at a lower temperature and recovers the free H2SO4 acid which is not associated with any other elements. All of the  water  content  in  the  sulfate  cake  is  also  driven  off  in  the  offgas  stream.  This  gas  stream  is condensed in a nearby three-stage condensing and scrubbing circuit. The first stage condenses as much as 98% of the H2SO4 and recovers it in a solution containing more than 96% sulfuric acid. The

second stage completes the condensation of the H2SO4 as 80% sulfuric acid. The last stage finalizes the  scrubbing  to  minimize  the  H2SO4  release.  The  combined  96%  sulfuric  acid  produced  in  the condensing  circuit  is  sent  back  to  the  HCl  Regeneration  unit.  The  last  stage  of  the  two-stage calcining process of the Acid Regeneration cake reaches elevated temperatures to decompose all of the solid sulfates present in the kiln. Sulfur is added to the sulfate cake at this stage to compensate for sulfur losses and is burned to SO2 during the decomposition of the sulfates. This decomposition releases  SO2  and  H2O.  The  sulfur  dioxide  gas  from  this  kiln  is  combined  with  that  of  the  Tails Neutralization sulfate cake calciner and scrubbed in a three-stage scrubbing circuit. The scrubbing circuit is identical to the first stage scrubbing circuit and condenses H2SO4 and water from the SO2 gas before sending it to the Acid Plant for conversion back to H2SO4. The mixed oxides produced are pneumatically conveyed to the Tailings Neutralization as a neutralizing reagent.

The calcination of the Tailings Neutralization sulfate cake only has one stage as it contains no free H2SO4 acid that is not associated with any other elements. The calcination also releases SO2 and H2O. The sulfur dioxide gas from this kiln is combined and scrubbed as described above. The mixed oxides  are  sent  to  Tailings  Neutralization  via  screw  conveyor.  Calcium  loop  calcined  oxides  are pneumatically conveyed back to Ti Neutralization and to the HCl Leach. The mixed oxides produced are  conveyed  to  the  Paste  Backfill  unit  via  belt  conveyor.  A  portion,  adjusted  to  minimize  sulfur losses to the waste water, is recycled back to the Tailings Neutralization for neutralization.

## Scandium Solvent Extraction (640)

The Scandium Solvent Extraction unit is a four stage D2EHPA solvent extraction circuit followed by a wash  stage,  a  three-stage  scrubbing  circuit  and  two  stage  Stripping  Circuits  used  to  selectively recover scandium from the leach solution. The extracting organic solution is prepared in an agitated tank.  The  Barren  organic  from  the  stripping  section  is  conditioned  with  HCl  to  remove  any Hydroxides and to convert it from the Na+ form to its H+ form before being recycled to the Extraction section with fresh organic (small amount as required from time to time to adjust volume). The barren organic flows through the extraction mixer-settlers in series. The aqueous feed from PLS Aging is fed countercurrent to the barren organic through the extraction mixer-settlers. The scandium loads to the organic along with titanium and other elements in small amounts. The raffinate is sent to the HCl Regeneration unit while the loaded organic moves on to a single stage wash with a HCl solution to finalize the separation of aqueous impurities from the organic. The titanium and other impurities that loaded on the organic are then scrubbed in a scrubbing section with a solution containing H2O2 and H2SO4.  The  Sc  rich  loaded  organic  is  then  sent  to  the  Stripping  Circuit.  The  scrubbed  organic solution  is  combined  with  NaOH  and  agitated  in  a  series  of  cascading  tanks  which  strips  the scandium of the organic and precipitates it. Separation is accomplished by a 3-phase settler where the  organic,  aqueous  and  solids  are  separated.  The  aqueous  phase  containing  excess  NaOH  is moved to a holding tank and is recycled back to be re-used as strip solution. The barren organic is sent  to  a  coalescer  and  is  recycled  to  the  conditioning  step  upstream  the  Extraction.  The  settler underflow is further refined in the Scandium Refining unit.

## Scandium Refining (645)

Scandium Refining involves removing Zirconium and other impurities such as titanium and niobium from the scandium produced. The process is operated in batches. The first step is to re-dissolve the scandium  rich  solids  in  H2SO4  and  dilute  this  solution  down  with  RO  water.  The  scandium  rich solution is then contacted with a mix of two organics and diluent in single mixer-settler tank. The Zr,

Ti and Nb are loaded onto the organic, which is decanted and moved to a stripping stage while the decanted Sc rich raffinate is sent to the oxalate crystallization step. There Zr, Ti and Nb are stripped from the loaded organic with H2SO4 in a single mixer-settler tank. The stripped organic solution then moves on to the organic regeneration circuit  to  be  recovered  for  re-use  in  another  cycle  and  the stripping solution is sent to Tailings Neutralization. The Sc rich raffinate is mixed with oxalic acid to form scandium oxalate crystals that are filtered and washed on a belt filter. The filtrate and wash liquor are sent to Tailings Neutralization while the cake is calcined to convert the solids to Sc2O3. The calciner discharge is transferred by screw conveyor to a screen where the final product is weighed and bagged for sale.

## Sulfuric Acid Plant (655)

Gas from the calciner is delivered to the acid plant drying tower cleaned and cooled to a temperature of  50°C.  The gas is deficient in oxygen so ambient air is added to the clean gas leaving the gas cleaning  system  to  provide  sufficient  oxygen  for  the  conversion  of  SO2  to  SO3  in  the  acid  plant contact section. A minimum O2:SO2 ratio of 1:1 is required for efficient reaction.

The  diluted  gas  still  contains  water  which  must  be  removed  before  the  gas  enters  the  contact section. Drying of the gas is done in the drying tower by counter current contact with concentrated sulfuric acid in the packed section. Concentrated sulfuric acid readily absorbs water from the gas. The dry gas leaves the top of the packed section and passes through a mesh pad mist eliminator before leaving the tower.

The dry gas enters the main acid plant blower which compresses the gas for delivery through the acid  plant  contact  section.  The  cold  gas  leaving  the  blower  must  first  be  heated  to  the  catalyst ignition temperature. This is done in a series of gas-to-gas heat exchangers which transfer heat from the hot gas leaving the catalyst beds.

The contact process consists of multiple catalyst bed conversion stages with interstage gas-cooling heat  exchangers  followed  by  two  absorption  stages.  The  conversion  stages  convert  SO2  to  SO3, while the absorption stages capture the SO3 to produce concentrated sulfuric acid.

Primary  conversion  is  obtained  in  the  first  three  catalyst  beds  with  cooling  of  the  process  gas between each bed. The gas leaving the 3rd catalyst bed is cooled prior to entering the intermediate absorber  tower.  In  the  absorber  tower  the  SO3  formed  up  to  this  stage  is  absorbed  by  counter current contact with concentrated sulfuric acid in the packed section. The gas leaving the absorber tower passes through a set of high efficiency mist eliminators before being reheated to the Bed 4 inlet temperature.

The gas undergoes the final stage of SO2 to SO3 conversion in Bed 4. The removal of SO3 in the intermediate absorption tower results in a higher overall conversion rate in the final bed. The gas leaving the final catalyst bed is cooled before entering the final absorber tower. In the final absorber tower the SO3 formed in Bed 4 is absorbed by counter current contact with concentrated sulfuric acid in the packed section. The gas leaving the absorber tower passes through a set of high efficiency mist eliminators before being discharged to atmosphere through the acid plant stack.

The acid plant is designed for an overall conversation rate of 99.7% and a product acid concentration of 96%.

## Hydrochloric Acid (HCl) Regeneration (660)

In this area  chlorine  is  recovered  in  the  form  of  Hydrochloric  Acid  (HCl)  for  reuse  in  the Hydrometallurgy  Process.  The  scandium  raffinate  stream  contains  significant  concentrations  of dissolved  metal  chloride  compounds  in  water.  Metal  chlorides  react  with  sulfuric  acid  to  produce metal  sulfates  and  HCl  gas.  The  HCl  gas  is  vented  to  absorber  columns  to  recover  the  HCl  in solution. Sulfate compounds are precipitated as solids in a sulfuric acid solution and recovered by filtration.

The process contains a sulfuric acid recirculation loop. Sulfuric acid is added to the Precipitators and collected in Filtrate Tanks after the solids are filtered. The sulfuric acid from these tanks is heated and returned to the HCl Regen Reactors

Water interferes with precipitation of sulfate solids and must be removed along with HCl. Two water removal steps are provided with an initial feed vacuum flash and a second post-reaction vacuum flash unit.

## Tailings Neutralization (665)

The Tailings Neutralization unit is fed by the centrate and filtrate from the Titanium Precipitation unit as well as other acidic tailings streams. The combined feed is reacted with recycled mixed oxides in a series of agitated tanks in order to raise the pH to around 9.5. The discharge slurry is pumped to Tailings Handling.

## Tailings Handling (670)

The discharge slurry from Tailings Neutralization is successively dewatered in a thickener and filter presses. The filtrate is returned to the thickener, the filter cake is sent to the sulfate calciner, and the thickener overflow is sent to water treatment.

## 17.2.3 Pyrometallurgical Plant

The high level Pyromet plant flowsheet is presented in Figure 17-3. The proposed process is based on aluminothermic reduction of niobium pentoxide (Nb2O5) present in the precipitate. The dry Nb2O5 precipitate pellets are fed by conveyor to the Furnace Feed Preparation Area (FPA), and stored in a closed  bin,  giving  a  total  of  7.5  days  storage  time.  Aluminum  grains,  the  primary  reductant,  with hematite  Fe2O3  pellets  to  supply  iron  units  are  also  stored  in  feed  bins  with  a  13  day  storage capacity.

The low consumption fluxes limestone (CaCO3) and sodium oxide (Na2O) are each stored separately in super sacks that can easily be opened. Six flow control bins for aluminum, hematite, limestone, sodium oxide, and FeNb metal off-spec recycle material along with the Nb2O5 feed stock from the Hydromet provide measured feed to the FeNb Furnace. The three larger quantity usage bins are loaded by conveyor while the lower quantity usage bins are loaded by crane using super sacks. All of the  conveyors  under  the  bins  are  on  load-cells,  as  part  of  the  furnace  feed  preparation  mass measurement system which is automatically controlled via PLC.

The  furnace feed preparation is performed as a continuous process with specified mass measurement of the Nb2O5 precipitate pellets with the required aluminum, hematite, and fluxes to satisfy a 'recipe' for the production of on-spec FeNb alloy (65% Nb). Each ingredient is fed onto the furnace feed conveyor at a pre-determined rate to provide a continuous charge to the furnace.

This allows tight control on continuous feed of the mixed charge into the furnace, to maintain furnace levels of slag and metal alloy. Furnace feeding will be stopped briefly for tapping of both molten slag and FeNb alloy, according to levels of slag and metal in the furnace.

The tapping of slag and FeNb metal is scheduled over two 12 hour shifts:

- 1. Slag: 18 taps x per 12 hour shift, 15 minute tapping duration. 1.97 t per tap.
- 2. FeNb metal: 2 taps x per 12 hour shift, 10 minute tapping duration. 5.5 t per tap.

A tapping drill and clay gun unit is used to open each slag and metal tap-hole, and plug each taphole  with  clay  after  the  tap  is  complete.  A  molten  heel  or  pool  of  metal  is  left  remaining  in  the furnace, with some slag layer covering the metal. This is carried out according to measured furnace levels with the slag and metal masses, providing ongoing control and continuous operation of the furnace. The FeNb furnace will be operated at a temperature in the range of 1850 to 1900°C.

Electrical  energy  is  supplied  to  the  furnace  to  initiate  or  maintain  heat  input  into  the  furnace  to complete the reduction of Nb2O5 and Fe2O3. Aluminum is the primary reductant and on oxidation to Al2O3 forms a large part of the slag system with TiO2, fluxed with limestone (CaCO3) and sodium oxide (Na2O).

The Al2O3-TiO2OO-CaO type slag produced in the furnace is tapped into steel molds multiple times (18 times/shift) each shift where it is allowed to cool before being moved to a storage bunker area. The steel molds are sectioned so that the slag is easily removed from the mold and is in small easily crushed pieces. The molds are reused. The slag is moved from the load out bunker with a front-end loader  (FEL)  to  the  vibrating  feeder  that  feeds  the  Slag  Jaw  Crusher.  The  crushed  slag  is  then treated by gravity separation to recuperate the FeNb particles stuck in the slag. The remaining slag is transferred to the tailings impoundment.

The FeNb alloy metal is tapped via a short launder into the FeNb pelletizing pan where the molten droplets will solidify in a cold water basin to form particles ranging in size from approximately 6 mm to 15 mm. The cooled FeNb pellets will then be removed from the basin by a pocket conveyor and transferred to a rotary dryer where the moisture will be driven off prior to screening and packaging. Undersize FeNb pellets are collected and sent to the off-spec feed bin to be reintroduced into the EAF.

Dusts from the FeNb Furnace Feed Preparation Area, are captured via ducting through a dry cyclone - bag-house system. All dusts from this area are returned to the FeNb Furnace Feed Preparation Area and placed in a separate bin. As required, according to the furnace charge mix recipe, these fines are bled back into the furnace charge for smelting.

The FeNb furnace off-gas, slag and metal tapping fumes, and casting fumes above each mold are captured and ducted to the furnace off-gas baghouse. Baghouse dust is recycled to the EAF or the Pelletizer.

Both the Feed Preparation and Furnace dust collectors cleaned air exhausts are ducted respectively to  their  own  exhaust  stack.  Each  air  exhaust  duct  may  be  monitored  by  sampling  to  meet environmental regulations.

## 17.2.4 Acid Plant

Gas from the calciner is delivered to the acid plant drying tower cleaned and cooled to a temperature of  50 C.  The  gas  is  deficient  in  oxygen  so  ambient  air  is  added  to  the  clean  gas  leaving  the  gas o cleaning  system  to  provide  sufficient  oxygen  for  the  conversion  of  SO2  to  SO3  in  the  acid  plant contact section. The diluted gas still contains water which must be removed before the gas enters

the contact section. Drying of the gas is done in the drying tower by counter current contact with concentrated sulfuric acid in the packed section. Concentrated sulfuric acid readily absorbs water from the gas. The dry gas leaves the top of the packed section and passes through a mesh pad mist eliminator before leaving the tower.

The contact process consists of multiple catalyst bed conversion stages with interstage gas-cooling heat  exchangers  followed  by  two  absorption  stages.  The  conversion  stages  convert  SO2  to  SO3, while the absorption stages capture the SO3 to produce concentrated sulfuric acid.

The acid plant is designed for an overall conversation rate of 99.7% and a product acid concentration of 96%

## 17.3.2 Hydrometallurgical Plant

Based  on  the  design  criteria  and  the  flowsheet,  a  mass  balance  for  the  hydrometallurgical processing plant has been developed. The mass balance was prepared for an average feed of 2,760 t/d  or  115 t/h  operating  332  days  per  year  at  0.8%  Nb2O5.  The  mass  balance  for  the  plant  was calculated to provide tonnages and flow rates to different sections and equipment in the plant. The mass  balance  was  designed  and  a  model  of  the  hydrometallurgical  plant  was  done  using  the flowsheet integrator METSIM. A summarized mass balance can be found in the Figure 17-4.

## 17.3.3 Pyrometallurgical Plant

Based on the design criteria and the pyrometallurgical flowsheet, a mass balance model with energy requirements was developed for the Pyromet plant. The mass balance was prepared for an average feed rate of 43.92 t/d (dry basis) or 1.83 t/h at 49.5% Nb2O5 with a 91.7% overall plant availability. The mass balance for the pyrometallurgical plant was calculated to provide tonnages and flow rates to different sections and equipment in the plant. A partition coefficient method was used to define the split  of  elements  between  furnace  slag  and  FeNb  metal  alloy.  These  partition  coefficients  were estimated  based  on  KPM  test  work,  slag  and  alloy  chemistry,  and  supported  by  data  from  other FeNb alloy industry operations.

The major element partition coefficients defining the mass balances are shown in Table 17-5. Other element distribution coefficients are provided in the design criteria back-up documents.

Table 17-5: FeNb Furnace Partition Coefficients

| Element   |   % to Slag |   % to Metal |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| Nb        |         4   |         96   |
| Fe        |         5   |         95   |
| Ti        |        99.1 |          0.9 |

From Table 17-5, the Nb recovery in the pyrometallurgical process plant is targeted at 96%, given the assumptions made in the design criteria. For this study, it is assumed that all dust and metal fines  with  Nb  units  in  fumes  are  collected  and  recycled  to  the  FeNb  Furnace.  This  includes  Nb bearing dusts and fume from the Feed Preparation Area, FeNb Furnace off-gas, Tapping &amp; Casting, and FeNb Crushing and Screening areas.

The FeNb metal production was calculated at 19.3 t/d, corresponding to 7,055 t/yr with an availability of 91.7% and considering a grade of 0.35Fe-0.65 Nb.

The FeNb slag output was estimated at 44.3 t/d, corresponding to 16.2 Mt/y (same availability), with an estimated Nb2O5 grade of 1% not transformed.

Storm  water  will  be  collected  on  site  by  a  storm  water  collection  system  that  will  consist  of  a combination  of  buried  HDPE  pipe  and  surface  swales  and  ditches.  Surface  water  from  disturbed areas will be collected in a storm water retention basin prior to its release into the local stream.

Storm water that is  collected  from  areas  of  potential  contamination  from  hazardous  material  from process areas will be collected separately from other surface water sources and analyzed prior to discharge to the storm water collection system. The fuel island, as well as the retention pond pipe inlet  will  include  oily  water  separators  to  ensure  any  petroleum  that  is  in  surface  water  is  not discharged to local waters and is collected for off-site disposal.

## Sanitary Waste Water System

Sanitary waste water will be transported from the on-site holding tanks to the municipal waste water treatment plant located in Tecumseh.

Waste water from all site facilities will be collected in the on-site sanitary waste water system through an underground PVC SR35 sewer piping network combining manholes and sewage lift stations. The system is designed for a peak flow rate of 750 gpm during peak shower usage and 27,300 gpd daily nominal volume.

## First Aid Facilities

The Administration building, as well as the Mine Change building, will each have a first aid station for treatable  on-site  injuries.  There  will  be  an  on-site  emergency  mine  rescue  vehicle  and  a  rescue trailer. A helicopter pad will be located within the site property for evacuation of personnel.

## Laydown Area / Cold Storage

During normal operation of the mine and processing facilities there will be minimal need for laydown areas or additional, covered or enclosed storage. The spacing between buildings has been chosen to provide adequate clearances for construction, and space for staging equipment and replacement parts for maintenance and plant turnarounds.

## Reagent Storage

Reagents will be used in the Hydromet, Pyromet, Acid Plant, HCl Regeneration Plant and the Paste Backfill Plant. Liquid reagents will be stored in the reagent or raw material tank farm located west of the  Hydromet  Plant.  The  tank  farm  will  include  truck  unloading  stations  and  transfer  pumps  to transfer reagent to their required process. All tanks of specific reagents will be isolated from other reagents and located within their own diked containment areas.

Process facilities will also store reagent tanks, bunkers, bins and silos. Additional plant reagents will be stored in the process buildings.

## Products Storage, Packaging, Shipping

Packaging of the three main products will take place at the outlet of the respective final processing equipment, as a continuation of the process flow.

The anticipated production rates of ferroniobium and titanium dioxide will warrant multiple shipments per week of each product if shipped via over-the-road vehicles. The anticipated production rate of scandium  will  yield  much  smaller  volumes.  Frequency  of  shipments  of  scandium  will  be  less

frequent, justifying transfer of the containers to a designated storage area inside the Maintenance / Warehouse Building until shipment.

The types and locations of loading and unloading facilities will be specific to the material or products being received and shipped.

## RCRA Waste Storage

This storage area will include a concrete diked containment area for the storage of wastes, including any hazardous wastes generated at the facility prior to offsite disposal.

## Truck Scale

A truck scale will be located near the primary site access.

## Fuel Storage - Surface Fuel Station

Fueling facility for surface vehicles will be provided.

## 18.7  Roads

## 18.7.1 Main Access Road to Site

The primary access to the site will be from County Road 721. Access into the site will be controlled by security personnel. The site access road will be leading to the main access points to the mine, the Administration Building and the primary traffic destinations on the site.

## 18.7.2 Secondary Site Access Roads

A  second,  emergency  access  to  the  site  will  be  connecting  to  Nebraska  State  Route  50.  The entrance to the emergency access road will be secured with a locked gate.

## 18.7.3 Secondary Site Roads (to tailings, etc.)

Secondary roads on site include haul roads connecting the Plant Site to TSF cells and light vehicle access roads connecting infrastructure throughout the site. Haul traffic is expected to include 40 t haul trucks delivering tailings to the active TSF cells and support equipment for the haul fleet. Light vehicles include light duty pickups and service vehicles supporting infrastructure.

## Haul Roads

Haul roads are required to provide access between the Plant Site and TSF Cells. A haul road will provide  access  to  Plant  Site  Cells  2  and  3,  as  well  as  Area  7.  Area  7  haul  road  will  require  a connection between a public road and the TSF area. Improvements to the public roadway may be required pending haul fleet size delivering tailings to Area 7. Highway compliant tractor-trailer trucks may be used instead of off-road trucks.

Haul roads are designed to allow trucks to pass safely. The haul trucks assumed for this study are 40 t  articulated  off-road  trucks.  The  width  of  a  truck  is  approximately  4  m  wide.  To  provide  safe passage for two-way traffic, the suggested width of the travel way (driving surface) is 3.5 times the width of the truck, or 14 m. Haul roads are shown with a width of 20 m, allowing for up to 6 m for safety berms. The road widths and berm placement will be determined during the final engineering design. Much of the roadway may not require a safety berm due to height, but a running width of 20 m is used for estimating and preliminary design purposes.

Haul  traffic  speed  is  generally  slow,  (30  to  40  km/h);  the  design  shown  does  not  incorporate engineering  controls  for  a  design  speed,  and  are  shown  for  estimating  and  preliminary  design purposes only.

## Light Vehicle Access Roads

Light vehicle access roads are located throughout the site. They provide access to dewatering well pads, and infrastructure such as ponds, embankment crest and toe fills.

Expected traffic on light duty roads includes light duty pickup trucks, maintenance equipment, and the occasional haul truck. Light vehicle roads assume occasional use, single lane traffic with areas to safely pull out of the traffic lane should vehicles meet. A typical light duty vehicle is approximately 3 m wide. Road widths are designed at 6 m in width.

Speeds are expected to be slow (20 to 30 km/h); the design shown does not incorporate engineering controls for a design speed, and are shown for estimating and preliminary design purposes only.

## Construction

Geotechnical  information  for  soils  underlying  road  alignments  is  not  available  at  this  time.  The construction  of  the  roadways  assumes  similar  construction  practices  as  defined  for  the  TSF embankment construction. Remove 1 m (+/-) of topsoil, replace with suitable compacted sub-grade fill, and  provide  structural  support  for  traffic  with  a  durable  gravel  surface.  Geotextile  fabric  is installed at the base of the gravel layer to provide stability. A minimum of 0.5 m of compacted gravel should be provided for the driving surface.

All roadways will be designed to promote drainage off of the driving surface. This requires that the roadways  be  elevated  slightly  above  the  surrounding  ground  elevations  and  crowned,  and/or  a drainage ditch be provided as needed in areas of elevation transition from cut to fill. In areas where berms are required, notches in the berms should be provided to allow stormwater to discharge off of the roadways. In areas where safety berms are not required, shoulder slopes should not exceed 3:1 (horizontal to vertical), and 4:1 desired to reduce the chance of a vehicle rollover should they divert from the roadway.

## 18.8  Temporary Waste Rock Stockpile

The temporary waste rock stockpile will be used during the sinking of the shaft for storage of topsoil, waste rock and ore. The feasibility design incorporates the following parameters and details:

- a. The facility has been divided into three cells (Figure 18-3) to enable waste materials to be stockpiled separately.
- b. A minimum of 1 m of subbase soils will be removed prior to construction of the TSF and stockpiled at the location shown on Figure 18-3.
- c. Based on the current geochemical analysis of the waste rock and ore the temporary waste rock stockpile will be lined. The liner systems for the facility is shown on Figure 18-10 and will incorporate:
- o A  minimum  of  2  ft  of  glacial  till,  amended  as  necessary  with  bentonite,  and compacted  in  layers  to  result  in  a  hydraulic  conductivity  of  less  than  or  equal  to 1x10-7cm/s;
- o An 80-mil high-density polyethylene (HDPE) geosynthetic liner placed over the low permeability basin and inside embankment sideslopes; and

- d. Runoff  from  the  stockpile  will  gravity  drain  into  a  water  management  pond  located  to  the south of the facility (Figure 18-3). The water management pond liner system will incorporate:
- o A  minimum  of  2 ft  of  glacial  till,  amended  as  necessary  with  bentonite,  and compacted  in  layers  to  result  in  a  hydraulic  conductivity  of  less  than  or  equal  to 1x10-7cm/s;
- o A 60-mil HDPE secondary liner incorporating a DrainLiner system or Geonet layer above the geosynthetic liner;
- o An 80-mil high-density polyethylene (HDPE) primary liner;

The DrainLiner or Geonet layers will gravitate into a leak collection and recovery system (LCRS) that facilitates pumping of collected seepage water back into the water management pond via a submersible pump and riser pipeline arrangement. As shown on Figure 18-13, the riser pipeline will be contained in a 'port' pipeline installed between the two liners. The LCRS sumps are gravel-filled facilities between the primary and secondary liners,  with  the  horizontal  base  of  the  riser  pipe  perforated  within  the  gravel  for  leakage collection and recovery.

- e. Once the plant is operational the ore will  be  removed  and  processed.  Waste rock will  be used as overliner during TSF construction and any additional will be placed in Plant Site Cell 1 for final disposal.
- f. It  is  currently anticipated that all waste material will be removed from the temporary waste rock stockpile by Year 2.

## 18.9  Water Management

## 18.9.1 Surface Water Management for TSF and Temporary Stockpile Areas

The Project is located primarily in the Elk Creek Watershed, near its confluence with Todd Creek. Todd  Creek  is  a  tributary  of  North  Fork  Big  Nemaha  River  which  becomes  Big  Nemaha  River approximately 30 miles downstream  and  joins the Missouri River approximately 45 miles downstream.

The  TSF  and  associated  ponds  will  all  be  located  outside  and  above  the  limits  of  the  FEMA approximate Zone A flood zone (Figure 18-4).

Figure 18-4: TSF and Stockpile Area Stormwater Controls

<!-- image -->

Hydrologic and hydraulic analyses were performed to evaluate stormwater control requirements for the  Elk  Creek  TSF  and  supporting  facilities.  In  general,  the  TSF  facilities  are  located  in  the uppermost  reaches  of  small  catchments  in  the  Elk  Creek  watershed  and  therefore  only  local diversion of small upstream flows (run-on) around facilities is required.

Stormwater  control  designs  include  spillways  on  the  TSF  cell  and  water  management  pond embankments, and channels on the embankment crests for management of storm runoff from the closed and re-graded surfaces. External stormwater controls include triangular channels (v-ditches) and sediment traps located at the toe of embankments for sediment and erosion control, and culverts to pass flows in drainages through access road crossings (Figure 18-4).

All  TSF cell and pond spillways are configured as a 0.5 m deep by 3 m wide trapezoidal channel (notch) with 10:1 sideslopes, oriented perpendicular to the embankment crest and can pass the PMF storm  event;  a  channel  (down-chute)  lined  with  riprap  (or  HydroTurf)  will  convey  flows  down embankments and into stilling basins. All other stormwater controls are design to withstand the peak flow rate from the 100-year, 24-hour storm event.

Peak flow rates for spillway, culvert and closure channel sizing were determined utilizing HEC-HMS version  4.2  (HEC-HMS),  released  by  the  US  Army  Corps  of  Engineers,  Hydrologic  Engineering Center (USACE 2016). The Rational Method was used to evaluate peak flow rates and channel (vditch)  sizing  for  the  embankment  toe  channels.  Hydraulic  calculations  were  performed  in  Bentley FlowMaster version 8i (Bentley 2009), and HY-8 version 7.5 (HY-8) released by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA 2016).

Rainfall  data  used  in  the  hydrologic  analyses  was  obtained  from  the  National  Oceanic  and Atmospheric  Administration  (NOAA),  Precipitation  Frequency  Data  Server  (PFDS)  which  for  the State  of  Nebraska  utilizes  NOAA  Atlas  14,  Volume  8  Version  2  (NOAA  2013)  (Table  18-4).  The probable maximum precipitation (PMP) storm depth of 21 inches (533 mm) was obtained from the document  Nebraska  Statewide  Probable  Maximum  Precipitation  Study  (Tomlinson  et.  al,  2008), recommended for use in Nebraska by Nebraska Department of Natural Resources.

## 18.9.2 Active Dewatering System

Active dewatering from the surface will be utilized in advance of development of the mine and will continue  to  be  utilized  throughout  the  mine  life.  The  active  dewatering  system  will  consist  of  a network of approximately 12 perimeter wells, equally spaced around the deposit. The wells will be drilled  to  a  depth  of  850  mbgs.  The  wells  will  be  16  inches  in  diameter  and  will  be  capable  of pumping approximately 65 L/sec (1,000 gpm) each. The wells must be installed and operational one year in advance of the shaft completion date, so that the shaft can be suitably dewatered. Three additional  wells  will  be  drilled  to  provide  dewatering  capacity  when  primary  wells  and  pumps  are being  serviced.  The  three  additional  wells  will  also  allow  a  higher  maximum  flow  rate  for  short periods of time when needed.

Wells will require a nominal 16 inch outside diameter casing and screen to accommodate a 16-stage, nominal 9.5 inch diameter, 670 kW (900 HP), submersible pump with a shroud. The final design of the wells will depend on the prototype wells and how they function,

Water from each well will be piped to a collection pond. The water will then be pumped via a mine dewatering  discharge  waterline  to  the  Missouri  River.  The  total  average  anticipated  input  to  the collection pond during the first 5 years will be 757 L/sec, after which time flow rates are expected to gradually decline through the LoM.

## 18.9.3 Active Dewatering Pond

The active dewatering pond has been designed as a collection and transfer pond for all mine water and any suitable process water prior to discharge to the Missouri River (Figure 18-5). In addition, water from the active dewatering pond will be used as a source of make-up water for the plant. The feasibility design incorporates the following parameters and details:

- a. Feasibility design has been performed using 1 m contoured topography.
- b. The active dewatering pond embankment sections will incorporate a 20 m crest width and 3 (horizontal) to 1  (vertical) side  slopes.  Revegetation  of  the  embankment  crests  and downstream sideslopes will be provided for erosion protection, immediately after construction completion of each embankment.
- c. The active dewatering pond will cover approximately 5.4 ha with a crest elevation of 372.5 masl  and  a  base  elevation  of  362.5  masl.  The  maximum  embankment  height  will  be approximately 11 m.
- d. Assuming 1 m of dry freeboard, the pond has a total capacity of approximately 430,000 m 3 . The pond will provide 4.5 days of emergency storage assuming a maximum dewatering rate of 950 L/sec (15,000 gpm) rate plus the 100-year, 24-hour storm.
- e. The  active  dewatering  pond  has  been  designed  with  two  cells  for  operational  water management, thus allowing water management in one cell while solids are removed from the other cells. Each cell has a capacity of approximately 50,000 m 3  or approximately 0.5 days of storage. These cells are included in the total capacity described in c, above.
- f. Foundation preparation for the embankments will incorporate removal of a minimum of 0.5 m of  native  soils,  and  re-compaction  in  layers.  The  embankments  will  then  be  constructed using  soil  borrowed  from  within  the  active  dewatering  pond  footprint,  and  compacted  in layers to form a non-settling structure.
- g. The active dewatering pond, as well as the Leak Collection and Recovery System (LCRS) sumps within the cells, will incorporate:

- · A  minimum  of  2 ft  of  glacial  till,  amended  as  necessary  with  bentonite,  and compacted  in  layers  to  result  in  a  hydraulic  conductivity  of  less  than  or  equal  to 1x10 -7 cm/s;
- · A 60-mil HDPE secondary liner incorporating a DrainLiner system or Geonet layer above the geosynthetic liner;
- · An 80-mil high-density polyethylene (HDPE) primary liner;

The DrainLiner or Geonet layers will gravitate into a LCRS sump that facilitates pumping of collected  seepage  water  back  into  the  LCPs  via  a  submersible  pump  and  riser  pipeline arrangement.

- h. In order to maintain a constant water level within the pond water will need to be pumped to the Missouri River at a rate of approximately 790 l/s (12,500gpm) assuming average monthly precipitation, an average dewatering rate of 950 l/s, and an average make-up water rate of 190 l/s.

## 18.9.4 Waterline to Missouri

The  purpose  of  the  waterline  to  the  Missouri  is  to  convey  water  from  a  holding  pond  (active dewatering pond) that is filled by the mine's dewatering wells to a discharge point at the Missouri River. The dewatering system will consist of a 53 km waterline as well as booster pump stations, control valves, surge protection and a mixing diffuser structure at the Missouri River.

## Waterline to Missouri Dewatering System

## Design Criteria

- · The design criteria includes:
- o Sustained Pumping Capacity: 45.4 m³/min (12,000 gpm); and
- o Peak Pumping Capacity: 56.8 m³/min (15,000 gpm).

## Waterline Alignment

The 53 km waterline  generally  follows  County  Road  720  from  the  mine  site  continuing  east  until County Road 634 Ave where it jogs to the north 1.6 kilometers (1 mile), and then continues along County Road 721 until the Missouri River where it meanders northerly to the proposed outlet (Figure 18-6).

<!-- image -->

Source: Olsson, 2017

## Waterline

The waterline has been sized to minimize friction head loss while maintaining high enough velocities to  keep  the  pipe  clean.  The  sizing  is  based  on  a  maximum  velocity  of  2.1  m/sec  (7  ft/sec])  at 56.8 m³/min  (15,000  gpm),  and  the  velocity  in  the  waterline  will  be  approximately  1.7 m/sec  (5.5 ft/sec) at 45.4 m³/min (12,000 gpm). Due to the elevated level of chlorides in the water, high-density polyethylene  (HDPE)  pipe  was  selected  as  the  pipe  material.  The  proposed  waterline  includes 762 cm (30 inch) internal diameter (ID) HDPE standard dimension ratio (SDR) 11 pipe.

The waterline installation will include open-cut trenching as well as trenchless installation. A majority of the waterline will be installed via open-cut trenching. Waterlines installed at the river and water way crossings will be installed using horizontal directional drilling (HDD) to avoid impacts to waters of the  U.S.,  which  would  require  additional  U.S.  Army  Corps  of  Engineers  (USACE)  permitting. Waterlines installed under highways and railroads will be installed using auger boring or pipe jacking and include steel casings.

It  is  anticipated  that  construction  operations  will  have  a  major  impact  on  the  existing  gravel  road along the waterline alignment, that the road will need to be completely rebuilt, and that the vegetation along the sides of the road will  need  to  be  re-established.  This  work  will  be  coordinated  with  the Counties through which the waterline will occupy right-of-way.

NioCorp has obtained a perpetual easement for the east end of the waterline at the Missouri River and  may  need  to  acquire  additional  lands  along  the  waterline  route  for  pumping  stations  located along the route and to avoid impacting the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) dam near U.S. Highway 75. It is assumed that the remaining portion of the waterline will primarily occupy county right-of-way.

## Automatic Air Relief Valves

To evacuate air that may accumulate in the waterline, automatic air relief valves are anticipated at high points along the waterline alignment. It has been assumed that one automatic air relief valve station (including the valve and below grade vault) will be installed at every mile along the waterline. The number of automatic air relief valves will be further evaluated once final design is authorized to proceed.

## Surge Protection within Waterline

Surge  protection  along  the  waterline  will  be  provided  and  includes  an  assumption  that  surge protection  devices  will  include  a  combination  of  pressure/surge  relief  valves,  pressurized  surge tanks, pump station bypasses, and/or surge towers. It is anticipated that one surge control device will be required between each of the booster stations for a total of four surge protection devices. The exact  number  and  type  of  surge  protection  devices  will  be  further  evaluated  through  additional hydraulic modeling once the final design is authorized to proceed.

## Booster Pump Stations

The pump station design includes a pre-packaged building with four vertical turbine pumps piped in parallel with variable frequency drives (VFD), controls, electrical panels, and support equipment. One of the pumps is designated as a back-up and the others will be utilized based upon flow conditions. The station will be pre-wired and tested prior to installation.

A  total  of  five  booster  pump  stations  are  currently  anticipated.  Two  stations  will  have  four  600 horsepower (hp) pumps at 106.68 m (350 ft) total dynamic head (TDH), two stations will have four 350 hp pumps at 61 m (200 ft) TDH, and one station will have six 200 hp pumps at 61 m (200 ft) TDH, for a total of five stations.

At 56.8 m³/min (15,000 gpm) the four pump booster stations will have three pumps operating with one  standby  pump,  and  the  six  pump  booster  station  will  have  five  pumps  operating  with  one standby pump. At 45.4 m³/min (12,000 gpm), the four pump booster stations will have a maximum of three  pumps operating at a reduced speed with one pump as standby and the six pump booster station  will  have  a  maximum  of  four  pumps  operating  with  two  pumps  as  standby.  The  pump operational plan and total number of pumps running versus number of available standby pumps will be evaluated and modified as design progresses.

The pre-packaged station, concrete footings, pump station installation, site clearing and grading, and site fencing are included in the cost for the pump stations. Additional modeling will be performed and the number of pump stations and sizing will be refined once final design is authorized to proceed with the goal of reducing the total number of pump stations required.

Permanent  electrical  service  will  be  required  at  each  of  the  four  pump  stations  along  the  pipe alignment. Generally, existing overhead power is available along the waterline route. The supply of this power will be coordinated with Omaha Public Power District (OPPD), the local power supplier, during detailed Project design.

It is anticipated that each of the pump stations will require the purchase of 0.2 hectare (0.5 acre) for locating the pump station building, backup generator, and general circulation to operate and maintain each facility. Figure 18-7 shows a typical booster station layout.

## Control Valves

It is anticipated that one control valve will be provided at each pump station. The control valve will be utilized  to  sustain  pressure,  reduce  pressure,  or  recirculate  flow.  Additional  modeling  will  further define the function of the control valve at each location.

## Backup Emergency Power

Backup emergency power will be provided at each booster pump station. It is anticipated that each generator  will  be  an  1,800  kW  diesel  generator  set,  480  volt,  3-phase  with  a  sound  attenuated weatherproof steel enclosure and a 7,570-liter (2,000-gallon) sub-base fuel tank rated for 24 hours at 100%  load.  Controls,  automatic  transfer  switch,  charging  system,  and  concrete  footings  will  be provided at each pump station. One generator set is anticipated at each station, except for the mine site pump station that will be powered by the mine site emergency power.

## Mixing Diffuser at River Discharge

A  study  has  been  performed  by  MixZon  Inc.  to  size  the  mixing  diffuser  structure  at  the  Missouri River. The diffuser structure includes a pre-fabricated diffuser assembly that will be installed within the  Missouri  River.  The  diffuser  assembly  is  to  be  of  the  submerged  multiport  configuration.  The general arrangement of the assembly is a 10 m (32.8 ft) long staged multiport diffuser. A total of six risers  are  to  be  equally  spaced  along  the  10  m  (32.8  ft)  length  with  duckbill  style  check  valves mounted on the risers and pointing offshore in a fanned design. A detailed design of the diffuser assembly  including  river  installation  design  will  be  performed  once  final  design  of  this  item  is authorized. Figure 18-1 shows the mixing diffuser. A lower cost diffuser mechanism may ultimately be utilized as detailed engineering and permitting progress.

## Design and Construction Period

## Design Period

The overall design period is anticipated to take 34 weeks or 238 days from Notice to Proceed (NTP) and is summarized as follows:

- · Preliminary Design:
- o Hydraulic  modeling  can  begin  within  1  to  2  weeks  of  NTP  and  is  expected  to  be completed within 8 weeks of initiation.
- o Remainder of preliminary design can begin in 1 week +/- of NTP and is expected to be completed within 9 weeks of initiation.
- · Survey:
- o Survey can begin in 3 weeks of NTP and is expected to be completed within 8 weeks of initiation.
- o Booster station locations need to be finalized before survey can be completed, which is tied to the hydraulic modeling.
- · Geotechnical:
- · Geotechnical soil borings can begin in 3 weeks of NTP and is expected to be completed within  4  to  5  weeks.  Laboratory  testing  is  expected  to  be  completed  within  3  weeks  of completion  of  drilling.  The  report  is  expected  to  be  completed  within  3  to  4  weeks  of completion of laboratory testing.
- o Booster  station  locations  need  to  be  finalized  before  geotechnical  borings  can  be completed, which is tied to the hydraulic modeling.
- · Final Design:
- o Final design can begin as soon as preliminary design is completed and is expected to be completed within 21 weeks.

## Procurement

Since  the  Project  will  discharge  into  the  Missouri  River  and  will  require  a  National  Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit through the Nebraska Department of Environmental Quality (NDEQ), it is anticipated that 100% designs will need to be developed and submitted to the NDEQ for approval and issuance of a construction permit. It is anticipated the Project will be bid concurrent  to  the  NDEQ  review.  Once  bids  are  received  and  the  construction  permit  is  issued, Project construction can commence.

## Construction Period

The overall construction period is anticipated to take 12 to 18 months after awarding the Project and is summarized as follows:

- · Current conversations with pump station vendors indicate that pump station fabrication and delivery could take up to 8 months. In addition, we have confirmed that we can match pumps if two vendors are considered. It is estimated that utilization of multiple vendors may result in a month of schedule reduction. However, at this time it is anticipated that construction of the pump station component of this Project will require a year including fabrication, delivery, and installation. A goal of the final design task will be to refine hydraulic analysis in an attempt to reduce the number pump stations required, which could reduce the construction schedule.

- · Pipe installation has been estimated at one year based upon multiple crews installing the trenchless portions of the Project and multiple crews installing the open cut portions of the Project. It is not advisable to consider anything less than 1 year and it is recommended to consider 15 to 18 months to account for conditions such as a harsh winter or wet spring conditions.
- · The  mixing  structure/diffuser  is  anticipated  to  require  5  months  to  fabricate  and  install. Timing of installation will need to account for lower flow conditions in the Missouri River.

## 18.10  Tailings Surface Logistics

The tailings will be transported by conveyor from the Hydromet Building to a temporary staging area, which will have concrete containment and will be sheltered by a tensioned-fabric over steel framing structure.  Slag  will  be  transported  from  the  Pyromet  Building  by  truck  or  skid  loader  to  the  same temporary staging area. The material will be transported by truck to the tailings storage facility or utilized  for  paste  backfill  by  the  surface  paste  backfill  plant,  once  the  slag  has  been  properly characterized for use in the backfill application.

## 18.11  Tailing Storage and Associated Facilities

Preliminary investigations performed by SRK included a comparison of potential TSF sites for both slurry  and  filtered  (dewatered)  tailings  disposal  options.  This  comparison  considered  potential engineering, strategic, permitting and closure issues, including:

- · Engineering:  Containment  area,  required  reclaim  for  negative  water  balance  on  tailings impoundment,  relative  embankment  heights,  distance  to  plant,  pumping  head  for  slurry (plant  to  impoundment)  and  reclaim  water  (impoundment  to  plant),  upstream  stormwater management,  major  road  crossings,  potential  residential  relocations,  and  potential  road relocations;
- · Strategic:  Proximity  to  major  roadways,  churches  and  cemeteries,  visual  embankment heights, and property ownership;
- · Permitting: Major drainage crossings and major road encroachment; and
- · Closure: Closure cover areas and volumes, seepage potential, and mass stability.

Of  eight  potential  sites,  Area  7  and  Area  1  ranked  first  and  second  for  both  slurried  and  filtered tailings.  This  evaluation  included  development  and  implementation  of  a  preliminary  foundation characterization  plan  for  both  Area  1  and  Area  7,  and  development  of  preliminary  water  balance spreadsheets for both slurried and filtered tailings options for both sites.

Following development of the 2015 PEA, the decision was made to only generate dry tailings, by calcining and filtration processes, and a more detailed foundation characterization investigation was performed for Area 7. Additional data revealed that the full stream of filtered tailings would be used for underground backfill operations, limiting the total tailings tonnage to be disposed of in the TSF to around 1,070 dry t/d for a life of 32 years (as opposed to 4,930 t/d for 30 years).

This significant decrease in deposition rate, as well as the finding that the predominantly calcined tailings  material  will  be  a  dry  'clinker',  with  a  sandy  gravel  or  gravelly  sand  gradation  (i.e.,  well drained) resulted in NioCorp's direction to SRK to evaluate the Plant Site (refer Cells 1, 2 and 3 in Figure  18-11)  as  feasible  tailings  storage  and  stormwater  management  locations  for  the  first  19 years of operations, with the following significant advantages:

- · No Elk Creek access road and conveyor crossings;
- · Shorter distance from Plant Area for tailings transport and reclaim water management;
- · Reduction in storm water management; and
- · Consolidation of disturbance into a much smaller area (than Area 7).

The Plant Area was therefore considered the best option for the first 19 years of management and storage of tailings dry  tailings  (in  three  State-approved  solid  waste  facilities),  and  management  of precipitation  contacting  the  tailings  via  runoff  and  infiltration  in  separate  double-lined  'leachate collection ponds'. Once the Plant Site cells are full, a new facility will be constructed at Area 7.

The feasibility design incorporates the following parameters and details:

- a. Topography: Feasibility design has been performed using 1 m contoured topography.
- b. Feasibility Design: Feasibility design of the TSFs is based on dam safety regulations, solid waste regulations (including tailings placement/compaction/interim covering), leachate water management regulations, and radioactive licensing regulations, all discussed in Section 20. The  design  is  intended  to  demonstrate  compliance  with  Nebraska  industrial  solid  waste Regulations  for  Design,  Operation  and  Closure  and  is  based  on  a  meeting  held  between NioCorp, SRK and Nebraska Department of Environmental Quality Solid (NDEQ).
- c. Embankment Cross-Section: All TSF and LCP embankment sections will incorporate a 20 m crest width and 3 (horizontal) to 1 (vertical) side slopes as shown in Figure 18-10 and Figure 18-12. Vegetation of the embankment crests and downstream sideslopes will be provided for erosion protection, immediately after construction completion of each embankment.
- d. Leachate Collection Ponds: Each of the three leachate collection ponds will be utilized for management of precipitation runoff and drainage from the tailings solids, and will be lined with  two  layers  of  geosynthetic  liner  (primary  and  secondary),  sandwiching  a  permeable spacer that allows evacuation of all leakage through the primary liner to be collected in a lined 'sump' area and pumped back into the Leachate Collection Pond, thereby providing a means of long-term leakage control as shown on Figure 18-13. This approach is known as a Leakage Collection and Recovery System (LCRS).
- e. Tailings  Production  Rate:  The  tailings  production  rate  is  an  average  of  2,460  dry  t/d consisting  of  825  dry  t/d  of  water  leach  residue  tailings,  1,588  dry  t/d  of  calcined  excess oxide tailings, and 46 t/d of slag. Of this, an average of 1,390 dry t/d will be placed into the mine  back  fill  (Section  18.12)  and  1,070  dry  t/d  will  be  deposited  in  the  TSF.  Testing performed  on  the  excess  and  insoluble  oxides  indicate  that  a  loose  (non-compacted)  dry density of 1.6 t/m 3 will occur, and placement and spreading of the dry tailings will increase the density to between 1.7 and 1.8 t/m 3 .
- f. Growth  Media  Salvage:  A  minimum  of  1  m  of  subbase  soils  will  be  removed  prior  to construction of the TSF and stockpiled at the locations shown on Figure 18-9, as follows:
- o For Plant Site Cell 1 the topsoil will be stockpile in the Plant Site Cell 3 footprint;
- o For  Plant  Site  Cell  2  and  Cell  3  topsoil  will  be  stockpiled  in  the  footprint  of  the Temporary Waste Rock Stockpile (which will have ended its design life and been removed to Plant Site Cell 1 as described in Section 18.8; and
- o For Area 7 Cell 1 topsoil will be stockpiled in the specified location in Area 7.
- g. TSF Area, Storage and Time Characteristics: The TSF system includes four TSF cells, Plant Site Cell 1, Cell 2 and Cell 3 and Area 7 Cell 1. Table 18-5 provides a summary of TSF cell footprint areas, storage characteristics and time periods.

## h. Leachate Collection Pond (LCP) Storage Characteristics

The LCP system includes three ponds; one for Plant Site Cell 1 (LCP-1), one for Plant Site Cells  2  and  3  (LCP-2)  and  one  for  Area  7  Cell  1  (Area  7-LCP).  Table  18-6  provides  a summary of LCP footprint areas, and leachate and stormwater storage characteristics.

Table 18-6: LCP Area, Storage and Time Characteristics

| LCP        |   Approximate Footprint Area  (Ha) | Total Storage Capacity  (1)   (m 3 )   |
|------------|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| LCP-1      |                                0.9 | 29,200                                 |

- i. Structural  Embankment  Foundation  Preparation:  Foundation  preparation  for  all  TSF  and LCP embankments will incorporate removal of a minimum of 0.5 m of native soils, and recompaction in layers to form a non-settling structure as shown on Figure 18-10 and Figure 18-12.
- j. Embankment Compaction:  All  TSF  and  LCP  embankments  will  be  constructed  using  soil borrowed from within the respective TSF basins, and compacted in layers to form a nonsettling structure as shown on Figure 18-10 and Figure 18-12.
- k. Embankment  Raises:  All  tailings  embankments  will  be  constructed  to  completion  before each cell is commissioned as shown in Table 18-7, thereby eliminating the need for raising, extension of the TSF liner and embankment drainage elements at any stage. This assists in preventing the facility from being affected by potential liquefaction of the tailings solids under seismic loads.
- l. TSF Liner and Above-Liner Drainage System: The components of the facility liner/drainage systems are described below and shown in Figure 18-10 through Figure 18-13
- i. The TSF basins and inside embankment sideslopes will incorporate:
- (1)  A minimum of 2 ft of glacial till, amended as necessary with bentonite, and compacted in layers to result in a hydraulic conductivity of less than or equal to 1x10 -7 cm/s;
- (2)  An 80-mil high-density polyethylene (HDPE) geosynthetic liner placed over the low-permeability basin and inside embankment sideslopes; and
- (3)  For  Plant  Site  Cell  1,  an  above-liner  centralized  drain  (i.e.,  from  north  to south) directing drain flows into an above-liner, double-lined, leak-detected sump that facilitates pumping into LCP 1.

- (4)  For Plant Site Cells 2 and 3 and Area 7 Cell 1, above-liner embankment toe drains  (along  entire  inside  perimeter),  as  well  as  respective  centralized drains, that gravitate drain flows into above-liner, double-lined, leak-detected sumps that facilitates pumping into LCP 2 and Area 7 LCP, respectively.
- (5)  Typical drain sections are provided on Figure 18-11 for the centralized drain (Plant Site Cells 1, 2 and 3), and the perimeter inside toe drains (Plant Site Cells 2 and 3 and Area 7 Cell 1).
- ii. Lining for LCP Basins and Inside Sideslopes: LCP basins and inside embankment sideslopes, as well as the leak collection and recovery system (LCRS) sumps within the TSF cells, will incorporate:
-  A minimum of 2 ft of glacial till, amended as necessary with bentonite, and compacted in layers to result in a hydraulic conductivity of less than or equal to 1x10 -7 cm/s;
-  A 60-mil HDPE secondary liner incorporating a DrainLiner system or Geonet layer above the geosynthetic liner;
-  An 80-mil high-density polyethylene (HDPE) primary liner;
- The DrainLiner or Geonet layers will gravitate into a LCRS sump that facilitates pumping of  collected  seepage  water  back  into  the  LCPs  via  a  submersible  pump  and  riser pipeline arrangement. As shown on Figure 18-13, the riser pipeline will be contained in a 'port'  pipeline  installed  between  the  two  liners.  The  LCRS  sumps  are  gravel-filled facilities between the primary and secondary liners, with the horizontal base of the riser pipe perforated within the gravel for leakage collection and recovery.
- m.  Tailings  Solids  Transportation  and  Deposition:  A  cost  tradeoff  study  was  performed  to compare trucking to conveying costs, and trucking is the preferred option. Tailings' solids will be trucked from the process plant directly to each planned deposition location at the TSFs, dumped, spread and compacted using a bulldozer, and graded to slope in a predetermined direction to facilitate control of surface water. Tailings will be placed in sections in the cells starting at the high point in the base grading and working toward the sumps. Each cell will be closed in phases every 3 to 4 years, once the full depth of tailings has been achieved in each section, as described in Section 20.5.
- i. For Plant Site Cell 1 and Area 7 Cell 1, tailings placement will be performed from south to north.
- ii. For Plant Site Cell 2 and 3, tailings placement will be performed from north to south.
- n. TSF  Stage-Area-Capacity  Data:  These  are  provided  in  Table  18-7  and  indicate  TSF elevation,  area,  cumulative  volume,  capacity  in  tonnes,  time  in  years  and  rate  of  rise  in meters per year.
- o. Surface  Water  Management:  Surface  water  management  comprises  both  precipitationinduced contact water and non-contact water.
- 1. Surface water contacting the tailings will be managed  via  dedicated pump arrangements  for  all  three  cells  that  comprise  slotted  HDPE  riser  pipes  located above  the  liner  system  at  the  impoundment  low  topography  on  the  embankment inside  slopes.  Submersible  pumps  will  be  used  to  pump  collected  water  into  the LCPs.  The  submersible  pumps  will  be  maintained  above  the  current  tailings elevation at all times. The locations of the riser pipes are shown on Figure 18-9. Any  infiltrating  surface  water  will  be  collected  in  the  TSF  above-liner  drainage system.

- 2. Average rainfall is shown in Table 18-8. Based on the average monthly precipitation, pump back from the TSF underdrainage system has been estimated:
- · For Plant Site Cell 1 at an average of 36 gpm varying between 64 gpm and 11 gpm,
- · For Plant Site Cell 2 at an average of 58 gpm varying between 104 gpm and 18 gpm, and
- · For Plant Site Cell 3 at an average of 57 gpm varying between 102 gpm and 18 gpm.
- · For Area 7 Cell 1 at an average of 100 gpm varying between 175 gpm and 30 gpm.
- 3. Storm related precipitation depths are provided for 25-year and 100-year, 24 hour duration  storms  in  Table  18-4.  Based  on  100-year  precipitation  depth,  the  pump back requirements for the 100-year condition is estimated to require 115 gpm from Plant Site Cell 1, 190 gpm from both Plant Site Cells 2 and 3, and 373 gpm from Area 7 Cell 1.
- 4. Non-contact surface water will be managed via channels, spillways, and culverts as described in Section 18.9.1 and shown on Figure 18-4. Spillways are sized to pass the PMF  storm event and all other stormwater controls are designed to accommodate 100-year, 24-hour storm event precipitation.

## 18.12 Paste Backfill Plant and Underground Reticulation

## 18.12.1 Surface Plant

The backfill system at the Elk Creek Mine was designed to make paste from leach residue and oxide material  produced  by  the  Hydromet  plant.  The  paste  formulation  tests  were  carried  out  in  SGS Lakefield, Ontario between March and July 2017. The test mixes met or exceeded the 1 MPa at 28day mining requirement using 5% binder.

A  calcination  pilot  program  carried  out  at  Hazen  Lab  in  Golden,  Colorado  suggested  that  the formation  of  Srebrodolskite  (Ca2Fe2O5)  significantly  reduces  the  CaO  content  in  the  oxide  solids. This allowed the backfill system to utilize the oxide as a source of solids without having a self-heating issue due to the exothermic reaction from hydrating CaO.

The paste plant receives 28.1 t/h of the leach residue filter cake, and up to 70 t/h of the oxide solids for making paste backfill. The leach residue filter cake is expected to have 20% to 25% moisture and the oxide solids are completely dry (due to the high temperature calcination process). If required, the oxide solids will be crushed to minus 2 mm, with a suitable particle size distribution, before they are used. The crushing process needs to be a dry process to avoid introducing excessive water content into the paste mix. The filter cake is fed to a conveyor belt with a live bottom feeder, while the dry oxide  solids  are  stored  in  a  silo  before  they  are  fed  to  the  mixer.  The  system  has  a  nominal production of 37.8 m 3 /h or 81.9 wet t/h. This is the rate required to keep up with the voids created underground. The design production rate is 62.4 m 3 /h or 137.8 wet t/h. This design rate allows the paste plant to catch up (at a throughput of 65% over the nominal rate). At the design rate, the backfill system can complete filling the daily void created underground in 14.5 hours. However, the system is expected  to  run  continuously  once  the  stopes  become  available  for  backfill,  except  for  planned maintenance.

## 18.12.2 Underground Reticulation

The  paste  is  pumped  underground  with  a  positive  displacement  pump.  The  pipeline  enters  the underground just outside of the backfill plant to avoid interfering with surface operations. This also eliminates any interactions with the waterway.

A 6 inch borehole connects the backfill plant and the underground backfill station at about 65 degree inclination from horizontal. From the underground backfill station, the paste goes to the stope in 6' Schedule 80 carbon steel pipe. Sill plugs will be required at the base of each paste pour in order to protect the paste barricades from overloading. The sill plugs typically extend from the bottom of the stope to roughly 2 m above the drawpoint brow. This ensures the maximum loading on the barricade is kept under 200 kPa.

Rupture  spools  are  used  to  manage  any  unexpected  high  pressure  in  the  pipeline.  The  paste  is directed from the rupture point to a sump for safety and easy clean-up. A spill detector senses the paste in the sump and transmits the information to the control room in the backfill plant. Water proof cameras with night vision are used to monitor the underground backfill operation.

## 18.12.3 Capital and Operating Cost

The pre-production capital for the paste plant and infrastructure is estimated at US$12.58 million. A 15%  contingency  (US$1.88  million)  is  included  in  Feasibility  Technical  Economic  Model.  The operating costs are estimated at US$8.29/t ore mined (average over LoM).

## 18.12.4 Opportunities

Binder costs are typically the single largest component of the operating cost in a backfill system. At Elk Creek the unique combination of leach residues and oxide wastes results in exceptional backfill strengths  at  very  low  binder  contents.  However,  all  backfill  systems  provide  opportunities  for optimization  of  mix  designs  to  lower  operating  costs.  The  slag  produced  from  the  mill  can  also potentially be analyzed and used as a binder or for sale.

## 19 Market Studies and Contracts

## 19.1  Market Studies

Market  studies  for  niobium,  titanium  dioxide  and  scandium  trioxide  are  an  important  part  of  the proposed  Elk  Creek  operation.  These  commodities,  especially  niobium  and  scandium  trioxide (scandium), are thinly traded without an established publically available price discovery mechanism. Hence, detailed third party market studies provide the basis for assumptions used in the economic analysis.

## 19.1.1 Niobium

As part of its scope for the Project, SRK carried out a Niobium Marketing Study in Q2 2017 at the request of NioCorp (SRK, 2017a) from which the following information in this section is taken.

Commercial  trade  of  niobium  occurs  in  a  number  of  forms,  the  most  common  of  which  is ferroniobium. Ferroniobium is sold most commonly as steel grade (65% Nb content) as well as a higher purity technical grade.

## Supply

The niobium market is generally described as an oligopoly with three major producers dominating supply.  These  three  producers  are  Companhia  Brasileira  de  Metalurgia  e  Mineração  (CBMM), Niobec and China Molybdenum Co. Ltd (CMOC). However, in practical terms, the market operates like a monopoly with a single company (CBMM) setting the price and the other operations acting as price takers. In addition, CBMM performs its own research and development activities to evaluate additional  /  increasing  usage  of  niobium  which  provides  a  significant  benefit  for  other  market participants.  In  terms  of  ferroniobium  production,  Table  19-1  shows  reported  annual  production capacity from the three largest mine operations along with the Project's estimates.

Table 19-1: Comparison of Project vs. Selected Niobium Producers

| Mine/Project   | Owner            | Country   | Reserves  (Est.)                                                | Annual Ferroniobium  Production  (Est.)         |
|----------------|------------------|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Araxa (OP)     | CBMM             | Brazil    | 800 Mt @ 2.5% Nb2O5  (weathered)  900 Mt @ 1.57% Nb2O5  (fresh) | 90,000 t/y;  150,000 t/y  expansion in progress |
| Niobec (UG)    | Magris Resources | Canada    | 46 Mt @ 0.53% Nb2O5                                             | 5,000 t/y  expansion plans not clear            |

## Demand

Niobium demand showed a strong profile of growth over almost 20 years from the early 1990's to late 2000's, greatly exceeding growth rates in steel demand (Figure 19-1: ).

<!-- image -->

Source: CBMM, 2013

However, the overall trend in demand since that time has been flat overall. SRK is of the opinion that the drivers behind the flattening of demand growth in niobium are due to three primary factors:

- · CBMM rebasing the niobium price significantly higher in the late 2000's;
- · The global financial crisis of 2008 damaging global demand for all products; and
- · Decreasing rate of taking market share from some industry sectors such as automotive and pipeline.

SRK is of the opinion that demand growth for niobium usage will again outperform overall growth in demand  for  steel  (which  is  more  closely  tied  to  GDP  growth).  This  is  due  to  the  following assumptions:

- · Increased use in structural applications;
- · Continued  increases  in  market  share  in  automotive  applications,  albeit  at  a  reduced  rate from that seen in the 2000's;
- · Continued development of advanced new alloys and microalloys utilizing niobium; and
- · Continued development of new pipelines as oil and gas are produced from regions distant from  traditional  production  areas  (and  associated  refining  capacity).  This  includes  areas such as the Bakken shale gas field of North Dakota and oil shale regions of northern Alberta.

At  the  same  time,  other  primary  demand  sectors  for  niobium  will  be  maintained  such  as  on  the superalloy  side  where  the  718  superalloy  continues  to  be  utilized  in  the  newest  jet  engines  and global growth of the aeronautical industry remains robust. Some demand in sectors such as power

generation may fall off as typical steam or gas fired turbines from nuclear, natural gas or coal fired power may decrease, but this demand can be offset as niobium is also utilized in some renewable energy sources such as towers for wind turbines.

SRK therefore is of the opinion that it  is  reasonable  to  utilize  an  average  of  a  5%  growth  rate  in niobium demand going forward.

## Pricing

Recent price trends for 65% ferroniobium (pricing basis anticipated for NioCorp) are shown in Figure 19-2. Notably, there has been a slight downward trend in the US Dollar price since 2011. However, in terms of Brazilian Real, CBMM's base currency, the price actually increased over this time period. This indicates that although there may have been a slight decrease on a US Dollar basis, CBMM was potentially more profitable and could therefore allow the price to slip slightly.

Source: Metal Pages

Future prices of niobium are highly dependent upon the intention of CBMM. The company has the ability to flood the market with low cost production, dropping the price and driving out its competitors. This will  be  especially  true  once  it  finalizes  its  expansion  that  is  currently  underway.  However,  to date,  CBMM has shown a tolerance for other producers and has dropped its production levels to maintain a stable price. SRK is of the opinion that it has adopted this strategy as it allows for higher profitability and also provides additional comfort to downstream consumers that there is more than one supplier, encouraging additional demand.

The  economic  analysis  in  this  report  used  the  recommended  real  2017  US  dollar  base  price  of US$40/kg Nb as the forward looking price for steel grade (65%) ferroniobium. This price is slightly higher  than  spot,  but  SRK  is  of  the  opinion  that  the  recovering  Brazilian  Real,  combined  with increasing steel demand, will push the price back to the US$40/kg Nb level.

The key risk to achieving this price is the intent of the Brazilian producers as they have the potential to flood the market to depress the price and stop development of new Nb projects like Elk Creek. It is noted that the Brazilian producers have not taken such drastic actions during the decades that they have held a preeminent market position. SRK is of the opinion that this is not likely though given the limited production volumes (10% of global market of less) proposed by NioCorp.

## 19.1.2 Titanium Dioxide

No  formal  market  study  was  done  for  titanium  dioxide  (TiO2)  during  the  report  period  as  it  only represents 2% of overall revenue in the economic analysis. All market information for titanium and titanium  dioxide  is  derived  from  USGS  Commodity  Market  Summaries  (Bedinger,  2016)  and  the internal SRK price database.

TiO2  is  used  extensively  as  paint  pigment  with  some  minor,  though  increasing,  demand  from  the aerospace  industry  as  an  alloy  in  next  generation  aircraft.  Average  domestic  US  consumption  in 2015  was  747,000 t  of  which  242,000 t  was  imported.  With  the  Project  producing  approximately 11,500 t TiO2 per year during LoM, it is assumed that this annual production volume can easily be absorbed into the domestic market.

The  economic  analysis  assumes  a  constant  long-term  price  of  US$0.88/kg  based  on  rutile concentrate FOB Australia benchmark with no discounts. This is supported by SRK's subscription Consensus  Market  Forecast  (CMF),  produced  quarterly  by  Consensus  Economics,  which  shows long  term  pricing  trends  in  the  mid  to  high  eighties  range  as  shown  in  Table  19-2.  Although  the market  is  well-established  and  mature,  the  key  risk  to  maintaining  this  price  is  domestic  US  and global economic growth.

Table 19-2: Long Term TiO2 Pricing Trend (Rutile Concentrate FOB Australia Benchmark)

## 19.1.3 Scandium Trioxide

NioCorp engaged OnG Commodities LLC (OnG) to produce a preliminary market assessment for scandium which was first published in July 2015 (OnG, 2015). This study formed the basis for the economic  analysis  undertaken  in  the  2015  PEA.  For  this  study,  the  market  assessment  was subsequently updated by OnG in April 2017 (OnG, 2017) from which the following information in this section is taken.

The  studies  examine  current  scandium  production  trends  (~20 t/y)  from  existing  and  emerging producers plus an outlook for supply to 2028. The outlook then reviews the current and emerging applications  for  scandium  including  fuel  cells,  aerospace,  industrial  and  other  uses  plus  and  an outlook for demand to 2028.

Based on these inputs, OnG then gives pricing forecasts and global demand volumes by year to 2028  based  estimated  production  costs  and  supply-demand  balances.  These  forecasts,  plus  the Project's  estimated  annual  scandium  production  volumes,  are  shown  in  Table  19-3  and  in  Figure 19-3.

Source: SRK after OnG, 2017

The OnG (2017) scandium price forecast does incorporate a 25% price drop in the 2022-23 period due  to  oversupply  which  is  appropriate.  The  Project  is  anticipated  to  come  online  in  2021  and produce 102 t in 2022 and 86 t in 2023 which contributes to the oversupply in that period. It is only

an expected growth in demand that the oversupply situation is remediated and the price starts to rise steadily again to US$3,750/kg in 2028 as demand outstrips supply resulting in a projected shortage of 140 t a year by then.

In SRK's opinion, the scandium supply/demand balance and price projections are the key risks to the Project's  viability.  Currently  most  of  the  scandium  production  is  from  China  which  does  not  have transparency in reserves and cost reporting. If production from other parts of the world (RoW) and Russia begins to take off as projected, it is not clear whether Chinese or even Russian production will not increase and keep new entrants from entering the market. Conversely, if the entrance of a few new producers to the market stimulates demand, and the new entrants and existing producers cannot  meet  that  demand,  pricing  could  conceivably  increase  over  the  estimates  provided  in  the OnG market report.

## 19.2  Contracts and Status

At  the  time  of  the  report,  NioCorp  has  entered  into  two  offtake  agreements  covering  ferroniobium production  from  the  Project.  Each  agreement  has  a  10  year  term  which,  when  combined,  means 75% of the projected production is contracted at a 3.75% discount to the quoted Metal Pages price (unless a premium can be achieved by the offtake customers, which is uncertain).

No  offtake  agreements  have  been  executed  at  the  time  of  the  report  for  titanium  dioxide  and scandium trioxide products from the Project. It is assumed these will be sold on a spot price, ex-mine gate basis.

No  definitive  supplier  contracts  for  major  services  such  as  power,  natural  gas,  etc.,  have  been executed at the time of this report.

## 20 Environmental Studies, Permitting and Social or Community Impact

## 20.1  Environmental Studies

## 20.1.1 Soils

According to the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), soils in the vicinity of the Project are primarily comprised of clay, silty clay, silt loam, and clay loam within an ecological site that is typified as 'Rangeland'. For all soil types, the depth to any soil restrictive layer is more than 200 cm below ground surface (bgs) and the infiltration is generally 'slow' to 'very slow'. Soils in the area are generally eroded and range in slopes from 2% to 30%, with the majority of the area having slopes of between 6% and 11%. (NRCS, 2015)

## 20.1.2 Climate/Meteorology/Air Quality

A dedicated meteorological station was installed at Elk Creek in July 2014. Parameter measurements included in the overall instrument package include:

- · Wind Speed;
- · Wind Direction;
- · Temperature;
- · Temperature Difference;
- · Dew Point Temperature;
- · Precipitation;
- · Pressure; and
- · Solar Radiation.

The data  thus  far  collected  include  more  than  two  years  of  continuous  monitoring  that  has  been audited  by  a  third  party,  and  can  subsequently  be  used  in  air  quality  modeling  and  permitting.  A continuation  of  data  review  will  be  conducted  on  a  monthly  basis,  as  specified  in  Meteorological Monitoring Plan, and a final review will  be  necessary  prior  to  submittal  for  inclusion  in  dispersion modeling.

In September 2016, NioCorp met with the Nebraska Department of Environmental Quality (NDEQ) regarding the on-site air monitoring program and the air quality permit application process. It was decided that the ambient monitoring program needed to include PM2.5 data collection, in light of the attention that this parameter has been given recently by the U.S. EPA. PM2.5 monitoring was initiated at the Elk Creek site in February 2017; a PM10, monitor was added in March 2017, along with colocated PM2.5, and monitoring for four gasses including CO, NOx, SOx and ozone (O3).

## 20.1.3 Cultural and Archeological Resources

There  were  at  least  15  Native  American  tribes  that  have  inhabited  the  Great  Plains  region  now incorporated  in  the  State  of  Nebraska,  including  the  Kansa  and  Otoe  tribes  of  southeastern Nebraska. Of these original inhabitants, there are four federally recognized Indian tribes that remain in Nebraska today, including:

- · Omaha Tribe of Nebraska;
- · Winnebago Tribe of Nebraska;
- · Iowa Tribe of Kansas and Nebraska;
- · Ponca Tribe of Nebraska; and
- · Santee Sioux Tribe of Nebraska.

Reservations associated with these tribes are located in the northeastern part of the state, over 200 km to the north of Elk Creek.

The Otoe Tribe once lived south of the Platte River in the region of the proposed mine, but in 1881, sold  all  of  their  land  in  Nebraska  to  the  federal  government  and  moved  to  Indian  Territory  (now Oklahoma). No direct tribal consultation appears to be necessary at this time.

In January 2017, Cultural Resources Consulting of Hickman, Nebraska (CRC)  conducted archeological resources investigations within the proposed area of potential effect (APE), including the proposed mine Project area and the waterline corridor to the Missouri River. The investigation was intended to determine if there are known archeological sites recorded, or currently unknown, but potentially significant cultural resources that may be impacted within the defined APE. As currently designed,  no  significant  archeological  resources  will  be  impacted  by  construction  of  the  NioCorp mine and processing area, the evaporation pond and tailings impoundment area, or installation of the waterline. It is recommended that no further Historic Preservation compliance actions are warranted and the Project be allowed to proceed as currently planned. (CRC, 2017) During construction, the Project will still be subject to the provisions of the Nebraska Unmarked Human Skeletal Remains and Burial Goods Protection Act .

## 20.1.4 Vegetation

Cultivated  crop  land  (principally  corn,  soy,  and  alfalfa)  makes  up  the  majority  of  the  surface  area within  the  Project  boundary.  Native  and  non-agricultural  vegetation  exist  primarily  in  the  form  of hedgerows and windbreaks along field margins, and in riparian areas along surface water drainages. According  to  ecosite  descriptions  from  the  NRCS  (2015),  plant  communities  within  the  vicinity  of Project  consist  of  annual  and  perennial  weedy  forbs  and  less  desirable  grasses  from  abandoned farmland,  as  well  as  big  bluestem  ( Andropogon  gerardii ),  smooth  brome  ( Bromus  inermis ),  tall fescue  ( Schedonorus  arundinaceus ),  switchgrass  ( Panicum  virgatum ),  Indiangrass  ( Sorghastrum nutans ), sideoats  grama  ( Bouteloua  curtipendula ), little bluestem  ( Schizachyrium  scoparium ), Scribner's rosette grass ( Dichanthelium oligosanthes var. scribnerianum ), porcupinegrass ( Hesperostipa spartea ), sedge ( Carex ), leadplant ( Amorpha canescens ), eastern redcedar ( Quercus macrocarpa ), honey locust ( Gleditsia triacanthos ), and smooth sumac ( Rhus glabra ).

## 20.1.5 Wildlife

According to Schneider et. al. (2011) the Project is located in Nebraska's Tallgrass Prairie Ecoregion which is home to more than 300 species of resident and migratory birds and 55 mammal species, most of which can also be found in central and western Nebraska. The small mammal fauna of the Tallgrass Prairie Ecoregion consist of species such as the plains pocket gopher ( Geomys bursarius ), prairie  vole  ( Microtus  ochrogaster ),  thirteen-lined  ground  squirrel  ( Spermophilus tridecemlineatus ), and Franklin's  ground  squirrel  ( Spermophilus franklinii ).  White-tailed  deer  ( Odocoileus virginianus ) are the common big game species in the region. The most abundant large predator of the region is

the coyote ( Canis latrans ),  but  other  predators such as the red fox ( Vulpes vulpes )  and American badger ( Taxidea taxus )  can be found in the Tallgrass Prairie Ecoregion as well. The bobcat ( Lynx rufus ), least weasel ( Mustela nivalis ), and American mink ( Neovison vison ) can be found in wooded areas, wetlands and along river valleys (Schneider et. al . 2011).

## 20.1.6 Threatened, Endangered, and Special Status Species

The Project and surrounding areas lie in the Southeast Prairies Biologically Unique Landscape (BUL) within  the  Tallgrass  Prairie  Ecoregion  of  Nebraska  (Schneider et.  al .,  2011).  No  species  that  are listed  as  Threatened  or  Endangered under the federal Endangered Species Act, or the Nebraska Non-game and Endangered Species Conservation Act, have been identified as inhabitants of the Southeast  Prairies  BUL.  According  to  Schneider et.  al .  (2011)  special  status  species  which  have been identified as 'Tier I at-risk species' by the state of Nebraska, as well as those species that may be  headed  for  state  or  federal  listing,  that  may  occur  in  the  vicinity  of  the  Project  include  the following:

- · Birds:
- o Greater Prairie-Chicken (Tympanuchus cupido);
- o Henslow's Sparrow (Ammodramus henslowii);
- o Loggerhead Shrike (Lanius ludovicianus); and
- o Wood Thrush (Hylocichla mustelina).
- · Reptiles:
- o Massasauga (Sistrurus catenatus); and
- o Timber Rattlesnake (Crotalus horridus).
- · Insects:
- o Iowa Skipper (Atrytone arogos iowa);
- o Regal Fritillary (Speyeria idaliaI);
- o Married Underwing (Catocala nuptialis); and
- o Whitney Underwing (Catocala whitneyi).
- · Mollusks:
- o Pimpleback (Quadrula pustulosa);
- o Pistolgrip (Tritogonia verrucosa); and
- o Plain Pocketbook (Lampsilis cardium).
- · Mammals:
- o Plains Harvest Mouse (Reithrodontomys montanus griseus).

The Pistolgrip is known to only occur in one other BUL in Nebraska, while the Massasauga and Plain Pocketbook  are  known  to  occur  in  only  two  other  BULs  in  Nebraska.  No  nesting  Piping  Plovers ( Charadrius  melodus ), Interior  Least  Terns  ( Sternula  antillarum  athalassos ), migrant  Whooping Cranes ( Grus Americana ), or nesting Bald Eagles ( Haliaeetus leucocephalus ) are known to occur in the vicinity of the Project area (Brown, 2014). The Massasauga's primary habitat is wet meadows while  the  Timber  Rattlesnake  generally  inhabits  rocky  outcropping  and  adjacent  habitats.  If  any construction is to be conducted in the range of either of the snake species, or any Tier I species, a proper impact analysis is required to be executed. This would be accomplished during the federal review process, if necessary.

The discharge of mine dewatering water to the Missouri River will need to consider potential impacts to  several  threatened  and  endangered  species,  including,  but  not  limited  to:  the  threatened  lake sturgeon  ( Acipenser  fulvescens ), the  endangered  pallid  sturgeon  ( Scaphirhynchus  albus ), the Sturgeon  Chub  ( Macrhybopsis  gelida ),  the  river  otter  ( Lutra  Canadensis ),  as  well  as  several  bat species.

## 20.1.7 Land Use

Since the settlement of Johnson County, farming for livestock, crops, and pasture has been the most important  land  use  enterprise.  Over  the  years,  crop  production  has  shifted  from  orchards,  oats, barley,  and  rye  to  corn,  soy,  wheat,  alfalfa,  and  grain  sorghum.  Livestock  in  the  county  generally consists of hogs, cattle, and milk cows (USDA SCS, 1984). About 10,000 acres in Johnson County is irrigated  cropland,  while  about  42,000  acres  is  used  for  pasture.  About  32,000  acres  of  Johnson County is used for rangeland, which includes both native prairie that was never broken from sod and areas that were cultivated and then reseeded. Based on known soil types, land use in the vicinity of the Project is best suited for rangeland and native hay, introduced or domestic grasses for pasture and, if irrigated, corn, sorghum, and soybeans (USDA SCS, 1984).

## 20.1.8 Hydrogeology (Groundwater)

A hydrogeological characterization of the deposit was conducted during the core drilling program. The program included:

- · 42 downhole packer-isolated injection and airlift testing in core holes;
- · Installation of six, 2 inch PVC standpipe piezometers isolated in the carbonatite and open to large intervals of the deposit;
- · Installation of two, nominal 2 inch PVC standpipe piezometers isolated in the 590 ft (180 m) thick Pennsylvanian aquitard above the carbonatite; and
- · Frequent measurement of water levels in open core holes and piezometers over a period of six months.

The  hydrogeological  characteristics  of  the  resource  area  were  significant  enough  that  a  10-day pumping test was conducted in the fall of 2014. During this initial test, an open borehole was pumped at  35 gpm,  and  the  response  was  observed  in  nearby  piezometers.  These  data  were  used  to establish  the  prospective  mine  water  inflow  prediction  that  appears  in  the  2015  PEA  level documents.  However,  the  hydrogeological  issues  associated  with  these  initial  findings  were considered to be significant enough for a second test, conducted in May and June of 2015. For this second test, a large diameter injection well was installed in the approximate center of the deposit, and two additional distant monitoring piezometers were established. Water was injected at a rate of 350 to 480 gpm (22 to 30 L/sec) over a nominal 30-day period, and the response was measured by a series  of  instrumented  piezometers.  Analysis  and  interpretation  of  the  data  from  these  testing programs has been completed and a preliminary conceptual model developed.

While water samples collected from these deep holes, NEC 14-014 and Met-1, indicate very similar quality,  overall,  water  sampling  results  are  variable  across  the  site.  This  includes  Total  Dissolved Solids  (TDS)  which  can  range  in  concentrations  of  over  18,000  ppm,  with  the  major  contributors being  sodium  and  chloride.  Both  of  the  wells  noted  above  also  exceed  EPA  primary  Maximum Contaminant Levels (MCLs) with respect to the following:

- · Arsenic;
- · Gross alpha; and
- · Ra-226 + Ra-228.

Water from both of these wells also exceeds secondary MCLs with respect to chloride, fluoride, iron, manganese, sulfate, as well as TDS. NEC 14-014 also exceeds the secondary MCL for aluminum. There were no detectable pesticides or herbicides. Although the deep groundwater is not currently a drinking water source, concentrations were compared to drinking water standards as a reference to possible  regulatory  and  management  implications  of  groundwater  disposal  from  future  mine dewatering. Given the variability of water quality across the site, additional testing may be necessary to appropriately characterize the deep aquifer.

The  deep  groundwater  chemistry  data  indicate  a  low-oxygen,  chemically  reducing  groundwater system  that  is  out  of  chemical  equilibrium  with  surface  conditions.  Supporting  evidence  of  this conclusion includes:

- · Nitrogen species are mostly dominated by ammonia rather than nitrate or nitrite;
- · Iron is elevated at neutral pH, a condition which is unlikely to occur in an oxygenated, natural
- · system; and
- · Groundwater brought to the surface at some boreholes is initially black, changes to orange over a time period ranging from hours to days, then eventually turns clear while forming an orange precipitate. This is characteristic of water initially containing reduced ferrous iron that eventually oxidizes to ferric iron.

Further  investigation  is  needed  to  determine  the  origin  of  the  elevated  concentrations  in  the groundwater, as well as refinement of the overall pumping requirements for the underground mining operation (from surface wells and the underground mine). Because of difficulties in handling these waters once they have been pumped to the surface, the additional testing remains a recommendation, and must wait until surface management structures (ponds) and permitting have been completed.

## 20.1.9 Hydrology (Surface Water)

Surface water samples have been collected as part of baseline sampling on a quarterly basis since early  2014.  Surface  water  sampling  locations  were  selected  to  establish  a  baseline  monitoring perimeter both upstream and downstream from all proposed facilities in the Project area. All samples were  analyzed  by  Midwest  Laboratory  in  Omaha  for  a  comprehensive  suite  of  metals  and  other inorganic analytes plus a panel of pesticides and herbicides. The preliminary results of the baseline program are as follows:

- · Surface water in and around the Project area exhibits minor water quality impairment, as indicated by concentrations outside the limits of several secondary drinking water standards and several aquatic life criteria (e.g., aluminum, iron, and manganese).
- · Average stream TDS concentrations fluctuate appreciably; however, this variability is most likely the result of post-harvest runoff containing excess sediments.
- · Stream pH is consistently circum-neutral, ranging from about 6.6 to 8.2 standard units.
- · Gross  alpha,  beta,  Ra-226  and  Ra-228  have  been  detected  in  several  surface  water samples, but at concentrations below their respective EPA Maximum Contaminant Levels

(MCL).

## 20.1.10 Wetlands/Riparian Zones

## Project Site

Olsson Associates (2015) was retained to conduct a wetland delineation and potential jurisdictional waters assessment in Sections 3, 28, 29, 32, 33, Township 3; 4 North, Range 11 East, Pawnee and Johnson  counties,  Nebraska.  The  purpose  behind  this  investigation  was  to  identify  wetland  and drainage  features  within  the  proposed  Project  boundary  that  could  be  classified  as  jurisdictional waters of the U.S., and therefore be subject to permitting requirements by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE).

The  study  area,  at  the  time  of  the  site  visit,  consisted  of  existing  agricultural  fields,  pastures, farmsteads and unnamed tributaries to Todd and Elk creeks. The majority of unnamed tributaries consisted of riparian areas and ponds that drained to Todd and Elk creeks. Many of the wooded areas that were not situated along drainages were located along fence lines as windbreaks. Most of the study area had been impacted by grazing livestock.

Wetlands  were  identified  in  agricultural  fields,  pastures,  roadside  ditches  and  abutting  stream channels. Olsson (2015) identified a total of 45 wetlands encompassing a total area of approximately 10.64 acres. Nine unnamed streams were also found during the field investigation for a total length of  approximately  13,726  ft.  An  approved  jurisdictional  determination  (AJD)  was  obtained  from  the USACE on September 6, 2016. This AJD confirmed jurisdiction of 11 stream reaches and associated wetlands as waters of the U.S. within the Project area.

## Waterline Corridor

Subsequent  to  the  Project  area  AJD,  Olsson  completed  a  wetland  delineation  and  potential jurisdictional waters assessment along the proposed waterline corridor between the Project site and the  Missouri  River.  The  path  generally  follows  Highway  50,  County  Road  720,  634  Avenue,  721 Road,  649  Avenue,  and  a  private  driveway  to  the  Missouri  River.  Olsson  identified  75  wetlands totaling 7.37 acres and 45 stream channels, including various reaches and tributaries to Todd Creek, North Fork Big Nemaha River, Long Branch, Little Muddy Creek, Muddy Creek, Whisky Run, and the Missouri River. Stream channel present within the corridor totals 14,300 linear feet. An AJD is not being  pursued  for  these  features,  and  they  are  assumed  to  be  jurisdictional  waters  of  the  U.S. (Olsson, 2017)

## 20.1.11 Geochemistry

A geochemical characterization program for the mineralized material, waste rock, and tailings has been initiated by SRK for the Project. Preliminary results are provided in the following sections.

## Niobium Mineralized Material

Preliminary results suggest that the mineralized material has potential to leach various constituents due  to  exposure  to  meteoric  precipitation.  Laboratory  leach  tests  of  a  composite  sample  of  this material  from  drillhole  NEC11-001  indicate  that,  at  a  minimum,  fluoride  and  nitrate  could  be mobilized during surface stockpiling. Note: fluoride is the only analyte that exceeds the EPA MCL in the leach testing. Nitrate and several metals are detectable, but not at concentrations exceeding their respective MCL for drinking water).

Contained within  the  mineralized  material  are  naturally  occurring  uranium  and  thorium.  Based  on existing drilling data, the average thorium and uranium content in the Mineral Resource is 0.034% and  0.0045%,  respectively  (0.0395%  in  total).  Leach  testing  of  potential  waste  materials  has  not produced concentrations of these radionuclides above regulatory limits. However, the concentrations in the rock are relatively elevated (approximate relative concentrations):

- · Uranium = 33 ppm;
- · Thorium = 303 ppm;
- · Gross alpha = 200 pCi/g;
- · Gross beta = 160 pCi/g;
- · Radium 226 = 56 pCi/g; and
- · Radium 228 = 18 pCi/g.

The current assay database for the Elk Creek orebody contains 6,288 samples for which uranium and thorium were analyzed, and detected. Of this dataset, 1,122 samples (~18%) had a combined uranium+thorium concentration of greater than ('&gt;') 500 ppm. The mean and median concentration of uranium+thorium was 336 ppm and 273 ppm, respectively. The mineralized material suitable for mill  feed  will  require  proper  management during the periods it is exposed on the surface, prior to processing.

## Waste Rock and Overburden

There are two basic types of waste rock associated with the niobium deposit. These include:

- · Pennsylvanian limestones and mudstones - The upper 100 ft (30 m) of lithology consists of unconsolidated glacial till, underlain by a 560 to 590 ft (170 to 180 m) of low-permeability, Pennsylvanian-aged  mudstone  and  limestone,  otherwise  known  as  the  'Pennsylvanian strata' (PENN). The PENN is reportedly continuous across the state of Nebraska, and locally it behaves as a very effective aquitard. This material is neutralizing due to its high carbonate content.  In  terms  of  metal  leaching  characteristics,  Meteoric  Water  Mobility  Procedure (MWMP) testing suggests that the PENN has the potential to leach antimony and selenium at concentrations above general surface water standards. Additionally, the PENN exhibits a propensity  to  leach  gross  alpha  and  radium  above  regulatory  limits.  This  lithology  is  the primary source for construction aggregate in Nebraska.
- · Non-ore  grade  carbonatite -  Preliminary  assessment  of  the  host  rock  identified  visual sulfide  content  of  up  to  1%  based  on  observations  by  core  loggers.  Laboratory  analyses confirmed  the  sulfide  content  at  around  1.34%.  This  sulfide  consists  mainly  of  pyrite, chalcopyrite,  bornite, galena,  sphalerite,  and  possibly  pyrrhotite.  However,  even  with detectable sulfide content, the carbonatite waste rock is still net neutralizing given the high carbonate content.

Of  the  94  rock  samples  collected  over  a  837  ft  (255  m)  vertical  length  of  the  waste  rock  and mineralized zone, eight samples (8.5%) registered a reading of &gt;25 µRads/hour. These levels are not  considered  to  be  hazardous,  but  could  be  used  as  a  diagnostic  tool  to  identify  elevated concentrations of uranium and thorium.

Temporary surface disposal of waste rock will be predicated on minimizing meteoric infiltration and leaching of this material. NioCorp has conservatively elected to line the waste rock and low-grade mineralized material stockpiles, and actively manage any runoff derived from these materials until

such time as that and residual ore and low-grade mineralized materials can be processed, and the surface waste rock transferred to the TSF for final disposal.

## Tailings

Representative quantities of post-process tailings from the metallurgical testing program have been limited. Geochemical testing and characterization (including radiological testing) of the tailings was completed in Q3 of 2017 when the testing of the beneficiation process was finalized and the need for, and usability of, tailings as underground backfill could be properly evaluated. Characterization of the  various  tailings  materials  has  included  both  the  Toxicity  Characteristic  Leaching  Procedure (TCLP) and the Synthetic Precipitation Leach Procedure (SPLP), which are designed to determine the mobility of both organic and inorganic analytes present in liquid, solid, and multiphasic wastes, and assist in the proper classification of waste materials. The most recent tailings material testing showed  negligible  mobility  of  regulated  constituents  (indicating  a  non-hazardous  classification), although the pH of the TCLP/SPLP extracts remained high. While the calcined tailings are likely to produce heat when exposed to atmospheric moisture and precipitation (i.e., exothermic hydration), this  reaction  is  not  'violent'  as  defined  under  40  CFR  §  261.23(2) Characteristic  of  reactivity [for hazardous wastes] (adopted by the State of Nebraska under Title 128 - Nebraska Hazardous Waste Regulations).Given the limited quantities of ore available for this testing further characterization of these materials is recommended in order to establish representativeness with the mineral deposit as a whole.

## 20.1.12 Known Environmental Issues

There are currently no known environmental issues that could materially impact NioCorp's ability to extract  the  Mineral  Resources  or  Mineral  Reserves at  Elk  Creek.  However,  there  are  several  key permitting  risks  and  uncertainties  that  could  affect  the  Project  financing  and  schedule.  Risks  are summarized in Section 24.2.

## 20.2  Waste Management and Disposal

## 20.2.1 Overburden and Waste Rock

Overburden  developed during mine construction will be excavated, crushed and used as construction material. The limited quantities of waste rock will be temporarily stored on the surface prior to final disposal within the lined tailings impoundment. The majority of the waste rock generated by  the  mining  operations  will  remain  underground  and  be  placed  in  secondary  backfill  stopes. Because  of  the  potential  presence  of  low  levels  of  Naturally  Occurring  Radioactive  Materials (NORMs)  in  some  of  the  waste  rock  brought  to  the  surface,  NioCorp  will  take  the  conservative approach of placing this material on a lined containment facility from which any surface water runoff or seepage can be controlled and managed. It is not anticipated that any of these materials would remain on the surface post closure.

## 20.2.2 Tailings

The tailings production rate is an average of 2,460 dry t/d, consisting of 825 dry t/d of water leach residue tailings, 1,588 dry t/d of calcined excess oxide tailings, and 46 t/d of slag. The water leach residue tailings will be returned to the underground mine as backfill, along with a portion of the oxide tailings. The remaining oxide tailings and slag will be deposited within double-lined, surface storage

facilities  under the regulatory oversight of the Solid Waste Branch of the Nebraska Department of Environmental  Quality  (NDEQ).  NioCorp  has  chosen  to  design  the  solids  portion  of  the  TSF  to include 2 ft of compacted soil liner with a permeability of 1 × 10 -7 cm/s or less, overlain by an 80-mil HDPE liner, overlain by an overliner drain system. The water retaining portion of the facility will be lined  with  a  double  lined  system  consisting  of  a  60-mil  HDPE  secondary  liner  and  80-mil  HDPE primary  liner  with  an  active  leak  detection  system  between.  This  conservative  approach  should ensure adequate protection of local groundwater resources. Additional details regarding the TSF are provided in Section 18.11. Closure of the TSF is discussed in Section 20.5.3.

## 20.2.3 Project Waste Disposal

## Solid Waste

Solid  waste  generated  by  the  Project,  as  defined  by  40  CFR  §  261.2,  will  be  collected  and transported  to  the  Douglas  County/Pheasant  Point  Landfill,  located  near  Elk  City  in  northwest Douglas County, 87 miles (140 km) from the Project site. Under current management practices, the Pheasant Point Landfill has 92 years of projected remaining life. (NDEQ, 2012)

## Hazardous Waste

Any hazardous waste generated by the Project will be transported by licensed operators to the Clean Harbors  Environmental  Services  facility  in  Deer  Trail,  Colorado,  470  miles  (756  km)  away,  in accordance with hazardous waste manifest and pre-transport requirements.

## 20.2.4 Site Monitoring

Surface water and groundwater monitoring will continue throughout the LoM, as initiated during the baseline study program. Additional monitoring locations could be added during the regulatory review process. This will include, but not necessarily be limited to groundwater monitoring downgradient of the tailings storage facility, mine water collection pond, and the discharge to the Missouri River under the state NPDES program.

Geotechnical monitoring of the TSF facility will also occur on a regular basis as per state regulatory requirements.

Ambient air quality monitoring will likely continue, and may include emissions control monitoring once operations  commence.  This  will  be  conducted  in  accordance  with  all  applicable  state  regulatory requirements.

The  presence  of  NORMs  in  the  mineralized  ore  and  several  of  the  process  waste  streams  will necessitate  the  need  for  a  comprehensive  site-wide  monitoring.  At  a  minimum,  the  Broad  Scope License will require the development and implementation of a formal Radiation Safety program for the facility, including environmental and personnel monitoring programs, which are discussed further in the following sections.

## 20.2.5 Water Management

## Operational Water Management

For the first several years of construction, the advancement of the shaft and underground workings will  require subsurface dewatering. Initially, water from well testing will be stored in the lined Mine

Water Pond during construction of the discharge waterline to the Missouri River. The Mine Water Pond will require permitting under Nebraska's Dam Safety regulations.

Once  full  operations  commence,  and  the  appropriate  discharge  to  the  Missouri  River  has  been permitted  and  facilities  constructed,  the  dewatering  water  will  be  temporarily  stored  in  the  Mine Water Pond, where it will cool and equilibrate with atmospheric gasses (especially oxygen) prior to being  pumped  to  the  discharge  point.  The  equilibration  step  for  this  water  will  result  in  the precipitation  of  several  constituents,  including  iron,  manganese  and  carbonates  (among  others). Additional discussion on deep groundwater chemistry is provided in Section 20.1.8.

Once tailings begin being deposited in the TSF, internal contact water (from residual moisture in the tailings and precipitation falling within the impoundment footprint) will need to be actively managed. This water will be collected and treated using lime softening to precipitate hydroxide and carbonate solid forms for many of the inorganic constituents. The treated water will be filtered to remove the solids  (which  will  be  returned  to  the  TSF  for  disposal)  and  the  clean  water  will  be  pumped  to  the process plant RO system for further treatment. The clean water from the process plant RO unit will be used in the process plant, and the reject concentrate will be transferred to the Mine Water Pond where it  will  mix  with  the  dewatering  water  and  be  discharged.  NioCorp  is  currently  working  with state regulators to ensure that the overall discharge permit limitations to the Missouri River account for this additional brine concentration.

## Post-Closure Water Management

Upon  cessation  of  mining,  dewatering  operations  will  be  halted  and  the  wells  will  be  abandoned according to state regulations. Until such time that the TSF closure cover can be constructed, and any residual water or seepage eliminated, the TSF contact water will require management. Whether the singular TSF brine stream from the RO plant can continue to be discharged the Missouri River or if  another disposal method considered (i.e., disposal in the deep mine workings), will be evaluated during the final years of operation.

## 20.2.6 Chemical and Reagents Handling

Process  reagents  and  chemicals,  including  but  not  limited  to:  sulfur  (molten),  sodium  hydroxide (NaOH), magnesium hydroxide (MgOH), lime (CaO), aluminum, iron (scrap and powder), boiler feed chemicals, water treatment plant chemicals, cooling tower chemicals, and solvent extraction circuit chemicals, will be trucked to the site and stored in specially designed and constructed containers located  within  concrete  and  concrete-bermed  areas.  For  liquid  chemicals  and  reagents,  these bermed areas will be designed to contain at least 110% of the capacity of the largest storage tank or tanks  in  series  within  the  berm.  Solid  chemicals  and  reagents  will  be  stored  in  flow  bins  or  silos specifically designed for these materials. Reagents will be stored in a manner that inhibits any intermixing and subsequent reactions.

Fuel  (i.e.,  gasoline,  diesel  fuel,  and  propane),  antifreeze,  petroleum  oils,  and  solvents  will  be delivered  to  the  mine  in  tanker  trucks,  totes  and  barrels  for  transfer  to  authorized  storage  tanks. Storage tanks or tanks in series will be enclosed by berms sized to contain at least 110% of the capacity  of  the  largest  tank  in  the  event  of  a  spill  or  tank  rupture.  NioCorp  will  develop  a comprehensive Spill  Prevention Control and Countermeasures Plan (SPCC) to  be implemented in the event of a spill or release of petroleum products.

Explosive materials transported to the site will include blasting agents and initiation devices. Blasting agents are comprised primarily of ammonium nitrate and fuel oil. The ammonium nitrate and fuel oil will be stored in appropriate storage bins separate from the explosives magazine. Blasting initiation devices will be stored in prefabricated magazines in conformance with BATF, MSHA, and applicable state and local regulations.

## 20.3  Project Permitting Requirements

Engagement of local, state and federal regulators has already occurred, and three major areas of permitting have been initiated, including 404/408 permitting with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), and 402 and air quality permitting with the State of Nebraska. Initiation of the balance of permitting for the Project is dependent upon the completion of the mine plan and surface facilities being developed as part of this technical document. Typically, larger mining operations such as this have  the  benefit  of  a  pre-feasibility  stage  of  analysis  and  development  from  which  permitting  is generally initiated. With the completion and publication of this FS, the balance of permitting for the Project can commence.

The Project will be held to permitting requirements that are determined to be necessary by Johnson and Pawnee counties, the State of Nebraska, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and USACE national policies, such as the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4321) and the Clean  Water  Act  (33  U.S.C.  1251 et seq .). The  list of potentially applicable permits and authorizations for the Project are presented in Table 20-1.

Table: 20-1: Project Permits

The following is a brief discussion of the more material permits which are likely to form the critical path in the Project permitting timeline.

## 20.3.1 USACE 404/408 Permitting and NEPA

## Clean Water Act Section 404

Section 404 of the federal Clean Water Act (CWA) establishes a program to regulate the discharge of  dredged  or  fill  material  into  Waters  of  the  U.S.  (WOUS),  including  wetlands  and  jurisdictional drainages/waterways. Activities in WOUS regulated under this program include fill for development, water resource projects (such as dams and levees), infrastructure development (such as highways and airports) and mining projects. Section 404 requires a permit before dredged or fill material may be discharged into WOUS.

Proposed activities are regulated through a permit review process. An individual permit is required for potentially significant impacts. Individual permits are reviewed by the USACE. However, for most discharges that will have only minimal adverse effects, a general permit may be suitable. General permits are issued on a nationwide, regional, or state basis for particular categories of activities. The general permit process eliminates individual review and allows certain activities to proceed with little or no delay, provided that the general or specific conditions for the general permit are met.

For  the  most  part,  NioCorp  has  directed  the  engineering  partners  on  the  Project  to  avoid  both floodplains and any potentially jurisdictional water features during the design process. The mine and surface plant facilities have been sited to avoid these features. This design approach is viewed very favorably by the USACE.

With respect to the waterline corridor, all but the final outfall section has been permitted under the USACE  Nationwide  Permitting  Program.  The  final  section  (~900  ft)  will  be  authorized  under  the same Nationwide Permit once the CWA Section 408 process described below is completed. The Nationwide Permit process does not require individual National Environmental Policy Act review.

## Clean Water Act Section 408

At  the  request  of  the  USACE,  an  assessment  of  CWA  Section  408  permitting  has  been  initiated. Section  408  deals  with  the  review  and  approval  of  all  requests  to  modify,  alter,  or  occupy  any existing  USACE-constructed  public  works  project.  Public  works  projects  include  dams,  basins, levees, channels, navigational channels, and any other local flood protection works constructed by the Corps. In the case of the Project, this assessment focusses on the review of potential impacts to the  bank  stabilization  structures  along  with  the  revetments  placed  by  the  USACE  in  the  Missouri River just downgradient of the proposed dewatering water discharge point. Revetments are sloping structures placed on banks or cliffs in such a way as to absorb the energy of incoming water. This assessment should be completed in concurrence with the 404 Nationwide permitting process.

## National Environmental Policy Act Review

Within  most  federal  permitting  processes,  the  need  for  environmental  impact  analysis  is  typically required for major federal actions. The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requires federal agencies to consider the environmental effects of, and any alternatives to, their proposed actions. A USACE action that involves the placement of fill material into a WOUS and issuance of a permit generally requires an assessment of compliance with NEPA prior to issuance of the permit. For the

issuance of a nationwide permit, that compliance with NEPA is pre-assumed, as all impacts under the nationwide permit are considered insignificant; thus allowing for a general permit to be issued.

In  the  event  that  additional  NEPA  analysis  is  requested  by  the  USACE  (or  cooperating  federal agency,  such  as  the  U.S.  Environmental  Protection  Agency  or  EPA),  the  NEPA  process  would generally involve one of two levels of analysis:

- · Preparation  of  an  Environmental  Assessment  (EA)  and Finding  of  No  Significant  Impact (FONSI); or
- · Preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS).

It is important to remember that both EAs and EISs are public disclosure documents, not permit or approval documents. They are intended to disclose what, if any, environmental impacts may occur from the Project and guide the decisions of federal agencies. The primary difference between the two types of documents is that an EA is prepared when no significant impacts are expected or the potential  impacts  are  unknown,  and  an  EIS  acknowledges  that  there  is  a  potential  for  significant impacts, and analyzes and discloses what those potential impacts are. Significance is determined based on a variety of factors such as compliance with state, federal, and local regulation regulations, USACE,  EPA  and  USFWS  policies  and  guidelines,  and  other  site  specific  concerns  such  as removing water sites or critical habitat.

At this time, the preparation of a comprehensive EIS is not anticipated for the Project, but remains a risk  until  the  USACE has acted upon (i.e., completed) the official permit application (submitted on March  24,  2017)  and  has  issued  a  FONSI  on  the  Section  408  action  regarding  the  river  outfall structure.  Only  in  rare  circumstances,  has  the  preparation  of  an  EA  resulted  in  the  decision  to subsequently prepare an EIS.

## 20.3.2 Nebraska NPDES Permitting Program

The  current  Project  water  balance  suggests  that  excess  water  from  underground  dewatering operations  will  need  to  be  managed  for  discharge  to  the  environment.  The  current  plan  is  to discharge  dewatered  groundwater  via  waterline  and  diffuser directly to the Missouri River, approximately 31 miles (50 km) to the east of the Project site. The Missouri River is believed to be the only regional water body of sufficient quantity (flow) and quality to accept the projected volume of water  from  the  mine  with  minimal  pre-treatment,  and  still  meet  applicable  discharge  and  surface water quality standards. Various rights-of-way and easements will also need to be negotiated with Johnson,  Pawnee,  Richardson  and  Nemaha  counties  and  private  landowners.  In  addition,  the location  and  design  of  the  in-stream  diffuser  and  impacts  to  any  jurisdictional  areas  along  the proposed waterline corridor,  will  need  to  be  addressed  through  the  USACE  nationwide  permitting process.

In the State of Nebraska, all persons discharging or proposing to discharge pollutants from a point source into any waters of the state are required to apply for, and have a permit under the National Pollutant  Discharge  Elimination  System  (NPDES)  to  discharge,  including  all  significant  industrial users  discharging  to  a  publicly  owned  treatment  works  (POTW).  The  NDEQ  is  responsible  for developing and issuing NPDES permits, and for insuring that permitted facilities comply with permit requirements.

## NPDES Permit Timing

Regulations require an individual, site-specific NPDES permit application be submitted to the NDEQ at  least  180  days  (six  months)  prior  to  the  date  of  first  discharge.  This  is  predicated  on  an administratively and technically complete and accurate permit application. If changes are made or additional information is submitted or is required by the agency, the 180-day period may start over. NPDES permits are public noticed for 30 days before being issued. If comments are received and a hearing is required, the NDEQ would schedule a hearing and respond to any comments received at the hearing. This may require an additional 60 to 90 days.

## 20.3.3 DHHS Radioactive Materials Program and Licensing

The Elk Creek Mineral Resource, and thus the residual post-processing tailings, will contain trace amounts of uranium and thorium, which are Naturally Occurring Radioactive Materials (NORM). At issue  will  be  the  ultimate  classification  of  the  tailings  because  of  these  constituents,  and  the occurrence of these constituents in the processing circuit. Preliminary discussions with the State of Nebraska have indicated that a Broad Scope Radioactive Materials License, issued under 180 NAC 3-013  by  the  Nebraska  Department  of  Health  and  Human  Services  (DHHS),  may  likely  be necessary.

As defined by the Nebraska Radiation Control Act, radioactive material means any material, whether solid, liquid, or gas, which emits ionizing radiation spontaneously. Radioactive material includes, but is  not  limited  to,  accelerator-produced  material,  by-product  material,  naturally  occurring  material, source material, and special nuclear material. The classification of radioactive material appears to be irrespective  of  any  concentration  -  it  merely  has  to  emit  ionizing  radiation.  The  material  for processing,  waste  rock,  and  tailings  are  likely  to  be  seen  as  naturally  occurring  material,  and therefore, classified as a radioactive material.

The DHHS retains the right to require registration or licensing of [any] radioactive material in order to maintain  compatibility  and  equivalency  with  the  standards  and  regulatory  programs  of  the  federal government or to protect the occupational and public health and safety and the environment [NRS 71-3507(2)]. At the same time, the DHHS can exempt certain sources of radiation or kinds of uses or users from licensing or registration requirements when the department finds that the exemption will not  constitute  a  significant  risk  to  occupational  and  public  health  and  safety  and  the  environment [NRS 71-3507(4)].

At a minimum, the Broad Scope License will require the development and implementation of a formal Radiation  Safety  program  for  the facility, including environmental  and  personnel  monitoring programs, appropriate warning signage be displayed around the site, and a final permanent closure cover for the TSF be engineered and constructed. DHHS oversight and the Broad Scope License will necessarily cover all points of potential worker exposure, including but not limited to: underground mining, crushing, transportation and stockpiling, conveying, and processing, especially in areas were airborne dust containing uranium and thorium (as well as radon gas) can occur. Worker protection from  ionizing  radiation  and  radon  will  also  be  regulated  by  the  U.S.  Department  of  Labor,  Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) under 30 CFR PART 57 - Safety and Health Standards Underground Metal and Nonmetal Mines, Subpart D - Air Quality, Radiation, Physical Agents, and Diesel  Particulate  Matter.  Both  programs  will  examine  potential  exposure  limits,  engineering  and

administrative  control  requirements,  the  use  of  appropriate  Personal  Protective  Equipment  (PPE), and monitoring/reporting programs to ensure worker protection.

In the likely event that the Elk Creek facility is regulated in this way, some land restrictions may be invoked at the time of mine closure. While these requirements appear to be directed at uranium mills and commercial radioactive waste disposal facilities, and not necessarily mine tailings for operations containing NORM, the law makes no clear distinction between the facility types. As such, the State of Nebraska  could  apply  them  under  either  scenario,  which  could  even  include  the  possibility  of deeding the land to the State of Nebraska following closure.

Irrespective  of  ultimate  classification,  the  tailings  (and  their  disposal  facility)  will  require  financial assurance  for  reclamation  and  closure.  Again,  these  rules  appear  to  be  directed  at  uranium  mill tailings  and  low-level  radioactive  waste  facilities,  but  are  non-specific  enough  that  they  could  be applied  to  other  situations  where  NORMs  are  being  actively  managed.  In  addition  to  a  direct reclamation financial assurance, it is probable that the state will require a funding mechanism (e.g., trust fund, escrow, etc.) for monitoring and maintenance of the facility in the longer term as part of a Broad Scope License.

## DHHS License Timing

NioCorp estimates that a Broad Scope License for the Project will take 6 to 9 months to obtain once the  formal  application  has  been  submitted,  and  will  involve  several  months  of  discussions  and negotiations related to engineering, design, monitoring, and terms and conditions.

## 20.3.4 Nebraska Air Quality Permitting

The  Nebraska  air  regulations  are  primarily  based  on  regulations  developed  by  the  U.S.  EPA  to address the Clean Air Act (CAA) requirements. Air quality permits are the primary tool used by the NDEQ to implement the CAA. For businesses that intend to operate unit sources that emit regulated pollutants that will exceed Nebraska air quality thresholds, a construction permit will be required.

There  are  two  types  of  construction  permits:  state  construction  permits  and  federal  construction permits,  known  as  New  Source  Review  (NSR)  or  Prevention  of  Significant  Deterioration  (PSD) permits. The type of construction permit that is needed will depend on the quantity of air pollutants that potentially could be released from the new plant or expansion project.

Because  the  Project  includes  a  primary  sulfuric  acid  plant  [a  regulated  facility  under  40  CFR  § 52.21(b) which anticipates emissions in excess of the regulatory thresholds], and since Nebraska is currently classified as in 'attainment' of all ambient air quality standards, a federal PSD construction permit will be required. The entire permit process is expected to take at least 190 days, provided that there  are  no  significant  technical  issues  or  problems  in  obtaining  information,  and  the  facility  has submitted  a  complete  application  (including  detailed  air  dispersion  modeling).  Typically,  however, PSD permits require over one year in order to complete.

The PSD permitting process includes both public and EPA review and comment periods. Part of the EPA review of the application includes additional scoping through issuance of a PSD Public Notice Package to other federal agencies and land managers, local officials, affected states and others, as necessary. This can lengthen the permit timeline. However, opportunities exist within the program to authorize  certain  early  construction  activities  (typically  limited  to  ground  clearing  and  grading

activities) prior to permit issuance. The nature and extent of these variances must be negotiated and applied for with the NDEQ.

The sulfuric acid plant is currently assumed to only exist for the purpose of supplying sulfuric acid to the super-alloy materials production process. Alternatively, the sulfuric acid plant may be built with enough capacity to provide the majority of sulfuric acid off site as a saleable product.

In addition to the construction permit, the NDEQ also issues operating permits based on a source's level  of  emissions.  There  are  two  types  of  operating  permits:  major  source  (federal  program)  and minor source (state program). As before, the potential to emit associated with the sulfuric acid plant will  necessitate the issuance of a major source permit for the operation. The federal major source program (a.k.a., Class I or Title V) regulates larger sources of air pollution. A Class I source has the potential-to-emit (PTE) quantities greater than:

- · 100 t/y of any criteria air pollutant, excluding lead;
- · 10 t/y of any single hazardous air pollutant (HAP) or 25 t/y of a combination of HAPs; or
- · 5 t/y of lead.

The  operating  permit  incorporates  all  of  a  source's  requirements  into  one  permit,  including  all construction permit limitations and federal regulations. Operating permits usually require additional monitoring, stack testing, reporting, and recordkeeping. However, the application for the operating permit need only be submitted within 12 months after the emissions unit(s) begin operation, or within 12 months of becoming subject to the operating permit requirements, whichever is earlier.

Earthworks associated with digging holes, grading soil, stockpiling of topsoil, and land clearing where the new source will be located, which will not result in a change in actual emissions, and are not of a permanent nature, do not require a construction permit or prior approval of the NDEQ under Title 129, Chapter 17 ( Acceptable Pre-Construction Dirt Work dated August 2016).

## 20.3.5 Nebraska Dam Permitting

The Department of Natural Resources (DNR) regulates the construction, operation, and maintenance of dams in Nebraska to protect life and property from dam failures. The DNR regulates all dams in the state that:

- · Have a total height of 25 ft or more and an impounding capacity at the top of dam that is greater than 15 acre ft;
- · Have an impounding capacity at the top of dam of 50 acre ft or more and a total height that is greater than 6 ft; or
- · Are located in a high hazard potential location.

As promulgated in Chapter 46, Article 16 - Safety of Dams and Reservoirs, approval of applications shall be issued within 90 days after receipt of the 'completed' application plus any extensions of time required to resolve matters diligently pursued by the applicant. At the discretion of the DNR, one or more public hearings may be held on an application (46-1654). This will, of course, add additional time to the overall permitting process for the TSF and Mine Water Pond.

## 20.3.6 Greenhouse Gas Permitting

The NDEQ defines Greenhouse Gases (GHG) as chemical compounds that, when emitted into the atmosphere,  have  the  potential  to  cause  climate  change.  There  are  currently  73  GHG  chemicals

identified in 40 CFR § 98 Table A-1 to Subpart A, which include, but are not limited to: CO2, CH4, N2O,  and  Fluorinated  GHGs  (SF6,  PFCs,  HFCs).  Recent  rulemaking  by  the  EPA  incorporates changes impacting the regulation of GHGs and establishes emission thresholds for GHG emissions, while provides the State of Nebraska (among others) the authority to issue PSD permits governing GHGs.

Because not all GHGs remain in the atmosphere for the same amount of time or have the same potential effect in the atmosphere, a system of equivalents (using CO2 as a baseline or CO2 e ) was developed to account for the variation between compounds. For New Sources, the PSD permitting threshold is: 100,000 t/y CO2 e  (as of July 1, 2011). Preliminary calculations for the Project suggest that the operation will be above this threshold.

To date, the EPA has not implemented a minor source program for GHGs, and Nebraska has not chosen to implement a minor source program either. At this time, no fees will be collected, but all sources will be required to report GHG emissions.

## 20.3.7 Permitting Status

Initial  permitting  activities  commenced  in  January  2015  with  the  submission  of  a  Jurisdictional Delineation  report  to  the  USACE  for  the  mine  site.  In  addition,  several  high-level  meetings  with federal,  state  and  local  agencies  have  been  held  in  order  to  introduce  the  Project  to  the  local regulatory communities.

## NDEQ Construction Air Permit

A  pre-application  meeting  took  place  with  the  NDEQ  on  September  8,  2016.  Subsequent  to  this meeting, the Project team has begun analysis of processes that result in emissions regulated by the NDEQ, and have completed initial air emissions calculations. These calculations continue to evolve as  the  process  develops.  At  the  current  time,  it  appears  the  Project  will  require  a  PSD  major construction and operating permit. The PSD process requires ambient air monitoring for a number of pollutants, and a request to trim that list to PM2.5 was submitted to the NDEQ on December 6, 2016. The NDEQ denied NioCorp's request, and the Company has proceeded to conduct air monitoring for all of the monitoring parameters required under the PSD program.

NioCorp currently anticipates submitting the Air Construction Permit application by the end of 2017 with an anticipated permit issuance in 2018.

## CWA NPDES Permit

A Section 402 permit will be required to authorize discharges of underground mine dewatering water to the Missouri River. Initial coordination with the NDEQ occurred in 2015, and NioCorp is currently in  the  process  of  updating  and  finalizing  the  discharge  model  to  include  in  the  permit  application. MixZon (2016), of Portland Oregon, evaluated a discharge outfall that would meet the acute (860 mg/L) and chronic (230 mg/L) water quality criteria for chlorides at mixing zone limits of 250 ft and 5,000 ft, respectively, downstream  from  the discharge location in accordance  with NDEQ requirements  and  guidelines,  using  the  CORMIX  mixing  zone  model.  The  preliminary  model indicated that a multiport diffuser configuration would be required in the Missouri River to meet these requirements. The preliminary design of this diffuser has begun. Agency meetings with the NDEQ and EPA occurred on November 17 and again on December 9, 2016 to discussing the 402, 404, and 408  permits,  and  identify  a  path  forward  for  the  NPDES  discharge  permit  for  the  Missouri  River.

Subsequent meetings with the NDEQ regarding the Section 402 permit occurred on April 21, 2017 (Pre-Application  Meeting)  and  May  23,  2017  (Alternative  Analysis  for  Anti-Degradation  meeting). Additional  evaluation,  design  optimization  and  modeling  will  need  to  be  performed  to  arrive  at  an optimized outfall configuration for this discharge.

## USACE Wetland Permitting

As  indicated  above,  permitting  associated  with  impacts  to  jurisdictional  wetlands  and  WOUS  are anticipated  to  be  authorized  under  the  USACE  nationwide  permitting  process.  This  process  was unofficially initiated with the development of the AJD between NioCorp and the USACE. The official permitting commenced with the submittal of the 404 PCN application to the USACE, which occurred on  March  24,  2017,  followed  by  another  PCN  submittal  (and  response  to  comments)  on  May  5, 2017. This process is expected to be completed in 2017.

On June 7, 2017, NioCorp (through Olsson Associates), submitted a letter on behalf of Elk Creek Resources, requesting initiation of a 33 U.S.C 408 (Section 408) review by the USACE. The review is for the proposed construction and operation of an outfall structure into the Missouri River. At this time, it does not appear that a Categorical Permission would apply to this component of the Project; rather, the USACE believes, and is proceeding under the assumption, that the 408 evaluation will require an individual NEPA analysis (environmental assessment). This process could take six to nine months to complete once initiated.

## Temporary Limestone Processing

The Project may require temporary limestone processing during the construction of the mine shaft. Third-party  portable  limestone  processing  equipment  may  be  used  on  site  to  crush  and  handle limestone removed from the mine shaft, so long as that material meets construction specifications and does not leach potentially deleterious constituents (i.e., heavy metals or NORMs). The NDEQ has  confirmed  that  third-party  operators  will  be  required  to  have  an  air  quality  permit  to  operate equipment on site.

## 20.3.8 Post-Performance and Reclamation Bonding

In addition to lacking hardrock mining regulations for reclamation and closure, there are also limited requirements  for  the  provision  of  financial  sureties  with  respect  to  hardrock  mining  operations  in Nebraska. One possible exception would be under the scenario in which the facility falls under a broad scope radiological license, which has financial assurance requirements for reclamation and closure  ('decommissioning  funding  plan').  As  noted  before,  however,  these  rules  appear  to  be directed at uranium mill tailings and low-level radioactive waste facilities, but are vague enough that they could be applied to other situations where NORMs are being managed, though NioCorp has conservatively assumed that the licensure program and financial surety requirements will apply to the Project. These surety requirements extend to long-term site monitoring, maintenance, and care, and include the following mechanisms:

- · Pre-payment (Trust Fund);
- · Surety Bond;
- · Insurance;
- · Letters of Credit; and/or
- · Corporate Guarantee (provided parent company passes financial test).

In addition, financial assurances will also be required for the TSF, for which jurisdiction will fall under the NDEQ  Title  132  -  Integrated Solid Waste  Management  Regulations,  and  includes  the requirement  for  a  detailed,  third-party  closure  cost  estimate,  proper  disposal  of  all  materials  or wastes left at the site, and post-closure care for the solid waste disposal area in compliance with the post-closure plan. Allowable mechanisms for financial assurance under the solid waste regulations include:

- · Trust Funds;
- · Surety Bonds Guaranteeing Payment or Performance;
- · Letters of Credit;
- · Insurance;
- · Corporate Financial Tests;
- · Local Government Financial Tests;
- · Corporate Guarantees; and/or
- · Local Government Guarantee.

At  this  time,  the  type  and  phased  amount  of  financial  surety  for  Elk  Creek  has  not  yet  been established, though the amount of bond will only reflect the liability on the ground at any given time (i.e., NioCorp should not be required to bond for reclamation of all of the TSF cells when only one will be active and unreclaimed at any time). The specific requirements will be refined through meetings and negotiations with the two agencies and the submission of formal permit applications.

## 20.4  Community Relations and Social Responsibilities

Community  relations  and  stakeholder  engagement  have  been  undertaken  in  parallel  with  field operations in Nebraska and have included town hall and individual meetings with local landowners. Some early communications have occurred between NioCorp and Johnson, Pawnee, Nemaha and Richardson County representatives (including the county commissioners) as well as the Southeast Nebraska Development District (SENDD). Given the accelerated schedule proposed by NioCorp for the  Project,  all  of  the  relevant  regulatory  agencies  will  need  to  be  formally  engaged  as  soon  as possible using the designs presented herein as the basis for permitting. Any significant deviations from this design, could, therefore, have an impact on overall Project timing.

NioCorp is committed to ensuring that a proper Social License is garnered from the community and stakeholders. Thus far, support for the Project has been positive from those who have been engaged and notified of the pending Project. However, as with any major mining project, there remain vocal opponents  and  non-governmental  organizations  (NGOs)  who  will  oppose  the  Project  on  principal alone.  These  groups  are  likely  to  include  organizations  such  as  Bold  Nebraska,  a  citizen  group focused on ' taking actions critical to protecting the Good Life .'  NioCorp has already engaged with Bold  Nebraska  in  early  discussions  about  the  Project  on  May  23,  2016,  and  has  kept  the  group informed of major developments over the past year.

## 20.4.1 Health and Safety

Occupational health and safety at the Project will be strictly  regulated  by  the  U.S.  Department  of Labor,  Mine  Safety  &amp;  Health  Administration  (MSHA),  under  Title  30  of  the  Code  of  Federal Regulations, Mineral Resources, Parts 1 through 199 (30 CFR Parts 1 through 199). This includes all of the training requirements specified in 30 CFR Parts 46 through 49. Given the radiological nature of

the mineralized material, MSHA will likely institute radon exposure and monitoring requirements on all underground workers in accordance with 30 CFR § 57.5039 thru § 57.5047.

Because Nebraska has not enacted any workplace safety and health rules, the federal Occupational Safety  and  Health  Act  (OSH  Act)  governs  workplace  health  and  safety  requirements  in  private (private  businesses  and  nonprofit  organizations)  sector  workplaces.  In  addition,  the  Nebraska Occupational  Safety  and  Health  Surveillance  Program  (NOSHP),  established  in  2010  under  the Nebraska  Department  of  Health  &amp;  Human  Services,  provides  state-based  occupational  health surveillance,  while  the  Nebraska  Department  of  Labor  (DOL)  Office  of  Safety  is  charged  with  the protection  of  people  and  property  through  enforcement  of  the  Nebraska  Amusement  Ride,  Boiler Inspection, and Conveyance Safety Acts. With respect to the Project, DOL safety staff will inspect boilers and pressure vessels to ensure that they are properly installed and maintained.

## 20.5  Reclamation and Closure

Without specific hardrock mining regulations, there are limited obligatory requirements for reclamation and closure of mining properties in Nebraska. There are provisions, however, within the applicable regulatory framework which are likely to be applied to the Project during the permit and licensing  processes,  specifically  those  associated  with  the  TSF.  The  following  sections  provide  a summary of the key elements to the approaches proposed for closure and reclamation of the Project, and form the basis for the closure cost estimate.

## 20.5.1 Surface Disturbance

The  principal  objective  of  the  surface  reclamation  plan  will  be  to  return  disturbed  lands  to  a productive post-mining land use. Soils, vegetation, wildlife and radiological baseline data will be used as  guidelines  for  the  design,  completion,  and  evaluation  of  surface  reclamation.  Final  surface reclamation will blend affected areas with adjacent undisturbed lands so as to re-establish original slope and topography and present a natural appearance. Surface reclamation efforts will strive to limit soil erosion by wind and water, sedimentation, and re-establish natural drainage patterns.

## 20.5.2 Buildings and Equipment

All  surface  structures  and  equipment  will  be  evaluated  for  appropriate  post-closure  re-use  or disposal. Buildings  and  equipment  will  be  decommissioned,  decontaminated  (as  necessary), dismantled, and either salvaged or disposed of in an appropriate on-site or off-site disposal facility.

All wells, including dewatering and production wells, monitoring wells, and any other wells within the Project  Area  used  for  the  collection  of  hydrologic  or  water  quality  data  or  incidental  monitoring purposes, will be properly abandoned in accordance with NDEQ and DNR requirements.

## 20.5.3 Tailings Disposal Facility

Since the definition of Solid Waste in Chapter 1 of Title 132 Integrated Solid Waste Management Regulations includes material generated from mining operations, the tailings disposal facilities at the Project  will  likely  be  subject  to  all  or  part  of  the  Title  132  regulations,  including  the  closure requirements. The design of the TSF cells allow for concurrent reclamation in order to reduce the amount of precipitation contact water that will require active management. Once a cell of the TSF has reached design capacity, it will be closed. For purposes of closure cost estimating and potential

future bonding requirements, this approach will assume that only one cell will be active at any given time  for  which  reclamation  (and  bonding)  may  be  required.  In  addition,  the  approach  to  TSF construction and material placement will allow the operator to concurrently close portions of each cell as they reach capacity.

The initial closure cover will consist of surface grading, and placement of a geomembrane liner over the  graded  tailings.  This  liner  requires  an  over-liner  drainage  system  that  discharges  to  the  outer slope of the embankment of each TSF cell, and placement of adequate thickness of cover to allow for  vegetation;  though  a  root  barrier  may  be  necessary  to  prevent  rooting  into  the  tailings.  With respect to post-closure requirements, operators of solid waste disposal areas shall provide for postclosure  care  for  a  period  of  at  least  30  years.  At  this  time,  there  is  no  anticipated  post-closure solution/draindown  management  consideration  for  the  TSF  cells  given  the  nature  of  the  tailings materials  and  the  conceptual  closure  approach.  This  approach  to  closure  of  the  TSF  cells  is considered conservative, and was selected to demonstrate feasibility and permit ability with respect to the NDEQ landfill regulations and on the advice of the agency. Given the current LoM expectation, additional  technologies  and/or  approaches  to  equally  effective  closure  options  may  likely  be developed prior to actual reclamation of the site.

## 20.5.4 Closure Cost Estimate

Closure costs for the Project, including estimates for post-closure monitoring and maintenance, have been estimated at just over US$39 million. This conservative approach and estimate consider the fact that: 1) none of the facilities are constructed (i.e., final actual configurations are unknown), 2) costs  for  materials  and  services  are  difficult  to  predict  30  years  in  advance,  and  3)  no  trade-off studies or final risk assessments have been performed on the closure approach (normally done later in the mine life).

## 20.6  International Standards and Guidelines

The  United  States  is  a  Designated  Country  with  respect  to  the  Equator  Principles.  Designated Countries  are  those  countries  deemed  to  have  robust  environmental  and  social  governance, legislation  systems,  and  institutional  capacity  designed  to  protect  their  people  and  the  natural environment (Equator Principles Association, 2011).

The current  release  of  the  Equator  Principles  (EP  III),  launched  on  June  4th,  2013,  covers  more projects  and  streamlines  the  process  to  focus  on  legal  compliance  in  Designated  Countries.  The reworded  Principle  3,  states  that:  'the  Assessment  process  should,  in  the  first  instance,  address compliance with relevant host country laws, regulations and permits that pertain to environmental and social issues.' This is in an effort to streamline assessments, especially in Designated Countries whose laws already meet the requirements of environmental and/or social assessments (Principle 2), management systems and plans (Principle 4), stakeholder engagement (Principle 5) and, grievance mechanisms  (Principle  6).  In  this  case,  an  evaluation  of  compliance  with  host  country  laws  is considered  sufficient. Elsewhere  (non-Designated  Countries),  compliance  with  the  applicable International Financing Corporation (IFC) Performance Standards (updated in January 2012) and the World  Bank  Group  Environmental,  Health  and  Safety  Guidelines  is  generally  required.  Other changes in EP III included:

- · public disclosure of the Environmental and Social Impact Assessment for the Project, or at a minimum, its summary statement;
- · analysis of alternatives to address greenhouse gas reductions;
- · in  non-designated countries, consideration of the new IFC Performance Standards around labor  standards,  and  occupational  health  and  safety  diligence  requirements  in  relation  to primary  supply  chain  employees  and  contracted  workers,  and  possibly  human  rights  due diligence  in  limited  'high  risk  circumstances'.  The  new  IFC  Performance  Standards  also require Informed Consultation and Participation of affected peoples, or even, Free Prior and Informed Consent for certain projects. This latter is stronger than most of the legally required consultation frameworks around the world.

At this stage, the Project is in compliance with EP III.

## 21 Capital and Operating Costs

## 21.1  Capital Cost Estimate - Initial &amp; Sustaining

Table  21-1  shows  the  breakout  in  LoM  initial  and  sustaining  capital  estimates  which  total US$1,505 million. An overall 11.1% contingency factor has been applied to the initial capital estimate while a smaller 1.4% contingency was applied to the sustaining capital estimate. The preproduction period is defined from June 2017 to the end of construction in December 2020 plus a three month ramp up period through the end of March 2021. Commercial production is then to be declared on April  1,  2021.  The  initial  capital  estimate  of  US$1,088  million  can  be  partially  offset  by  a  Gross Preproduction Revenue Credit of US$79 million (generated by preproduction product sales) to net to a cost of US$1,008 million.

## 21.1.1 Capitalized Preproduction Costs

Preproduction  costs  are  defined  as  production  operating  expenses  that  are  incurred  in  the preproduction period before the declaration of Commercial Production phase.

For the purposes of this study, the NioCorp finance team directed the Project team to categorize these costs as capital for taxation purposes which, per US federal tax rules, 70% of the annual cost can be expensed in year incurred with the remaining 30% of cost amortized over next five years.

Table  21-2  shows  the  breakout  between  the  different  operating  production  costs  incurred  from October,  2018  with  the  start  of  active  dewatering  activities  and  especially  in  the  six-month commissioning and ramp-up period from October 1, 2020 and March 31, 2021.

Consequently, all production operating costs incurred after the planned declaration of Commercial Production phase on April 1, 2021 are 100% expensed in the year incurred and fully deductible for taxation purposes.

A contingency is also included on sustaining capital only tailings to address construction unknowns.

## 21.1.10 Tailings and Tailings Water Management

## Basis

Capital cost for tailings facility construction was based on contractor estimates for earthworks and liner installation. Equipment for loading, hauling and placement of the tailings was quoted by a local equipment supplier. SRK developed some cost internally for items where no quotes were obtained. The SRK estimates were developed from recent and relevant costs on other projects or developed from first principles. Approximately 10% of the tailings facilities costs were from SRK estimates.

## Initial Capital

Tailings Plant Site Cell 1 is located directly east of the process plant site. Construction for the cell will occur during the summer and fall before the plant goes into production. Plant Site Cell 1 construction will  consist of approximately 465,000 m 3  of cut to fill earthworks and 111,000 m 2  of geomembrane installation for the tailings facility and associated storm water pond. The estimated costs, including earthworks, project management, piping and geosynthetic costs, and storm water management are summarized in Table 21-12.

In addition, the Project will haul and place the tailings. Tailings will be loaded from a storage area with  a  front  end  loader  and  hauled  by  articulating  trucks  to  the  tailings  cells.  The  tailings  will  be spread in thin lifts with a mid-size dozer and compacted with a soil compactor. Support equipment for these activities will include a 2,000 gallon water truck and a light plant. The cost of this equipment, based on budgetary pricing from a local equipment supplier, is shown on Table 21-13.

## Capital Contingency

Capital contingency was assigned, with some exceptions, on the following assumptions

- · 5% for equipment with quotes from supplier,
- · 10% for earthwork and liner with contractor quotes, and
- · 15% for items estimated from similar projects.

## 21.1.11 Active Dewatering Pond

The Active Dewatering Pond construction will be very similar to the construction of the tailings cell. Cost  for  similar  activities  from  the  tailings  cell  were  applied  to  the  Active  Dewatering  Pond. Contingencies were also estimated for this construction as they were for the tailings cell.

The  pond  construction  will  consist  of  approximately  134,000 m 3   of  cut  to  fill  earthworks  and 118,000 m 2  of geomembrane installation (double liner). The estimated costs for this facility, broken out by major components, are shown in Table 21-14. Construction of the Active Dewatering Pond is scheduled for 2017.

## 21.1.12 Temporary Waste Rock Storage Facility

The Temporary Waste Rock Storage Facility construction will be very similar to the construction of the tailings cell. Costs for similar activities from the tailings cell were applied to the Temporary Waste Rock Storage Facility. Contingencies were also estimated for this construction as they were for the tailings cell.

The storage facility construction will consist of approximately 16,600 m 3  of cut to fill earthworks and 69,900 m 2   of  geomembrane  installation.  The  estimated  costs  for  this  facility,  broken  out  by  major components, are shown in Table 21-15. Construction of the Temporary Waste Rock Storage Facility is scheduled for 2018.

## 21.1.13 Active Surface Mine Dewatering Wells and Pumps

The estimated capital cost for drilling, installation, development and step testing of a dewatering well with 316L SS screen is approximately US$2.8 million. Cost to equip a well with a pump and a fixed speed drive is estimated at US$396,900. Therefore, the cost per well is approximately US$3.2 million, based on quotes received.

A summary of capital costs for active dewatering (without contingency) is provided in Table 21-16.

## 21.1.14 Active Surface Mine Dewatering Pipeline

The road construction activity for the Active Surface Mine Dewatering Pipeline is very similar to the road construction activities for the tailings cell. Costs for the road construction from the tailings cell were  applied  to  the  Active  Surface  Mine  Dewatering  Pipeline.  The  cost  for  supply  and  installing piping material was based on recent and relevant construction pricing on a project in Nevada. It was assumed that pipeline construction would occur during construction of the Active Dewatering Pond and the mobilization and project management function would be covered under pond construction activity. Contingencies were also estimated for this construction as they were for the tailings cell.

The  pipeline  work  will  consist  of  approximately  5,150 m  of  152,  406,  or  610 mm  diameter  High Density Polypropylene (HDPE) pipe plus valves and steel manifolds. The estimated costs for these pipelines  and  access  roads,  broken  out  by  major  components,  are  shown  in  Table  21-17. Construction of the Active Surface Mine Dewatering Pipeline is scheduled for 2017.

## 21.1.16 Closure and Reclamation

## Closure Cost Basis

The closure cost estimate for the Project was developed using the Standardized Reclamation Cost Estimator (SRCE) (available at www.nvbond.org) and a user-defined cost data file (CDF). The inputs to the CDF were obtained from the following sources:

- · Equipment  costs  have  been  obtained  from  Gana  Trucking.  These  include  all-in  operator rates, fuel consumption, consumables, and preventive maintenance.
- · Given equipment hire costs include operator rates, labor rates are input separately only for non-operator rates.
- · Material costs have been obtained from current quotes, where available.

## Plant and Mine Facilities

Facilities  and  equipment  associated  with  the  underground  mine  and  processing  plant  will  be reclaimed as follows:

- · Plant site buildings will be decontaminated, the buildings will be demolished, and the debris hauled off-site.
- · Stockpile underliners will be removed and hauled to the underground for disposal.
- · Pond,  no  longer  in  use  will  have  sediment  and  liners  removed  and  hauled  to  the underground for disposal.
- · Residual  wastes  (solid  and/or  hazardous),  will  be  hauled  to  appropriate  off-site  disposal facilities.
- · The dewatering wells will be no longer required at the end of operations and will be plugged and abandoned.
- · Underground workings (production shafts and ventilation shafts) will be capped to prevent public access post-closure.
- · On-site water pipelines, such as the dewatering pipes, will be removed.
- · The discharge pipe to the Missouri River is, for the most part, buried. Portions of the pipe will be grouted and filled, approximately at every mile at road crossings. The diffuser in the river will be removed.
- · On-site powerlines within the Project boundary will be removed. The utility company will own the  substation  and  would  be  responsible  for  its  continued  use  or  demolition,  once  site operations are complete. The natural gas metering station on site that would be owned by a utility would also be managed in this fashion; and
- · General disturbances will be covered with growth media if necessary and revegetated.

## Tailings Storage Facility

The  TSF  consists  of  a  series  of  separate  impoundments  (cells)  for  which  the  exposed  tailings surface will be reclaimed as follows:

- · Subgrade preparation (i.e., tailings regrading, assumed to be part of the operational costs);
- · Synthetic liner installation;
- · Above-liner drainage layer construction (i.e., gravel drain layer)
- · Above-liner growth media layer placement;

- · Amendment of the growth media layer (scarification and nutrient addition) and placement of sod as an anti-erosion measure.

Reclamation will be carried out concurrently as each of the TSF cell reaches its design capacity.

## Post-Closure Monitoring

Monitoring is assumed to continue for 30 years after end of operations and includes baseline and radiochemical  profiles.  Monitoring  around  the  TSF  will  be  conducted  at  three  points.  Long-term management costs will be limited to the maintenance of a fence around the TSF, which is on private property, in perpetuity.

## 21.1.17 Sustaining Capital Costs

A contingency is included on sustaining capital only on tailings to address construction unknowns.

## Mining

Mining Sustaining capital is discussed in Section 21.1.2. The sustaining capital is in the categories of capital development, mine mobile equipment, and mine other.

## Process and Infrastructure

The sustaining capital for process plants, buildings and infrastructure was estimated using a ratio to the direct cost Capital Costs. This ratio has been set to zero from year 1 to 5 and then ramped up to its maximum value between years 6 to 30 of the Project life. The ratio is decreasing year 29 and 30 and set at zero for years 31 and 32. Table Table 21-19 presents the sustaining capital for process and infrastructure.

## Tailings and Tailings Water Management

A  new  tailings  facility  (Plant  Site  Cell  2)  will  be  needed  in  2023  and  that  facility  will  have  to  be expanded (Cell 3) in 2030. When Plant Site Cell 3 in nearly full, a separate facility will be constructed in  'Area 7' in 2038. The Area 7 facility is designed to handle all the remaining tails for life of the Project.  Based  on  preliminary  designs,  the  construction  cost  of  these  facilities  is  shown  in  Table 21-20.

Equipment  to  load,  haul  and  place  tailings  will  be  replaced  over  the  life  of  the  Project.  It  was assumed that the mobile equipment would be replaced at 40,000 machine hours, with the articulating trucks and the soil compactor replaced at 30,000 machine hours. Light plants are replaced at 10,000 hours. Area 7 will require hauling tailings on Nebraska highway 50. When the Area 7 tailings facility goes into service, a contractor will be used to haul the tailings using over the road trucks. The Project will load the contractor's trucks and be responsible for spreading and compacting the tailings. Table 21-21 shows the estimated LoM replacement cost of the tailings placement mobile equipment.

## Active Water System

SRK has assumed that two wells will need to be replaced every 10 years (four wells total), however empirical information during operations will determine the necessity and frequency of replacement. In addition, because the last two dewatering wells are installed after mine production begins, these two wells are considered sustaining Capital Costs.

## Waterline to Missouri

The repairs and replacements are included in operating cost.

## 21.2  Operating Cost Estimate

Table 21-22 summarizes the operating costs estimate by area which equals US$168.52/t ore. These unit rates are stated on a RoM basis where the costs are estimated from 2022 through 2051 period and do not include the first or last years of production nor preproduction and post closure Operating

Costs. LoM operating costs include the preproduction, post closure, and first/last years of production. This basis is used in order to give a more representative measurement of anticipated costs during normal operating conditions.

## 21.2.1 Mining

Mine  operating  costs  for  the  LoM  are  US$39.43/t  of  ore  produced.  Table  21-23  summarizes  the breakdown by mine production activities and shows the general services costs and labor that are allocated over all the tonnage produced. These costs include the cost to drill, blast, install ground support,  load  and  haul,  crush  and  handle  materials  to  the  surface,  ventilation,  pumping,  general maintenance, technical services, backfill, and mine management. The operating cost varies by year, by mine  location and  production.  The  annual  operating  cost  varies  by  year  but averages approximately US$39 million per year over the LoM. The mining operating cost is based on a Q2 2017 cost basis.

## 21.2.2 Process

The annual LoM operating costs for the Process and Infrastructure portion of the plant is estimated at  US$111.56/t  of  mineralized  material  processed.  This  estimate  includes  four  major  areas  of  the surface plant; Mineral Processing, Hydrometallurgical Plant, Pyrometallurgical Plant and Infrastructure. The estimate for each of these four areas was developed by determining the required quantities of manpower, energy (natural gas, electrical power, and fuel) reagents, consumables and other general costs required for one year of operation and then applying current unit cost and feed rates to develop an annual operating cost for each area. These costs were then used to calculate other  valuable  metrics  such  as  dollars-per-ton-milled.  Table  21-25  summarizes  the  costs  for  each area.

The Site G&amp;A labor costs as shown in Table 21-2 of US$6.7 million per year are derived by the 80.5 staff  headcount  as  shown  in  Table  21-28.  The  overall  organizational  chart  for  the  entire operation during LoM is shown in Figure 21-1. The Site G&amp;A numbers do not include any mining or any  direct  processing  operations  or  maintenance  staff.  However,  both  Processing  Overhead  and Technical Services that roll up in the Site G&amp;A area are grouped within mining and processing areas in the organizational chart for simplicity.

In  terms  of  fixed  costs,  SRK  developed  allowances  for  each  category  based  on  experience  from similar  US  mining  projects  (Table  21-29).  The  average  annual  Site  G&amp;A  fixed  cost  (non-labor) estimate is US$1.7 million per year. The Project is somewhat unique that although it is located in a rural area in southeastern Nebraska, it is only one hour drive from the city of Omaha, an eight minute drive to a 40 bed county hospital, and has a high capacity fiber optic trunk bypassing the property on the adjacent county road.

## 21.2.4 Tailings and Tailings Water Management

## Tailings Operating Costs

During  tailings  disposal  at  the  Plant  Site  TSFs,  tailings  will  be  loaded  from  a  stockpile  near  the backfill  plant  and  hauled  to  the  tailing  storage  facility  in  30  ton  articulating  trucks.  In  order  to maximize the density, the tailings will be dozed into thin lifts and compacted using a soil compactor.

Tailings  storage  at  the  batch  plant  is  limited,  so  costs  for  tailings  placement  were  estimated  by assuming  that  the  work  will  be  completed  on  a  10  hour  shift,  7  days  per  week.  Two  crews  of operators, consisting of four persons per crew, will alternate on a 4 days on, 4 days off schedule. Each crew will  consist  of  two  equipment  operators  and  two  truck  drivers.  Half  of  the  year  it  was assumed that there would be a full time water truck driver. One equipment operator will run the front end  loader  to  load  the  trucks.  The  second  operator  will  alternate  between  the  dozer  and  soil compactor at the tailings cell. Alignment of the work schedules for tailings personnel with the balance of mine and plant operational schedules will be evaluated at the detailed design stage.

Truck productivity was calculated using Caterpillar Inc.'s Fleet Production and Cast Analysis (FPC) software to determine the haul times required the trucks to place the tailings. Parameters used in determining the haulage requirements to Plant Site Cell 1 are shown in Table 21-30. This analysis shows  that  two  trucks  are  capable  of  handling  the  amount  of  tailings  produced  with  sufficient capacity in case of equipment downtime.

Plant Site Cells 2 and 3 have longer haul distance, but the equipment fleet will be able to handle the additional haulage cycle time.

Equipment operating costs were obtained using Costmine, modified for fuel pricing. Operating cost includes  cost  for  major  component  rebuild.  Adjusted  equipment  hourly  costs  are  shown  in  Table 21-31.

Costs were calculated on a period basis. It was assumed that all tailings haulage operators would be paid based on working a full 10 hour shift every day of the period. Equipment utilization factors were assumed for each equipment type. Table 21-32 shows the utilization factors for equipment usage.

Table 21-32: Tailings Mobile Equipment Utilization

| Equipment Type      | Utilization   |
|---------------------|---------------|
| Loader              | 80%           |
| Dozer               | 45%           |

In Year 19 when tailings disposal moves to the Area 7 TSF, highway trucks will be required when hauling tailings to Area 7 (instead of the articulating trucks used for disposal in the Plant Site TSFs). A quote was received from a contractor to tailings haulage only for US$2.55/t tailings. NioCorp will be responsible to load the contractor's trucks and to spread and compact the tailings.

Estimated costs for tailings loading, haulage and placement are shown in Table 21-33.

## 21.3  Basis of Estimate

The cost basis is Q2-1017.

## Mining, Process, and Infrastructure Capital Costs

The  mining  Capital  Costs  were  developed  including  a  combination  of  vendor  and  contractor quotations, first principles buildup, allowances, and historical database costs. The estimates include labor,  materials,  equipment  purchase  and  operation  cost,  rental  equipment,  supplies,  freight,  and energy. The costs developed include direct and indirect costs and included separate contingencies on  both.  Equipment  purchase  includes  freight,  an  allowance  for  transporting  underground,  initial training and commissioning.

## Tailings and Tailings Water Management Capital Costs

Capital cost for tailings facility construction was based on contractor estimates for earthworks and liner installation. Equipment for loading, hauling and placement of the tailings was quoted by a local equipment supplier. SRK developed some cost internally for items where no quotes were obtained.

The SRK estimates were developed from recent and relevant costs on other projects or developed from first principles. Approximately 10% of the tailings facilities costs were from SRK estimates.

## Active Surface Dewatering Wells and Pumps Capital Costs

The  active  dewatering  Capital  Costs  were  developed  including  a  combination  of  vendor  and contractor  quotations,  first  principles  buildup,  allowances,  and  historical  database  costs.  The estimates  include  labor,  materials,  equipment  purchase  and  operation  cost.  The  costs  developed include direct and indirect costs and included separate contingencies on both.

## Waterline to Missouri Capital Costs

The capital costs for the waterline are described herein.

Waterline: Prices  were  derived  by  obtaining  material  supplier's  quotes  for  pipe  material  including freight  and  fusion  of  the  pipe,  and  additional  costs  were  added  to  the  supplier's  quotes  including excavation, backfill, installation of pipe, haul-off of excess soils, bedding materials, equipment, and labor.  Bore  with  casing  and  horizontal  directional  drilling  (HDD)  costs  were  derived  by  review  of recent bid results from projects of similar size and nature.

Pump  Stations: Prices  were  derived  by  obtaining  quotes  from  manufacturers  for  pre-packaged pump station  packages.  The  pre-packed  station,  concrete  footings,  pump  station  installation,  site clearing and grading, and site fencing are included in the cost for the pump stations.

Backup  Emergency  Power: The  backup  emergency  power  costs  were  derived  by  obtaining equipment quotes from NMC out of Omaha and using the Mean's Estimating guide for installation for generators  sized  as  required  to  provide  power  based  upon  the  horsepower  assumptions  at  each pump  station,  excluding  the  pump  station  at  the  mine  site.  The  costs  include  automatic  transfer switch, concrete foundation, and installation.

Mixing Diffuser at the River Discharge :  The  cost  associated  with  the  diffuser  includes  the  prefabricated diffuser assembly and the installation of the diffuser within the Missouri River. The cost identified within the budget for this item is based upon quotes from AE2S..

Surge Protection within Waterline: The cost associated with surge protection along the waterline includes an assumption that surge protection devices will include a combination of pressure/surge relief  valves,  pressurized  surge  tanks,  pump  station  bypasses,  and/or  surge  towers.  The  costs  of these  individual  items  vary  but  the  average  cost  of  the  devices  will  be  in  the  range  of  our assumptions.  It  is  anticipated  that  one  surge  control  device  will  be  required  between  each  of  the booster stations for a total of four surge protection devices.

## Closure and Reclamation

The closure cost estimate for the Project was developed using the Standardized Reclamation Cost Estimator (SRCE) (available at www.nvbond.org) and a user-defined cost data file (CDF). The inputs to the CDF were obtained from the following sources:

- · Equipment  costs  have  been  obtained  from  Gana  Trucking.  These  include  all-in  operator rates, fuel consumption, consumables, and preventive maintenance.
- · Given equipment hire costs include operator rates, labor rates are input separately only for non-operator rates.
- · Material costs have been obtained from current quotes, where available.

## Mining Operating Costs

Mining operating cost was developed from first principles and includes equipment operating costs, labor,  materials,  and  contract  labor  estimates.  Vendor  quotations  for  high  use  materials  were obtained  that  included  freight.  Explosives  include  an  adder  for  offsite  storage  and  delivery. Productivity information  was  developed  based  on  first  principles  for  the mining  tasks.  The productivities were applied to the mine physical quantities to develop equipment operating hours for the mine fleet. The required labor was developed based on mine plan requirements for equipment and material movements. The mine plan quantities also dictated the material quantities required and unit pricing based on vendor quotes were applied to determine material costs. Equipment hours were determined for each month, quarter or year based on the mine quantities to in the mine plan. Unit operating  rates  per  hour  were  applied  generating  a  cost  per  period  for  equipment  operation. Maintenance supplies and labor as well as management and technical personnel were included in the mining cost. A unit cost for backfill was developed and included in the mine operating cost. The costs vary by year based on production requirements. Haulage distance was  taken into consideration on haulage costs. No contingency was applied to mine operating costs.

## Process Plants Operating Costs

The  annual  process  operating  costs  were  determined  by  estimating  the  required  quantities  of manpower,  natural  gas,  electrical  power,  reagents,  and  consumables  required  for  one  year  and applying current unit cost rates to develop an annual operating cost for each area.

## Site G&amp;A Operating Costs

The  annual  Site  G&amp;A  operating  costs  were  determined  by  estimating  the  required  quantities  of manpower  and  using  allowances  for  fixed  costs  such  as  consumables,  supplies,  etc.,  based  on SRK's experience with analogous projects and discussions with NioCorp Project team members.

## Owner's Costs Capital Costs

The  Owner's  Capital  Costs  were  estimated  mainly  from  allowances  based  on  Tetra  Tech's experience with analogous projects and discussions with NioCorp Project team members.

## Tailings and Tailings Water Management Operating Costs

Basis of the tailings operating cost include the following cost items supplied by the client:

- · Hourly wage rate for equipment operator and truck driver: US$23.29/hour
- · Labor burden: 35.91%
- · Diesel fuel: US$1.66/gallon
- · Equipment operating cost developed from Infomine Costmine (2016)

Additionally,  Tailings  operating  cost  for  haulage  from  the  plant  site  to  Area  7  TSF  are  based  on quotes provided by Gana Construction.

## Waterline to Missouri Operating Costs

The operating cost is based on vendor suggested operating and replacement costs and first principal estimate.

## 22 Economic Analysis

## 22.1  Principal Assumptions and Parameters

## 22.1.1 Introduction

The indicative economic results summarized in this section are based upon work performed by SRK and NioCorp in 2017. They have been prepared on both a periodic monthly/quarterly format and an annual format. The metrics reported in this volume are based on the annual cash flow model results. The metrics are on both a pre-tax and after-tax basis; a 100% equity basis with no Project financing inputs; and are in Q2 2017 U.S. constant dollars.

Key criteria  used  in  the  analysis  are  discussed  in  detail  throughout  this  section.  Principal  Project assumptions used are shown summarized in Table 22-1.

Table 22-1: General Assumptions

| Description                  | Value    |
|------------------------------|----------|
| Pre-Production Period        | 4 years  |
| Process Plant Life           | 32 years |
| Mine Operating Days per Year | 365      |
| Mill Operating Days per Year | 365      |
| Discount Rate                | EOP @ 8% |
| Commercial Production Year   | 2021     |

Source: SRK, 2017

All costs incurred prior to June 2017 are considered sunk with respect to this analysis.

The selected Project discount rate is 8% as directed by NioCorp and the valuation uses standard end of-period discounting. A sensitivity analysis of the discount rate is discussed later in this section.

Foreign  exchange  impacts  were  deemed  negligible  as  most,  if  not  all  costs  and  revenues  are denominated in US dollars.

The major criteria adopted to define when the Project will enter into Commercial Production include the following: (1) all major capital expenditures to bring the mine to nameplate capacity have been completed;  (2)  the  process  plant  and  other  facilities  have  been  transferred  to  the  control  of  the Operations  team  from  the  Commissioning  team;  (3)  the  plant  has  reached  80%  of  initial  design capacity; (4) product recoveries are at or near expected levels; (5) the mine has the ability to sustain ongoing  production  of  ore  at  the  required  CoG;  and  (6)  costs  are  under  control  or  within expectations.

The following is a breakdown of netback pricing assumptions for each commodity:

## Niobium

- · Ferroniobium (65% Nb) concentrate product (FeNb product) with constant LoM Benchmark/Provisional Price of US$40/kg Nb;
- · All FeNb product is transported in paletted 1 t supersacks in 20 ft standard containers with capacity of 17.5 t;
- · All FeNb product destined for southern US destinations are trucked directly from site (2 days travel time);
- · All FeNb product destined for European destinations are transported in 175 t lot size (17.5 t container x 10 containers). Product is first trucked from site to Omaha, NE railhead, railed through Chicago, IL hub to Norfolk, VA port (10 days travel time). Once loaded, the ship will take indirect route back to Europe (30 days travel time);
- · All  settlement  Nb  prices  have  a  3.75%  discount  to  the  netback  price  of  benchmark  price minus Buyers Logistics Costs (BLC) except with customers buying on spot pricing; and
- · All FeNb product purchases have a 10 Net Days Outstanding (NDO) After Delivery term for approximately 85% of the purchase with another 50 days NDO after the first payment.

At the time of this report, the Project had two committed offtake customers signed up for 10 year terms with all remaining annual FeNb production sold on spot basis:

- · Buyer #1 - US-based metals trader with mill operations around the southern half of the US:
- o 10 year commitment to purchase 25% of annual offtake production to a maximum of 1,875 t/y;
- o Assume  80%  of  FeNb  product  trucked  directly  to  customer  mills  in  southern  US within 1,000 mile radius at US$0.065 per short ton-mile (round trip);
- o Remaining 20% of FeNb product shipped from to Rotterdam Port at US$2,627/container; and
- o For  accounts  receivable  (A/R)  purposes,  the  weighted  average  NDO  for  the  first payment is 19.6 days.
- · Buyer #2 - European-based manufacturer with global mill operations:
- o 10 year commitment to purchase 50% of annual offtake production to a maximum of 3,750 t/y;
- o Assume 80% of FeNb product shipped from site to Bremerhaven Port, Germany at cost of US$2,627/container.
- o Remaining 20% of FeNb product trucked directly to customer mills in southern US within 1000 mile radius at US$0.065 per short ton-mile (round trip).
- o For A/R purposes, the weighted average NDO for the first payment is 42.2 days.
- · Spot  Buyer  -  It  is  assumed  that  all  annual  FeNb  production  not  sold  under  an  offtake agreement is sold at spot (or benchmark) pricing of constant US$40/kg Nb on an ex-mine gate basis with a 10 day NDO A/R term.

Based on these pricing assumptions, the average realized LoM Nb price is US$39.60/kg.

## Titanium Dioxide

- · No offtake agreements have been negotiated at the time of writing this report;
- · It  is  assumed  that  all  annual  TiO2  production  is  sold  at  spot  (or  benchmark)  pricing  of constant US$0.88/kg on an ex-mine gate basis with a 10 days NDO A/R term.

## Scandium Trioxide

- · No offtake agreements have been negotiated at the time of writing this report;
- · It is assumed that all annual production is sold at spot (or benchmark) pricing on an ex-mine gate basis with a 10 days NDO A/R term; and
- · Based on these pricing assumptions, the average realized LoM Sc2O3 price in US$3,675/kg.

## 22.1.4 Operating Costs

Operating cost metrics in the technical economic model are reported on a RoM basis meaning that all costs and mined/processed tonnes starting from the first day of commercial production (April 1, 2021 for the Project) through the end of operations in 2052 are included in the metric. Conversely, all operating costs incurred during the preproduction period from January 1, 2017 through March 31, 2021  are  recategorized  as  capital  in  the  technical  economic  model  and  not  included  in  the  RoM operating cost metric.

The total RoM operating cost unit rate of US$180.97/t processed is summarized in Table 22-7. This amount differs from the Operating Costs unit rate of US$168.51 discussed in Section 21.2 as this table includes concentrate freight and property tax costs in the Others category.

- *Revenue from sales occurring during commissioning and ramp-up phases
- **Does not include Initial Working Capital (A/R, A/P, &amp; Inv) of $30 million in Years -1 and +1

An estimate of US$30 million of working capital is estimated for the last year before and first year of commercial production. The assumptions used for this estimate are as follows:

- · Accounts Receivable (A/R) - commodity/offtake agreement specific (see Revenue section);
- · Accounts Payable (A/P) - 30 day delay; and
- · Consumable Inventory - 60 day supply

Annual  adjustments  to  working  capital  levels  are  made  in  the  technical  economic  model  with  all working capital recaptured by the end of the mine life resulting in a LoM net free cash flow (FCF) impact of US$0.

## 22.2  Cashflow Forecasts and Annual Production Forecasts

Cashflow Forecasts are summarized on a LoM basis in this section while a full LoM annual Cashflow model is presented in Appendix D.

The technical economic model metrics are prepared on an annual pre-tax and after-tax basis, the results of which are summarized in Table 22-10. Based on current assumptions and design listed in this report, the Project returns a pre-tax NPV 8% of US$2,291 million and an IRR of 24.3% along with an after-tax NPV 8% of US$1,666 million and IRR of 21.7%.

Figure 22-2 presents annual pre-tax and after-tax free cash flow versus payable Nb production and shows that the Project is expected to generate a stable positive pre-tax free cash flow of US$350 to US$400 million per year and after-tax free cash flow of US$250 to $300 million per year through the LoM.

Table 22-11 shows the build-up of a RoM average C1 cost of US$37.56/kg Nb net of a US$2.19/kg Nb TiO2  by-product  credit  over  the  operational  life.  By  converting  the  Sc2O3  production  to  an  Nb equivalent (NbEq) basis, the RoM average C1 cost is US$12.14/kg NbEq net of a US$0.71/kg NbEq TiO2 by-product credit over the 32-year life of the Project.

Figure 22-3 shows the annual C1 costs against an overall average RoM C1 cost of US$37.56/kg Nb over the 32-year LoM at an annual production rate of 4,500 t/y Nb. The spike in C1 costs in the last year  of  production  in  2052  (which  is  not  included  in  the  RoM  metric)  is  common  in  most  mine operations where lower production volumes combined with carrying some amount of annual fixed production costs causes the unit cost to spike compared to the average RoM or even LoM cost.

## 22.3  Taxes, Royalties and Other Interests

Due to the Project's location in a rural area of Nebraska with little industrial activity, a comprehensive taxation methodology was developed for the technical economic model by SRK with the assistance of NioCorp's finance staff to correctly model the impacts of various government tax incentives.

The  assumptions  used  in  the  methodology  are  described  in  this  section  whereas  a  full  taxation model is shown in Appendix E. The main taxation assumptions are as follows:

- · Taxes calculation is on an annual basis;
- · Corporate Income Tax (CIT) rates are 35% for Federal and 7.81% for Nebraska;
- · Federal taxable income is subject to Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) of 20%;
- · County property tax based on end of year value of Project, net of capital improvements and depreciation  taken,  multiplied  by  0.017292.  A  10  year  tax  abatement  has  also  been negotiated with the county tax authority;
- · Net Operating Losses (NOL) are carried forward indefinitely and can be used up to 100% of annual positive taxable income per period;
- · Federal Depletion allowance is calculated using co-product percentage depletion method as it was determined that the cost depletion method would be too small compared to the former method. The percentage depletion rates applied against Gross Income from Mining (subject to 50% of Net Income from Mining limit) are:
- o Nb - 22%
- o TiO2 - 22%
- o Sc2O3 - 14%
- · Tax Depreciation allowance is calculated each year by the following methods:
- o Mining  Development/Capitalized  Preproduction  Costs:  70%  of  cost  expensed  in  year incurred and remaining 30% amortized over 5 years;
- o Mine Fleet  Equipment:  7  year  Modified  Accelerated  Cost  Recovery  System  (MACRS) depreciation starting in year when cost is incurred;
- o Plant: 7 year MACRS depreciation starting in first year of commercial production; and
- o Infrastructure: 10  year MACRS  depreciation  starting  in first year of commercial production;
- · Federal Domestic Productions Activities  Deduction (DPAD) is  calculated  for each  year by determining the larger of:
- o 9% of net taxable income amount; and
- o 50% of total direct mining/processing salaries and wages cost.
- · Two tax credits available to the Project include:
- o Federal Domestic Research and Development (R&amp;D) tax credit calculated each year taking 20% of Qualified Expenditures (defined as ~3.6% of annual processing labor costs allocated to R&amp;D-type activities); and
- o Nebraska  Investment  Tax  Credit  (ITC)  is  applied  against  NE  state  income  tax payable  from  a  beginning  balance  of  US$132.5  million  based  on  a  formula incorporating development capital spent in area to date.

The Project is subject to a private 3 rd   party  'NSR' royalty  of  2%.  In  SRK's  opinion,  this  royalty  is better defined as a 'Net Proceeds' royalty as annual operating costs are deducted along with the usual freight/insurance costs.

The calculated effective income tax rate for the Project is 24.1% (CIT Payable/Adjusted EBITDA).

There is a US$4.76 million reclamation bond premium payable on the Project to be paid quarterly in a three year period from 2023 through 2025.

## 22.4  Sensitivity Analysis

Sensitivity analyses for key operational parameters and commodity prices are shown on a pre-tax and after-tax basis in Figure 22-4 through Figure 22-6. Not surprisingly, the Project is nominally most sensitive to Sc2O3 and Nb prices, whereas capital cost and operating cost sensitivities are similar.

The Project NPV is most sensitive to changes in Sc2O3 and Nb pricing as shown in Figure 22-4. It should  also  be  noted  that  on  a  pre-tax  basis,  operating  costs  have  a  slightly  greater  effect  than capital costs, but on an after-tax basis both have equal effect.

Figure 22-5 shows that the Project IRR is again most sensitive to changes in Sc2O3 and Nb prices on both a pre-tax and after-tax basis but capital costs clearly have a greater effect than operating costs.

Discount rate sensitivity is always important in a Project valuation, and with respect to this Project there is a complex process plant flow sheet and market uncertainty to account for. NPV profile charts are  presented  in  Figure  1-4,  which  shows  pre  and  after  tax  NPV  results  for  100  basis  point increments  between  0%  and  20%.  It  should  be  noted  that  with  current  assumptions,  the  Project breaks even at a ~20% hurdle rate on an after tax basis.

## 24.1  Project Implementation Plan

The key Project objectives are to:

- · Complete the Project on time and on budget;
- · Ensure that no one gets hurt and the environment is protected during Project execution;
- · Ensure compliance with all applicable laws and regulations;
- · Ensure positive economic impacts for SE Nebraska, including the use of local businesses wherever feasible, the employment of local residents and tax benefits for local governments.
- · Maintain a high level of engagement and communication with Stakeholders;
- · Ensure  the  Project  meets  design  parameter  objectives;  throughput,  quality  and  operating budget objectives

The  PIP  execution  is  based  on  use  of  two  EPCM  contractors.  One  with  responsibilities  for  the underground related work and the second with site-wide surface responsibilities. Certain portions of the  work  will  be  performed  with  EPC  contracts  awarded  to  specialty  contractors  for  process  and technology related packages, such as the acid plant. This approach is reflected in the capital cost estimate for the Project.

## 24.1.1 Project Cost Objectives

Table  24-1  presents  the  cost  of  the  Project  by  main  category  of  work.  The  cost  objective  of  the Project  is  to  reach  80%  of  production  capacity  within  the  total  cost  of  US$1,009  million  as summarized below. Numbers are rounded to the nearest thousand.

## 24.1.8 Construction Management

The EPCM  contractor will manage  construction management  functions including planning, organizing,  and  resolving  issues  involving  the  site  contractors.  Ensuring  that  contractors'  work  is performed according to the  Project's safety, quality, schedule, and cost requirements. Additionally, the EPCM contractor will provide  the  facilities and services, including security,  to  support  the  Work Contractors.  This  practice  ensures that quality standards are maintained, and improves the use of shared resources and equipment. The primary functions performed include planning and coordination,  contractor  management,  quality  assurance,  resolving  design  engineering  issues, quantity measurement, and materials management.

## 24.1.9 Commissioning, Operational Readiness, and Early Operations

## Commissioning

The  Owner's  team  will  be  responsible  for  commissioning.  The  owner  will  develop  a  detailed commissioning plan prior to the start of commissioning that will address the following:

- · Lists of Handover Packages &amp; Commissioning Systems
- · Transition process
- · Commissioning Sequence
- · Alignment of Boundaries between Handover Packages and Construction Work Packages
- · Commissioning Schedule
- · Roles and Responsibilities
- · Scope of Work Alignment
- · HES Management for Commissioning
- · Handover Documentation
- · Vendor Management
- · Monitoring of Inspection and Testing done by work Contractors
- · Commissioning Deficiencies
- · Acceptance process
- · Reporting

The owner's team will partner with key vendors to complete the commissioning effort to hand over the Project to operating personnel for early operations and ramp up.

## Operational Readiness and Ramp-up

Two Operations Readiness Plans will be prepared: the first Plan will be specific to the operation of the mine; the second Plan will be specific to the surface plant.

Training  on  equipment  (both  factory-based  and  on-site)  will  be  provided  by  vendors.  Request  for quotations will require all vendors to supply Operation and Maintenance manuals, lists of spare parts

for the first year of operation, list of commissioning spare parts, and training manuals. Vendors may be requested to perform onsite training based on complexity of the equipment and/or its controls.

Ramp-up consist of bringing the plant production from First Metal, achieved by commissioning of the plant, up to 80% of commercial capacity. For the purpose of ramp-up, commercial capacity involves the production of Superalloy materials at 80% of the facility nameplate capacity, in sellable quality.

NioCorp internal resources will execute the ramp-up under the responsibility of the Owner's Team.

## Early Operations

The Project has a number of early operation tasks that will be operating during the construction of the remaining facilities on the Project. These areas include:

- · Dewatering wells;
- · Water pipeline to the Missouri River;
- · Mine electrical substation and later the Plant main electrical sub-station;
- · Natural Gas distribution;
- · Temporary and permanent electrical distribution; and
- · Water Treatment Plant.

Specific  areas  may  be  operated  and  maintained  by  internal  Project  staff  or  by  third-party  Work Contractors to be decided on a case by case basis. Early Operations activities are included through the completion of the Project.

## 24.2  Opportunities and Risk Assessment

A two-day opportunity / risk session was conducted for this FS as a first step of a risk management process  which  requires  continuous  planning,  assessment  and  response  to  risks,  throughout  all phases of the Project.

## 24.2.1 Opportunities

Opportunities  were  identified  during  the  review  session.  However,  no  significant  changes  were required.  The  proposed  layout  was  found  adequate  for  construction  even  if  optimization  could  be done.  Nothing  was  mentioned  adding  a  significant  value  at  this  stage  to  improve  the  Project execution strategy, improve the schedule and improve the site layout taking into consideration the construction schedule, temporary facilities and laydown areas.

The following opportunities have been considered in cost estimating:

- · Use the Hydromet and Mineral Plant buildings for tanks fabricated on site;
- · Consider a surface-based storm water drainage.

The following opportunities will be considered in the EPCM phase:

- · Mineral Processing and Pyromet buildings: stick built building vs prefab building
- · Hydromet building: stick built first story and prefab second
- · Quality:  specialized  contractor  for  installation  of  the  liner  in  tailing  and  active  dewatering pond;
- · Environmental protection: environmental barrier at ground level during construction.

- · Update  Paste  Backfill  Cement  Content  based  on  additional  testing  and  evaluate  lower cement content.

## 24.2.2 Risks

47 execution risks and 40 operation risks were identified during our review session. The risks were then rated and those that ranked high or very high were discussed to be re-rated after mitigation measures are applied.

Figure 24-3 shows the risk profile summary. Overall, the following risks were identified:

- · 21 low risks;
- · 61 medium risks; and
- · 5 high risks.

## Scandium Market Development and Sales Plan

NioCorp  has  been  working  with  a  Scandium  industry  expert,  Dr.  Andrew  Matheson  of  ONG Commodities, to help expand our current target list of prospective Sc customers and distributors. Dr. Matheson's  in-depth  knowledge  of  Sc  markets,  applications,  and  industry  contacts  has  been invaluable  to  date  as  we  continue  to  identify  customers  for  our  Sc  product.  He  also  is  assisting NioCorp  in  its  communications  about  the  large  potential  of  Scandium  markets  with  interested investors and with U.S. government officials.

NioCorp is working with 10 potential customers at the time of writing, and discussions with these potential  customers  are  proceeding  under  the  provisions  of  Non-Disclosure  Agreements  (NDAs). These potential customers can be separated into the following categories or final end products:

- 1. Scandium/Aluminum  alloys  used  in  aerospace,  automotive,  and  other  applications  to increase  strength  and  allow  for  reduction  of  weight.  Interested  customers  are  situated  at various  points  in  the  supply  chains  for  aerospace  manufacturing  and  operation;  specialty alloy manufacturing; and specialty minerals and metal brokers/distributors.
- 2. Solid  Oxide  Fuel  Cells.  Scandium  is  used  in  the  electrolyte  of  solid  oxide  fuel  cells  to increase the conductivity at lower temperatures, allowing for higher efficiency and longer life. Discussions with interested customers in this industry and its supply chains are continuing.

NioCorp has produced a small quantity of 99.9% pure Scandium Trioxide during lab pilot testing  which  meets  or  exceeds  the  purity  needed  for  virtually  all  mainstream  commercial applications.  This  material  has  been  sent,  and  will  continue  to  be  sent,  to  interested customers for their analysis.

The U.S. Congress is currently on track to  approve  an  initiative  contained  in  the  FY2018 National Defense Authorization Act that is aimed at raising the profile of NioCorp's domestic

Sc  production  with  the  U.S.  Department  of  Defense  (DoD)  and  with  the  many  defense contractors who supply the DoD with technologies and platforms that could incorporate Sc. NioCorp is in talks with the DoD about how the Department can help to ensure the onset of U.S. production of Sc.

NioCorp's overall objective during the six months immediately following the issuance of the project's Feasibility Study is to complete offtake agreements for a minimum of 25% of the projected annualized Sc2O3 production from the Project.

## 25 Interpretation and Conclusions

## 25.1  Geology &amp; Resources

SRK has constructed mineralization models for the deposit, based upon all of the available drilling information. Modeling has initially been completed in Leapfrog® by modeling the grade shells at 0.3, 0.4,  0.5  Nb2O5%  intervals.  The  use  of  structural  trends  has  been  utilized  to  mimic  the  geological interpretation and the grade shells have been cross checked against the geological interpretation to select the optimum parameters.

SRK has undertaken a statistical study of the data, which demonstrates adequate splitting/domaining of the deposit. High grade statistical outliers have been controlled in the estimation through grade capping. SRK has undertaken a geostatistical study to investigate the niobium grade continuity which showed  minor  changes  to  the  parameters  used  in  2014.  The  semi-variograms  remain  to  have  a relatively short first range of between 7 to 20 m, with the maximum range of influence of 80 to 110 m along strike and 60 m down-dip.

SRK has interpolated Nb2O5 grade data using OK into a block model of dimensions 5 m x 15 m x 5 m (based on an assumed mining unit) and using appropriate search and estimation parameters were then  tested  for  sensitivity  to  the  estimation  process.  The  resultant  block  model  has  been  fully validated and no material bias identified.

SRK  has  classified  the  Mineral  Resource  in  the  Indicated  (51%)  and  Inferred  (49%)  Mineral Resource categories, mainly on the basis of the geological and grade continuity and the relatively wide drillhole spacing of up to 60 to 120 m on average. Additional Inferred material has been added to the geological model as a result of the Phase II and III drilling programs, at the end of the deposit and by increasing the model at depth, with the deeper vertical holes completed. The deposit remains open both along strike to the northwest and southeast and at depth as well as in the center, which SRK considers to have the best possibility to add additional material to the mine plan in the short term. The highest grades are associated with mineralization at depth and there remains potential to increase the current Mineral Resource further.

The Mineral Resource Estimate has been defined based on an NSR CoG to reflect the increased knowledge in the processing methodology and the assumed revenue streams from Nb2O5, TiO2 and Sc for the deposit. At a US$180/t NSR cut-off, the Indicated Resource is 90.9 Mt at 0.66% Nb2O5, 2.59% TiO2, and 70 g/t Sc; and an Inferred Resource of 133.4 Mt at 0.48% Nb2O5, 2.24% TiO2, and 59  g/t  Sc;  The  updated  Mineral  Resource  represents  a  slight  increase  in  the  reported  contained metal for the Indicated when compared to the 2015 estimate, which is mainly due to an effective drop in the CoG.

## 25.2  Processing and Metallurgical Testing

## Mineral Processing

The Feasibility-level comminution test work was completed in two stages at SGS. The primary stage was conducted on six composite samples and 13 variability samples, and included the determination of standard comminution parameters (SGS 2016a). The second stage of comminution test work was conducted  on  a  single  composite  sample,  using  a  LABWAL  HPGR  semi-pilot  scale  test  work

program (SGS 2016b). The test work results indicate that the Project ore is categorized as soft to moderately hard in terms of ore hardness, and amenable to standard grinding as well as an HPGR operation.

## Hydrometallurgical Plant

Pilot test programs showed that high recovery rates of the niobium, scandium and titanium could be achieved and that recycling and regeneration of reagents was also possible; thus, minimizing fresh reagent  input  and  waste  generation.  Recoveries  of  85.8%  Nb2O5  and  93.1%  Sc2O3  have  been demonstrated while achieving 40.3% recovery of TiO2.

Further  understanding  of  the  Process  was  achieved  with  respect  to  the  kinetics  of  each  unit operation which suggested that the design be adjusted from what was initially shown in the 2015 PEA. Among the changes the following are of particular interest:

- · The temperature of the HCl Leach was adjusted to control leaching of the iron. The Fe to Nb ratio in the Leach residue has an impact on the precipitation of Nb and the co-precipitation of titanium.
- · Acid Bake total mixing and reaction time was reduced to 2.5 hours.
- · Iron Reduction step was optimized based on actual reduction of Fe 3+  which resulted in an improved iron consumption.
- · Dilution  ratio  in  the  Niobium  Precipitation  was  reduced  from  5:1  to  0.6:1  thus  reducing reagent consumption and equipment size. This however comes at the expense of a slight reduction in Nb recovery and an increase in Ti co-precipitation.
- · Secondary scandium recovery from the barren sulfate solution was developed. A selective precipitation  of  the  scandium  over  impurities  was  achieved.  Scandium  precipitated  in  this section is combined and recovered in the Sc Solvent Extraction.
- · A scandium purification step was added that provided a 99.9% scandium product (as Sc2O3).
- · HCl Acid Regeneration development proved that a recovery of chlorine in excess 99% is achievable.
- · Further  test  work  and  development  provided  the  basis  to  greatly  reduce  the  need  for neutralizing reagents while increasing the recovery of sulfur; therefore, greatly reducing the need for sulfur import.
- · Mixed sulfur oxide gas is treated and cleaned prior to being sent to the Acid Plant therefore reducing the size and cost of the Acid Plant.

## Pyromet

Lab testing has confirmed most of the anticipated findings from the mathematical model that was developed by applying thermodynamic principles:

- · The  aluminothermic  reduction  of  niobium  oxide  precipitate  and  iron  oxide  has  been demonstrated. Ferroniobium particles have been formed and the chemical proportion of iron and niobium is just what was expected.
- · The change to produce a higher TiO2 content product from the Hydro-Met did not change what  was  anticipated:  Ti  content  in  the  FeNb  alloy  did  not  increase  and  the  reduction  of Nb2O5 did not seem to be affected by this higher amount of titanium oxide.

- · Different temperatures have been used in various tests which have provided good reference points  on  the  slag  behavior.  The  Electric  Arc  Furnace  (EAF)  temperature  during  the operation is expected to correspond to a temperature between 1850  o C and 1900 o C.

## 25.3  Mining &amp; Reserves

## Geotechnical

A  geotechnical  field  characterization  program  has  been  undertaken  to  assess  the  expected  rock quality. This program included logging core, laboratory strength testing, in situ stress measurements and oriented core logging of jointing. The results of this program have provided adequate quantity and quality data for feasibility-level design of the underground workings.

A geotechnical assessment of the orebody shape and ground conditions has determined that longhole  open  stoping  mining  is  an  appropriate  mining  method.  Stopes  have  been  sized  to  maintain stability once mucked empty. A primary/secondary extraction sequence with tight backfilling allows optimization of ore recovery while maintaining ground stability. Primary stopes will be backfilled with cemented  pastefill,  while  secondary  stopes  will  be  backfilled  with  either  light-cement  pastefill  or uncemented waste rock from development.

The design has been laid out using empirical design methods based on similar case histories. The stability  of  the  design  has  been  checked  with  3-D  numerical  stress-strain  models  of  the  working which included consideration for mine-scale faulting. The modeling results confirm that stopes and access drifts are predicted to remain stable during active mining.

## Mine Design

Longhole  stoping  is  seen  as  the  appropriate  mining  method  for  the  deposit  geometry.  The  large stope  sizes  minimize  the  mining  cost.  The  increased  dilution  due  to  large  stopes  sizes  is  not particularly material to the mine plan as dilution has some grade.

An NSR approach was used and takes into account revenue for three elements (Nb2O5, TiO2, and Sc)  and  generates  three  separate  products  (TiO2,  FeNb,  and  Sc2O3).  Stope  optimization  was completed to identify economic mining areas. The 3-D mine design was completed on an elevated CoG, over twice the actual calculated cut-off. Three mining blocks were designed, giving a 32 year mine life, although additional material, classified as indicated, exists below the mine plan presented here.

The underground mine is accessed through a conventionally sunk 7.5 m diameter shaft system. A 5.5 m raisebore to surface serves as exhaust ventilation and emergency egress.

Tonnage and grades presented in the reserve include dilution and recovery and are benchmarked to other similar operations. Productivities were generated from first principles with inputs from mining contractors, blasting suppliers, and equipment vendors where appropriate. The productivities were also benchmarked to similar operations. Equipment used in this study is standard equipment used world-wide with only standard package/automation features.

A monthly/quarterly/yearly production schedule was generated using iGantt software. The schedule targeted 2,760 t/d.

## 25.4  Recovery Methods

Based  upon  the  ore  body  samples  retained,  all  bench  testing  performed  and  process  analyses completed  to  date,  Tetra  Tech  is  confident  that  the  current  design  will  yield  the  FeNb,  TiO2  and Sc2O3 in the quantities expected. While this level of design is feasibility, it is expected that additional design effort during the detail phase will likely yield better results and further improve the efficiency and yields of the processes.

## 25.5  Infrastructure

## 25.5.1 Onsite and Offsite Infrastructure

Based upon the most current operating and process design information and expectations, the on-site and off-site infrastructure and services will meet each of the required needs of this entire facility.

Infrastructure buildings, office space, locker facilities and showers were sized and designed based upon current manpower projections for the site, as well as a tentative work schedule of 12 hr shifts for  shift  personnel,  and  standard  8  hr  shifts  for  non-shift  staff.  A  change  in  the  number  of  shifts and/or shift durations may have an impact on the requirements of these facilities.

Likewise, both potable water and waste water distribution systems were sized based upon the above shift  criteria.  Changes  in  the  number  of  personnel,  and/or  changes  in  numbers  of  shifts  and  shift durations may have an impact on the potable and waste water demands which must be addressed during the detail phase of this design.

Off-site infrastructure in the form of natural gas and electrical power services provided by others are readily available, and well within the current demand requirements of the facility.

Changes to  the  process  during  the  detail  phase,  in  particular,  changes  to  the  Hydromet  process needs could also have an impact on both potable and process water needs which could have an impact on the WWTP (Waste Water Treatment Plant). Additionally, changes to the process could have an impact on the quantities and type of reagents required, which could in turn change the size of storage tanks and facilities, as well as the types and materials of construction of these facilities (tanks, totes, bunkers, etc.).

Foundation designs for large loads and structures, as well as roadway designs, were based upon the most current geotechnical report and best engineering practices for the local site conditions.

The  most  current  geotechnical  report  partially  addressed  the  recommended  designs  for  deep foundations or foundations for large loads; building columns, columns with bridge crane loads, large process equipment or structures. It will be important that the final geotechnical report address these types of loads and provide specific recommendations, but that the final geotechnical site evaluation includes  test  borings  in  the  final  locations  of  buildings,  process  equipment  and  major  structures. Recommendations should further include expected setlltements, as well as pavement designs with material and compaction recommendations.

## 25.5.2 Active Dewatering

The underground mine will require active dewatering using dewatering wells drilled from surface. The base  case  using  the  numerical  model  predicts  a  maximum  dewatering  rate  of  757  L/sec  (12,000 gpm) from 12 wells (63 L/sec per well) is reached in pre-mining Year -1 and maintained through Year

4. After five years of active pumping at 757 L/s, pumping requirements begin to decrease, gradually tapering off to approximately 230 L/s at the end of mine life. All discharged water will be pumped to a lined  dewatering  storage  pond  on  site,  and  then  50  km  to  a  diffuser  on  the  Missouri  River.  LoM Capital Costs for the active dewatering system is approximately US$64.4 million and LoM Operating Costs is approximately US$134 million.

Uncertainty exists in the projections, due to the lack of information for some important parameters such  as  the  actual  thickness  of  the  permeable  carbonatite,  the  specific  yield  of  the  central carbonatite,  and  the  nature  of  the  granite  surrounding  the  Elk  Creek  Carbonatite.  Therefore  it  is critical  that  two  prototype  dewatering  wells  be  installed  and  tested  immediately  to  1)  advance  the conceptual  understanding  of  the  hydrogeology  and  dewatering  requirements  and  2)  optimize  well and pump designs for the remaining wells.

## 25.5.3 Tailings

Based on the parameters and assumptions outlined in Section 18.11, the Plant Site and Area 7 TSFs have been design with adequate containment and capacity to manage the planned filtered water leach residue, calcined excess oxide, and slag deposition for a 32-year mine life.

## 25.5.4 Waterline to Missouri

The  waterline  to  the  Missouri  is  a  critical  element  to  the  Project  to  allow  discharge  from  the dewatering  process  that  will  be  required  to  construct  and  operate  the  mine.  The  waterline  to  the Missouri will require the installation of a 914 cm (36 inch) diameter pipeline within County ROW of four Counties in southeast Nebraska, the crossing of State Highways as well as railroad crossings. The  waterline  will  also  require  multiple  pump  stations  and  a  diffuser  structure  constructed  in  the Missouri River. A majority of the waterline and associated facilities will be constructed within ROW while portions will require acquisition of property from private property owners.

The  Project  will  require  multiple  permits  in  order  to  construct  and  operate  the  system  and  to discharge the water to the Missouri River. The process of completing the 404 permit process as well as  obtaining  the  permit  and  the  permit  to  discharge  to  the  Missouri  River  are  underway.  Permits associated with occupying or crossing ROW and railroads as well as the NDEQ construction permit will  be  prepared  during  the  preliminary  and  final  detailed  design  phases  of  the  Project.  Risks associated with the waterline have been evaluated and have been determined to be low to medium. The waterline construction schedule has been evaluated and deemed to be feasible in regard to the overall construction schedule for the mine. Certain activities related to data collection and preliminary design of the waterline should commence in the near future to facilitate the overall Project schedule.

## 25.6 Environmental and Permitting

NioCorp  has  developed  information  and  conducted  a  number  of  environmental  studies  related  to baseline  characterization  for  the  Project,  the  most  important  of  which  are  the  studies  related  to hydrogeology and geochemistry, given the current plan to discharge underground dewatering water to the Missouri River, over 30 miles away. The geochemistry of this water will dictate the terms and conditions of the discharge permit, and any additional management (active or passive) that may be required.

The geochemistry and characterization/classification of the ore and waste materials (including the final  process  waste  streams  making  up  the  bulk  of  the  tailings  mass),  directly  influences  the management  of  these  materials  given  the  presence  of  naturally  occurring  radioactive  materials (NORMs) (i.e.,  uranium  and  thorium)  and  the  potential  for  limited  reaction  to  contact  with  water. These  materials  currently classify as non-hazardous  based  on  regulatory  testing.  Site-wide management of non-contact and contact stormwater will be essential to Project compliance.

Engagement  of  local,  state  and  federal  regulators  has  already  begun,  and  three  major  areas  of permitting have been initiated, including CWA Sections 404 and 408 permitting with the USACE, as well as Section 402 discharge permitting and air quality permitting with the Nebraska Department of Environmental Quality (NDEQ). These will be critical  for  dewatering water  temporary storage  and discharge to the Missouri River. Initiation of the balance of permitting for the Project is dependent upon the completion of the mine plan and surface facilities being developed as part of this technical document,  as  well  as  additional  characterization  of  the  waste  materials  and  potential  worker exposures under the jurisdiction of the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) and U.S. Department of Labor - Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA), both of whom will have primary oversight of worker safety and monitoring programs with respect to the presence of NORMs in the ore and waste rock.

Without specific hardrock mining regulations, there are limited obligatory requirements for reclamation and closure of mining properties in Nebraska. There are provisions, however, within the applicable  regulatory  framework  that  are  likely  to  be  applied  to  the  Project  during  the  permit  and licensing  processes,  specifically  those  associated  with  the  TSF  and  mineral  processing  facilities. This will include the provision of financial surety for proper closure and reclamation of the site. The currently estimate costs for closure and reclamation of the Project is US$39 million.

Overall, the Project appears to be sufficiently advanced to initiate the submission of formal permit applications which will govern the construction, operation, and closure of the mine. However, given the complexity of the mine design, process operations, accelerated schedule currently envisioned by NioCorp, and the inexperience of the state regulators with this type of mining, one must recognize that risks remain within the permitting process that could slow Project development, even with the overwhelming support that the Project appears to have from the communities and stakeholders.

## 25.7  Economic Analysis

The indicative economic results summarized in this section are based upon work performed by SRK, or  received  from  NioCorp,  in  2016-17.  They  have  been  prepared  on  both  an  annual  pre-tax  and after-tax basis, a 100% equity basis with no Project financing inputs.

The Project design is a 1.0 Mt/y operation that would cost an estimated US$1,088 million to build (or US$1,008 million after a US$79 million net preproduction revenue credit). The Project is expected to produce annually 7,055 t of ferroniobium, 11,455 t of TiO2, and 103 t of Sc2O3 TiO2 over a 32 year mine life. On an NbEq basis, production cash costs are expected to be US$12.14/kg NbEq.

Project  metrics  are  summarized  in  Table  25-1  and  show  a  pre-tax  NPV  8%  result  of  US$2,291 million and 24.3% IRR with undiscounted payback from start of commercial production of 3.4 years as  well  as  an  after  tax  NPV  8%  result  of  US$1,666  million  and  21.7%  IRR  with  undiscounted payback from start of commercial production at 3.7 years. With an estimated effective income tax rate of 24.1%, the Project is expected to generate over US$284 million in annual free cash flow over

its  operational life,  for  a cumulative total of approximately US$7,885 million. The effective tax rate was  derived  utilizing  current  federal,  state  and  local  tax  rates  along  with  statutory  deductions  for which the company qualifies.

Source: SRK, 2017

The Project will obviously benefit from becoming a stable, domestic US producer of Nb and Sc2O3 where  currently  all  supplies  must  be  imported  from  abroad.  However,  this  valuation  is  most dependent upon the sale of all annual Sc2O3 production from startup as it accounts for 66% of LoM gross revenue generated. At the extreme, at a cash cost of US$37.59/kg Nb and current US$40/kg benchmark price and assuming no Sc2O3 revenue it is apparent that Nb sales (32% of gross revenue generated) as modelled would cover the cost of production for all three commodities but Sc2O3 sales will be required to generate positive cash flow to cover any Project loan principal repayments/interest expense and meet investment criteria for stakeholders.

Although  75%  of  Nb  sales  in  the  first  10  years  are  currently  covered  by  offtake  agreements,  the revenues generated under those contracts are still sensitive to the benchmark Nb price currently set in  the  technical  economic  model  at  US$40/kg.  The  benchmark  price  is  exposed  to  competitive pressure.

## 26 Recommendations

## 26.1  Recommended Work Programs

## 26.1.1 Geology and Resources

SRK has no further recommendations for additional drilling needed to support the current FS. SRK is of the opinion that there may be an opportunity to further refine and improve the understanding of the mineralization, particularly near the top of the deposit where mining is scheduled to begin. This may be  considered  in  planning  for  future  exploration  and  mining,  as  a  matter  of  course  in  the development of the Project.

SRK notes that the current understanding of the extents of the deposit, while sufficient for the current level of study, are still limited by the extent of the drilling, and that the deposit is locally open along strike and at depth.

SRK previously highlighted to the Company a series of work programs to increase the confidence in the assay database for the historical drilling. NioCorp has completed programs to ensure complete datasets  are  available  within  the  current  mineralization  wireframes.  Follow  up  on  the  differences between SGS and Actlabs is recommended but not deemed to be material at this stage.

## 26.1.2 Hydrometallurgical Plant

Adequate test work was conducted to support a feasibility-level design for the hydromet plant and all sections of the process have been successfully tested at the pilot scale required for a FS. However, optimization was not achieved in all areas and certain areas will certainly benefit from further 'post FS' test work, preferably before detailed engineering activities begin. A number of factors have not been optimized in this study and further testing will be preferable to achieve optimal results. Such optimization could also be achieved with the help of the process simulation of the yearly or monthly elemental feed composition using the METSIM model and the compositions from the mine plan.

A summary of the recommended test work is presented below.

- · HCl Leach
- o Optimize leaching of Fe to correlate with optimum Fe/Nb ratio and Nb Precipitation - aim to best recovery of Nb while preventing Ti co-precipitation;
- o Optimize  the  method  used  in  the  aging  of  the  HCl  Leach  liquor  prior  to  Sc  Solvent Extraction;
- · Acid Bake - Water Leach
- o Perform vender testing and optimization of Acid Bake operations and equipment;
- o Optimize process control and equipment capabilities -optimizing mixing time, temperature, acid to residue ratio;
- o Optimize water to residue ratio in Water Leach;
- · Iron Reduction
- o Verify reaction kinetics and the use of briquettes;
- · Nb Precipitation
- o Optimize Fe/Nb ratio;

- o Optimize  Precipitant (dilution water) acidity to maximize  Nb  precipitation  and  Ti selectivity;
- o Optimize final free acid (FAT) to maximize selectivity against Ti;
- · Ti Precipitation
- o Further test work required to maximize Th/U removal from the titanium dioxide product to increase its value;
- · Sc Precipitation
- o Optimize the H3PO4 addition;
- o Optimize the Fe addition;
- o Perform locked cycle tests on the Calcium loop;
- · Sc Refining
- o Optimize and further evaluate Zr/Nb removal using mixed organics - stripping acid;
- o Optimize conditions to minimize Sc losses;
- · Sc oxalate Precipitation
- o Verify precipitation using solid Oxalic Acid - optimal amount for optimal recovery;
- o Optimize acidity, temperature, and g/l with solid Oxalic Acid;
- o Optimize washing of Sc Oxalate for calcining equipment integrity;
- · Acid Regeneration
- o Optimize the filtration - evaluate equipment and filtration media;
- · Sulfate calcining
- o Optimize residence time;
- o Vendor testing of different equipment and assembly;
- · General
- o Equipment selection, material of construction and vendor guarantee testing;
- o Further perform process engineering during the detailed design phase;
- o Perform process simulation of the yearly or monthly elemental feed composition using the METSIM model and the compositions from the mine plan;

## 26.1.3 Geotechnical

To  advance  to  the  final  mine  design,  additional  characterization  data  will  be  required  to  reduce geotechnical uncertainty. SRK recommends the following characterization activities:

- · Drillholes at the final shaft and ventilation raise location to confirm ground conditions for the shaft ground support
- · An additional 4 to 6 geotechnical drillholes in the footwall infrastructure and planned stope mining areas to verify the range of expected ground conditions. This includes collecting:
- o RMR/Q data
- o Structural orientation data
- o Updating the structural model and geotechnical models
- o Updating mine design parameters
- · Additional geotechnical drillholes to characterize ground conditions for the final alignment of the  ramps  and  footwall  drives.  These  holes  should  be  drilled  from  underground,  after  the shaft is constructed and the initial access drives are mined.

## 26.1.4 Mining and Reserves

No  additional  work  is  identified  other  than  that  included  in  workplan  provided  for  the  detailed engineering phase of work and cost estimate included within the FS capital estimate.

## 26.1.5 Recovery Methods

## Mineral Processing

Based  on  the  metallurgical  test  work  and  the  process  design  completed  for  the  FS,  Tetra  Tech recommends further pilot testing of the HPGR option. The pilot HPGR test work program should be conducted prior to the detailed engineering stage in order to confirm and determine:

- · The main operating variables of the HPGR;
- · Flake strength; and
- · Wear rate:
- o Abrasion Index

The results from the pilot testing will be used to confirm the unit energy consumption, optimize the HPGR operating variables, and confirm the size of the HPGR unit for industrial operation.

The sample requirement for the pilot testing is estimated to be approximately 1.5 t.

The cost of pilot testing will be in the range of US$8,500 to US$30,000.

## Hydrometallurgical Plant

Any additional work required is included in the detailed engineering scope of work and included in the feasibility cost.

## Pyromet

Even though the testing has shown good results and is aligned in accordance with the mathematic model developed using thermodynamic calculations a few minor issues remain to be addressed:

- · Optimize the capacity of the Hydromet to increase the proportion of Nb2O5 in the precipitate. A target ratio of Nb2O5/ TiO2 of 1 would be suitable.
- · Perform large scale testing with an EAF to ensure good separation of slag/metal liquid and ensure the homogeneity of the ferroniobium alloy.
- · Develop a flux that will enhance the fluidity of the slag at 1850 o C and 1900 o C.
- · Select  a  material  for  the  refractory  that  will  resist  the  aluminothermic  conditions  in  the Electrical Furnace.

## 26.1.6 Infrastructure

## General Infrastructure

Tetra Tech recommends additional geotechnical investigation and design recommendations based upon the detail design requirements addressed in Section 25.5.1; borings in the selected building and  large  equipment  locations,  high  load  and  deep  foundation  recommendations,  as  well  as pavement design recommendations based upon the type and frequency of vehicle traffic.

Any additional work required is included in the detailed en1gineering scope of work and included in the feasibility cost.

## Tailings

The detailed design phase of the Plant Area and Area 7 TSFs will include characterization of any additional tailings  materials,  additional geotechnical characterization of Plant  Area TSF foundation and borrow materials, and confirmation of feasibility-level containment, water balance and stability design.

Any additional work required is included in the detailed engineering scope of work and included in the feasibility cost.

## Backfill

Further testing of the backfill is recommended during detailed engineering to reduce cement content and minimize backfill operating cost.

## Active Dewatering

SRK recommends a post-FS field program be conducted immediately to reduce uncertainty in the hydrogeological aspect of the Project. SRK has scoped two phases for post-FS work although there is not chronological significance between Phases 1 and 2, and no contingency dependence. Phase 1 has a higher priority due to its importance regarding Capital Costs and proper vetting of well and pump design due to the aggressive construction schedule that requires 12 of the wells be installed and operational one year prior to completion of the shaft. Phase 1 of the proposed program involves early installation of two 16 inch diameter dewatering wells to serve as 'prototype' wells but to also serve as LoM installations. In the absence of a large-scale pumping test to date, early installation of two wells allows NioCorp to test the drilling methodology and well design in advance of committing to the majority of the remaining dewatering well and pump network expenditure.

As part of the testing on the first two wells, SRK recommends completion of spinner logs to assess vertical contribution of water to the well, a step test in each well, and a 30-day pumping test in each well, which can be conducted simultaneously if the schedule does not allow independent testing. The first well would be installed in the vicinity of the proposed shaft to a depth of 850 m. The second well would be located either near the shaft, or on the southeast edge of the deposit in a location thought to  encounter  multiple  mapped  faults.  A  minimum  30-day  pumping  test  would  require  a  discharge option.  The  dewatering  pond  and  two  of  the  gathering  lines  would  need  to  be  constructed immediately;  water  during  the  30-day  test  would  be  discharged  to  the  lined  pond  for  storage. Following the discharge phase, SRK recommends monitoring of recovery for a minimum of 60 days, longer if possible, due to the need to assess changes in storage during rebound.

Phase 2 is lower priority,  but  should  happen  prior  to  or  concurrent  with  Phase  1.  Phase  2  of  the program  involves  work  necessary  to  fill  data  gaps  and  reduce  uncertainty  in  the  hydrogeological conceptual model. Phase 2 involves testing of the carbonatite and the granite at eleven locations and installation of critical observation wells at all eleven locations. It is important that Phase 2 be implemented  concurrent  with  (or  ideally  prior  to)  Phase  1  prototype  dewatering  well  drilling,  and finish before the dewatering wells are operational, so that the new observation wells can be utilized as monitoring points during the 30-day test period. The Phase 2 holes would be drilled with a PQ diameter core bit, and packer testing should occur along the majority of the holes.

## Waterline to Missouri

No  additional  work  is  identified  other  than  that  included  in  workplan  provided  for  the  detailed engineering phase of work and cost estimate included within the FS capital estimate.

## 26.1.7  Environmental and Social

With respect to environmental, permitting and social/community issues for the Project, SRK provides the following recommendations to NioCorp:

- · Remain engaged and transparent with Bold Nebraska throughout the permitting process and provide them an opportunity to participate in any public meetings or town hall discussions. This  tends  to  garner  less  opposition  when  it  comes  time  for  formal  public  comments  on permit applications; and
- · Complete the detailed hydrogeological investigation of the orebody to more accurately and precisely define the quantity and long-term quality of dewatering water expectations.
- · Continue  characterization  work  on  the  mine  waste  rock  and  tailings  materials  in  order  to more  precisely  define  the  extent  and  partitioning  of  radionuclides.  Assess  the  potential effects of the exothermic reactions from the hydration of the calcined tailings materials on the overall TSF facility, worker safety, and surrounding environment, including the potential for rad-containing, fugitive dust generation.

## 26.1.8 Economic Analysis

SRK makes the following recommendations about the Project:

- · NioCorp should continue and expand its efforts to engage potential offtake customers for all of its three products, in particular Sc2O3;
- · Seeing that Nebraska government officials are very supportive of the job generating potential of the Project in a remote, undeveloped part of the state, NioCorp should continue to engage and lobby local, state and federal regulatory agencies for further tax deductions and credits; and
- · Investigate  joint  academic-industry  research  efforts  into  developing  new  uses  for  Nb  and Sc203.

## 28 Glossary

The Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves have been classified according to CIM (CIM, 2014). Accordingly, the Resources have been classified as Measured, Indicated or Inferred, the Reserves have been classified as Proven, and Probable based on the Measured and Indicated Resources as defined below.

## 28.1  Mineral Resources

A Mineral Resource is a concentration or occurrence of solid material of economic interest in or on the Earth's crust in such form, grade or quality and quantity that there are reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction. The location, quantity, grade or quality, continuity and other geological characteristics of a Mineral Resource are known, estimated or interpreted from specific geological evidence and knowledge, including sampling.

An Inferred Mineral Resource is  that  part  of  a Mineral Resource for which quantity and grade or quality are estimated on the basis of limited geological evidence and sampling. Geological evidence is  sufficient  to  imply  but  not  verify  geological  and  grade  or  quality  continuity.  An  Inferred  Mineral Resource has a lower level of confidence than that applying to an Indicated Mineral Resource and must not be converted to a Mineral Reserve. It is reasonably expected that the majority of Inferred Mineral Resources could be upgraded to Indicated Mineral Resources with continued exploration.

An Indicated  Mineral  Resource is  that  part  of  a  Mineral  Resource  for  which  quantity,  grade  or quality, densities, shape and physical characteristics are estimated with sufficient confidence to allow the application of Modifying Factors in sufficient detail to support mine planning and evaluation of the economic  viability  of  the  deposit.  Geological  evidence  is  derived  from  adequately  detailed  and reliable exploration, sampling and testing and is sufficient to assume geological and grade or quality continuity  between  points  of  observation.  An  Indicated  Mineral  Resource  has  a  lower  level  of confidence  than  that  applying  to  a  Measured  Mineral  Resource  and  may  only  be  converted  to  a Probable Mineral Reserve.

A Measured  Mineral  Resource is  that  part  of  a  Mineral  Resource  for  which  quantity,  grade  or quality,  densities,  shape,  and  physical  characteristics  are  estimated  with  confidence  sufficient  to allow the application of Modifying Factors to support detailed mine planning and final evaluation of the  economic  viability  of  the  deposit.  Geological  evidence  is  derived  from  detailed  and  reliable exploration,  sampling  and  testing  and  is  sufficient  to  confirm  geological  and  grade  or  quality continuity  between  points  of  observation.  A  Measured  Mineral  Resource  has  a  higher  level  of confidence  than  that  applying  to  either  an  Indicated  Mineral  Resource  or  an  Inferred  Mineral Resource. It may be converted to a Proven Mineral Reserve or to a Probable Mineral Reserve.

## 28.2  Mineral Reserves

A Mineral  Reserve is  the  economically  mineable  part  of  a  Measured  and/or  Indicated  Mineral Resource.  It  includes  diluting  materials  and  allowances  for  losses,  which  may  occur  when  the material  is  mined  or  extracted  and  is  defined  by  studies  at  pre-feasibility  or  feasibility-level  as appropriate that include application of Modifying Factors. Such studies demonstrate that, at the time of reporting, extraction could reasonably be justified.

The  reference  point  at  which  Mineral  Reserves  are  defined,  usually  the  point  where  the  ore  is delivered  to  the  processing  plant,  must  be  stated.  It  is  important  that,  in  all  situations  where  the reference  point  is  different,  such  as  for  a  saleable  product,  a  clarifying  statement  is  included  to ensure  that  the  reader  is  fully  informed  as  to  what  is  being  reported.  The  public  disclosure  of  a Mineral Reserve must be demonstrated by a pre-feasibility study or FS.

- A Probable  Mineral  Reserve is  the  economically  mineable  part  of  an  Indicated,  and  in  some circumstances, a Measured Mineral Resource. The confidence in the Modifying Factors applying to a Probable Mineral Reserve is lower than that applying to a Proven Mineral Reserve.

A Proven Mineral Reserve is the economically mineable part of a Measured Mineral Resource. A Proven Mineral Reserve implies a high degree of confidence in the Modifying Factors.

## E X E C U T I V E   S U M M A R Y

NioCorp  Developments  Ltd.  (NioCorp)  commissioned  Tetra  Tech  Canada  Inc.  (Tetra  Tech)  to complete a mineral processing circuit design as part of the Elk Creek Niobium Project (the Project) Feasibility Study. As part of the mineral processing circuit design, Tetra Tech completed the following activities between August 2016 and May 2017:

-  review of the metallurgical test work relating to comminution
-  completion of a desktop-level trade-off study of three comminution options
-  process design of comminution circuit.

## METALLURGICAL TEST WORK

Tetra  Tech  reviewed  the  comminution  results  from  the  historical  test  work  (SGS  2015)  and  has included it in the report for completeness but not involved with any other aspects of the historical work.

The Feasibility-level comminution test work was completed in two stages at SGS Canada Inc. (SGS) in Lakefield,  Ontario.    The  primary  stage  test  work  (SGS  2016a)  was  conducted  on  six  composite samples and 13 variability samples and included:

-  Bond Rod Mill Work Index (RWi) testing
-  Bond Ball Mill Work Index (BWi) testing
-  Bond Abrasion Index (Ai) testing
-  Bond Low-energy Impact (CWi) testing
-  JK Drop Weight (JKDW) testing
-  Semi-autogenous grinding (SAG) Mill Comminution (SMC) test.

The  second  stage  of  comminution  test  work  (SGS  2016b)  was  conducted  on  a  single  composite sample, using a LABWAL high-pressure grinding roll (HPGR) semi-pilot scale test work program.

The test work results indicate that the Project ore is categorized as soft to moderately hard in terms of ore hardness, and amenable to standard grinding as well as an HPGR operation.

<!-- image -->

## TRADE-OFF STUDY AND FLOWSHEET DESIGN

The comminution flowsheet for the Project was selected by conducting an economic trade-off study (Tetra  Tech  2016).    Three  different  comminution  flowsheet  options  were  considered  during  the trade-off study:

-  conventional wet SAG milling (base case)
-  dry SAG milling
-  HPGR.

Tetra Tech compared these options on a differential (or relative) cost basis and identified the HPGR flowsheet as the most cost effective option for the Project.

The battery limits of the comminution circuit are the comminution circuit feed bin at surface and the comminution product discharge bin at the end of the comminution circuit.

The  HPGR  option  has  been  designed  to  process  1,007,400 t/a  of  primary  crushed  niobium  ore hauled from the underground mine.  The primary driver of the comminution circuit design is the dry processing of ore, which will be used in order to avoid an expensive drying operation prior to acid leaching.

The process design described in this report relies upon two things:

-  receiving a primary crusher product with a characteristic particle size of (P80) 115 mm at the comminution circuit feed bin
-  producing feed material for the downstream hydrometallurgical processing at a characteristic particle size of (P80) 1.1 mm.

## RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES

Through review of completed test work and the comminution flowsheet design, a number of risks and opportunities have been identified:

-  Risks:
-  Any potential increase in ore moisture content above 5%  will be detrimental to the HPGR Operation
-  Because the comminution circuit has been designed as a single stream, any equipment breakdown will stop the production of the plant.
-  The comminution test work indicated that a portion of the ore from one part of the mine is harder than the rest of the ore.  This comminution circuit design is based on a blended feed of ore and could become a bottleneck if the hard ore has to be treated on its own.
-  The consumable consumption rates of the HPGR were not tested; therefore the wear and tear of the HPGR unit could not be estimated.

<!-- image -->

-  The comminution circuit product used in the design has a characteristic particle size of P80=1.1 mm.  Any fluctuations in the HPGR feed size as a result of screen inefficiency will have a negative effect on HPGR performance and final product size.
-  The risk of airborne and respirable dust exposure to the comminution plant operational personnel needs to be quantified.
-  Opportunities
-  Waste heat generated from other areas of the process plant could be possibly used to dry the ore during periods of higher feed moisture content.

## RECOMMENDATIONS

Tetra Tech recommends further pilot testing (for the HPGR flowsheet option) should be conducted prior to the detailed engineering stage.

The results from further pilot testing will be used to confirm unit energy consumption, optimize the HPGR operating variables, and to confirm the size of HPGR required.

The cost of pilot testing will be in the range of US$8,500 to US$30,000, depending on the vendor.

## 1.0 I NTRODUCTION

NioCorp commissioned Tetra Tech to complete the mineral processing circuit design as part of the Elk Creek Project Feasibility Study.  As part of the mineral processing circuit design, Tetra Tech completed the following activities between August 2016 and May 2017:

-  comminution metallurgical test work review
-  desktop-level trade-off study of three comminution options
-  process design of the comminution circuit.

The battery limits of the comminution circuit include the discharge from the comminution circuit feed bin at surface and the comminution product discharge bin at the end of the comminution circuit.  It should be noted that the surge capacity between the underground operation and mineral processing plant are not within the battery limits of Tetra Tech's scope of work.

## 2.0 MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING

The comminution test work reported in this section was completed by SGS in three phases.  The historical test work was completed in 2015 (SGS 2015), followed by the Feasibility Study test work, which was undertaken in two stages (SGS 2016a; SGS 2016b) in 2016.

Tetra Tech reviewed the historical test work results but not involved with any other aspect of the historical metallurgical test work.  The comminution results from the historical test work are included in the reference documents (SGS 2015) and are reported here for the purpose of completeness.

The Feasibility-level comminution test work was completed in two stages at SGS in Lakefield, Ontario.  The primary stage (SGS 2016a) was conducted on six composite samples and 13 variability samples and included the determination of standard comminution parameters.

The second stage of comminution test work (SGS 2016b) was conducted on a single composite sample, using the LABWAL HPGR semi-pilot scale test work procedure.

The test work results indicate that the Project ore may be categorized as soft to moderately hard in terms of ore hardness and is amenable to conventional as well as HPGR grinding.

## 2.1 HISTORICAL COMMINUTION TEST WORK

SGS completed previous comminution test work for the Project as part of an overall metallurgical program in April 2014.  The historical comminution test work consisted of a single determination for each of the following parameters:

-  Bond Rod Mill Work Index (RWi)
-  Bond Ball Mill Work Index (BWi)
-  Abrasion Index (Ai).

The test work was completed on a sub-sample obtained from a composite comprising drill core samples delivered to SGS (SGS 2015).

A summary of the historical metallurgical test work results is shown in Table 2.1.

The RWi of the tested samples places the ore in the moderately hard range of the SGS database.  However, the BWi was benchmarked as medium hardness by SGS based on their database.  Thus, the ore can be considered as moderately hard at coarser grind sizes and medium hard finer grind sizes.

## 2.2 CURRENT COMMINUTION TEST WORK

## 2.2.1 PRIMARY COMMINUTION TEST WORK

The primary stage comminution test work (SGS 2016a) was conducted on six composite samples and 13 variability samples, and included the following test work:

-  RWi test
-  BWi test
-  Ai test
-  CWi test;
-  JKDW test
-  SMC test.

## SAMPLE SELECTION

Tetra Tech was not involved with the sample selection for the comminution test work, the samples were selected by NioCorp under the guidance of Dahrouge Geological Consulting Ltd and prepared as composites or individual samples according to the compositing instructions provided by Roche Ltd.

735-1662020100-REP-P0001-01

The core samples were primary crushed to approximately 62.5 mm in size and the subsamples for the CWi test and JKDW test (where applicable) were separated.  The remainder was further crushed to approximately 31.2 mm in size and the sub-samples for SMC and Ai tests were separated.  The remaining sample was split into two, one fraction was sent to the store and the second fraction was stage crushed to approximately 12.5 mm in size, the sample for the RWi test was then extracted.  The remaining sample from the second fraction was further crushed to approximately 3.4 mm and a sample was taken for the BWi test.  A typical sample preparation protocol is shown in Table 2.4.

## TEST RESULTS

SGS completed JKDW tests on two composites (Comp4-VM12-13 and Comp5-LPM11-13) and four individual samples (Samples #1, #2, #3, and #12).  SGS also completed SMC tests on all six composites and the remaining nine individual samples.

The RWi tests and the Ai tests were completed on all 13 individual samples and 4 composites (Comp1-VM10, Comp2-PM10, Comp4-VM12-13, and Comp5-LPM11-13).

The BWi tests were completed on all 13 individual samples and 5 composites (Comp1VM10, Comp2-PM10, Comp4-VM12-13, Comp5-LPM11-13, and Comp6-PM13).

The CWi tests were completed on only two individual samples (samples #12 and #13).

A summary of the comminution test results are shown in Table 2.5.

The comminution test results indicate that the Ai for all of the samples tested ranges from 0.026 to 0.126, which corresponds to the mildly to slightly abrasive range.

The JKDW and SMC test results indicate that all of the individual samples fall in the moderately soft to moderately hard (A x b = 58.4 to 41.3) range of hardness with respect to resistance to impact (A x b).  The resistance to impact (A x b) for the composites ranges from medium to hard (A X b = 49.4 to 34.9).

The CWi results indicate that the samples tested are in the range of medium to moderately hard (10.7 kWh/t to 12.0 kWh/t) for crusher design purposes.

The RWi results indicate that the ore falls in the soft to hard (11.9 kWh/t to 18.0 kWh/t) range of hardness for the purpose of rod mill design purposes.

The BWi results indicate that two of the samples fall in the soft range (Sample #4 [11.6 kWh/t] and Sample #7 [11.7 kWh/t]).  The results also indicate that Comp1-VM10 falls in the moderately hard range (BWi = 15.7 kWh/t); all other samples fall in the moderately soft to medium range.

In summary, Comp1-VM10 shows hard indices in all tests, while all other samples range from soft to moderately hard.  This clearly indicates that the sample used in Comp1VM10 (drill hole NEC 14-010) is hard, while the rest of the ore zones are moderately hard.

## 2.2.2 HIGH-PRESSURE GRINDING ROLL TEST WORK

HPGR semi pilot plant (LABWAL) test work was conducted by SGS between November and December 2016 (SGS 2016b).

## SAMPLE PREPARATION

SGS stage crushed the composite sample to approximately 12.5 mm in size in order to prepare for the HPGR test work.  A sub-sample was taken from the crushed sample for moisture, specific gravity, bulk density, and particle size analysis.  The remaining sample was riffled into eight 30 kg charges and ten 10 kg charges for the HPGR test work.

## TEST WORK EQUIPMENT DETAILS

The HPGR tests were run in the LABWAL unit, which is equipped with solid roll tires that are protected against wear by tungsten-carbide studs.  The principal characteristics of the unit are presented in Table 2.7.

The key parameters from the locked-cycle test work (the specific throughput, specific grinding force, net specific energy requirements, and flake thickness) are discussed in the following sub-sections.

## SPECIFIC ENERGY REQUIREMENT

The test work results indicate that the net specific energy requirement of the locked-cycle test is 3.65 kWh/t.  SGS reported that this is amongst the highest value in the SGS database and could possibly be owing to the relatively fine closing screen size (1.70 mm) used in the locked-cycle test (most of their HPGR tests are conducted with a coarser

screen size of 3.35 mm).  Tetra Tech notes that the reported net specific energy requirement is comparable to the HPGR specific power requirement (4.18 kWh/t) calculated, based on the SMC test on a different composite from the same orebody.

## SPECIFIC GRINDING FORCE

The results indicate that the specific grinding force of the locked-cycle test is 3.14 N/mm 2 .  SGS reported that this specific grinding force value corresponds to the 60 th percentile of the SGS database (meaning that 60% of all the locked-cycle tests used a lower pressure).

## SPECIFIC THROUGHPUT

Higher specific throughput was reported (311 ts/hm 3 ) from the locked-cycle test work. SGS reported that the sample falls in the soft range of the SGS database in terms of the specific throughput, at approximately the 15 th  percentile.

## FLAKE THICKNESS

The flake thickness was reported at approximately 7 mm for all tests.  This flake thickness indicates that a suitable de-agglomeration step ahead of the HPGR product screen needs to be considered in the process design.

## 3.0 RECOVERY METHODS

## 3.1 COMMINUTION FLOWSHEET OPTIONS TRADE-OFF STUDY

Tetra Tech completed a desktop-level, trade-off study in order to identify the optimal comminution flowsheet for the Project.  The trade-off study compared three comminution flowsheet options on a differential (or relative) cost basis:

-  conventional wet SAG milling (base case)
-  dry SAG milling
-  HPGR.

The battery limits for this trade-off study included all equipment from the primary crusher discharge bin to the final comminution product discharge bin at the end of the comminution circuit.

Tetra Tech assumed a comminution circuit product particle size at a characteristic size of P80 = 1.1 mm.

The accuracy of the capital cost estimate was assessed at ±25% and the operating cost estimate was assessed at ±10%.

## 3.1.3 DRY SAG MILL

## PROCESS DESCRIPTION

The primary crusher product will be dried in a rotary drier and fed to a dry SAG (Aerofall type) mill, operating with an air classifier.  The ore fraction of the air classifier will be fed to a screen and the oversize will be subsequently fed to an in-circuit pebble crusher for recycling to the mill.  The screen undersize is the comminution circuit product that will report to the hydrometallurgical process.  The air fraction will be fed to an air cyclone and passed through a dust collector bag house before returning to the mill.  A conceptual block flow diagram of the dry SAG mill circuit is shown in Figure 3.2.

## 3.1.5 BASIS OF COST ESTIMATES

## CAPITAL COST

The capital costs for each flowsheet option were established in the trade-off study, in order to comprehensively compare the flowsheet options.  The costs are based on a standalone plant construction, ring-fenced from all other site areas.

For the standalone plant, the primary equipment list of each flowsheet was developed from the following:

-  process design basis
-  conceptual block flow diagram
-  high-level equipment sizing
-  process design criteria.

Once the primary equipment list was developed, the cost of each capital item was established based on the following resources:

-  equipment vendor's budget price estimates
-  mine and mill equipment cost guide (Infomine USA 2014)
-  Tetra Tech's in-house database.

Installation costs were then estimated and the following engineering factors were applied:

-  civil
-  structural steel
-  piping and valves
-  electrical and instrumentation
-  transport
-  erection of items
-  vendor services.

Indirect engineering factors (site preparation and construction management) were then applied to the installed plant capital cost to establish the total capital cost.

It is important to note that the total plant capital costs used in the trade-off study form the base capital cost estimate of the selected plant, but cannot be compared directly to the final plant capital cost.

## OPERATING COST

Operating costs for each option were established by estimating the required labor, consumables, moisture removal or drying, and adsorbed power requirements.

The labor cost for the comminution circuit was assumed at a constant rate of US$0.50/t of ore for all options.

Consumable usage was estimated based on the test work results, vendor's recommendations, and from Tetra Tech's experience in similar projects, or using industry standard assumptions.

Maintenance spares were calculated assuming 5% of the cost of the primary mechanical equipment.

Power costs were calculated based on an estimate of absorbed power requirements and an assumed power cost of US$0.06/kWh.

## 3.1.6 CAPITAL COST ESTIMATE

The capital costs for each option are shown in Table 3.5.  These costs are scoping-level estimates for comparison purposes only and do not constitute the final cost estimate for use in the feasibility study estimate.

Table: 3.5 Capital Cost for Each Option

| Cost Breakdown               |   Wet SAG  ($ million) |   Dry SAG  ($ million) |   HPGR  ($ million) |
|------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|---------------------|
| Primary Equipment Cost       |                   6.51 |                   9.24 |                4.1  |
| Installation Cost            |                  11.27 |                  15.98 |                7.1  |
| Installed Plant Capital Cost |                  17.78 |                  25.21 |               11.2  |
| EPCM Allowance               |                   2.67 |                   3.78 |                1.68 |
| Total Capital Cost           |                  20.45 |                  28.99 |               12.88 |

Note:

EPCM - engineering, procurement and construction management

The capital cost estimate presented in Table 3.5 indicates that the HPGR option is the lowest capital cost option under both scenarios.  The data also indicates that the dry SAG option is the most expensive followed by the wet SAG.

It is important note that the capital cost for the wet SAG option is higher because it also includes the cost of thickener and a filter press, in addition to a standard SAG milling circuit.

## 3.1.7 OPERATING COST ESTIMATE

The operating cost for each option is shown in Table 3.6.  These costs are scoping-level estimates for comparison purposes only and do not constitute the final cost estimate for use in the feasibility study estimate.

Table: 3.6 Operating Cost for Each Option

| Cost Breakdown         |   Wet SAG  ($/t) |   Dry SAG  ($/t) |   HPGR  ($/t) |
|------------------------|------------------|------------------|---------------|
| Consumables            |             1.58 |             1.38 |          0.87 |
| Moisture Removal Cost  |             0.63 |             0.32 |          0.32 |
| Power                  |             0.76 |             0.95 |          0.48 |
| Maintenance and Spares |             0.33 |             0.47 |          0.21 |
| Labour                 |             0.5  |             0.5  |          0.5  |
| Total Operating Cost   |             3.8  |             3.61 |          2.37 |

The operating cost data shown in Table 3.6 clearly indicates that HPGR is the lowest operating cost option under both scenarios.  The operating cost data also indicates that the wet SAG is the most expensive option followed by the dry SAG.  The wet SAG is a more expensive option because of the relatively higher drying or moisture removal cost, as compared to the other options.

## 3.1.8 ECONOMIC EVALUATION

The trade-off study capital and operating cost estimates clearly demonstrate that the HPGR option is the least expensive in terms of capital and operating costs.  In this context, a discounted cash flow analysis is not required in order to identify the most economical solution; HPGR can be selected for the Project as the most cost-effective solution for comminution.

## 3.4 PROCESS DESCRIPTION

The run-of-mine (ROM) ore will be crushed underground in a primary crusher, and the crushed product with a top size of 203 mm and characteristic size (P80) of 115 mm, will be delivered to the crushed ore bin located at the surface.  The ore from the bin will be reclaimed by three vibrating feeders with a total capacity of 136 t/h and passed on to the secondary crusher circuit via the secondary crusher screen feed conveyor.

At the secondary crushing stage, the ore will be sized on a dry, double deck screen with a top deck aperture size of 50 mm and bottom deck aperture size of 25 mm.  The screen oversize from both decks will report to the secondary crushing stage.  The screen undersize will be conveyed to the HPGR circuit.

<!-- image -->

The screen oversize fractions will be crushed in a single secondary cone crusher operating with a closed side setting of 25 mm.  The secondary crushed product will be sized by the same double deck screen with the primary crusher discharge ore.

The screen undersize, at an approximate characteristic particle size (P80) of 22 mm, will be further crushed in the HPGR circuit.  The HPGR circuit will consist a single HPGR crusher and a dual stage de-lumper-type de-agglomeration unit operating in closed circuit, with a separate double-deck vibrating screen with top and bottom deck aperture sizes of 6 mm and 3 mm, respectively.  The recirculating load of the HPGR circuit is expected to be in the range of 30 to 40% of the circuit new feed.

The HPGR screen undersize will be the final comminution product and is expected to have a characteristic particle size (P80) of 1.1 mm.  The ore will be stored in a fine ore bin, then reclaimed by three vibrating feeders with a total design capacity of 132 t/h, and then passed on to the acid leach circuit via the acid leach feed conveyor for further processing.

A conceptual block flow diagram of the HPGR circuit is shown in Figure 3.4.

## 3.5 CONTROL PHILOSOPHY

An appropriate control philosophy for the comminution circuit will be developed during the next stage of project development, in order to maximize throughput and stabilize the control of the product particle size.  Information about control philosophy is provided in this report as general guidance for the control system design engineer.

<!-- image -->

It is important to note that accurate and robust control instrumentation is critical to the long-term sustainability and success of a comminution operation.  The following conditions normally upset the steady state operation of comminution circuits:

-  variability in feed (size distribution, ore hardness, feed rate)
-  abrasive nature of the feed material
-  unmeasured disturbances (tramp metal, chute plugging).

Therefore, the control instrumentation should be carefully selected with the objective of preventing these conditions.

Typical equipment normally used in a comminution circuit includes:

-  conveyor belt weightometers (measure the mass of ore entering and leaving)
-  metal detectors (remove tramp steel from crusher feed conveyor)
-  level transmitters (measure the level of material in crushing cavity/surge bins)
-  tilt switches (in feed chutes to detect plugging events).

## 4.0 CONCLUSIONS

SGS completed historical test work in 2015 (SGS 2015) and it is included in this report for completeness.

The Feasibility-level comminution test work was completed in two stages at SGS.  The primary stage was conducted on six composite samples and 13 variability samples, and included the determination of standard comminution parameters (SGS 2016a).  The second stage of comminution test work was conducted on a single composite sample, using a LABWAL HPGR semi-pilot scale test work program (SGS 2016b).  The test work results indicate that the Project ore is categorized as soft to moderately hard in terms of ore hardness, and amenable to standard grinding as well as an HPGR operation.

The comminution flowsheet for the Project was selected by conducting an economic trade-off study (Tetra Tech 2016).  As part of the trade-off study, Tetra Tech compared three comminution flowsheet options on a differential (or relative) cost basis and identified the HPGR flowsheet as the most cost effective option for the Project.

The HPGR option for the comminution flowsheet has been designed to process 1,007,400 t/a of primary crushed niobium ore hoisted from the underground mine, with a characteristic particle size of (P80) 115 mm. The comminution circuit product is expected to have a characteristic particle size of (P80) 1.1 mm.

## 5.0 RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES

Based on the metallurgical test work and the process design completed for the Feasibility Study, Tetra Tech has identified the following potential risks and opportunities for the Project.

## 5.1 RISKS

-  The ore moisture content was assumed as 5%.  This is a reasonable assumption for design purposes, but it is anticipated that the ore moisture content may exceed the 5% limit during certain periods of operation.  It is also observed that some lithology types consisted of an increased amount of clay particles.  It is important to note the presence of higher moisture and clay together in the feed would be detrimental for the effective operation of the HPGR.
-  The entire comminution circuit is designed as a single stream.  This means the breakdown of any equipment in the flowsheet will stop the production of the plant.  This risk could be mitigated by running a preventive maintenance program, as well as employing a good maintenance crew on site.
-  The comminution test work indicates that the ore from one particular area of the mine is much harder than the rest of the ore.  However, Niocorp interpreted that the harder ore represents a minor proportion of the entire ore body.  The comminution circuit design is based on a blended feed that includes the hard ore.  The comminution circuit will be become a bottleneck if this hard ore has to be treated in its own without appropriate blending in place.
-  The consumable consumption rates of the HPGR were not tested; thus the wear and tear of the HPGR unit cannot be estimated.  Higher than normal wear and tear of HPGR is a potential risk.
-  The design comminution circuit product has a characteristic particle size of P80 = 1.1 mm.  This target product size is achievable subject to effective operation of the secondary screen along with the DE agglomeration drums.  Any fluctuations in the HPGR feed size as a result of screen inefficiency will have a negative effect on HPGR performance and final product size.
-  The risk of airborne and respirable dust exposure to the comminution plant operational team has not been quantified yet.  This could be possibly mitigated by employing covered conveyors and an effective dust control system.

## 5.2 OPPORTUNITIES

-  Waste heat generated from other areas of the process plant could possibly be used to dry the ore during periods of higher moisture content of feed ore.

<!-- image -->

## 6.0 RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on the metallurgical test work and the process design completed for the Feasibility Study, Tetra Tech recommends further pilot testing of the HPGR option.  The pilot HPGR test work program should be conducted prior to the detailed engineering stage in order to confirm and determine:

-  the main operating variables of the HPGR
-  flake strength
-  wear rate
-  Abrasion Index

The results from the pilot testing will be used to confirm the unit energy consumption, optimize the HPGR operating variables, and confirm the size of the HPGR unit for industrial operation.

The sample requirement for the pilot testing is estimated to be approximately 1.5 t.

Tetra Tech recommends that NioCorp select a vendor and complete the pilot testing prior to placing the order for the HPGR.  The cost of pilot testing will be in the range of US$8,500 to US$30,000, depending on the vendor.

## Executive Summary

The objective of this project was to characterize the hardness of samples in order to design a single-stage SAG mill grinding circuit.

The grindability tests conducted on 19 samples from the Elk Creek project indicated that:

-  The samples typically varied from the moderately soft to moderately hard range of hardness with respect to SAG milling and in terms of the Bond rod mill work index (RWI);
-  The ore is relatively  softer  for  ball  milling  relative  to  the  SAG  mill  grindability  and  the  samples typically ranged from the soft to medium range of hardness with respect to ball milling;
-  The ore is only slightly abrasive;
-  The hardness variability among the samples was relatively low likely due to the compositing of the samples.  Individual samples may show a greater range of hardness.

The grindability test results were used to design a grinding circuit capable of treating 2,700 tpd (122.3 t/h at 92% availability), from a feed F80 of 115 mm to a P80 of 1.4 mm using the JKSimMet software.  Two single-stage SAG mill configurations were investigated: with and without pebble crushing.

-  For the single-stage SAG mill without pebble crushing, it was found that one 20.0' x 9.0' SAG mill, with internal dimensions (nominal diameter x EGL) of 5.89 x 2.74 m, fitted with a 1.72 MW motor (2,300 HP), would be adequate to reach the design targets;
-  For the single-stage SAG mill with pebble crushing (SAC), it was found that one 20.0' x 7.5' SAG mill, with internal dimensions (nominal diameter x EGL) of 5.89 x 2.29 m, fitted with a 1.42 MW motor (1,900 HP), would be adequate to reach the design targets;
-  The motors were designed to allow an increase in ball charge up to 15% and in mill speed up to 80% of the critical speed (13.9 RPM).

-  Mill  design  should  be  reviewed  with  supplier  as  power  draw  may  vary  with  mill  geometry  and design, like the cone angles.

These recommendations do not allow for any safety factors that should be applied for errors in the model and design assumptions or the uncertainty in the representation of the ore body by the selected samples.

It is  recommended  to  complete  additional  variability  testing  using  continuous  intervals  representing individual blocks rather than large composites, in order to measure the true variability in hardness indices and to reduce the risk in the equipment selection.

Note that the product size P80 from the AG mill operation is highly ore-dependent, although also clearly affected by the classification system.  The P80 figures simulated in JKSimMet should be used as indicative only,  and  fine  tuning  of  the  AG  mill  discharge  system  and  classification  screen  aperture  may  be necessary once in operation.

## Introduction

Mr.  Alain  Dorval  of  Roche  Ltd,  on  behalf  of  NioCorp  Developments  Ltd,  requested  that  SGS  Minerals Services (SGS) perform grindability testing on nineteen samples from the Elk Creek deposit, located in Nebraska, USA.  The objective of this project was to characterize the hardness of the samples in order to design a single-stage SAG mill grinding circuit.

The  sample  preparation  and  grindability  program  was  performed  at  the  SGS  Lakefield  facility.    The characterization included the following tests: JK drop weight test, SMC test, Bond low-energy impact test, Bond rod mill grindability test, Bond ball mill grindability test, and Bond abrasion index test.

The bench-scale test results were used to design a grinding circuit capable of milling 2,700 metric tonnes per day (tpd) from a SAG feed F80 of 115 mm to a final grind P80 of about 1.4 mm.

This report summarizes the sample preparation and presents the grindability test results, as well as the grinding circuit design.

## Discussion

## 1. Sample Receipt and Preparation

Three skids of pails, weighing approximately 1,909 kg total, were received at the SGS Lakefield site in November 2014.  The shipment was given the SGS receipt number 0052-NOV14.  The shipment content was inventoried  following  reception,  and  the  inventory  is  appended  (Appendix  A).    The  samples  were received as full HQ and quarter HQ drill cores.  The samples were composited and grouped into batches according  to  the  grindability  tests  to  be  performed  prior  to  being  submitted  to  the  proper  preparation procedure.  The compositing instructions were provided by Roche Ltd.  A total of six composites and 13 individual samples were prepared and submitted for testing.

The sample and composite preparation details, along with the sample preparation diagrams, are included in  Appendix  A.    Figure  1  depicts  the  preparation  diagram  for  Sample  #13  as  an  example  of  the preparation steps required.

## 2.1. JK Drop-weight and SMC Tests

The JK drop-weight test was performed on four individual samples (Samples #1 to #3 and Sample #12) and on two composites (Comp4-VM12-13, Comp5-LPM11-13).  The results were interpreted by Contact Support Services (CSS), the North American agent for JKTech.  The test results are presented in Table 3 while the test procedures and details are presented in the CSS report (Appendix B).

In  addition  to  the  JK  drop-weight  test,  SMC  tests  were  performed  on  nine  individual  samples  and  six composites,  namely  Comp1-VM10,  Comp2-PM10,  Comp3-P10,  Comp4-VM12-13,  Comp5-LPM11-13, and Comp6-PM13.  The SMC tests on the individual samples were performed on Samples #4 to 11 as well  as  on  Sample  #13.    The  SMC  test  is  an  abbreviated  version  of  the  standard  JK  drop-weight  test performed on rocks from a single size fraction (-22.4/+19.0 mm in this case).  The SMC test results were calibrated  against  reference  samples  submitted  for  the  standard  DWT  in  order  to  consider  the  natural 'gradient of hardness' by size, which can widely vary from one ore to another.  The SMC test results were calibrated against the average DWT results.  The test results are presented in Table 3 and the SMC test results are detailed in the JKTech report, which is appended (Appendix C) along with the test procedure, calibration, and test details.  The cumulative distribution of the A x b values from the Elk Creek samples is compared to other large comminution projects in Figure 2.

The Elk Creek samples typically fell in the moderately soft to  moderately  hard  range of hardness with respect  to  resistance  to  impact  (A x b)  and  abrasion  (t )  breakages.    Only  sample  Comp1-VM10  was a categorized as hard in terms of A x b.  The A x b average, including all the DWT and SMC results, was 47.5.  The two samples on which a DWT and an SMC tests were performed were in good agreement. Four of the DWT samples have shown a slight evidence of bimodality in the rock relative density.  The average rock relative density among the 19 samples varied from 2.84 to 3.32.

As shown in Figure 2, the variability of the A x b from the Elk Creek samples was much lower than what is typically observed.  The Elk Creek A x b distribution is very sharp compared to other projects which all have a reversed 'S' shape, which is more typical.  The low variability in the test results may be due to the fact  that  composites,  made  of  intervals  from  different  depth  and  locations,  were  tested  rather  than discrete samples representing a specific block or location in the deposit.  Testing on large composites tends to reduce the variability observed in the results.

## 2.2. Bond Low-energy Impact Test

The Bond low-energy impact test determines the Bond Crusher Work Index (CWI), which can be used with Bond's third theory of comminution to calculate power requirements for crusher sizing.  The test was performed  on  Samples  #12  and  #13  only.    A  total  of  20  rock  specimens  for  each  sample,  in  the -75/+50 mm size fraction  were shipped to the SGS Burnaby laboratory for the completion of the Bond low-energy impact test.    The  results  are  presented  in  Table  4  and  compared  to  the  SGS  database  in Figure 3.  The test details are appended (Appendix D).  With CWI values of 10.7 kWh/t (Sample #12) and 12.0 kWh/t (Sample #13), the samples fell in the medium to moderately hard range of hardness of the SGS database.

## 2.3. Bond Rod Mill Grindability Test

Composites 1, 2, 4, and 5, as well as Samples #1 to 13 were prepared for the Bond rod mill grindability test at 14 mesh (1,180 microns) of grind.  The test results are summarized in Table 5 and the Bond Rod mill Work Indices (RWI) are compared to the SGS database in Figure 4.  The cumulative distribution of the RWI's from the Elk Creek samples is compared to other large comminution projects in Figure 5.

The  test  details  are  appended  (Appendix  E).    With  RWI's  ranging  from  11.9  to  18.0  KWh/t,  the  RWI values fell in the soft to hard range of hardness and averaged 15.4 kWh/t.

Sample #5 was categorized as soft with an RWI of 11.9 kWh/t corresponding to 23 rd percentile,  while Comp1-VM10 was the hardest with an RWI of 18.0 kWh/t.

As observed in the DWT and SMC test results, the variability of the RWI results was relatively low, as shown in Figure 5.

## 2.4. Bond Ball Mill Grindability Test

The  Bond  ball  mill  grindability  test  was  performed  at  400  mesh  of  grind  (38  microns)  on  all  samples except for sample Comp3-P10.  The test results are summarized in Table 6 and compared to the SGS database in Figure 6.  The Elk Creek BWI cumulative distribution is compared to other large comminution projects in Figure 7.  The test details are appended (Appendix F).

For such a fine closing screen size (38 microns), the mill product was wet-screened at every stage.

Samples #4 and #7 fell in the soft range of hardness with BWI's of 11.6 and 11.7 kWh/t, respectively. The hardest Elk Creek sample was Comp1, categorized as moderately hard with a BWI of 15.7 kWh/t. The remaining BWI values fell in the moderately soft to medium range of hardness of the SGS database. The overall BWI average was 13.5 kWh/t.  Overall, the variability in the BWI was relatively low.

## 2.5. Bond Abrasion Test

A total of four composites (1, 2, 4, 5) and the 13 individual samples were submitted for the Bond abrasion test.    The  results  are  summarized  in  Table  7  and  comparison  to  the  SGS  database  is  depicted  in Figure 8.  The cumulative distribution of the AI's from the Elk Creek samples is compared to other large comminution projects in Figure 9.  The test details are appended (Appendix G).

The Abrasion Index (AI) for  all  the  samples  and  composites  tested  ranged  from  0.026  to  0.126  which correspond to the mildly to slightly abrasive range.  The overall AI average was 0.072 g.  The Comp2 was the most abrasive sample with an AI of 0.126 g.  As for the other indices measured within this project, the variability of the AI results was very low.

## 3. Grinding Circuit Design

After completion of the grindability test program, the design was put on hold for about 18 months until the metallurgical  flowsheet  and  liberation  size  requirement  were  defined.    Since  the  liberation  size  is  now coarse enough, the need of a secondary milling step was eliminated.

A grinding circuit design was performed based on the bench-scale grindability test results presented in Section 2 using the JKSimMet software.

## 3.1. Design Criteria

The grinding circuit was designed to handle a throughput rate of 2,700 tpd (122.3 t/h at 92% availability) from a feed F80 of 115 mm to a final grind P80 of 1.4 mm.  The design criteria are summarized below:

## Design Criteria:

Daily Tonnage:

2,700 tpd (metric)

Utilization Rate:

92.0%

Throughput Rates:

122.3 t/h

F80:

115 mm

Final P80:

1,400 microns

Two flowsheet configurations, which are represented in their simplified form in Figure 10 and Figure 11, were investigated in the design.  The first option is a single-stage SAG circuit, which consists of a semiautogenous grinding mill (SAG) closed with a screen.  The addition of a pebble crusher to the previous

configuration, which results in the SAC circuit, was also simulated.  A standard primary crusher product size  distribution,  with  an  F 80 of  115  mm,  was  requested.    The  complete  size  distribution  used  for  the design is presented in Figure 12.

The two circuit configurations were evaluated based on the 80 th hardness percentile calculated from the 19 samples.  The grindability results, used for the scoping simulations, are presented in  Table 8.  The major assumptions made by SGS based on experience, are discussed in the following sub-sections.

## 3.1.1. Correction Factors and Calculations

The SAG mill powers were calculated using the Morrell power calculation spreadsheet and correspond to the power at the motor input.

The average crusher power requirements, calculated using the Bond crusher work index, were reported at the motor input.  Bond's equation reports the crusher power at the motor output, and thus a correction factor  of  0.95  was  applied.    Note  that  the  calculated  crusher  power  corresponds  to  average  power

requirements based on the third theory of comminution, but the crusher motors must be designed by the supplier to handle peak power

The total gross power was obtained by adding the power requirements for the SAG milling and pebble crushing (when applicable).  The total specific power requirement was calculated by dividing the gross power requirement by the total feed rate.

## 3.2. Scoping Simulation Results

The  simulations  were  performed  with  a  SAG  mill  charge  level  of  25%,  which  is  the  average  in  the JKSimMet model database, and is considered optimal for throughput.  The simulations were performed with  a  maximum  of  25%  recycle  rate  at  the  SAG  mill.    The  results  of  the  scoping  simulations  are presented in Table 9 and Table 10.

In SIM-01, it was found that a 20.0' x 9.0' (nominal diameter x EGL) SAG mill with internal dimensions of 5.89 x 2.74 m and operated with a 10% ball charge would be required to achieve 122.3 t/h (2,700 tpd) for the single-stage SAG configuration.  A speed of 75% of the critical speed was used, which corresponds to 13.1 RPM.  A closing screen size of 8 mm was used, and resulted in a product size P80 of about 1.6 mm. The grind size was slightly coarser than the target of 1.4 mm because it is expected that the grindability test results from the 80 th percentile, used in the scoping simulations, will generate a coarser P80 than the average grinding test results.  The SAG mill power requirement was 10.9 kWh/t.  Cone angles of 15º were assumed for the SAG mill, but final design should be checked with the supplier.  The SAG mill should be fitted with a total installed power of 2,300 HP (1.72 MW), which would allow an increase in ball charge up to 15% and in mill speed up to 80% of the critical speed (13.9 RPM).

The addition of a pebble crusher, simulated in SIM-02, resulted in an overall power requirement reduction of about 1.7 kWh/t and thus a shorter SAG mill.  A 20.0' x 7.5' (EGL) SAG mill, with internal dimensions of 5.89 x 2.29 m was selected to handle 122.3 t/h for the SAC configuration.  Cone angles of 15º were also assumed  for  the  SAG  mill.    The  SAG  mill  should  be  fitted  with  a  total  installed  power  of  1,900  HP (1.42 MW), which  will  allow  an  increase  in  ball  charge  up  to  15%  and  in  mill  speed  up  to  80%  of  the critical speed (13.9 RPM).  Given the low recycle rate of 27 t/h, a single HP100 cone crusher should be adequate for pebble crushing.

## 3.3. Variability Simulation Results

Variability  simulations  were  performed  for  each  of  the  two  designs  presented  previously,  using  the  19 samples  submitted  for  bench-scale  comminution  testing.    The  single-stage  SAG  mill  was  simulated  in SIM-03 to SIM-21, while the SAC circuit was simulated in SIM-22 to SIM-40.  The results of the variability simulations are also presented in Table 9 and Table 10 and are compared in graphical form in Figure 13 and Figure 14.

The total specific energy required to process 122.3 t/h was 10.8 kWh/t, on average, and varied from 10.3 to 11.3 kWh/t, for the SS-SAG configuration.  The product size P80 averaged 1,426 microns, and ranged from 1,184 to 1,840 microns.

The addition of a pebble crusher reduced the average total specific energy requirement to 9.2 kWh/t, and ranged from 8.7 to 9.6 kWh/t.  The average product size for the SAC configuration was 1,459 microns, and varied from 1,219 to 1,868 microns.  The characteristics of the recommended AG mills are presented in Table 11.

Note  that  the  product  size  P 80 from  AG  mill  operation  is  highly  ore-dependent,  although  also  clearly affected by the classification system.  The P80 figures simulated in JKSimMet should be used as indicative only,  and  fine  tuning  of  the  AG  mill  discharge  system  and  classification  screen  aperture  may  be necessary once in operation.

## 1 INTRODUCTION

Drop-weight test data for six samples from Niocorp were received  from SGS Minerals Services on February 24-26, 2015, by CSS  for data analysis.  The samples were  identified as  Comp 4-VM 12-12, Comp 5-LPM 11-13, Sample #1, Sample #2, Sample #3 and Sample #12.  The data were analysed to determine the JKSimMet comminution parameters.  Analysis and reporting  were completed on February 27, 2015.

## 2 THE JK DROP-WEIGHT TEST

## 2.1 INTRODUCTION

The JKTech drop-weight test provides ore specific parameters for use in the JKSimMet Mineral Processing Simulator software.  In JKSimMet, these parameters are combined with equipment details and operating conditions to analyse and/or predict SAG/autogenous mill performance.  The same test procedure also provides ore type characterisation for the JKSimMet crusher model.  These ore specific parameters have been calculated from the test results and are supplied to Niocorp Developments Ltd. in this report as part of the standard procedure.

## 2.2 DROP-WEIGHT TEST PROCEDURE

Details of the drop-weight test procedure can be found in Appendix A.

## 2.3 INTERPRETATION OF DW TEST RESULTS

## 2.3.1 Resistance to Impact Breakage

One of the problems with the functional form used to represent the t10 v Ecs relationship is that the parameters A and b are not independent and thus cannot be used directly for comparisons between ore types.  Two alternative parameters give a better comparison.  These are the product A*b and the t10 achieved by the application of 1.0 kWh/t of Specific Comminution Energy (Ecs).  For both of these parameters, a smaller number means a greater resistance to impact breakage.

## 2.3.2 Resistance to Abrasion Breakage

Resistance to abrasion is indicated by the ta parameter.  As with parameter A*b, a smaller value of ta indicates more resistance, this time to abrasion breakage.

## 2.3.3 Effect of Particle Size on Resistance to Impact Breakage

Variation of impact resistance with particle size is important for crusher power draw calculations and SAG/autogenous mill media competency considerations.  Some ores exhibit a significant decrease in impact resistance with increasing particle size while others show no variation with size.  The opposite trend of increasing impact resistance with increasing particle size is extremely rare.

The trend most frequently observed is for there to be decreasing slope with decreasing energy (Ecs values).  However, it is both the slope and the absolute values of the low energy t10 values that are of interest for SAG/autogenous milling because these data give an indication of the ability of media particles to survive.  If the trend of the t10 values with increasing particle size is significantly upwards, it can be inferred by extrapolation that particles in the 100 - 200 mm size range (normal media size) will not be strong enough to survive.  The same argument applies if the absolute values of t10 at low energy are sufficiently high.

## 2.3.4 Density Results

As part of the standard JKTech ore property assessment procedures, the relative density of 30 randomly selected particles in the size range 26.5 mm to 31.5 mm are determined by weighing each particle, suspended initially in air and then in water.

It should be noted that this method measures the density of the particle rather than the density of the solid phase, since any internal porosity will be included in the volume measurement.  A more accurate measurement of the solid phase density is possible using a Helium Pycnometer.  However, it is the particle density rather than the phase density that is of concern in the assessment of SAG milling properties.

Even at the coarse particle sizes tested, it is normal to find a range of relative densities as the mineralogy of the particles varies.  However, of great concern in SAG/autogenous milling is the possibility of a component in the ore that is both high density and resistant to breakage.  Such material will concentrate in the load in a SAG/autogenous mill and result in higher than expected power draw.

Sample #12 has an A*b value of 46.4, which puts this material in the medium range of resistance to impact breakage.  In the JKTech database, 50.7% of the 4,568 ore types contained in the JK database have lower A*b values (refer to Table 2).

With a ta of 0.33, Sample #12 falls into the hard abrasion range compared with the other ore types in Table 2.  In the JKTech database, 26.8% of the 4,596 ore types contained in the JK database have lower ta values.

## APPENDIX A.  BACKGROUND TO THE DROP WEIGHT TEST

## A 1 INTRODUCTION

This section provides a brief description of the drop-weight test procedure.

To characterise ore breakage at different energy levels, the JKTech method uses two complimentary techniques:

- 1. To characterise breakage at moderate to high energy levels (i.e. impact breakage), a drop-weight device is used.
- 2. To characterise breakage at low energy inputs (i.e. the abrasion component of breakage), a tumbling test is used.

## A 2 IMPACT BREAKAGE TESTING

The JK drop-weight device comprises a steel drop-weight that can be raised by a winch to a known height.  A pneumatic switch releases the drop-weight, which then falls under gravity and impacts on a rock particle that is positioned on a steel anvil. The device is enclosed in Perspex shielding and incorporates a variety of features to ensure operator safety.  By varying the height from which the drop-weight is released and the mass of the drop-weight, a very wide range of energy inputs can be generated.  A schematic drawing of the device is given in App Figure 1.

After release, the drop-weight descends under the influence of gravity and impacts the target particle.

App Figure 1 - The JK Drop Weight Tester

<!-- image -->

The particle is broken and the drop-weight is brought to rest at a distance above the anvil approximately equal to the largest product particle.  The difference in distance between the initial starting point and the final resting place of the drop-weight is used to calculate the energy that is expended in breaking the particle.  Thus

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where:

Ei =  energy used for breakage

M  =  drop-weight mass g  =  gravitational constant

h  =  initial height of the drop-weight above the anvil xM =  final height of the drop-weight above the anvil.

Providing the drop-weight does not rebound after impact, the application of equation (1) is valid.  Where rebound occurs an additional term is required to account for the energy re-transmitted to the drop-weight.  Rebound has been seen to occur only at elevated input energies.  This energy will be assessed during the test work program. It is likely, however, that its magnitude will be relatively small and can be ignored with only a minimal loss in accuracy.

The assumption is made that all the energy provided is utilised in the breakage of the particle.  Thus

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where:

Eis =  specific input energy

Ecs =  specific comminution energy m    =  mean particle mass

To test an ore type, the original 100 kg sample is sized into selected fourth-root-oftwo size fractions.  Ten (10) to thirty (30) particles are required in each size fraction for each energy level, depending on particle mass.  Typically fifteen (15) size/energy combinations are selected.  The input energy levels for a particular test are designed to suit ore hardness but a standard set of energies are used whenever possible.

The breakage products of all particles for each size/energy combination are collected and sized.  The size distribution produced is normalised with respect to the original particle size.  For a wide range of energy inputs, particle sizes and ore types, the relative size distributions remain similar in shape and can be fully characterised by a single point on the distribution.  The JKTech convention is to use the percentage passing one-tenth of the original particle size.  This is referred to as the "t10" value.

In the manner described above, a set of t10 and Ecs values are produced for the 15 energy/size combinations.

## A 3 ABRASION BREAKAGE TESTING

It is possible to characterise low energy (abrasion) breakage with a miniature dropweight and repeated impacts.  However, Leung (1987) demonstrated that a tumbling test of selected single size fractions could produce a similar result with less experimental effort.

The standard abrasion test tumbles 3 kg of -55+38 mm particles for 10 minutes at 70% critical speed in a 305 mm by 305 mm laboratory mill fitted with 4 x 6 mm lifter bars.  The resulting product is then sized and the t10 value for the product is determined.

The mean particle size of the original size fraction 55 x 38 mm is 45.7 mm.  The t10 size is:

## A 4 USING STANDARD DW TEST RESULTS IN JKSIMMET

## A 4.1 SAG/autogenous Mill Model

In the SAG/autogenous mill, both breakage mechanisms discussed in Section 2 are assumed to occur.  The parameters used in the model are given in Table 1.

## A 4.2 High Energy or Impact Breakage

To represent the impact breakage mechanism in the model, the 15 pairs of t10/Ecs data from the drop-weight test are subjected to non-linear least squares techniques to fit the following equation, which describes the relationship between breakage and impact energy:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

In this equation, A and b are the fitted parameters.  These parameters can then be used in the JKSimMet SAG/autogenous mill model which incorporates the same relationship.

## A 4.3 Low Energy or Abrasion Breakage

As discussed in Section A 3, the abrasion test results in a t10 figure.  The abrasion parameter used in the model, ta, is defined as

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

For example, if t10 = % passing 4.57 mm = 4.0%, then

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

## A 4.4 Combined Breakage

These two sets of parameters representing the two breakage modes are used in combination by the model to generate an ore specific appearance function.  The scaling factor of 10 is applied in the calculation of ta so that the relative proportions of

high and low energy breakage represented in the combined appearance function are correct.

The assumption is made that all brittle rock types break with the same general pattern and this pattern is built into the model.  This assumption does not mean that the amount of energy required to achieve a particular t10 is the same for all brittle rocks.  It simply means that if a single particle is broken to a particular t10 value, then the complete size distribution of the broken fragments is known.

This assumption is not perfect but is quite adequate for the purposes of the SAG/autogenous model.

To use the results of testing, the ore type parameters A and b (from drop-weight testing) and ta (from abrasion testing), are entered into the SAG/autogenous mill model in JKSimMet, together with machine dependent parameters of mill size, grate size, ball load, etc.  The simulation predicts product size and mill load using appropriate breakage rates.  The simulator can then also be used to predict mill performance with variations in screen and classifier configurations or even with recycle crushing.

Details of the SAG/autogenous mill model are given in Leung (1987) and Leung, Morrison, and Whiten (1987).  The calculations on which the power prediction for SAG/autogenous mills is based are described in Morrell (1996).

## A 4.5 Crusher Model

For the crusher model, only the high energy or impact breakage test results are used. These are presented in a somewhat different manner from the SAG/autogenous mill model.

The assumption that all brittle rocks break with the same breakage pattern is not made and the pattern for the ore under test is used.  The parameters used by the crusher model are tabulated in the results section of this report.  The appearance function defines the shape of the breakage distribution curve at various degrees of "broken-ness", as defined by t10.  The specific comminution energy table defines the amount of energy required to achieve varying levels of "broken-ness".  The form of the specific comminution energy table reflects the fact that the energy required to achieve a certain degree of breakage is sometimes found to be dependent on the initial particle size.

Details of the crusher model including power prediction are described in Andersen and Napier-Munn (1988).

## A 4.6 Limitations

Experience to date demonstrates that the drop-weight test is appropriate for brittle ores over a wide range of hardness.  However, it is not useful for ores which undergo plastic deformation rather than brittle fracture, such as those of high clay content.

The testing procedure is limited by the maximum particle size tested.  If the ore is fractured or weaker at larger particle sizes, then JKSimMet simulations will be conservative.

For autogenous mills it is essential to have competent material in the range 150 mm to 100 mm in the feed to form the media.  If autogenous milling is seriously contemplated, testing of media competency at larger particle sizes should be conducted.  This can be achieved by drop-weight testing, media competency testing or full pilot plant testing.

## 1 INTRODUCTION

SMC data for fifteen samples from NioCorp Project were received  from  SGS Minerals Services on March 04, 2015, by JKTech for SMC test analysis.  The samples were  identified as Comp 1-VM10, Comp 2-PM10, Comp 3-P10, Comp 4VM12-13, Comp 5-LPM 11-13, Comp 6-PM13, Sample #4, Sample #5, Sample #6, Sample #7, Sample #8, Sample #9, Sample #10, Sample #11 &amp; Sample #13.  The data were analysed to determine the JKSimMet comminution parameters. SMC test results were forwarded to SMC Testing Pty Ltd for the analysis.  Analysis and reporting were completed on March 05, 2015.

## 2 THE SMC TEST®

## 2.1 INTRODUCTION

The standard JK Drop-Weight test provides ore specific parameters for use in the JKSimMet Mineral Processing Simulator software.  In JKSimMet, these parameters are combined with equipment details and operating conditions to analyse and/or predict SAG/autogenous mill performance.  The same test procedure also provides ore type characterisation for the JKSimMet crusher model.

The SMC test was developed by Steve Morrell of SMC Testing Pty Ltd (SMCT) to provide a cost effective means of obtaining these parameters from drill core or in situations where limited quantities of material are available.  The ore specific parameters have been calculated from the test results and are supplied to NioCorp Developments in this report as part of the standard procedure

## 2.2 GENERAL DESCRIPTION AND TEST BACKGROUND

The SMC Test ® was originally designed for the breakage characterisation of drill core and it generates a relationship between input energy (kWh/t) and the percent of broken product passing a specified sieve size.  The results are used to determine the so-called JK Drop-Weight index (DWi), which is a measure of the strength of the rock when broken under impact conditions and has the units kWh/m .  The DWi is directly 3 related to the JK rock breakage parameters A and b and hence can be used to estimate the values of these parameters as well as being correlated with the JK abrasion parameter - ta.  For crusher modelling the t10-Ecs matrix can also be derived. This is done by using the size-by-size A*b values that are used in the SMC Test® data analysis (see below) to estimate the t10-Ecs values for each of the relevant size fractions in the crusher model matrix.

For power-based calculations, (see APPENDIX B), the SMC Test ® provides the comminution parameters Mia, Mih and Mic. Mia is the work index for the grinding of coarser particles (&gt; 750 µm) in tumbling mills such as autogenous (AG), semiautogenous (SAG), rod and ball mills.  Mih is the work index for the grinding in High Pressure Grinding Rolls (HPGR) and Mic for size reduction in conventional crushers.

The SMC Test ® is a precision test, which uses particles that are either cut from drill core using a diamond saw to achieve close size replication or else selected from crushed material so that particle mass variation is controlled within a prescribed range. The particles are then broken at a number of prescribed impact energies. The high degree of control imposed on both the size of particles and the breakage energies used, means that the test is largely free of the repeatability problems associated with tumbling-mill based tests.  Such tests usually suffer from variations in feed size (which is not closely controlled) and  energy input, often assumed to be constant when in reality it can be highly variable (Levin, 1989).

The relationship between the DWi and the JK rock breakage parameters makes use of the size-by-size nature of rock strength that is often apparent from the results of full JK Drop-Weight tests.  The effect is illustrated in Figure 1, which plots the normalized values of A*b against particle size.  This figure also shows how the gradient of these plots varies across the full range of rock types tested.  In the case of a conventional JK Drop-Weight test, these values are effectively averaged and a

mean value of A and b is reported. The SMC Test ® uses a single size and makes use of relationships such as that shown in Figure 1 to predict the A and b of the particle size that has the same value as the mean for a JK full Drop-Weight test.

## 2.3 THE TEST PROCEDURE

In the SMC Test ® , five sets of 20 particles are broken, each set at a different specific energy level, using a JK Drop-Weight tester.  The breakage products are screened at a sieve size selected to provide a direct measurement of the t10 value.

The test calls for a prescribed target average volume for the particles, with the target being chosen to be equivalent to the mean volume of particles in one of the standard JK Drop-Weight test size fractions.

The rest height of the drop-head (gap) is recorded after breakage of each particle to allow for a correction to the drop energy.  After breaking all 20 particles in a set, the broken product is sieved at an aperture size, one tenth of the original particle size. Thus, the percent passing mass gives a direct reading of the t10 value for breakage at that energy level.

There are two alternative methods of preparing the particle sets for breakage testing: the particle selection method and the cut core method.  The particle selection method is the most commonly used as it is generally less time consuming.  The cut core method requires less material, so tends to be used as a fallback method, only when necessary to cope with restricted sample availability.

## 2.3.1 Particle Selection Method

For the particle selection method, the test is carried out on material in one of three alternative size fractions: -31.5+26.5, -22.4+19 or -16+13.2 mm.  The largest size fraction is preferred but requires more material.  The middle size fraction tends to be

most commonly used, whilst the finest size fraction tends only to be used if there is an issue with starting material size distribution or quantity.

In the particle selection method, particles are chosen so that their individual masses lie within ±30% of the target mass and the mean mass for each set of 20 lies within ±10% of the target mass.  A typical set of particles is shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2 - A Typical Set of Particles for Breakage (Particle Selection Method)

Before commencing breakage tests on the particles, the ore density is determined by first weighing a representative sample of particles in air and then in water.

## 2.3.2 Cut Core Method

The cut core method uses cut pieces of quartered (slivered) drill core.  Whole core or half core can be used, but when received in this form it needs to be first quartered as a preliminary step in the procedure.  Once quartered, any broken or tapered ends of the quartered lengths are cut, to square them off.  Before the lengths of quartered core are cut to produce the pieces for the JK Drop-Weight testing, each one is weighed in air and then in water, to obtain a density measurement and a measure of its mass per unit length.

The size fraction targeted when the cut core method is used depends on the original core diameter.  The target size fraction is selected to ensure that pieces of the correct volume will have 'chunky' rather than 'slabby' proportions.

Having measured the density of the core, the target volume can be translated into a target mass and with the average mass per unit length also known, an average cutting interval can be determined for the core.

Sufficient pieces of the quartered core are cut to generate 100 particles.  These are then divided into the five sets of 20 and broken in the JK Drop-Weight tester at the five different energy levels.  Within each set, the three possible orientations of the particles are equally represented (as far as possible, given that there are 20 particles).  The orientations prescribed for testing are shown in Figure 3.

The cut core method cannot be used for cores with diameters exceeding 70 mm, where the particle masses would be too large to achieve the highest prescribed energy level.

## 2.4 SMC TEST ®  RESULTS

The SMC Test ® results for the fifteen samples from NioCorp Project are given in Table 1.  This table includes the average rock density and the JK Drop-Weight index that is the direct result of the test procedure, plus the derived estimates of parameters A, b and ta that are required for JKSimMet comminution modelling.  The values determined for the Mia, Mih and Mic parameters developed by SMCT are also presented in this table.  The Mia parameter represents the coarse particle component (down to 750 µm), of the overall comminution energy and can be used together with the Mib (fine particle component) to estimate the total energy requirements of a conventional comminution circuit. The use of these parameters is explained further in APPENDIX B.

In the case of the fifteen samples from NioCorp Project, the A and b estimates are based on the results of full drop-weight testing on similar ore (Comp 4 - VM12-12 &amp; Comp 5 - LPM 11-13).  The full drop-weight test results were used to calibrate the

DWi versus A and b correlations.  The drop-weight results were supplied by SGS Minerals Services, and the average of the two results was used.

The influence of particle size on the specific comminution energy needed to achieve a particular t10 value can also be inferred from the SMC Test ® results.  The energy requirements for three particle sizes, each crushed to three different t10 values, are presented in Table 2.

The SMC Test ® database now contains over 25,000 test results on samples representing more than 850 different deposits worldwide.

Around 99% of the DWi values lie in the range 0.5 to14.0 kWh/m , with soft ores 3 being at the low end of this range and hard ores at the high end.

A cumulative graph of DWi values from the SMC Test ® Database is shown in Figure 4 below.  This graph can be used to compare the DWi of the material from NioCorp

Project, with the entire population of ores in the SMCT database.  The figures on the y-axis of the graph represent the percentages of all ores tested that are softer than the x-axis (DWi) value selected.

A further cumulative distribution graph is provided in Figure 5 to allow a comparison of the Mia, Mih and Mic values obtained for the NioCorp Project material, with the entire population of values for these parameters contained in the SMCT database.

The value of A*b, which is also a measure of resistance to impact breakage, is calculated and presented in Table 3 along with indicators of how each A*b value compares with the accumulated values in the JK Drop-Weight database (from full JK

Drop-Weight testing).  These indicators are the Category (eg 'soft' etc), the Rank (how many out of 4,176 recordings in database are harder) and the percent of database values that are harder.  Note that in contrast to the DWi, a high value of A*b means that an ore is soft whilst a low value means that it is hard.

The calculated value of t10 at an Ecs of 1 kWh/t is also shown in Table 3.  This is again accompanied by Category, Rank and the percent of values in the database that are harder, so each can be seen against the yard-stick of all other samples in the JKTech database.

## APPENDIX A. BACKGROUND TO THE SMC TEST ®

## A 1 HOW THE SMC TEST ®  RESULTS ARE USED

The SMC Test® generates a relationship between specific input energy (kWh/t) and the percent of broken product passing a specified sieve size. The results are used to determine the JK Drop-Weight index (DWi), which is a measure of the strength of the rock when broken under impact conditions. The DWi is directly related to the JK rock breakage parameters A and b and hence can be used to estimate the values of these parameters.

Provision of a relatively low cost method of estimating the A and b parameters opens the possibility of incorporating these data into mine and mill planning operations. However a number of full JK Drop-Weight tests is still recommended for any particular orebody, to ensure that an accurate correlation between the DWi and the A and b parameters is available. The number of full JK Drop-Weight tests required for a given orebody will depend on its variability and should at least cover the major recognised ore types.

The A and b parameters are used in AG/SAG mill models, such as those in JKSimMet, for predicting how the rock will break inside the mill. From this description the models can predict what the throughput, power draw and product size distribution will be (Napier-Munn et al (1996)). Modelling also enables a detailed flowsheet to be built up of the comminution circuit response to changes in ore type. It also allows optimisation strategies to be developed to overcome any deleterious changes in circuit performance predicted from differences in ore type when such changes are indicated by the SMC Test®. These strategies can include both changes to how mills are operated (eg ball load, speed etc) and changes to feed size distribution through modification of blasting practices and primary crusher operation (mine-to-mill).

The mine to mill models require information on rock mass competence such as provided by the point load index. The DWi is correlated with the point load index and hence can also be used in blast fragmentation modelling where direct measurements of point load index are not available.

The DWi is related to the resistance of a rock to breakage under impact. SMCT has developed a series of equations that relate the DWi to the specific energy (kWh/t) requirements of complete AG and SAG mill circuits. These equations take into consideration factors such as ball charge, feed size, aspect ratio, whether the mill is operated with or without a pebble crusher and whether it is closed with a fine classifier such as a cyclone. The ability of these equations to predict AG/SAG mill circuit specific energy is illustrated in App Figure 1. The data shown cover 19 different operations and include Cu, Au, Ni and Pb/Zn ores.

App Figure 1 - Mill Power Prediction Based on DWi

<!-- image -->

It should be noted that the parameter ta, which is the parameter representing the low energy abrasion component of breakage, is not yielded by the SMC Test®.  This parameter is derived from a tumbling test that is carried out as part of the full JK Drop-Weight test.  The fact that it is also required as an input to the JKSimMet SAG/AG models provides a further reason for ensuring that some full JK DropWeight tests are also performed to represent at least the main rock types of an orebody.

## A 2 IMPACT COMMINUTION THEORY

When a rock fragment is broken, the degree of breakage can be characterised by the 't10' parameter.  The t10 value is the percentage of the original rock mass that passes a screen aperture one tenth of the original rock fragment size.  This parameter allows the degree of breakage to be compared across different starting sizes.

The specific comminution energy (Ecs) has the units kWh/t and is the energy applied during impact breakage.  As the impact energy is varied, so does the t10 value vary in response. Higher impact energies produce higher values of t10, which of course means products with finer size distributions.

The equation describing the relationship between the t10 and Ecs is given below.

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

As can be seen from this equation, there are two rock breakage parameters A and b that relate the t10 (size distribution index) to the applied specific energy (Ecs).  These parameters are ore specific and are normally determined from a full JK Drop-Weight test.

A typical plot of t10 vs Ecs from a JK Drop-Weight test is shown in App Figure 2.  The relationship is characterised by the two-parameter equation above, where t10 is the dependent variable.

App Figure 2 - Typical t10 v Ecs Plot

<!-- image -->

The t10 can be thought of as a 'fineness index' with larger values of t10 indicating a finer product size distribution. The value of parameter A is the limiting value of t10. This limit indicates that at higher energies, little additional size reduction occurs as the Ecs is increased beyond a certain value.  A*b is the slope of the curve at 'zero' input energy and is generally regarded as an indication of the strength of the rock, lower values indicating a higher strength.

The A and b parameters can also be used with equation 1 to generate a table of Ecs values, given a range of t10 values. Such a table is used in crusher modelling to predict the power requirement of the crusher given a feed and a product size specification.

The DWi can be used to estimate the JK rock breakage parameters A and b by utilizing the fact that there is usually a pronounced (and ore specific) trend to decreasing rock strength with increasing particle size.  This trend is illustrated in App Figure 3  which shows a plot of A*b versus particle size for a number of different rock types.

App Figure 3 - Size Dependence of A*b for a Range of Ore Types

<!-- image -->

In the case of a conventional JK Drop-Weight test these values are effectively averaged and a mean value of A and b is reported. The SMC Test® uses a single size and makes use of relationships such as that shown in App Figure 3 to predict the A and b of the particle size that has the same value as the mean for a full JK Drop-Weight test.

An example of this is illustrated in App Figure 4 - Predicted v Observed A*b where the observed values of the product A*b are plotted against those predicted using the DWi. Each of the data points in App Figure 4 is a result from a different ore type within an orebody.

App Figure 4 - Predicted v Observed A*b

## APPENDIX B. USE OF THE Mia, Mib, Mih, Mic IN PREDICTING COMMINUTION CIRCUIT SPECIFIC ENERGY

## B 1 INTRODUCTION

-  As the SMC Test® produces the JK parameter values A and b as well as estimates the JK parameter ta and crusher model energy matrices, the SMC Test® can be used to conduct AG/SAG mill and crusher circuit simulations through the use of JKSimMet.  Independent of this it can be used in powerbased calculations, which in conjunction with the Bond ball work index test, enable the prediction of specific energy of comminution circuits where such circuits include combinations of any of the following equipment:



-  AG and SAG mills
-  Ball mills
-  Rod mills
-  Crushers
-  High Pressure Grinding Rolls (HPGR)

## B 2 EQUATIONS

## B 2.1 General

The approach divides comminution equipment into three categories:

Tumbling mills, eg AG, SAG, rod and ball mills

Conventional reciprocating crushers, eg jaw, gyratory and cone

HPGRs

Tumbling mills are described using 2 indices: Mia and Mib

Crushers have one index: Mic

HPGRs have one index: Mih

For tumbling mills the 2 indices relate to "coarse" and "fine" ore properties plus an efficiency factor which represents the influence of a pebble crusher in AG/SAG mill circuits.  "Coarse" in this case is defined as spanning the size range from a P80 of 750 microns up to the P80 of the product of the last stage of crushing or HPGR size reduction prior to grinding. "Fine" covers the size range from a P80 of 750 microns

down to P80 sizes typically reached by conventional ball milling, ie about 45 microns. The choice of 750 microns as the division between "coarse" and "fine" particle sizes was determined during the development of the technique and was found to give the best overall results across the range of plants in SMCC's data base.  Implicit in the approach is that distributions are parallel and linear in log-log space.

The work index covering grinding in tumbling mills of coarse sizes is labelled Mia. The work index covering grinding of fine particles is labelled Mib (Morrell, 2008).  Mia values are provided as a standard output from a SMC Test® (Morrell, 2004a) whilst Mib values can be determined using the data generated by a conventional Bond ball mill work index test (Mib is NOT the Bond ball work index). Mic and Mih values are also provided as a standard output from a SMC Test® (Morrell, 2009).

The general size reduction equation is as follows (Morrell, 2004b):

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where

Mi = Work index related to the breakage property of an ore (kWh/tonne); for grinding from the product of the final stage of crushing to a P80 of 750 microns (coarse particles) the index is labelled Mia and for size reduction from 750 microns to the final product P80 normally reached by conventional ball mills (fine particles) it is labelled Mib.  For conventional crushing Mic is used and for HPGRs Mih is used.

- Wi = Specific comminution (kWh/tonne)
- x2 = 80% passing size for the product (microns)
- x1 = 80% passing size for the feed (microns)

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

For tumbling mills the specific comminution energy (Wi) relates to the power at the pinion or for gearless drives - the motor output.  For HPGRs it is the energy inputted to the rolls, whilst for conventional crushers Wi relates to the specific energy as determined using the motor input power less the no-load power.

## B 2.2 Specific Energy Determination for Comminution Circuits

The total specific energy (WT) to reduce in size primary crusher product to final product is given by:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

## where

Wa = specific energy to grind coarser particles in tumbling mills

Wb = specific energy to grind finer particles in tumbling mills

Wc = specific energy for conventional crushing

Wh = specific energy for HPGRs

Ws = specific energy correction for size distribution

Clearly only the W values associated with the relevant equipment in the circuit being studied are included in equation 3..

## B 2.2.1 Tumbling mills

For coarse particle grinding in tumbling mills equation 1 is written as:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where

K1 = 1.0 for all circuits that do not contain a recycle pebble crusher and 0.95 where circuits do have a pebble crusher x1 = P80 in microns of the product of the last stage of crushing before grinding

- x2 = 750 microns
- Mia = Coarse ore work index and is provided directly by SMC Test®

For fine particle grinding equation 1 is written as:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where

- x2 = 750 microns
- x3 = P80 of final grind in microns

Mib = Provided by data from the standard Bond ball work index test using the following equation (Morrell, 2006):

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where

Mib = fine ore work index (kWh/tonne)

P1 = closing screen size in microns

Gbp = net grams of screen undersize per mill revolution

p80 = 80% passing size of the product in microns

f 80 = 80% passing size of the feed in microns

Note that the Bond ball work index test should be carried out with a closing screen size which gives a final product P80 similar to that intended for the full scale circuit.

## B 2.2.2 Conventional Crushers and HPGR

Equation 1 for conventional crushers is written as:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

## Where

Sc = coarse ore hardness parameter which is used in primary and secondary crushing situations.  It is defined by equation 8 with Ks set to 55.

- K2 = 1.0 for all crushers operating in closed circuit with a classifying screen. If the crusher is in open circuit, eg pebble crusher in a AG/SAG circuit, K2 takes the value of 1.19.
- x1 = P80 in microns of the circuit feed
- x2 = P80 in microns of the circuit product
- Mic = Crushing ore work index and is provided directly by SMC Test®

The coarse ore hardness parameter (S) makes allowance for the decrease in ore hardness that becomes significant in relatively coarse crushing applications such as primary and secondary cone/gyratory circuits.  In tertiary and pebble crushing circuits it is normally not necessary and takes the value of unity.  In full scale HPGR circuits where feed sizes tend to be higher than used in laboratory and pilot scale machines the parameter has also been found to improve predictive accuracy.  The parameter is defined by equation 8

## Where

Ks = machine-specific constant that takes the value of 55 for conventional crushers and 35 in the case of HPGRs

- x1 = P80 in microns of the circuit feed

## Equation 1 for HPGR's crushers is written as:

## B 2.2.3 Specific Energy Correction for Size Distribution (Ws)

Implicit in the approach described in this paper is that the feed and product size distributions are parallel and linear in log-log space.  Where they are not, allowances (corrections) need to be made.  By and large, such corrections are most likely to be necessary (or are large enough to be warranted) when evaluating circuits in which closed circuit secondary/tertiary crushing is followed by ball milling.  This is because such crushing circuits tend to produce a product size distribution which is relatively steep when compared to the ball mill circuit cyclone overflow.  This is illustrated in Figure A1, which shows measured distributions from an open and closed crusher circuit as well as a ball mill cyclone overflow.  The closed circuit crusher distribution can be seen to be relatively steep compared with the open circuit crusher distribution and ball mill cyclone overflow.  Also the open circuit distribution more closely follows the gradient of the cyclone overflow.  If a ball mill circuit were to be fed 2 distributions, each with same P80 but with the open and closed circuit gradients in Figure A1, the closed circuit distribution would require more energy to grind to the final P80.  How much more energy is required is difficult to determine.  However, for the purposes of this approach it has been assumed that the additional specific energy for ball milling is the same as the difference in specific energy between open and closed crushing to reach the nominated ball mill feed size.  This assumes that a crusher would provide this energy.  However, in this situation the ball mill has to supply this energy and it has a different (higher) work index than the crusher (ie the ball mill is less energy efficient than a crusher and has to input more energy to do the same amount of size reduction).  Hence from equation 7, to crush to the ball mill circuit feed size (x2) in open circuit requires specific energy equivalent to:

*

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

For closed circuit crushing the specific energy is:

*

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

The difference between the two (eq 10 - eq 11) has to be provided by the milling circuit with an allowance for the fact that the ball mill, with its lower energy efficiency, has to provide it and not the crusher.  This is what is referred to in equation 3 as Ws and for the above example is therefore represented by:

*

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Note that in equation 12 Mic has been replaced with Mia, the coarse particle tumbling mill grinding work index.

In AG/SAG based circuits the need for Ws appears to be unnecessary as Figure A2 illustrates.  Primary crusher feeds often have the shape shown in Figure A2 and this has a very similar gradient to typical ball mill cyclone overflows.  A similar situation appears to apply with HPGR product size distributions, as illustrated in Figure A3.

Interestingly SMCC's data show that for HPGRs, closed circuit operation appears to require a lower specific energy to reach the same P80 as in open circuit, even though the distributions for open and closed circuit look to have almost identical gradients. Closer examination of the distributions in fact shows that in closed circuit the final product tends to have slightly less very fine material, which may account for the different energy requirements between the two modes of operation.  It is also possible that recycled material in closed circuit is inherently weaker than new feed, as it has already passed through the HPGR previously and may have sustained micro-cracking.  A reduction in the Bond ball mill work index as measured by testing HPGR products compared it to the Bond ball mill work index of HPGR feed has been noticed in many cases in the laboratory (see next section) and hence there is no reason to expect the same phenomenon would not affect the recycled HPGR screen oversize.

It follows from the above arguments that in HPGR circuits, which are typically fed with material from closed circuit secondary crushers, a similar feed size distribution correction should also be applied. However, as the secondary crushing circuit uses such a relatively small amount of energy compared to the rest of the circuit (as it crushes to a relatively coarse size) the magnitude of size distribution correction is very small indeed - much smaller than the error associated with the technique - and hence may be omitted in calculations.

## B 2.2.4 Weakening of HPGR Products

As mentioned in the previous section, laboratory experiments have been reported by various researchers in which the Bond ball work index of HPGR products is less than that of the feed.  The amount of this reduction appears to vary with both material type and the pressing force used. Observed reductions in the Bond ball work index have

%

typically been in the range 0-10%.  In the approach described in this paper no allowance has been made for such weakening.  However, if HPGR products are available which can be used to conduct Bond ball work index tests on then Mib values obtained from such tests can be used in equation 5.  Alternatively the Mib values from Bond ball mill work index tests on HPGR feed material can be reduced by an amount that the user thinks is appropriate.  Until more data become available from full scale HPGR/ball mill circuits it is suggested that, in the absence of Bond ball mill work index data on HPGR products, the Mib results from HPGR feed material are reduced by no more than 5% to allow for the effects of micro-cracking.

## B 3 VALIDATION

## B 3.1 Tumbling Mill Circuits

The approach described in the previous section was applied to over 120 industrial data sets. The results are shown in App Figure 8.  In all cases, the specific energy relates to the tumbling mills contributing to size reduction from the product of the final stage of crushing to the final grind.  Data are presented in terms of equivalent specific energy at the pinion.  In determining what these values were on each of the plants in the data base it was assumed that power at the pinion was 93.5% of the measured gross (motor input) power, this figure being typical of what is normally accepted as being reasonable to represent losses across the motor and gearbox. For gearless drives (so-called wrap-around motors) a figure of 97% was used.

App Figure 8  - Observed vs Predicted Tumbling Mill Specific Energy

<!-- image -->

## B 3.2 Conventional Crushers

Validation of equation 1 used 12 different crushing circuits (25 data sets), including secondary, tertiary and pebble crushers in AG/SAG circuits.  Observed vs predicted specific energies are given in App Figure 9.  The observed specific energies were calculated from the crusher throughput and the net power draw of the crusher as defined by:

Net Power =

Motor Input Power - No Load Power

(13)

No-load power tends to be relatively high in conventional crushers and hence net power is significantly lower than the motor input power.  From examination of the 25 crusher data sets the motor input power was found to be on average 20% higher than the net power.

App Figure 9  - Observed vs Predicted Conventional Crusher Specific Energy

## B 3.3 HPGRs

Validation of equation 1 for HPGRs used data from 19 different circuits (36 data sets) including laboratory, pilot and industrial scale equipment. Observed vs predicted specific energies are given in App Figure 10.  The data relate to HPGRs operating with specific grinding forces typically in the range 2.5-3.5 N/mm .  The observed 2 specific energies relate to power delivered by the roll drive shafts.  Motor input power for full scale machines is expected to be 8-10% higher.

In this circuit, it is assumed that the pebble crusher feed P80 is 52.5mm.  As a rule of thumb this value can be estimated by assuming that it is 0.75 of the nominal pebble port aperture (in this case the pebble port aperture is 70mm).  The pebble crusher is set to give a product P80 of 12mm.  The pebble crusher feed rate is expected to be 25% of new feed tph.

In this circuit primary crusher product is reduced to a HPGR circuit feed P80 of 35 mm by closed circuit secondary crushing.  The HPGR is also in closed circuit and reduces the 35 mm feed to a circuit product P80 of 4 mm.  This is then fed to a closed circuit ball mill which takes the grind down to a P80 of 106 µm.

## Executive Summary

A  single composite  sample  from  the  Elk Creek  project was  submitted for bench-scale HPGR characterization.    The  sample  was  first  submitted  for  a  series  of  batch  HPGR  tests  which  investigated various operating parameters followed by a locked-cycle test, to evaluate the  HPGR performance in a closed circuit.  The results from the HPGR locked-cycle test, which was performed at 2% moisture and initial nitrogen and hydraulic pressures of 38 and 56 bars, respectively, are summarized in Table 1.  The test was closed with a 10 mesh (1.7 mm) screen.

Table 1: HPGR Locked-cycle Test Summary

| Sample ID   |   Closing  Screen Size  (mm) |   Pressure  Circul.  of Oper.  (bar) |   Load  (%) |   Net Spec.  Energy Requ.  (kWh/t) | P80  (µm)   |   % Passing  100 Mesh |   Specific  Grinding Force  (N/mm 2 ) |   Spec.  Throughput  (ts/hm ) (mf) 3 |

| HPGR Comp   |                          1.7 |                                   63 |       157.5 |                               3.65 | 1,269       |                  28.6 |                                  3.14 |                                  311 |

The net specific power requirement of 3.65 kWh/t was amongst the highest value in the SGS database, but  is  likely  due  to  the  relatively  fine  closing  screen  size  used  in  the  locked-cycle  test  (1.7  mm).    The specific grinding force of 3.14 N/mm  fell near the median of the SGS database, while the sample was 2 categorized  as  very  soft  in  terms  of  the  specific  throughput  rate  (311  ts/hm 3 ).    The  HPGR  testwork showed that this sample is amenable for HPGR grinding.

Higher  pressure  should  be  considered  to  lower  the  current  high  circulating  load  (158%)  produced  by screening at 1.7 mm.

It  is  recommended to perform preliminary HPGR sizing in order to compare the HPGR scenario to the single stage SAG mill simulations presented in SGS report 14379-008A (issued October 31, 2016).  The specific power requirement from the bench-scale HPGR test and the single-stage SAG mill simulations cannot  be  directly  compared  at  the  moment  as  the  feed  F80's  are  significantly  different.    To  compare HPGR power requirement to the SAG milling option, additional power required to 1) crush the ore from the gyratory crusher product to a feed suitable for the HPGR (top size depends on the HPGR size unit), and 2) account for the extra conveyors, will need to be included.

## Introduction

Mr.  Arun  Vathavooran  from Tetra Tech,  on  behalf  of  NioCorp  Developments  Ltd  (NioCorp),  requested that SGS Minerals Services (SGS) perform a High Pressure Grinding Rolls (HPGR) grindability study on a single sample from the Elk Creek project, located in Nebraska, USA.

This report summarizes the sample preparation and presents the grindability test results.

## Testwork Summary

## 1. Sample Preparation

Twelve pails were received at the SGS Lakefield site on November 14, 2016.  The shipment was given the SGS sample receipt number 0180-NOV16.  The sample weighed about 350 kg and was prepared as depicted in Figure 1, for the HPGR testing program.

## 2. HPGR Investigation

An HPGR batch investigation and an HPGR locked-cycle test were performed on a single sample labelled as 'HPGR Comp'.  The batch tests investigated the effects of pressure of operation and moisture content on  HPGR performance, whereas the  locked-cycle  test  established  closed-circuit  power  requirement  at steady state using the optimal operating parameters determined during the batch investigation.  The test results  are  discussed  in  the  following  sub-sections  and  the  complete  test  details  are  appended (Appendix A).

## 2.1. Feed Characteristics

A head sample was withdrawn for Specific Gravity (S.G.), bulk density, Particle Size Analysis (PSA), and 'as-received' moisture determinations.  The S.G. was measured using a gas pycnometer, while the bulk density was measured by vibrating a weighted sample for five minutes in a 1-L graduated cylinder, and recording the volume.  The HPGR feed characteristics are summarized in Table 2.  In addition to the F50 and F80 values, the percent passing 10 mesh (1.7 mm) and 100 mesh (150 microns) were also selected as key performance indicators.

Table 2: HPGR Feed Characteristics

| F50 (microns)                 | 5,256   |
|-------------------------------|---------|
| F80 (microns)                 | 9,591   |
| Percent Passing 10 mesh       | 21.5    |
| Percent Passing 100 mesh      | 6.6     |
| Specific Gravity  (kg/L)      | 3.13    |
| Wet Bulk Density (kg/L)       | 1.97    |
| Moisture 'as received' (%H2O) | 0.28    |

## 2.2. LABWAL Characteristics and Test Procedure

The HPGR tests were run in the LABWAL unit, which is equipped with solid roll tires that are protected against wear by tungsten-carbide studs.  The principal characteristics of the unit are presented below.

Diameter of rolls

0.25 m

Width of rolls

0.10 m

Speed of rolls

0.57 rotation/second

The  unit  pressure  and  power  draw  were  measured  every  second  by  a  Bailey  DCS  system  and  were trended over the test period.  The HPGR was choke-fed.  The following data were recorded and reported:

-  Zero gap
-  Moisture content
-  Throughput rate
-  Specific throughput rate
-  Flake thickness (if present)
-  Flake density (if present)
-  Ore specific gravity (S.G.)
-  Ore bulk density
-  Preset nitrogen pressure
-  Initial hydraulic pressure
-  Operating hydraulic pressure
-  Gross, no-load and net power
-  Specific energy input
-  Feed and product particle size analyses

In the batch test procedure, a 10-kg test charge was processed through the HPGR to clean the rolls and apply an autogenous layer on the tungsten-carbide studs.  Seven tests were then carried out using 30-kg charges  at  different  pressure  settings  and  different  moisture  contents.    The  moisture  content  was adjusted each time by adding the proportion of water required to the sample and mixing it in a cement mixer.

For each test, the initial nitrogen and hydraulic pressures were recorded, as well as the feed sample wet weight.  The sample was choke-fed to the HPGR and the test duration was recorded with a stopwatch. The power draw and pressures of operation were recorded through the Bailey system.  The maximum movement of the rolls during operation was also recorded as part of the test.

The  HPGR  discharge  was  sampled  (three  cuts)  following  stabilization  (about  10  seconds),  and  the product flake thickness was measured with a ruler and recorded.  The product was submitted for moisture content and PSA determinations.

For the  locked-cycle  procedure, the  30-kg test charges  were set at the optimal moisture prior to each cycle.  Once processed through the HPGR, the product was discharged on a 10 mesh screen and the oversize was combined with the fresh feed for the next cycle.  This procedure was then repeated until the amount of oversize produced was stabilized for at least 3 cycles.  For each cycle, the initial nitrogen and hydraulic pressures were recorded, as well as the feed sample weight.

The HPGR circuit product, which corresponds to the screen undersize, was sampled and submitted for moisture content and PSA determinations for the last three cycles.  The flake thickness was measured with a ruler and was also recorded.  A sample of the flake was collected and submitted for bulk density determination, using the waxing method.  The wax protects the sample from breaking up when immersed in  water and prevents the water from filling the voids in the flake.  The flake specimens were weighed before and after coating with wax, prior to S.G. determination, using the water displacement technique. The  weight  and  volume  of  the  wax  were  known,  so  the  actual  bulk  density  of  the  flake  could  be calculated.

## 2.3. Test Results

Seven batch tests were performed using different pressure settings and moisture contents, followed by a locked-cycle test to establish closed-circuit performance.  The test results are summarized in Table 3 and are discussed in the following sub-sections.  The selected locked-cycle test conditions were 2% moisture and initial nitrogen and hydraulic pressures of 38 and 56 bars, respectively.

## 2.3.1. Particle Size Analyses

The feed and product PSA's are presented in Figure 2.  The solid lines represent the batch tests, while the dotted lines represent the locked-cycle test.

## 2.3.2. Specific Grinding Force

The specific grinding force corresponds to the hydraulic force between the rolls per unit of area and is expressed in N/mm .  For a given HPGR unit, it is directly related to the hydraulic pressure, as presented 2 in  Figure  3.    Higher  forces  normally  result  in  higher  power  draw  and  increased  size  reduction  up  to  a certain point.

Figure 3: Specific Grinding Force versus Hydraulic Pressure

## 2.3.3. Specific Throughput Rate

The specific throughput rate corresponds to the throughput of  the HPGR unit  per unit  of roll area and speed.  It is normalized to a 1 m x 1 m HPGR (Diameter x Width) operated at 1 m/s.  This normalized throughput is ore-dependent and varies with operating conditions, but is essentially independent of the rolls'  geometry  and  speed,  and  can  therefore  be  used  for  scale-up  to  industrial  size.    The  relationship between  the  specific  grinding  force  and  the  specific  throughput  is  presented  in  Figure 4.    Specific throughput decreased with higher pressure and with moisture, which is typical.

Figure 4: Specific Throughput Rate versus Specific Grinding Force

## 2.3.4. Net Power Draw and Net Specific Power

The  net  power  draw  is  defined  as  the  energy  of  comminution,  i.e.  the  gross  power  requirement  as measured by the Bailey system less the power required to drive the rolls empty (no-load power).  The additional power applied is that which actually achieves comminution.  The effect of the specific grinding force of the LABWAL net power is presented in Figure 5.  The net specific power requirement, in kWh/t, corresponds  to  the  net  power  divided  by  the  actual  throughput  rate.    It  is  plotted  against  the  specific grinding force in Figure 6.  Power requirement increased with higher grinding force.

Figure 6: Net Specific Power Input as a Function of Specific Grinding Force

The net power requirement for the locked-cycle test was significantly higher (3.65 kWh/t) than for similar conditions in batch mode (1.68 kWh/t), which is the effect of the additional power required to achieve a 100% passing 10 mesh (1.7 mm) product.  The moisture had no significant impact on the net power draw, but did for the net specific energy (lower throughput rate with higher moisture content).

## 2.3.5. Product Size

The LABWAL product sizes, as percent passing 10 and 100 mesh, are presented based on the specific grinding force and the specific energy input in Figure 7 and Figure 8.  Higher grinding forces and specific energy inputs increased fineness and did not reach a plateau for the range investigated.

## 2.3.6. Overall HPGR Test Results

The locked-cycle test results are compared to the SGS database in Figure 9.  At a specific grinding force of  3.14  N/mm , the sample used a pressure corresponding to the 60 2 th percentile  of  the  SGS  database (meaning that 60% of all the locked-cycle tests used a lower pressure).  The HPGR Comp sample fell in the  soft  range  of  the  SGS  database  in  terms  of  the  specific  throughput  (m ),  falling  around  the  15 f th percentile.  The high specific throughput rate achieved by the HPGR Comp is partially due to the feed S.G.  of  3.13  kg/L.    However,  it  was  categorized  as  very  hard  with  respect  to  net  specific  energy requirement (kWh/t), falling in the 97 th percentile  of the database.  This is probably partially due to the relatively fine closing screen size used in the locked-cycle test (1.7 mm), while most of the data points from the database were completed at a much coarser screen size of 3.35 mm.

## Executive Summary

This study examined various mineral processing routes to pre-concentrate niobium from the Elk Creek deposit located in Nebraska, including gravity, magnetic separation, roasting, and flotation approaches. Head assays (whole rock analysis, niobium, tantalum and zircon) for the two main samples tested are presented in Table 1. In addition to the head assays presented in Table 1, the 'Nb Comp' contained 63 g/t of Scandium. Full head analysis of both samples has been presented in the body of the report. Testwork was also conducted on an ore sample provided by Hazen Research, and assay reject material was used in the operation of a mini-flotation pilot plant.

## Mineralogy of Test Samples

Testwork was conducted on two different samples from the deposit and labeled Nb Comp and the 2 nd Nb Drill  Core. The  two  samples  were  found  to  have  similar  mineralogy,  although  minor  differences  are recorded:

- o Carbonates  (51%  and  62%),  Fe-oxides  (10%  and  5%),  quartz/feldspars  (7%  and  11%),  biotite (3% and 4%), Fe-(Ti)-oxides (2%), barite (15-10%), sulphides (2-1%), and trace amounts of other minerals. Note that both magnetite and hematite were identified with XRD analysis.

At  a  grind  of  100%  passing  212 μ m,  the  D 50 (50%  passing  value  from  the  cumulative  grain  size distribution) shows that the niobium minerals are &lt;20 μ m in size and that pyrochlore carries most of the niobium (78%-82%), followed by niobium-rutile (11%-12%) and ilmenorutile (10%-6%). Free and liberated pyrochlore  accounts  for  23%  and  37%  in  the  Nb  Comp  and  2 nd Nb  Drill  Core  Head,  respectively. Pyrochlore liberation is significant at 48% and 57% in the -25 μ m fraction of the Nb Comp and 2 nd Nb Drill Core  Head,  respectively,  indicating  a  need  for  fine  grinding.    Greater  than  30%  exposure  of  niobium minerals is 39% and 48% in the Nb Comp and 2 nd Nb Drill Core Head, respectively, indicating that there is not a large portion of available surface for flotation of the niobium minerals.

The two samples yield similar theoretical grade and recovery values at a grind size of 100% passing 212 μ m.  Thus, grades of 7%-17% for recoveries of 24%-51%, respectively, are projected for the Nb Comp, and grades of 6%-16% for recoveries of 36%-60% for the 2 nd Nb Drill Core Head.

## Heavy Liquid and Magnetic Separation Testing

Results from heavy liquid separation (HLS) testing suggest that gravity separation would likely not be an efficient method of upgrading the Elk Creek ore, due to lack of niobium mineral liberation at sizes suitable for  such  processing  methods.  Likewise,  magnetic  separation  (both  low-intensity  (LIMS)  and  wet  highintensity (WHIMS)) was not successful in effectively upgrading the Nb Comp feed material, likely due to a lack of niobium mineral liberation at 100% passing 150 mesh, and the deportment of niobium to magnetic and paramagnetic minerals.

## Flotation Testing

After  testing  many  different  niobium  mineral  collectors  and  various  conceptual  flotation  flowsheets, benzohydroxamic acid (Florrea 7510 collector) was found to yield the best flotation performance when used in  conjunction  with  sodium  hexametaphosphate  (Calgon)  as  a  dispersant  and  carbonate  mineral depressant.  The  final  flotation  flowsheet  included  grinding  using  an  IsaMill  to  100%  passing  38 µm followed by a simple rougher flotation circuit, which recovered a large portion of niobium and titanium, while  effectively  rejecting  approximately  80-85%  of  the  mass,  containing  a  large  portion  of  carbonate minerals.

The final flotation  flowsheet is  illustrated  in  Figure  1.  To  obtain  71.3%  niobium  recovery  in  19%  of  the mass, a total of eight rougher flotation stages were required with reagent addition prior to each rougher stage.  Limiting  the  circuit  to  only  seven  rougher  stages,  a  combined  rougher  concentrate  with  68.1% niobium recovery in 16.5% of the mass was obtained. The total collector addition rates for seven and eight rougher flotation stages were 950 g/t and 1,050 g/t, respectively.

Concentrate

Use  of  the  Elk  Creek  ground  water  in  the  flotation  circuit  showed  no  adverse  effects  on  flotation performance. Pulp temperature was 30-35 C, in the range of grinding discharge temperatures. Flotation o pulp pH was not adjusted, but was recorded to be between 7.7-8.5, depending on the water used (Elk Creek ground water versus SGS Lakefield tap water). Fluctuation of pH in the range stated above did not appear to have a significant effect on flotation results.

## Recommendations for Future Testwork

It has been demonstrated that the collector and dispersant/depressant dosage are of utmost importance.

Prior to running a full scale pilot plant, it would be highly beneficial to run a statistically designed set of batch flotation tests with the objective of optimizing collector dosage, mass pull, niobium recovery, and the ratio of collector to depressant. This set of experiments would provide detailed information and allow for  rough  predictions  of  flotation  mass  pull  and  niobium  recovery  for  given  reagent  dosages  through mathematical modelling. Not only will this information help to achieve the best possible results from the

full scale pilot plant, it will prove invaluable to NioCorp Developments Ltd. and consultants through plant design and economic analysis.

In  addition,  a  trade-off  study  on  the  effect  of  IsaMill  versus  conventional  grinding  on  flotation  is recommended. This study should be executed with both grinding types targeting 100% passing 38 µm; subsequent flotation should follow the final recommended flotation flowsheet and reagent scheme. The results  will  help  to  minimize  grinding  costs  and/or  optimize  flotation  performance  in  the  process  plant design for the Elk Creek deposit.

Overall, the current recommended mineral processing flowsheet is quite simple, and as such, valuable information could be obtained and cost reduction may be realized through basic optimization testwork and trade-off  studies  on  a  representative  sample  and/or  variability  samples,  ideally  conducted  prior  to  the commissioning of a full scale pilot plant.

A  separate  study  should  investigate  the  flotation  response  of  geometallurgical  test  units  to  gauge metallurgical variability across the mineralization.

## Introduction

Neil McCallum and Darren Smith of Dahrouge met with members of SGS on February 11, 2014 at the Lakefield  site  to  review  SGS  mineralogical  findings  on  samples  from  the  Elk  Creek  deposit  located  in Nebraska. Effective February 20, 2015, NioCorp has announced the Elk Creek deposit to be an NI43-101 compliant resource reporting an Indicated Resource of 80.5 million tonnes grading 0.71% Nb2O5, 2.68% TiO2 and 72 ppm Sc and an Inferred Resource of 99.6 million tonnes grading 0.56% Nb2O5, 2.31% TiO2 and 63 ppm Sc (at a 0.3% Nb2O5 cutoff grade). Mineralogical characterization indicates that the niobium occurs  in  a  variety  of  minerals,  but  most  notably  a  Fe-Ti-Nb-oxide  phase  and  pyrochlore.  Liberation characteristics reveal that grain sizes are fine and that metallurgical flowsheet development was likely to be challenging.

A scope of work for a preliminary metallurgical test program was discussed. The objective of this program was to develop a conceptual flowsheet to treat a sample, representative of the Elk Creek deposit. The study  was  to  examine  various  processing  routes  to  concentrate  niobium  including  gravity,  magnetic separation, and flotation approaches. In addition, basic leach testing on whole ore would be completed to provide an indication of the success of niobium extraction.

The sample was received at SGS in Lakefield in April of 2014.  Sample preparation and metallurgical testwork,  as  outlined  in  the  original  proposal,  began  shortly  thereafter.  In  October  of  2014,  based  on discussions  with  Darren  Smith,  a  change  of  scope  was  executed  with  the  objective  to  perform complementary  testing  on  the  drill  core  samples,  and  leach  residue  with  the  same  objective  as  was defined  in  the  earlier  proposal:  70%  niobium  recovery  in  15%  mass  pull,  minimizing  collector  7510 dosage to 1,500 g/t or less, and identify a better and more selective collector.  This complimentary work continued into early 2015. The results from the original proposal and the change of scope from the end of October, 2014 are included in this report.

## Testwork Summary

## 1. Sample Receipt and Description

## 1.1. Sample Receipt and Preparation

In  April  of  2014,  one  skid  of  samples  was  received  at  the  SGS  Lakefield  site  and  assigned  the  SGS receipt  number  0022-APR14.  A  total  of  210  kg  of  the  sample  was  received  in  the  form  of  drill  core intervals placed in two drums. The core sample was identified as Nb Comp .

The material in the two drums was weighed, recorded, and combined to form a composite. The composite was stage-crushed to ½'. A 15 kg sub-sample was removed from the ½' material for Bond Rod mill Work Index  (RWI)  testing.  A  5  kg  sub-sample  of  -¾'+½'  was  split  out  for  Abrasion  Index  (AI)  testing. Approximately 120 kg of -½' material was split out and further stage-crushed to 100% passing 6 mesh. The minus 6 mesh material was homogenized, and an 8 kg sub-sample was removed for Bond Ball mill Work Index (BWI) testing. The remainder of the minus 6 mesh material was then split into 10 kg and 2 kg charges. A total of ten 10 kg charges and five 2 kg charges were prepared for the composite. One of the 2 kg charges was selected (randomly) for head characterization. A 150 g head assay sample was split out  from  the  2  kg  charge  and  submitted  for  niobium,  tantalum,  zirconium,  whole  rock  analysis  (WRA), carbon speciation (C(t), C(g), CO , TOC), sulphur speciation (S(t), S , SO , S°), ICP-OES multi element 3 = 4 scan, ICP-MS rare earth scan, and ISE (fluorine). A 200 g mineralogical sample was taken and submitted for QEMSCAN analysis in PMA (Particle Mineral Analysis) mode.  Furthermore, a 300 g sub-sample was submitted for head particle size analysis. All test charges as well as the remainders of -½' and minus 6 mesh materials, with a weight of ~73 kg and ~1.1 kg, respectively, were stored for future testing.

In July of 2014, a second sample shipment was received at the SGS Lakefield site. One drum containing approximately  250  kg  of  core  material  was  identified  as 2 nd Nb  Drill  Core .  This  material  was  stagecrushed to 100% passing 6 mesh. The minus 6 mesh material was homogenized and split into 10 kg and 2 kg charges, one of which was taken randomly for head characterization. A 150 g head assay sample was  split  out  and  submitted  for  niobium,  WRA  assays,  and  ICP-OES  multi  element  scan.  A  200  g mineralogical  sample  was  also  taken  and  submitted  for  QEMSCAN  analysis  in  PMA  (Particle  Mineral Analysis) mode.  All test charges, as well as the remainders of -½' and minus 6 mesh materials were stored for future testing.

## 1.2. Chemical Head Analyses

The two head samples were submitted for chemical head analysis including  ICP  Scan.  The  complete results of chemical head analyses for the Nb Comp are presented in Table 2 and Table 3.

## 1.3.4. IsaMill

The 2 nd Nb Drill Core material was initially submitted to batch regrinding in an IsaMill to generate material at a K98 of ~ 20 microns.  The testing was performed in a closed loop, and Malvern size analyses were performed periodically to determine the grind size.  When the target was reached, the ground product was submitted for further testing.

It  was  then  requested  to perform an IsaMill signature plot test on the sample to determine the energy requirement to grind to various sizes.  Further batches of the sample were then reground in the IsaMill to the  required  sizes,  using  the  results  of  the  signature  plot.    The  mill  description,  along  with  the  testing procedure  and  results,  are  given  in  the  following  sub-sections.    The  IsaMill  test  details  are  appended (Appendix A).

Prior to being submitted to IsaMill testing, minus 10 mesh charges of the sample were stage-ground in a rod mill  to  generate  an  IsaMill  feed  with  a  K 98 of ~ 150 microns, which was a suitable size to feed the IsaMill and to efficiently grind the sample to the target size while only using one media type in the IsaMill.

## 1.3.4.1. IsaMill Description and Testing Procedure

The IsaMill, developed by Xstrata Technology, is a high intensity, compact, continuous ultra-fine grinding technology, with demonstrated direct (1:1) scale-up.  A steep particle size distribution is produced in open circuit  operation,  without  the  use  of  troublesome,  fine  separating  screens.    Figure  5  presents  the operating principle of the IsaMill.  The inside configuration of the mill is designed such that there is an

internal classification that keeps the grinding media inside the mill, while the pulp is discharged at the mill outlet.  The bench-scale unit at SGS is a 4 L IsaMill, equivalent to the LMK 4 Netzsch mill.

Figure 5: Grinding and Internal Classification Mechanisms of an IsaMill 1

The  relationship  between  product  size  and  energy  input  remains  constant  during  scale-up  of  IsaMill technology.  As the diameter of a particle is halved, the surface area of its progeny is doubled.  Within reasonable reduction ratios, the log of size plotted against the log of energy produces a straight line.  This line can be extrapolated within the limits of media efficiency and viscosity.  This plot is referred to as a signature plot, and is unique to the ore, pulp conditions, and media selected.

The power draw is measured every minute, which allows trending of these values over the test period. The test investigates the energy required to grind a sample to a pre-determined size.  For the test, the following data were recorded and reported:

-  Feed % solids
-  Feed and product pulp densities and viscosities
-  Throughput rate
-  Number of passes required
-  Specific energy input
-  Specific energy input versus P 80 curve
-  Feed and product particle size analyses

The viscosity of the sample is measured during each pass using a Marsh funnel.  If the material becomes too viscous, the efficiency of the IsaMill decreases.  If the sample takes longer than 38 seconds to flow through the Marsh funnel, the pulp density of the sample must be decreased for the next pass by adding water.  Each data point on the curve corresponds to one 'pass' in the mill, in which the sample is entirely processed at a given kWh/t input.  The product from each pass is collected at steady-state and analyzed with the Malvern, prior to re-passing in the mill to generate further data points.  This is performed as many times as required to generate the signature curve.

Development of the signature plot is used to design large-scale IsaMills.  Most large-scale installations have been designed from a signature plot developed in a 4 L laboratory continuous mill.  The 4 L test must reflect the media and pulp conditions planned for full-scale operation, or full-scale design can be based on the most efficient signature plot developed during the testwork.

The experimental set up is presented in Figure 6.  It consists of an agitated feed tank, connected through a  pump  to  the  IsaMill,  which  discharges  into  a  second  agitated  tank.    For  each  pass,  the  circuit  is operated  at  a  given  flow  rate  and  density  in  order  to  achieve  a  target-specific  energy  input.    The  mill discharge  is  sampled  at  steady-state  and  the  product  is  submitted  for  particle  size  analysis  through  a Malvern sizer.  After the first pass, the product tank becomes the feed tank, and so on.

## 1.3.4.2. No-load Power

The IsaMill no-load power (i.e. the power required to run the mill empty) was measured before the test. The  mill  was  operated  without  slurry  and  grinding  media  for  about  30  minutes.    Before  the  no-load measurements were recorded, the mill was allowed to warm-up for 15 minutes.  The measurements were taken over a time of 15 minutes, and the results averaged.

The net power draw, which is used to scale-up the mill, is computed by subtracting the no-load power from the actual gross power measured during a test.  The measured no-load power was 0.71 kW.

## 1.3.4.3. Signature Plot Results

The IsaMill signature plot test was conducted on August 12, 2014.  The IsaMill was operated with the following parameters:

-  Mill speed of 1,500 rpm
-  2.5 L of 2 mm Keramax MTX grinding media

The test results are summarized in Table 7  and depicted in Figure 7.  The feed to the IsaMill had a F 98 of 152.2 microns.  To reach a P 98 of 38 microns, the energy requirement was 17.3 kWh/t.  In order to further grind down to a P 98 of 20 microns, the total energy requirement was 38.3 kWh/t.

## 1.3.4.4. Batch Grinding Results

Batch  testing  was  required  to  generate  material  for  flotation  testing.    The  first  two  batch  grinds  were completed prior to the signature plot, where the testing was performed in a closed loop.  Following the signature plot, it was then requested to grind a number of batches of samples to 38 µm or 53 µm grind targets.  As with the signature plot feed, 10 kg charges of the 2 nd Nb Drill Core were ground in a rod mill to  generate an IsaMill feed K 98 ~150 µm.  The signature plot results were then used to determine the flowrate required to reach the energy input and grind targets for each batch.  The results are summarized in Table 8.  The results generally agreed very well with the signature plot results.

## 2. Mineralogical Characterization of Feed Sample

The Nb Comp and 2 nd Nb Drill Core were each submitted for quantitative analysis using QEMSCAN once received on site in Lakefield.

## 2.1. Summary of Observations

-  Both samples were stage-ground to K80 of 106 μ m. The analysis was conducted on three size fractions (+106 μ m, -106/+25 μ m, and -25 μ m).
-  The  Nb  Comp  and  the  2 nd Nb  Drill  Core  Head  consist  of  similar  mineralogy  although  minor differences are recorded.
- o Carbonates 51% and 62%, respectively, Fe Oxides (10% and 5%), quartz/feldspars (7% and 11%), biotite (3 and 4%), Fe-(Ti)-oxides (2%), barite (15-10%), sulphides (2-1%), and trace amounts of other minerals. Note that both magnetite and hematite were identified with XRD analysis.

-  The D50 (50% passing value from the cumulative grain size distribution) shows that the niobium minerals are &lt;20 μ m in size.
-  Pyrochlore  carries  most  of  the  Nb  (78%-82%),  followed  by  Nb-rutile  (11%-12%),  ilmenorutile (10%-6%).
-  Free and liberated pyrochlore accounts for 23% and 37% in the Nb Comp and 2 nd Nb Drill Core Head, respectively.  Pyrochlore liberation is significant at 48% and 57% in the -25 μ m fraction of the Nb Comp and 2 nd Nb Drill Core Head, respectively.
- o This indicates the need for fine grinding to liberate the niobium minerals.
-  Exposure of niobium minerals greater than 30% exposure is 39% and 48% in the Nb Comp and 2 nd Nb Drill Core Head.
- o This  indicates  that  there  is  not  a  lot  of  available  surface  for  flotation  of  the  niobium minerals.
-  The two samples yield similar theoretical grade and recovery values.  Thus, grades of 17%-7% for recoveries of 24%-51%, respectively, are projected for the Nb Comp, and grades of 16%-6% for recoveries of 36%-60% for the 2nd Nb Drill Core Head.

## 2.2. Mineral Abundance

The  mineral  abundances  of  the  calculated  head  for  the  samples  are  graphically  shown  in  Figure  8. Mineral abundance is given in wt%.

The Nb Comp and the 2 nd Nb Drill Core Head consists of similar mineralogy although minor differences are recorded. Carbonates 51% and 62%, respectively, Fe Oxides (10% and 5%), quartz/feldspars (7% and 11%), biotite (3 and 4%), Fe-(Ti)-oxides (2%), barite (15-10%), sulphides (2-1%), and trace amounts of other minerals.

The main difference in the niobium mineral abundance is the mass of ilmenorutile. However, given the fine grained nature of the sample and the variability in chemistry, the mass of Nb-rutile and ilmenorutile may vary significantly.

## 2.3. Grain Size Distribution

Table 9 shows a summary of the D50 or 50% passing value from the cumulative grain size distribution of the  pyrochlore,  ilmenorutile,  Nb-rutile,  other  REE  minerals,  quartz/feldspar,  micas/clays,  other  silicates, sulphides, other oxides, carbonates, barite and overall particle size distribution (PSD) for the Nb Comp sample.  All niobium minerals are very fine grained. This has been consistent and in accordance with the electron microscopy observations.

| Mineral/Samle    |   Nb Comp |   2nd Nb Drill  Core Head |
|------------------|-----------|---------------------------|
| Pyrochlore       |        13 |                        11 |

## 2.4. Elemental Deportment

The elemental distribution of niobium, titanium, and iron are calculated based on the mineral mass per size  fraction  and  average  values  from  the  electron  microprobe  analyses  from  the  14379-001.    The elemental  distribution  of  niobium  is  graphically  presented  in  Figure  9.  Pyrochlore  carries  most  of  the niobium  (78%-82%),  followed  by  Nb-rutile  (11%-12%)  and  ilmenorutile  (10%-6%).  The  elemental distributions for titanium and iron are provided in the Appendix.

## 2.5. Liberation and Association of Pyrochlore and Nb-minerals

Liberation  and  association  data  for  pyrochlore  and  niobium  minerals (pyrochlore,  ilmenorutile,  and  Nbrutile)  and  image  grids  of  the  pyrochlore  association  are  presented  in  Figure  10.    Free  and  liberated pyrochlore (&gt;80% of surface area free) accounts for 23% and 37% in the Nb Comp and 2 nd Nb Drill Core Head,  respectively.    Liberation  of  the  niobium  minerals  is  lower  at  19%  and  24%,  respectively.  The niobium  minerals  occur  mainly  as  binary  and  ternary  (particles  containing  two  and  three  different minerals, respectively) middling particles with carbonates, silicates, Fe-(Ti)-oxides and barite.  It is noted that liberation of pyrochlore in the Nb Comp is 3%, 13%, and 48% for the +106 μ m, -106/+25 μ m, and -25 μ m, respectively, and nil, 18%, and 57%, respectively for the 2 nd Nb Drill Core Head.

Exposure of niobium minerals greater than 30% exposure is 39% and 48% in the Nb Comp and 2 nd Nb Drill Core Head, respectively (Figure 11).

## 2.6. Grade-Recovery Curves

Figure  13  illustrates  the  grade-recovery  curves  for  the  samples  based  on  the  liberation  of  niobium minerals  at  a  P 80 of  106  µm.    The  two  samples  yield  similar  theoretical  grades  and  recovery  values. Thus, grades of 17%-7% for recoveries of 24%-51% are projected for the Nb Comp, and grades of 16%6%  for  recoveries  of  36%-60%  for  the  2 nd Nb  Drill  Core  Head.  Note  these  values  are  based  on  the average niobium concentration in the pyrochlore, ilmenorutile, and Nb-rutile from the electron microprobe analyses and their respective liberation values. Thus, they may vary given the wide variation of niobium in the ilmenorutile and Nb-rutile. Note that based on the mineralogy developed grade-recovery curve, in an ideal separation in order to achieve niobium recovery close to 70%, concentrate grade will not exceed approximately 4.8% Nb. This grade of concentrate is not acceptable for pyrometallurgical conversion to ferroniobium without further processing.

## 3. Magnetic Separation Testing

## 3.1. Magnetic Separation on Head Sample

Due to the presence of magnetic (magnetite) and paramagnetic (hematite, ilmenite) minerals in the Elk Creek  ore,  magnetic  separation  testing  was  completed  on  a  6  kg  sample  of  Nb  Comp  material.  The sample  was  stage  ground  to  100%  passing  150  mesh,  and  then  subjected  to  low  intensity  magnetic separation (LIMS) to remove magnetic minerals and wet high intensity magnetic separation (WHIMS) to remove paramagnetic minerals. The LIMS test was performed on the whole 6 kg sample at approximately 1,000 Gauss cleaned once at the same intensity, while the WHIMS test was performed on a 500 g subsample split out from the LIMS Non-Mags. The sub-sample was successively re-passed through an Eriez WHIMS separator with a steel matrix at 4,000, 7,500, 12,500, and 20,000 Gauss. All products from both LIMS and WHIMS tests were submitted for Nb2O5 assay and WRA (whole rock analysis). The test results are summarized in Table 10 and Table 11. All magnetic separation data is also presented in Appendix B.

Figure  14  illustrates  the  recovery  of  various  elements  at  different  magnetic  intensities  in  WHIMS. Figure 15 illustrates the separation performance of the WHIMS tests with mass pull versus recovery and grade versus recovery relationships. No efficient separation of niobium was observed in the tests.  From Table 10, the LIMS Mags recovered ~16% of the Nb2O5 which was directly proportional to the mass pull of the Mags at ~14%.  Nb2O5 recovery to the WHIMS Mags was also proportional to mass pull.

Overall, magnetic separation (both LIMS and WHIMS) was not successful in effectively upgrading the Nb Comp material, likely due to a lack of niobium mineral liberation at 100% passing 150 mesh, and the deportment of niobium to magnetic and paramagnetic minerals.

## 4. Heavy Liquid Separation Testing

Heavy liquid separation (HLS) testing was performed on Nb Comp material from the Elk Creek deposit to identify  the  potential  of  gravity  separation  as  a  unit  process  in  the  flowsheet.  Approximately  2.5  kg  of sample was initially stage-ground to 100% passing 212 µm and then separated into four different size fractions of -212/+150 µm, -150/+75 µm,-75/+38 µm, and -38 µm. Each size fraction was submitted for HLS at specific gravities (SG) of 3.30, 3.10, 2.90, and 2.80 g/cm . The float and sink products were then 3 submitted for Nb O5 2 analysis and WRA.

Table 12 summarizes the HLS results on each of the individual size fractions, Table 13 summarizes the HLS results for all combined size fractions in terms of sink products and Table 14 summarizes the HLS results for all combined size fractions in terms of float products.  Figure 16 illustrates the distribution of the cumulative  sink  products  at  different  SGs.  Figure  17  illustrates  the  distribution  of  the  cumulative  sink products at different SGs for each individual size fraction.

The results indicate that niobium recovery is closely related to mass recovery and limited upgrading was observed at any size fraction without significant niobium losses. At an SG cut point of 3.10, 72% Nb O 2 5 was recovered to the sink product in 51% of the mass in the -212/+150 µm fraction, 76.4% Nb2O5 was recovered in 52% of the mass in the -150/+75 µm fraction, 71.3% Nb2 O5 was recovered in 45% mass in the -75/+38 µm fraction, and 98% Nb O5 was recovered in 96.3% mass in the -38 µm fraction. 2

Heavy  liquid  separation  testing  results  suggest  that  gravity  separation  would  likely  not  be  an  efficient method of upgrading the Elk Creek ore due to lack of niobium mineral liberation at particle sizes suitable for such processing methods.

## 5. Flowsheet Development

## 5.1. Flotation Feed Sample Preparation

Feed for flotation was prepared by stage grinding minus 6 mesh feed material to the required grind size. Stage-grinding  of  the  material  was  conducted  in  a  10  kg  laboratory  rod  mill  using  stainless  steel  rod charges, beginning with 10 kg dry equivalent charges at 65% solids pulp density. The charge was first screened  to  remove  any  undersize  material  at  a  specified  cut  size.  The  oversize  material  was  then charged to the mill and ground for approximately 10 minutes, targeting a passing fraction yield of 30-40%

weight after grinding.  Material  was  removed  from the  mill  and  passed  through  the  appropriate  screen. Oversize  material  was  returned  to  the  mill  for  another  10  minutes  while  the  undersized  material  was filtered. Grinding was repeated in approximately 10 minute intervals. Water addition was adjusted based on the weight of oversize returning to the mill in order to maintain 65% solids. Once the oversize material was less  than  4  kg,  the  stage-grinding  procedure  was  continued  in  the  4  kg  laboratory  rod  mill;  once below 2 kg, oversize material stage-grinding was carried out in the 2 kg laboratory rod mill. Stage-grinding was  carried  out  until  the  entirety  of  the  10  kg  sample  passed  the  selected  screen  size.  The  ground material was filtered and spilt into equal 2 kg or 4 kg charges for flotation.

Grind size was adjusted throughout Phase 1 based on mineralogy and flotation test results. A laboratory scale IsaMill was used to more efficiently grind flotation feed to 100% passing 38 microns for later batch flotation tests. For IsaMill grinding, approximately 30 kg batches of minus 6 mesh materials was ground at 65% solids. A particle size distribution of the recycle streams was obtained in regular time intervals using a  Malvern  Mastersizer  during  grinding  until  the  material  reached  the  target  grind  size,  at  which  point grinding  was  stopped  and  material  was  filtered  and  made  into  equal,  representative  4  kg  flotation charges.

## 5.2. Flotation Batch Tests

A  total  of  136  flotation  tests  were  conducted.  All  flotation  test  conditions  and  full  mass  balances  are presented in Appendix D. For reporting purposes, batch flotation testwork will be discussed in terms of the  final flotation flowsheet  which  was  developed  through  initial  scoping  work,  which  constitutes approximately the first 49 tests of the test program and then optimization tests, which cover the remaining tests  (up  to  test  F136).  For  the  most  part,  the  latter  half  of  this  test  program  deals  with  making improvements  to,  and  optimizing  the  reagent  scheme/flowsheet  developed  in  the  first  49  tests.  A comprehensive  list  of  all  reagents  used  in  the  entirety  of  the  test  program  can  be  found  in  Table  15 through Table 19.

## 5.2.1. Final Flotation Flowsheet

The final flotation flowsheet included a rougher flotation circuit, which recovered a large portion of niobium and  titanium,  while  effectively  rejecting  approximately  80-85%  of  the  mass  which  contained  a  large portion of  carbonate minerals. The objective of this flowsheet was to produce a low-mass concentrate with sufficient niobium recovery to minimize reagent consumption in downstream processing.

The final flotation flowsheet, along with reagent addition rates to each stage can be found in Figure 18. Feed was ground to 100% passing 38 µm (by IsaMill), and conditioned for 2 minutes at 50% solids with Calgon (or sodium hexametaphosphate), a depressant/dispersant, and lead nitrate as a niobium mineral activator.  The  slurry  was  then  conditioned  for  5  minutes  with  collector  Florrea  7510.  Since  no  definite conclusion regarding the benefit of lead nitrate addition has been made, this reagent has been left in the flowsheet, as it was used in the final batch tests.

To  obtain  71.3%  niobium  recovery  in  19%  of  the  mass,  a  total  of  eight  rougher  flotation  stages  were required  with  reagent  addition  prior  to  each  rougher  stage.  Limiting  the  circuit  to  only  seven  rougher

stages,  a  combined  rougher  concentrate  with  68.1%  niobium  recovery  in  16.5%  of  the  mass  was obtained. The total collector addition rates for seven and eight rougher flotation stages were 950 g/t and 1,050 g/t, respectively. The above results were obtained using Elk Creek site groundwater in flotation. Pulp temperature was maintained at 30-35 C. Pulp pH ranged from 7.3-7.7; no pH adjustment was made. o

## 5.2.2. Initial Scoping Batch Flotation Tests

In  this  initial  scoping  study,  two  approaches  to  pyrochlore  flotation  were  assessed.  The  first  approach involved  the  direct  flotation  of  niobium  oxide  minerals  using  various  collectors.  The  most  common collector used in niobium mineral flotation is a cationic amine collector, often tallow diamine acetate. This reagent  is  used  to  selectively  float  pyrochlore  at  increasingly  acidic  pH.  The  lower  the  pH  in  the  final cleaning  stages,  the  higher  the  selectivity  of  the  amine  collector  for  niobium  minerals  over  silicate minerals.  However,  in  the  presence  of  a  great  deal  of  acid  consuming  carbonate  minerals  (such  as calcite, ankerite, and dolomite) it becomes difficult to control and maintain acidic pulp conditions. Thus, the second approach is to first float carbonate minerals using a fatty acid collector while niobium minerals are depressed with causticized corn starch. The tailings from the carbonate flotation circuit act as feed to the niobium circuit, where pyrochlore is floated under acidic conditions using an amine collector.

There are many other collectors that can be used to float niobium minerals, although their use is less common. Hydroxamates, succinimates, imadazoline, and diphosphonic acid have all been documented as selective collectors for niobium, iron, and titanium. Hydroxamates in particular are known to be strong chelating reagents which are selective for iron, titanium, niobium, and rare earths. Hydroxamates are also less sensitive to the presence of very fine material (slimes).

Based on the initial mineralogy report which identified niobium deportation to both pyrochlore and titanium oxide minerals, as well as highly complex pyrochlore which would likely necessitate fine grinding, different types of benzohydroxamic acid collector were tested first in conjuncution with Calgon for dispersion and carbonate mineral depression. These benzohydroxamic acids included:

- 1. Pure benzohydroxamic acid purchased from Alfa Aesar.
- 2. Benzohydroxamic  acid  product  known  as  BHD  from  an  unknown  Chinese  supplier,  which  is comprised of approximately 30% benzohydroxamic acid.

In further tests using benzohydroxamic acid, pulp temperature was adjusted to between 40 C and 50 C in o o order to improve collector dissolution, as well as facilitate collector adsorption on mineral surfaces. The results from some of these initial tests are presented in Figure 19.

Figure 19: Niobium Recovery as a Function of Mass Pull Using Different Benzohydroxamic Acid Collectors

<!-- image -->

F11, which used pure benzohydroxamic acid as a collector produced a first cleaner concentrate with a mass pull of 25.7% and 75.8% niobium recovery.

The 1  cleaner concentrate from F13 contained 22.9% mass with 68.4% recovery. Results from these st tests  can  be  found  in  Table  20  and  Table  21.    The  1 st cleaner  and  1 st cleaner  scavenger  combined concentrate from F13 was leached using hydrochloric acid at 50 C for four hours before being passed o through  wet  high  intensity  magnetic  separation  at  various  intensities.  The  intention  of  this  test  was  to improve iron oxide (and other paramagnetic mineral) liberation prior to magnetic separation through the leaching  of  carbonate  minerals.  The  results  from  leaching  and  WHIMS  testing  on  the  F13  flotation concentrate are also presented in Table 21.

From these tests it was observed that:

-  Recovery  improved  with  a  decrease  in  grind  size  from  100%  passing  105  microns  to  100% passing 38 microns.
-  Chinese collector BHD, when added at the same dosage are pure benzohydroxamic acid and the same grind size produced less attractive  results;  this  is  attributed  to  only  30%  of  the  collector being active benzohydroxamic acid, necessitating higher dosages to produce similar results.
-  Niobium recovery was highest at a grind size of 100% passing 38 microns.

A  number  of  different  flotation  flowsheets  and  reagents,  including  reverse  carbonate  mineral  flotation, followed by pyrochlore flotation with an amine collector, reverse barite and titanium flotation, and direct niobium flotation  with  an  amine  collector  were  all  tested,  but  none  of  these  options  showed  promising results.  For  the  most  part,  mass  rejection  was  limited  and  niobium  recovery  was  low,  with  significant niobium losses to gangue concentrate products. A summary of the tests conducted with results (mass recovery, Nb2O5 assay of the final concentrate and overall niobium recovery) can be found in Table 22. Full test conditions and mass balances are located in Appendix D.

Based on the results for the first 15 tests presented in Table 22, benzohydroxamic acid was identified as the most promising collector for upgrading the Elk Creek ore.  A commercially available benzohydroxamic acid collector from Florrea, known as 7510 was procured for further testwork, as pure benzohydroxamic acid  is  extremely  costly  and  the  Chinese  reagent  BHD  was  difficult  to  source.  It  was  determined  that

Florrea 7510 was approximately 50% strength compared to pure benzohydroxamic acid, and therefore it's dosage was doubled to produce the same results as were obtained with the pure reagent.

Florrea 7150 was tested under similar conditions to F11 with collector dosage increased based on the assumption of 50% strength. Results from F16 are presented in Table 23. Compared to test F7, which used pure benzohydroxamic acid and produced a combined rougher concentrate with 41.97% mass pull and 84.1% niobium recovery, F16 produced a combined rougher concentrate with 42.2% mass pull and 82.3% niobium recovery. Both tests used a 2%  solution of collector 7510, Calgon (sodium hexametaphosphate) for pulp dispersion/carbonate mineral depression, and frother F549 (Cytec).

With the results of F16 showing that Florrea 7510 was an equivalent collector to pure benzohydroxamic acid, a series of tests (F18-F21) were performed to produce flotation concentrate material for downstream (hydrometallurgy)  testwork.  Additional  tests  focused  on  collector  dosage  reduction,  changes  to  pulp temperature,  reverse  flotation  of  silicate  minerals  prior  to  flotation  with  7510,  high  and  low  density flotation,  reduction of initial grind size, and depressant screening. Mass pull, concentrate Nb O 2 5 assay, and  niobium  recovery,  as  well  the  main  reagents/conditions  for  tests  F16  to  F35  are  summarized  in Table 24. Complete test conditions and full metallurgical balances for each of these tests are presented in Appendix D.

Of the test results presented in Table 24, results from those tests which had minimal mass recovery and maximum niobium recovery to the final concentrate have been compared in Figure 19.

From Figure 19, it is clear that test results are quite consistent, indicating that the depressant AQ-4 has no added value compared to Calgon. Further, while it was hypothesized that grinding to 100% passing 20 microns would result in improvements to niobium mineral liberation and thus improve mass rejection, tests  F25  through  F28  do  not  support  this  assumption.  This  is  possibly  due  to  minimal  incremental increase in pyrochlore liberation between a grind size of 38 microns and 20 microns, and/or due to the negative impact (i.e. need for increased collector addition rates to maintain recovery) of the increased slimes generated when grinding to a finer size. Likewise, test F25 demonstrated that temperature may not play as significant of a role in terms of collector dissolution and uptake.

Results from tests F36 through F44 have been summarized in Table 25. In this set of tests, while awaiting a shipment of Florrea 7150, the Chinese reagent BHD was employed in order to drive testwork forward. For these tests collector dosage was scaled based on the relative strength of BHD compared to Florrea 7510.  Parameters  investigated  included  collector  dosage  reduction,  increased  number  of  cleaner scavenger stages, pH adjustment to more alkaline conditions, increased pulp density, and testing of F500 (a lignin sulphonate) as an alternative carbonate mineral depressant. Tests F43 and F44 were the first tests  to  be  conducted  on  the  2 nd Nb  Drill  Core  sample  received  by  SGS,  which  had  a  head  grade  of 0.66% Nb2O5, compared to the first Nb Drill Core which was 0.86% Nb O . 2 5

The primary observations from these tests were as follows:

-  Increased cleaner scavenger stages with lower collector addition in each stage increased recovery by approximately 5% with negligible increase in mass pull (F36 and F37).
-  There appeared to be little room for lowering collector dosage without negative impact on concentrate mass  pull  and  recovery  (tests  F37  and  F38).  Test  F38,  while  yielding  lower  recovery  than  F37, demonstrated that lower collector dosage added in more scavenger stages is beneficial for improving overall recovery. This test included 3 cleaner scavenger stages, as opposed to only one scavenger stage in F36. The resulting recovery was approximately 8% higher, as was mass pull.
-  Comparing  F39  and  F40,  which  were  performed  under  similar  conditions  but  at  50 C  and  80 C, o o respectively, elevated temperature resulted in increased mass pull with a corresponding increase in niobium recovery. Considering the incremental cost of operating at 80 C compared to 50 C, and the o o minimal improvement to test results, further testwork was continued at 50 C. o
-  In F39, nearly perfect linear relations were observed between niobium and titanium recovery. Similar relationships were observed between P2 O5, CaO, and MgO.
-  Operating at a pH of 10.5 as opposed to natural pulp pH of 8 showed no increased in mass rejection or recovery (F42).
-  Higher pulp density resulted in both higher mass pull and recovery but lower concentrate grade, likely due to an increase in entrained material.
-  F500 was not effective in depressing carbonate minerals or increasing recovery.

## 5.2.3. Optimization Batch Flotation Tests

## 5.2.3.1. Batch Flotation Tests on 2 nd Nb Drill Core Material

The  focus  of  the  majority  of  tests  in  the  latter  half  of  the  test  program  was  on  optimizing  the benxohydroxamic acid (Florrea 7510) Calgon reagent scheme to maximize recovery and minimize mass pull,  ultimately reducing acid consumption in hydrometallurgy. The results discussed in this section are divided between tests performed on the 2 nd Nb Drill Core material and assay reject material, which was used at the feed to a mini pilot plant (reported elsewhere). Comprehensive details of the mini pilot plant are outlined in a separate report.

Results from tests F49 to F68, completed on the 2 nd Nb Drill Core material, have been summarized in Table 27. Niobium distribution has been plotted against concentrate mass pull for tests F49 to F58 in Figure 21. From this plot, it is  evident  that  F49  and F50  demonstrate  the  highest  degree of  selectivity towards  niobium  for  recoveries  &gt;60%,  both  following  similar  mass-recovery  curves.  As  previously mentioned, these tests were conducted under identical conditions on 20 micron material (F50) and 38 micron material (F49). F50, with the finer initial grind size, showed slightly higher recovery in the rougher and  first  cleaner  flotation  stages  compared  to  the  coarser  grind  material.  Mass  pull  to  the  rougher concentrate of F50 was more than 15% higher. However, at a target mass pull closer to 10%, which was achieved through a cleaning stage, recovery was just above 60% for both grind sizes.

Test  F55  follows  a  nearly  identical  mass  recovery  curve  to  F50,  with  niobium  recovery  just  exceeding 60% with  10%  mass  pull.  Mass  pull  and  niobium  recovery  for  tests  F61  to  F66  have  been  plotted  in Figure 22 in reference to test F55.

Test F62 demonstrated the highest degree of niobium selectivity. The test was conducted using Calgon and  A3-3  (sodium  silicate,  disodium  phosphate  and  sodium  metabisulphate)  as  dispersants/gangue depressants, Florrea 7510, and frother F549. Mass pull to the rougher concentrate was 19.2% with 79.7% niobium  recovery.  After  six  cleaner  scavenger  stages,  a  final  combined  cleaner  concentrate  was produced with 67% niobium recovery in 10.4% of the mass. The metallurgical balance for test F62 can be found in Table 26.

## 5.2.3.2. Batch Flotation Tests on Mini Pilot Plant Feed Material

Approximately  one  tonne  of  material  was  received  in  Lakefield  as  feed  for  the  mini  pilot  plant.  This material was very similar to the 2 nd Nb  Drill  Core  sample  in  terms  of  head  assay.  Flotation  tests  were carried out on the mini pilot plant feed material, which was ground to 100% passing 38 microns using a laboratory  IsaMill,  and  on  the  mini  pilot  plant  ball  mill  grinding  circuit  product  which  was  95%  passing 45 microns or 100% passing 105 microns. A summary of these tests, along with two tests (F71 and F72) performed on the 2 nd Nb Drill Core to produce concentrate for rheology, is presented in Table 28.

It was observed that the mini pilot plant material had poorer flotation performance than the Nb Drill Core samples. Of the tests performed on the mini pilot plant material, more promising results were observed on the mini pilot plant feed material when ground in the laboratory IsaMill. Tests F73 and F74, which were conducted on mini pilot plant feed ground in the IsaMill, both produced concentrates with between 60% and 64% niobium recovery in approximately 11% of the mass. These results can be compared to F86, which produced the best results on the mini pilot plant grinding product. Mass pull to this concentrate was 9.1% with 52.5% niobium recovery. Test F86 also employed lower collector addition rates, with a total 7510 addition of 2.4 kg/t. Comparing results of F86 to F84, which used a total of 12.65 kg/t and produced a  concentrate  with  9.3%  mass  pull  and  49.7%  niobium  recovery,  it  became  evident  that  collector  was being added in excess and a great deal of room existed for reduction in collector dosage.  Figure 23 illustrates  mass  pull  and  recovery  for  tests  F66  to  F88,  performed  on  mini  pilot  plant  grinding  circuit material.

Tests were performed to assess the effectiveness of A3-3 addition, pulp temperature, regrinding, variable air  addition  and  agitation  rates,  imidazoline  and  other  hydroxamate  collectors,  and  various  initial  grind sizes. From tests F60 through F87, the following observations were made:

-  A grind size of 100% passing 38 microns yielded optimum results; little to no improvement was observed with regrinding to 100% passing 20 microns.
-  Depressant/dispersant 'A3-3' addition may help to a very small extent in terms of mass rejection, but overall did not appear to offer significant added benefit.
-  Imadazoline  and  various  other  hydroxamate  collectors  were  tested.  None  of  these  reagents outperformed Florrea 7150 as a selective niobium mineral collector in this particular ore system.

-  Pulp  temperature  appeared  to  have  some  importance,  but  there  was  no  benefit  observed  in elevating  the  temperature  above  approximately  55 C.  Testing  at  75 C  (F82)  only  showed  an o o increase in recovery of gangue mineral without increasing niobium mineral recovery.

Optimization testwork continued, while additional collector screening was carried out simultaneously. F89 through F92 were conducted on the mini pilot plant grinding circuit product after regrinding the material to 100% passing 38 microns in the laboratory IsaMill. Test F93 to F102 were carried out on the 2 nd Nb Drill Core. These test results are summarized in Table 29.

## 5.2.4. Optimization of Reagent Addition Rates

Before the test program shifted focus to optimization, consumption of the collector (Florrea 7510) was relatively  high  due  to  the  addition  of  collector  in  several  stages  of  rougher  and  cleaner  flotation.  An economic  assessment  performed  by  NioCorp  Developments  Ltd.  and  their  associates  revealed  that project economics required collector addition rates to be minimized, ideally to 1 kg/tonne or lower.

The majority of tests from F89 to F102 (Figure 24) focused on reduction of collector addition rates, testing niobium mineral activators with the potential to assist in collector reduction, and screening for other less expensive collectors and/or collector blends.

## 5.2.4.1. Reagent consumption and cleaner circuit performance

Preliminary optimization tests (i.e. F93) with the aim of collector reduction indicated that it was possible to reduce dosage, however reduction to as low as 1 kg/t would be difficult with the inclusion of the cleaner circuit,  which  required  several  scavenger  stages  with  collector  addition  to  each  in  order  to  maintain recovery.  As  a  result,  the  efficiency  of  the  cleaner  circuit  was  placed  under  scrutiny.  Typically,  mass rejection in the cleaner circuit was ~20%, with niobium losses to the cleaner tails just below 20% (F73).

It  was  also  observed  that  a  strong  relationship  existed  between  collector  and  Calgon  dosage.  It  was hypothesized that collector dosage could be further reduced if the effective ratio of collector to Calgon was maintained, and if the cleaner circuit was eliminated from the flowsheet.

## 5.2.4.2. Rougher flotation performance

To  assess  the  potential  of  eliminating  the  cleaner  circuit  from  the  flowsheet,  the  rougher  flotation performance of all tests was assessed to determine the best possible flotation conditions to achieve a rougher  concentrate  with  as  low  as  15%  mass  pull  and  close  to  70%  niobium  recovery.  A  rougher flotation performance index was calculated for each test; this number was calculated by dividing niobium recovery to the rougher concentrate by mass pull. Figure 25 shows the rougher flotation mass niobium recovery curves for all  flotation  tests,  with  'best  tests'  characterized  as  those  with  the  highest  rougher performance index values.

Figure 25: Rougher Flotation Performance for All Flotation Tests

Operating conditions for tests with the highest rougher performance index values were then assessed, with particular focus on the ratio of collector 7510 dosage to Calgon dosage. The tests with the highest rougher performance index values were found to be F71 and F61, which had 7510:Calgon addition rates of  7.4  and  7.7,  respectively.  Further,  both  of  these tests  were  performed on 10 kg charges in a 10 kg batch  flotation  cell.  It  was  observed  that  due  to  the  larger  surface  area  of  this  10  kg  flotation  cell compared  to  the  4  kg  flotation  cell  used  in  the  majority  of  the  test  work,  the  operator  was  inherently unable  to  pull  the  froth  as  quickly.  It  was  speculated  that  this  less  aggressive  froth  removal  allowed sufficient  time  for  entrained  particles  to  fall  out  of  the  froth,  ultimately  increasing  rougher  flotation selectivity.

As a result of this analysis, the remainder of the batch flotation tests included rougher flotation circuit only and addition of  Florrea 7510  was  limited  to  approximately  to  1  kg/t.  A  summary  of  results  for  rougher flotation tests performed on 2 nd Nb Drill Core material is presented in Table 30.

In addition, three new collectors, salicylhydroxamic acid, 8-hydroxyquinoline, and Florrea C8868 (F108, F109, F116) were tested, and two tests were performed on the leach residue material (F115 and F117). These tests have also been summarized in Table 30.

Examining niobium recovery as a function of mass pull for various ratios of 7510:Calgon (Figure 26), the most promising results were observed in test F118. In this test, a final combined rougher concentrate was produced with just  over  15%  mass  pull  and  71.5%  niobium  recovery  in  eight  rougher  flotation  stages. Total addition rate of Florrea 7510 was 1,050 g/t.

*Indicates tests using lead nitrate as a niobium activator

In test F118, lead nitrate was added (a niobium mineral activator) in order to increase niobium recovery at reduced collector dosages. Initial tests using lead nitrate (F113 and F118) indicated that there may be some benefit to addition of this reagent.

Beginning in F112, pulp temperature was reduced from 50 C to 30 C. The results in Figure 26 show that o o there  was  no  notable  change  in  rougher  flotation  performance  with  reduced  pulp  temperatures.  As  a result, all subsequent tests were performed at 30 C. o

Tests F118 through F124 (summarized in Table 31) were performed on material sent to SGS Lakefield from Hazen Research, Inc., from a parallel test program on the Elk Creek deposit. This material was very

similar  in  head  grade  to  the  2 nd Nb  Drill  Core,  and  was  prepared  by  grinding  to  100%  passing 38 µm in the laboratory IsaMill.

Niobium recovery versus mass pull has been plotted for tests F119 to F124 in Figure 27. Tests F119 and F120 were carried out under than same conditions, with and without lead nitrate addition. Based on these results, lead nitrate was successful in increasing niobium recovery for a given mass pull by approximately 5%.

*Indicates tests using lead nitrate as a niobium activator

Test F124 was conducted using groundwater from the Elk Creek site. The natural pH in this test was between  7.3-7.7,  compared  to  a  pH  approximately  8.0-8.4  in  tests  using  SGS  Lakefield  tap  water. However, F124 showed improved results when compared to F119, which was performed under identical conditions using SGS Lakefield tap water. The final combined rougher flotation concentrate in F124 had 71.3% niobium recovery in 18.9% of the mass after eight rougher stages, or 68.1% niobium recovery in 16.5% of the mass after seven rougher stages.

Test  results  for  F125  to  129  are  plotted  in  Figure  34,  with  F124  included  as  a  reference  test.  F125 explored less Calgon addition to the circuit, F126 and F127 were run as verification tests, and F128 was run in order to re-assess the benefit of inclusion of a cleaner circuit.

Figure 28: Niobium Recovery vs. Mass Pull for Tests F124 - F129

<!-- image -->

These results confirm that adding a cleaner circuit doesn't appear to have any clear benefit, as nearly the same  grade  and  recovery  can  be  achieved  with  rougher  flotation  only,  with  lower  collector  dosage. Overall the series of results was quite consistent, with around 65% niobium recovery in 11-13% mass pull, or up to 76% recovery in 18-19% of the mass with a few added rougher flotation stages.

A  number  of  additional  tests  were  performed  under  conditions  similar  to  F124  in  order  to  produce additional concentrate for hydrometallurgical testwork (F130-F135). Mass recovery curves for these tests, and F136, which was conducted on material similar to that which was tested at the Eriez facility in column cells, is presented in Figure 34.

Figure 29: Niobium Recovery vs. Mass Pull for Tests F130 - F136

<!-- image -->

From the plot in Figure 29, the following can be concluded:

- 1. Elk underground water most likely had a positive effect on niobium flotation.  In test F131, the mass pull was higher than expected.
- 2. The effect of lead nitrate is not clear, but can be revisited in the pilot plant (or mini pilot plant) operation.
- 3. The results from the Eriez sample, F136, were similar to those observed in previous tests.

## 5.2.5. Batch Flotation Tests on the Leach Residue

Two flotation tests were carried out on hydrochloric leach residue (F115 and F117) with the objective of further  upgrading  the  concentrate  following  improved  niobium  mineral  liberation  after  the  dissolution  of carbonate and phosphate minerals. Attempts were made to remove pyrite, silicate, barite, and Fe-oxides through reverse flotation,  however  in  all  cases  niobium  losses  were  significant  (directly  proportional  to mass pull as is evident in Figure 30). It was concluded that increased liberation after leaching was not sufficient  to  allow  for  further  upgrading  of  the  concentrate.  Further  batch  flotation  work  on  the  leach residue was abandoned.

## 5.3. Magnetic Separation on Leach Residue

Following flotation, the flotation concentrate was subjected to a hydrochloric acid leach. A 350 g sample of the leach residue was then passed through WHIMS at 2,000, 4,000, 6,000, 8,000, and 10,000 Gauss. The  Mags  and  Non-Mags  fractions  were  submitted  for  WRA  and  Nb O .  The  results  from  magnetic 2 5 separation testing on the leach residue are presented in Table 32.

Figure  31  illustrates  the  recovery  of  various  elements  at  different  magnetic  intensities  in  WHIMS.

Figure 32 illustrates the separation performance of the WHIMS tests with mass pull versus recovery and grade versus recovery relationships.

Selective  recovery  of  Fe O   over  Nb O   to  the  magnetic  concentrate  using  WHIMS  was  significantly 2 3 2 5 improved when performed on the leach residue when compared to the feed material. Improved results are  likely  due  to  increased  niobium  mineral  liberation  from  finer  grinding  (ore  was  ground  to  100% passing

38 µm for flotation) and leaching of carbonate and phosphate minerals.  However, niobium recovery to the magnetic concentrate was still closely related to mass pull. In order to recover approximately 50% Fe2O3 (at 10,000 Gauss) the resultant Nb O  losses were 15.1%. Again, this is likely attributed to a lack of 2 5 liberation or deportment of niobium to paramagnetic minerals, such as ilmenite.

It can be concluded that WHIMS demonstrated some potential to further upgrade the leach residue and reject nearly 50% of Fe O  in under 35% of the mass, but with niobium losses of approximately 15%. 2 3

## 6. Discussion of Flotation Results

## 6.1. Pulp Temperature

It  was  observed  that  although  the  collector,  Florrea  7510  must  be  maintained  at  65-70 C  in  order  to o prevent  precipitation,  flotation  results  were  not  drastically  affected  by  pulp  temperature.  In  rougher flotation at low collector dosages (i.e. in the range of 1 kg/t), there was no significant change in results when pulp temperature was dropped from 50 C to 30 C. This is likely attributed to the rapid uptake of o o collector once introduced to the pulp and the sufficient solubility of the active component, benzohydroxamic acid, at 30 C. o

In  earlier  tests,  at  much  higher  collector  dosages,  temperature  had  a  far  more  pronounced  effect. Figure  33  shows  a  significant  decrease  in  recovery  when  the  temperature  was  dropped  from  50 C  to o 25 C (plot on the left of Figure 33). Tests F55, F59, and F60 had 7510 addition rates of approximately o 10 kg/t, and included a cleaner circuit. The 7510:Calgon ratio was approximately 7.3-7.8.

Tests  F103  and  F112  (Figure  33)  produced  similar  results  in  terms  of  mass  pull  and  recovery,  but included only a rougher flotation circuit, with a total 7510 dosage of ~1 kg/t. The 7510:Calgon for these two tests was 6.3.

Figure 33: Mass-Recovery Curve at Various Pulp Temperatures at High Collector Dosages (left) and Lower Collector Dosages (right)

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

For these two sets of tests, which employed a similar ratio of collector to Calgon, it is likely that the more distinct effect of temperature while at high reagent addition rates can be attributed to collector solubility. It may be  that  when  both  Calgon  dosage  and  7510  dosages  are  high,  a  greater  amount  of  collector  is required to overcome the depressing effects of Calgon. However, 7510 is only partially soluble at such a high concentration, its solubility increasing with an increase in temperature. As flotation pulp temperature exceeds  25 C,  more  of  the  collector  is  readily  dissolved  and  becomes  available  for  adsorption  onto o minerals of interest, resulting in increased niobium recovery. This however, is merely speculation. Further testwork is required to fully understand the chemistry and mechanisms of this reagent system.

When  Calgon  dosage  is  reduced,  as  is  the  case  in  F103  and  F112,  a  lesser  amount  of  collector  is required to achieve good results. At lower concentrations, it is possible that the collector is more readily dissolved  at  lower  temperatures  and  therefore  an  increase  in  temperature  has  little  effect  on  niobium recovery.

## 6.2. Pyrite flotation

In the beginning of the test program, pyrite flotation was performed as an initial sulphur removal step prior to niobium flotation. However, the pyrite concentrate rarely contained more than 0.5% mass pull with a sulphur assay of approximately 16% S and 12% sulphur recovery (F71). Due to the inefficiency of this circuit, pyrite flotation was eliminated from the flowsheet.

## 6.3. Mineralogical Analysis of Flotation Products

Quantitative  mineralogical  analysis  using  QEMSCAN,  as  well  as  XRD  semi  quantitative  analysis  was performed on a number of different flotation products throughout the test program to better understand the  sources  of  niobium  losses  to  tailings  streams.  A  list  of  all  products  from  beneficiation  testwork submitted for QEMSCAN is as follows:

- 1. Nb Comp

- 3. Flot Feed
- 4. F4 Nb Ro Tail
- 5. F3 Ro Tails
- 6. F7 Ro Conc 1

Full QEMSCAN results for each of the products listed above are presented in Appendix F. In this section, selected product mineralogy is discussed as it pertains to development of the recommended beneficiation flowsheet.

## 6.3.1. F7 and F11 Concentrates

Two flotation  products,  rougher  concentrate  from  test  F7  and  3 rd cleaner  concentrate  from  F11,  were initially analysed using QEMSCAN. Both tests used benzohydroxamic acid as a niobium mineral collector. The F7 first rougher concentrate had a mass pull of 14.9%, with 49.5% niobium recovery. QEMSCAN revealed that:

-  35% of pyrcohlore was free and liberated in &lt;10 microns
-  12.1 % of pyrochlore was free and liberated in material coarser than 10 microns

-  17.8% pyrochlore was complex
-  11.5% of pyrochlore associated with other oxides
-  8.2% of pyrochlore was associated with carbonates

The F11 3 rd cleaner concentrate had a mass pull of 6.2% with 29.6% niobium recovery. QEMSCAN revealed that:

-  33% or pyrochlore was free and liberated in &lt;10 microns
-  18.8%% of pyrochlore was free and liberated in all material coarser than 10 microns
-  18.6% of pyrochlore was complex
-  14.9% or pyrochlore was associated with other oxides
-  3.5% of pyrochlore was associated with carbonates

From  these  results,  it  was  determined  that  in  order  to  obtain  a  high  grade  pyrochlore  concentrate (approximately  &gt;45%  Nb2O5), at  least 50%  of  the  niobium  would  have  to  be  rejected  from  these concentrates.  Furthermore,  it  is  very  difficult  to  achieve  good  results  and  selectivity  in  conventional flotation when grinding the feed material to less than 10 or 15 µm. Thus, in order to obtain reasonable recovery, the final niobium concentrate must be relatively low in grade.

## 6.3.2. Flotation Using Amines vs. Hydroxamates

In  addition  to  performing  QEMSCAN on concentrates from flotation tests using benzohydroxamic acid, both  concentrate  and  tailings  products  from  tests  using  typical  niobium  collectors  (amines)  were analyzed. More specifically, F5 Nb 6 th cleaner concentrate, which showed poor performance (4.5% mass pull and 8.4% niobium recovery), F4 Nb rougher tailings, F8 Nb rougher tailings were compared against F7 rougher concentrate and F3 rougher tailings in Figure 34.

Figure  34  demonstrates  that  flotation  with  benzohydroxamic  recovered  ilmenorutile,  Nb-rutile,  ilmenite, pyrite, and iron rich carbonates (i.e. ankerite/siderite). Examining Table 33, it is also evident that in the concentrate from F7, the D 50 of pyrochlore in the concentrate is 11 microns, compared to 16 microns in F5. Similar for Nb-rutile in the concentrate, the D 50 by mass in F7 is 12 microns, compared to 19 microns in F5.

It can be concluded that benzohydroxamic acid is more effective in recovering fine grained minerals when compared to a typical amine collector. Since the pyrochlore in the Elk Creek ore sample is highly complex and  necessitates  fine  grinding  (to  100%  passing  38  microns),  this  collector  appears  to  be  the  most attractive choice.

## 6.3.3. F72 Combined Cleaner Concentrate and Combined Tailings

Test F72 was performed on a 10 kg charge of 2 nd Nb Drill Core material at an initial grind size of 100% passing  37  µm.  The  test  included  eight  rougher/scavenger  stages  followed  by  a  1 st cleaner  and  six 1  cleaner scavenger stages. The combined 1 st st cleaner and 1 st cleaner scavenger concentrates, and the combined rougher and cleaner tailings were analyzed by QEMSCAN.

Table 34 outlines niobium mineral liberation and association in the concentrate and tailings products from F72. In the concentrate, pyrochlore, and Nb-rutile are 47% and 47.8% free and liberated, respectively, and  nearly  30%  of  the  niobium  bearing  minerals  are  locked.  In  the  combined  tailings,  only  ~20%  of pyrochlore, and just under 30% of Nb-rutile is free and liberated.

The results clearly indicate the niobium collector was fairly selective and efficient in recovering pyrochlore, ilmenite, and Nb-rutile. Furthermore, a large portion of dolomite, and ankerite/siderite was rejected to the tailings. The main weakness of this particular collector is its weak selectivity over titanium and iron oxide minerals.

## 6.4. Stage Addition of Reagents

Through all flotation tests, the necessity of stage addition of the collector has been observed. In almost all cases, the first concentrate collected, whether a cleaner or rougher concentrate, was lower in niobium assay than subsequent scavenger concentrates. This is generally uncommon in flotation. In the case of this complex ore, it appears the first flotation stage, while contributing to overall niobium recovery, is far less selective than subsequent steps. This is likely attributed to the entrainment of fines (both pyrochlore and gangue) which are removed in the first flotation stage, allowing for true, selective flotation to take place in later stages. It may also be that these slimes consume a great deal of collector in this first step, which would account for the need to continually add collector through the scavenger stages.

## 7. Roasting of Flotation Concentrate

Select  samples  of  flotation  concentrate  were  subjected  to  a  reductive  roast  with  the  objective  of converting  hematite  to  magnetite  to  be  removed  by  low  intensity  magnetic  separation,  resulting  in  a higher grade, lower mass feed for hydrometallurgy. Three reductive roasts were conducted, the first two on flotation  concentrate  before  pre-leaching  (C1  and  C2).  The  third  reductive  roast  was  run  on  a  preleach concentrate (C3).

For each test, 150 g of sample was measured into a quartz tube which was inserted into the furnace and rotated at a rate of 2 rpm. Argon gas was allowed to flow through the furnace at a rate of 500 mL/min as the temperature was brought to target. Test C1 was run at a target temperature of 500 C, C2 at 650 C, o o

and C3 at 650 C. Once at target temperature, the argon gas was switched off and carbon monoxide was o allowed to flow through the furnace at 500 mL/min for 2.5 hours. After 2.5 hours at temperature, carbon monoxide  was  switched  off,  argon  gas  was  switched  on  and  the  furnace  was  allowed  to  cool  to  an internal temperature less than 200 C. All valves to the furnace were then closed and the sample left in the o furnace  to  cool  for  an  additional  ~48  hours,  after  which  point  the  glass  tube  was  removed  from  the furnace and then sample was removed from the glass tube. The roast calcine was ground using mortar and pestle and any changes in physical appearance of the sample were noted.

After roasting was completed, each of the samples was submitted to Davis Tube testing to assess the potential for LIMS to separate any hematite which had been converted to magnetite. Davis tube results have been presented in Table 35, Table 36, and Table 37.

Flotation concentrate from flotation test F49, both before and after roasting (i.e., on the C1 feed and C1 calcine, and C3 feed and calcine) was submitted for Semi-Quantitative XRD. XRD results are presented in Table 38 and Table 39. The following was observed in the roasting tests:

Test C1 - Float concentrate, 500°C, 500 mL/min, 150 g feed sample, 2.5 h

-  Feed had 9.5% hematite which was reduced to 1.3% in the calcine
-  No change in goethite concentration was observed (4.5% vs. 4.7%) believed to be due to the inert gas heat up not allowing goethite to oxidize to hematite (~250°C or higher)
-  10% mags
-  Niobium losses to the magnetic concentrate were ~16%, after cleaning the magnetic concentrate in a Davis tube
-  18% iron recovery to Mags
-  XRD on calcine indicates that ~60% of the iron in the calcine is magnetite
-  Bulk of the remaining iron was present as ankerite and goethite

The roasting tests on the flotation concentrate both before and after pre-leaching did not result in efficient conversion of magnetite to hematite. Due to this, LIMS was not an effective means of rejecting mass prior to  downstream  processing.  At  lower  roasting  temperatures  (~500 C),  a  portion  of  the  hematite  was o converted to magnetite and ~18% of iron was removed in low intensity magnetic separation in 10% of the mass. However, niobium losses to the magnetic fraction were 16%, negating the benefit of mass rejection by LIMS. The lack of conversion of hematite to magnetite at higher roasting temperatures (~650 C) is not o well  understood at this  time.  Should  more efficient  conversion be  achieved  through roasting,  magnetic separation  would  likely  become  a  more  effective  means  of  mass  rejection.  Thus,  further  testwork  is required  before  it  can  be  determined  if  it  is  possible  to  reject  mass  through  roasting  coupled  with magnetic separation.

## Conclusions and Recommendations

## Conclusions

Due to the extremely fine grain size of niobium bearing minerals in the Elk Creek deposit, particularly pyrochlore, mineral beneficiation using a typical niobium mineral processing flowsheet was shown to be challenging.  Mineralogical  limitations  of  the  ore  prevented  the  production  of  a  standard,  high  grade pyrochlore concentrate and measures were taken to produce a high recovery, low grade niobium mineral concentrate  with  the  aim  of  maximizing  mass  rejection  and  niobium  recovery  to  reduce  reagent consumption and equipment size in downstream processing.

Examination of physical separation techniques, including gravity and magnetic separation, revealed that neither method was effective in rejecting sufficient mass without associated niobium losses due to the finely disseminated, highly complex nature of the ore.

In  flotation,  benzohydroxamic  acid  (commercially  available  as  Florrea  7510)  was  determined  to  be  the most suitable collector for selective recovery of niobium minerals. When used in conjunction with sodium hexametaphosphate (commercially available in North America as Calgon), a combined rougher flotation concentrate with niobium recovery of 65% or higher was produced in approximately 15% of the mass.

Based on bench scale flotation test work and extensive review of both rougher and cleaner flotation, the following can be noted:

-  Grinding to 100% passing 38 microns was required to achieve near target niobium recovery with sufficient mass rejection. Further grinding to 100% passing 20 µ m did not improve flotation results, possibly due to only marginal increase in niobium mineral liberation. Thus, it is recommended that future flotation testwork be conducted with on material ground to 100% passing 38 µm.
-  Improved flotation performance was noted on mini-pilot plant feed material ground in an IsaMill versus conventional grinding, likely due to the finer size distribution produced by the IsaMill, even at the similar 100% passing targets.
-  Elimination of the cleaner circuit allowed for higher niobium recovery and reduction of collector addition rates to ~1 kg/t (or potentially less).
-  Successful rougher flotation performance depended on the relative dosage of collector (Florrea 7510) to depressant (Calgon), thus it is important to optimize the Florrea 7510:Calgon ratio.
-  Stage  addition  of  reagents  through  multiple  rougher  flotation  stages  is  necessary  to  maintain niobium recovery and minimize mass pull to the flotation concentrate.
-  Tests  showed  that  pulp  temperature  in  flotation  was  an  important  variable  at  high  collector dosages  (~10  kg/t).  However,  at  lower  dosages  little  difference  was  observed  when  pulp temperature was dropped from 50 C to 30 C. Thus it is recommended that the flotation circuit be o o operated at typical mill discharge temperatures around 30-35 C to minimize costs and operating o challenges associated with pulp heating.

-  Pulp pH should be kept in the range of 8-9 (natural slurry pH); increasing pH to 9-10 did not result in improved results and therefore pH was not adjusted for the majority of tests. Reduction of pulp pH to below 7 had adverse effects on flotation and is not recommended.
-  Initial  tests  demonstrated  that  lead  nitrate  had  a  positive  effect  on  niobium  recovery  at  lower collector dosages but this was not confirmed in later tests. It is still uncertain if lead nitrate can indeed improve results significantly.

Reductive  roasts  on  the  flotation  concentrate  and  pre-leach  residue  were  not  highly  successful  in producing  a  large  amount  of  magnetite  to  be  removed  by  LIMS.  At  a  roasting  temperature  of  500 C, o partial  reduction  was  observed  but  not  to  the  extent  that  all  of  the  iron  was  transferred  to  magnetite. Further,  niobium  losses  to  the  magnetic  concentrate  were  high  (~15%)  even  with  partial  conversion, making  the  roast  detrimental  to  overall  metallurgical  recovery.    Further  roasting  testwork  is  not recommended at this time.

## Recommendations

The following is recommended for further testwork on Elk Creek ore:

-  Optimization study to assess the limits of the following parameters in flotation:
- o Collector addition rate and collector mixtures
- o Assessment  of  the  effect  of  different  metallic  compounds  (similar  to  lead  nitrate)  on niobium flotation behaviour and collector dosage
- o Depressant addition rate and assessment of different dispersants

It has been demonstrated that of these parameters, the collector and dispersant/depressant dosage are of  utmost  importance.  Prior  to  running  a  full  scale  pilot  plant,  it  would  be  highly  beneficial  to  run  a statistically designed set of batch flotation tests with the objective of optimizing collector dosage, mass pull,  niobium  recovery  and  the  ratio  of  collector  to  depressant.  This  set  of  experiments  would  provide detailed information and allow for rough predictions of flotation mass pull and niobium recovery for given reagent dosages through mathematical modelling.

-  Trade-off study on the effect of IsaMill and/or vertical grinding mills versus conventional grinding on flotation
- o This study should be executed with both grinding types targeting 100% passing 38 µm; subsequent flotation should follow the final recommended flotation flowsheet and reagent scheme

The  grinding  study  will  be  of  great  value  to  NioCorp  Developments  Ltd.  in  minimizing  grinding  costs and/or optimizing flotation performance in the process plant design for Elk Creek. This information will also be of great value prior to full-scale pilot plant testing.

-  Variability testing:
- o A  number  of  variability  samples  should  be  collected  and  tested  with  the  developed flowsheet.  The  exact  number  of  variability  samples  should  be  determined  by  NioCorp Developments  Ltd.  and  associates  to  capture  major  ore  variation  in  the  deposit.  This testwork  will  determine  how  robust  the  flowsheet  is  in  treating  the  entirety  of  the  Elk Creek deposit.

-  Geometallurgical testing:
- o This analysis will be extremely valuable for NioCorp Developments Ltd. to determine the effect of feed mineralogy on flotation and grinding in terms of reagent consumption and plant  energy  requirements.  The  developed  model  can  be  used  to  identify  different orebody zones which may respond differently to processing in real operation.

Overall, the current recommended mineral processing flowsheet is quite simple and as such, a great deal of information could be obtained and cost reduction may be realized through basic optimization testwork and trade-off studies, ideally conducted prior to the commissioning of a full scale pilot plant.
