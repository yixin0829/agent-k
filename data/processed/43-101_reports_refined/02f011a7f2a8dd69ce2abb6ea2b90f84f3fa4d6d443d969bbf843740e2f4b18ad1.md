## 1 SUMMARY

## 1.1 Description and Location

The  Greenbushes  Lithium  Operations  (as  defined  below)  are  located  directly  south  of  and  immediately adjacent to the town of Greenbushes approximately 250 kilometres ('km') south of Perth, at latitude 33° 52´ S and longitude 116° 04´ E, and 90km south-east of the Port of Bunbury, a major bulk handling port in the southwest of Western Australia ('WA').  The Greenbushes Lithium Operations are situated approximately 300 metres ('m') above mean sea level ('AMSL').  The Greenbushes Lithium Operations produce a range of lithium mineral products.

Talison  Lithium  Limited  ('Talison  or  the  'Company')  requested  Behre  Dolbear  Australia  Pty  Limited ('BDA') undertake the preparation of this independent technical report in connection with the recent update of Talison's lithium Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves at its Greenbushes Lithium Operations in WA ('the  'Greenbushes  Lithium  Operations')  in  compliance  with  the  Canadian  Securities  Administrators' National Instrument 43-101 - Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects ('NI 43-101').  BDA is the Australian  subsidiary  of  Behre  Dolbear  and  Company  Inc.,  which  has  offices  in  Denver,  New  York, Toronto, Vancouver, London, Hong Kong, Guadalajara, Santiago and Sydney.

Unless the context otherwise requires, all references to 'Talison' refer to Talison Lithium Limited and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.

## 1.2 Ownership

In  2010,  upon  completion  of  a  reorganisation  of  the  lithium  and  tantalum  businesses  previously  held  by Talison Minerals Pty Ltd and its subsidiaries ('Talison Minerals Group'), Talison acquired the Greenbushes Lithium Operations comprising real property, mining tenements, intellectual property, goodwill, contracts, and  plant  and  equipment,  including  two  lithium  ore  treatment  plants,  three  open  pits,  and  associated infrastructure  at  Greenbushes  in  south-west  WA  (Figure  1).  Talison  owns  the  Greenbushes  Lithium Operations through its wholly-owned subsidiary companies Talison Lithium (Australia) Pty Ltd ('TLA'), Talison Services Pty Limited ('Talison Services') and Talison Minerals Pty Ltd ('Talison Minerals').

As a result of the reorganization, the tantalum business previously owned by the Talison Minerals Group was  acquired  by  Global  Advanced  Metals  Greenbushes  Pty  Ltd  ('GAM'),  including  the  rights  to  all minerals other than lithium on the Greenbushes tenements, the crushing facility, the tantalum primary and secondary  plants,  and  access  to  the  Greenbushes  tenements.    The  lithium  Mineral  Reserves  and  Mineral Resources  and  the  tantalum  mineralization  and  related  processing  facilities  are  located  on  the  same tenements at Greenbushes.  GAM's operations are currently on care and maintenance.

Talison and GAM, through their respective subsidiaries, are party to a series of agreements entered into in connection  with  the reorganization relating to development,  production  and  operational  matters at Greenbushes.

## 1.3 Geology and Mineralization

The Greenbushes deposit lies within the Balingup Metamorphic Belt ('BMB') which forms the southern portion  of  the  Western  Gneiss  Province,  one  of  four  divisions  of  the  Archaean  Yilgarn  Craton.    The Greenbushes pegmatite intrudes rocks of the Balingup Metamorphic Belt and lies within a 15-20km wide, north to north-west trending lineament called the Donnybrook-Bridgetown Shear Zone.

The Greenbushes deposit comprises a main, rare-metal zoned pegmatite with numerous smaller pegmatite dykes and footwall pods.  These are concentrated within shear zones running on the boundaries of granofels, ultramafic schists and amphibolites.  The pegmatite body is 5km in length, up to 300m wide, strikes north to north-west and dips moderately to steeply west to southwest.

The primary ore minerals are found in specific mineralogical zones or assemblages.  The Lithium Zone is enriched  in  spodumene.    Tantalum  (tantalite)  and  tin  (cassiterite)  mineralization  is  concentrated  in  the Sodium  Zone  which  is  characterized  by  albite,  tourmaline  and  muscovite.    A  third  zone,  of  lesser commercial importance, contains concentrations of microcline.

The geology of the Greenbushes deposit is reasonably well understood and the data used to estimate the Mineral Resource has been checked and validated.

## 1.4 Mineral Resources

Mineral Resource estimation was performed by Quantitative Group Pty Ltd ('QG') of Perth, WA, using Ordinary  Kriging  ('OK'),  with  each  variable  being  estimated  independently.    Mineral  Resource  block models were prepared for the Central Lode C3, C2 and C1 areas of the Greenbushes Lithium Operations.

The Mineral Resources total 118.4 million ('M') tonnes ('t') at 2.4% lithium oxide ('Li O'), 7.1Mt lithium 2 carbonate equivalent ('LCE') of combined Measured and Indicated Mineral Resource; and 2.1Mt at 2.0% Li O , 0.1Mt LCE, of Inferred Mineral Resource at a 0.7% Li O  domain boundary grade, as summarized in 2 2 Table  1.1.    The  majority  of  the  Mineral  Resources  lie  adjacent  to  the  Central  Lode  Pit  3  ('C3  pit')  and Central Lode Pit 1 ('C1 pit').

Notes:

Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves are reported as at September 30, 2012. The Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves estimates forming the basis of the above tables remain current at the time of this report.

BDA considers the mine design for the open pits to be appropriate and the mining schedule achievable.  The estimated  mine  recovery  and  dilution  factors  appear reasonable.    Overall  BDA  considers  the  Proven  and Probable  Mineral  Reserves  to  be  an  appropriate  representation  of  the  recoverable  tonnes  and  grade  and suitable for use in financial modelling of the project.

## 1.6 Processing

Talison's lithium processing operations at Greenbushes include a crushing plant under a license agreement, two  processing  plants  and  associated  administrative,  workshop,  laboratory  and  other  infrastructure,  all located adjacent to the open pit mining operation.  Lithium ore treatment commenced at the site in 19841985 and has been expanded progressively since that time to its current capacity of about 1,500,000tpa of ore feed yielding approximately 740,000tpa of lithium concentrates.  The two plants, the Technical Grade Plant ('TGP') and the Chemical Grade Plant ('CGP'), produce mineral concentrates containing a range of lithium  grades  with  varying  iron  impurity  levels.    Low  iron  technical  grade  ('TG')  lithium  products  are produced  in  the  TGP;  chemical  grade  ('CG')  lithium  products  which  contain  higher  levels  of  iron  are produced  in  the  CGP.    The  main  usage  for  low  iron  products  is  as  feedstock  for  the  glass  and  ceramic industries.    The  CG  products  are  mostly  supplied  to  lithium  chemical  converters.    In  the  financial  year ('FY') 2012, approximately 785,000t of ore was processed to produce 357,000t of lithium concentrates.

For the first 3  months of FY 2013, approximately 331,900t of ore was processed to produce 126,500t of lithium concentrates.

## 1.7 Economic Analysis

BDA  considers  that  Talison's  financial  model  for  the  Greenbushes  Lithium  Operations  provides  a reasonable projection of future performance.  Over the life of mine ('LOM') of 24 years, Talison projects that  61.5Mt  of  ore  will  be  processed  to  produce  22.2Mt  of  lithium  products;  the  LOM  capital  costs  are projected to total Australian dollars ('A$') 201M, of which plant expansions and sustaining capital comprise 68% and 21%, respectively. Projected operating costs over the LOM are generally lower than recent actual operating  costs  as  rates  of  production  are  expected  to  be  higher  and  economies  of  scale  achieved. Projections  for  revenue  are  based  on  the  updated  Mineral  Resource  and  Mineral  Reserve  estimates, increasing the utilisation of the current expanded production capacity over the next few years and a further

expansion  of  the  CGP  in  FY  2018  and  on  lithium  concentrate  prices  which  reflect  Talison's  supply  and demand scenarios and Talison's current view of future exchange rates.

Talison has forecast that cash flow before income tax over the LOM will total A$2,920M and that the net present  value  ('NPV')  of  the  Greenbushes  Lithium  Operation  before  income  tax  and  applying  a  real discount  rate  of  9%  is  A$1,043M.    The  operation  is  most  sensitive  to  variations  in  lithium  concentrate prices.

The Greenbushes Lithium Operations have a history of reliable production of lithium products over more than 25 years.  Talison's projections of future production levels include progressive increases in the tonnes of lithium concentrate produced.  These increases are justified by market research which predicts continued growth in consumption of lithium driven primarily by the lithium secondary (rechargeable) battery market.

## 1.8 Development Potential

There is potential to further increase Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves at the Greenbushes Lithium Operations.    Lithium  mineralization  occurs  adjacent  to  the  designed  C3,  C2  and  C1  areas.    Potential extensions to Mineral Resources exist to the south, east, and north-east of the current mining areas, and at depth below the C3 area.

## 1.9 Recommendations

QG recommends that Talison:

-  Continues to investigate the processes for determining the iron content of the spodumene;
-  Continues to upgrade the drilling sampling and assay procedures to improve both grade and mineral quality boundaries data.
-  Continues to improve the grade control procedures to minimize the risk of dilution to feed for the TGP; and

The cost of the programs outlined above is not considered significant and Talison has indicated that they can be funded from operating cash flow.

## 2 INTRODUCTION

Talison  acquired  the  Greenbushes  Lithium  Operations  comprising  real  property,  mining  tenements, intellectual  property,  goodwill,  contracts,  and  plant  and  equipment,  including  two  lithium  ore  treatment plants, three open pit mines, and associated infrastructure at Greenbushes in south-west WA (Figure 2) in 2010 upon completion of the reorganization of the lithium and tantalum businesses previously held by the Talison  Minerals  Group.    Talison  owns  the  Greenbushes  Lithium  Operations  through  its  wholly-owned subsidiary companies TLA, Talison Services and Talison Minerals.  Details of the corporate structure are set out in Section 24 - Other Relevant Data and Information.

## 4 PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION

## 4.1 Location

Talison produces lithium mineral products from its operations at Greenbushes approximately 250km south of Perth, at latitude 33° 52´ S and longitude 116° 04´ E, and 90km south-east of the Port of Bunbury, a major bulk handling port in the southwest of WA (Figure 1).

The Greenbushes Lithium Operations are in close proximity to the Greenbushes town site located in the Shire of Bridgetown-Greenbushes (population 4,200).

Greenbushes has a population of approximately 450 people and is serviced by the larger town of Bridgetown (population  2,300).    Greenbushes  is  connected  to  the  regional  centre  of  Bunbury  by  the  South  Western Highway.

About 55% of the Greenbushes tenements held by Talison are covered by State Forest which is under the authority of the WA Department of Environment and Conservation ('DEC').  The majority of the remaining land is Private Land which covers about 40% of the surface rights.  The remaining ground comprises Crown Land, Road Reserves and other miscellaneous reserves.

## 4.2 Mineral Tenure

The  mineral  tenements  are  held  and  controlled  by  Talison  in  the  Greenbushes  area.    Table  4.1  lists  and Figure 2 shows the mineral tenements held and controlled by Talison.

Notes:

G01/01 and G01/02 are linked to Mining Lease M01/16 and are General Purpose Leases; 'G' denotes General Purpose Lease; 'L' denotes Miscellaneous Licence, 'M' denotes Mining Lease; 'P' denotes Prospecting Licence.

The  tenements  include mining  leases, prospecting licence application, general purpose leases and miscellaneous  licences.    These  are  registered  with  mining  registrars  located  in  the  State  of  WA.    The tenements have been surveyed and constituted under the Mining Act 1978 (WA) (the 'Mining Act').  The tenements total approximately 10,000 hectares ('ha') and cover the historic Greenbushes tin, tantalum and current lithium mining areas.  The mining leases entitle the tenement holder to work and mine the land (see Section  5.3).    The  operating  lithium  mining  and  processing  plant  area  covers  about  2,000ha  comprising Mining Leases M01/06, M01/07 and M01/16.  Talison holds the mining rights for all lithium minerals on these tenements, while GAM holds the mining rights to all minerals other than lithium through a reserved mineral rights agreement dated November 13, 2009.  The areas containing the crusher, tantalum primary and secondary plants on Talison's tenements are to be sub-leased to GAM for its tantalum operations.  Talison does not hold any exploration tenements in the Greenbushes area as these have been converted previously to mining leases.

Mining Leases M01/06, M01/07 and M01/16 contain the entire Measured, Indicated and Inferred Mineral Resource and all lithium mining activities, including tailings storage, processing plant, open pits and waste rock dumps, are currently carried out within the boundaries of Mining Leases M01/06, M01/07 and M01/16 plus General Purpose Leases G01/01 and G01/02.

GAM is the registered  applicant  of  P70/1562  which  will  be  transferred  to  Talison  upon  it  being  granted pursuant to the lithium business sales agreement dated November 13, 2009.

In  order  to  keep  the  current  granted  tenements  in  good  standing,  Talison  is  required  to  spend  a  yearly minimum expenditure of A$1.02M for all the permits.  Annual rates of A$48,930 and rent of A$153,936 are also payable to the Shires of Bridgetown-Greenbushes and Donnybrook-Balingup, and the WA Department of  Mines  and  Petroleum  ('DMP'),  respectively.    Further,  a  condition  of  grant  of  a  mining  lease  is  the lodging  of  environmental  bonds.    Currently  the  total  of  bonds  lodged  with  DMP  for  the  Greenbushes tenements to be held by Talison is A$3.91M.

## 4.3 Other Surrounding Mineral Tenements

There  are  four  surrounding  tenements  in  which  neither  Talison  nor  GAM  have  any  interests.    These tenements are Exploration Licences for the exploration of bauxite and diamonds by companies not associated with Talison or GAM.  The four tenements are ELA70/3313, E70/3407, E70/3622 and E70/3473.

## 4.4 Royalties

In  WA,  a  royalty  of  5%  of  the  royalty  value  of  lithium  concentrate  sales  is  payable  for  lithium  mineral production  as  prescribed  under  the  Mining  Act.    The  royalty  value  is  the  difference  between  the  gross invoice value of the sale and the allowable deductions on the sale.  The gross invoice value of the sale is the Australian dollar value obtained by multiplying the amount of the mineral sold by the price of the mineral as shown in the invoice.  Allowable deductions are any costs in Australian dollars incurred for transport of the mineral quantity by the seller after the shipment date.  For minerals exported from Australia, the shipment date is deemed to be the date on which the ship or aircraft transporting the minerals first leaves port in WA.

Talison has advised BDA that no private royalties apply to the Greenbushes property.

## 4.5 Access

Access  to  the  Greenbushes  mine  is  via  the  sealed  South  Western  Highway  between  Bunbury  and Bridgetown to the Greenbushes Township and via Maranup Ford Road to the Greenbushes mine.

## 4.6 Permits

Mining and mineral processing activities at the Greenbushes Lithium Operations operate under a number of State Government  approvals  under  the  Environmental  Protection  Act  1986  (WA)  ('Environmental Protection Act') and the Mining Act.

The Greenbushes mine is operated under a number of approvals, and variations to these approvals have been granted over a period of time.  The mining Notice of Intent ('NOI') dated April 1991 (Gwalia Consolidated, 1991)  is  the  main  development  approval  which  provides  for  current  lithium  and  tantalum  production activities  at  Greenbushes.    A  subsequent  mining  NOI  dated  August  2000  (Department  of  Minerals  and Energy, 2000) was approved for underground mining on Mining Lease 01/06.

Various  Works  Approvals  under  the  Environmental  Protection  Act  have  also  been  granted  over  time  to provide for various process plant upgrades.  Greenbushes also operates under an Environment Protection Licence  (No.  L4247/1991/12)  which  was  issued  by  the  Department  of  Environment  and  Conservation ('DEC') under the Environmental Protection Act.

Other WA State legislation relevant to Greenbushes' mine operations includes:

-  Dangerous Goods Safety (Explosives) Regulations 2007
-  Environmental Protection Act
-  Dangerous Goods Safety Act 2004
-  Environmental Protection Regulations 1987
-  Clean Air Regulations 1983
-  Environmental Protection (Noise) Regulations 1997

-  Local Government Act 1995
-  Rights in Water and Irrigation Regulations 2000
-  Rights in Water and Irrigation Act 1914
-  Soil and Land Conservation Act 1945
-  Conservation and Land Management Act 1984
-  Town Planning &amp; Development Act 1928

Talison  has  achieved  accreditation  by  Bureau  Veritas  for  International  Standards  ISO  9001:2008  Quality Management System Requirements and ISO 14001:2004 Environmental Management System Requirements.

## 4.7 Environmental Liabilities

The Greenbushes mining leases held by Talison cover State Forest (managed by the DEC) and privately owned land near Greenbushes.  Mining in the area has been carried out for over 100 years leaving a legacy of  areas  that  current  operators  are  required  to  rehabilitate.    Rehabilitation  programs  for  historical  and inactive  mining  sites  are  being  managed  with  the  assistance  of  local  regulators.    Relinquishment  of rehabilitation liability criteria has been established with regulators and requires Talison to re-establish a selfsustaining native forest while maintaining recreation, conservation, landscape and hydrology objectives.

Talison  is  finalizing  the  relinquishment  of  rehabilitation  liability  criteria  for  approximately  650ha  of rehabilitated mine workings with the intent of returning these areas to be managed as part of State Forest. Rehabilitation is monitored annually by assessing the variety of species and the density of plants growing in the area.

Each year, as part of its annual environmental reporting to regulators, Talison is required to calculate site mine  closure  costs.    The  closure  (rehabilitation  liability)  cost  estimate  is  A$16.82M  based  on  the  2012 disturbed  areas  totalling  1,808ha  covering  infrastructure  areas,  tailings  storage  facilities,  overburden  and waste  rock  dumps  and  open  pits  as  reported  in  the  2011-2012  Annual  Environmental  Review  Report (Talison, 2012).

## 5 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE AND PHYSIOGRAPHY

## 5.1 Topography, Elevation and Vegetation

The  Greenbushes  site  is  situated  approximately  300m  AMSL.    The  operations  area  lies  on  the  Darling Plateau and is dominated by a broad ridgeline which runs from the Greenbushes township (310m) towards the south-east (270m) with the open pits located along this ridgeline (300m).  The current operating waste rock dump is located on an east facing hill slope which descends to 266m and adjoins the South Western Highway, while the process plant area is located on the west facing hill slope which descends to 245m. The tailings storage areas are located south of the mining and plant areas at 265m.

The Greenbushes area has a temperate climate that is described as mild Mediterranean, with distinct summer and winter seasons.  The mean minimum temperatures range from 4°C to 12°C, while the mean maximum temperatures range from 16°C to 30°C.  The hottest month is January (mean maximum temperature 30ºC), while the coldest month is August (mean minimum temperature 4ºC).

There is a distinct rainfall pattern for winter, with most of the rain occurring between May and October.  The area  averages  about  970  millimetres  ('mm')  per  annum  with  a  range  of  about  610mm  to  1,680mm  per annum.  The evaporation rate for the area is calculated at approximately 1,190mm per annum.

The area is surrounded by vegetation broadly described as open Jarrah/Marri forest with a comparatively open understorey.

Mining and processing operations at Greenbushes operate throughout the year.

## 5.2 Access to the Property

Access to the Greenbushes Lithium Operations is via the sealed South Western Highway between Bunbury and Bridgetown to the Greenbushes Township and via Maranup Ford Road to the Greenbushes mine.

## 5.3 Infrastructure

## General

Currently, operating infrastructure on site includes a crushing plant, two lithium processing plants, tailings disposal facilities, a laboratory, administrative offices, occupational health/safety/training offices, dedicated mines rescue area, stores, storage sheds, workshops and engineering offices.  The crushing plant is owned by GAM but operated by Talison under a crusher license agreement dated November 13, 2009.  There are also primary and secondary tantalum processing facilities on the Greenbushes site which are owned by GAM which are currently on care and maintenance.

Under Australian mining law, subject to the provisions of the Mining Act, the holder of a mining lease is entitled  to  work  and  mine  the  land,  take  and  remove  any  minerals  (except  iron  ore,  unless  expressly authorised by the Minister) and do all things necessary to effectively carry out mining operations in, on or under the land.  The mineral tenements held and controlled by Talison are covered in Section 4.2 - Mineral Tenure.

The Greenbushes Lithium Operations are a major employer in the region with a workforce of approximately 180 people, which includes a number of contractors.  The workforce is characterised by a diversity of skills and knowledge.  Employee training, which includes skills and competency training, is further enhanced by having  health  and  safety,  quality  management  and  an  environmental  awareness  emphasis.    Detailed descriptions of the crusher and lithium process plants are provided in Section 17 - Recovery Methods.

There  is  sufficient  storage  area  in  the  mining  leases  for  the  disposal  of  waste  and  tailings  for  the  LOM Production Plan detailed in Section 22 - Economic Analysis.

## Water Supply

The Greenbushes Lithium Operations are located in the Blackwood Valley Catchment.  Water for current mineral  processing  is  sourced  from  rainfall  and  stored  in  several  process  dams  located  on  site,  with  the majority of the water used being recovered and recycled through the water circuit.  Surface water quality is measured and reported on a monthly basis.

## Power Supply

Talison  purchases  its  power  from  Synergy  Australia  which  is  delivered  to  the  site  by  Western  Power's distribution  system  and  reticulated  and  metered  within  the  site  by  Talison.    Peak  demand  for  the  lithium operation is currently approximately 6.0 megawatt hours ('MW') while average demand is approximately 4.8MW.

## Gas Supply

Talison  uses  liquefied  petroleum  gas  ('LPG')  fired  dryers  and  other  equipment  in  the  plants  and  the laboratory.    A  total  of  approximately  952t  of  LPG  is  used  by  the  lithium  operation  annually  which  is purchased and stored on site in bulk storage facilities.

## 6 HISTORY

## 6.1 Mining History

Mining  in  the  Greenbushes  area  has  continued  almost  uninterrupted  since  tin  was  first  discovered  at Greenbushes in 1886.  Greenbushes is recognized as the longest continuously operated mine in WA.

## Tin

Since  it  was  first  discovered  at  Greenbushes  in  1886,  tin  has  been  mined  almost  continuously  in  the Greenbushes area, although in more recent times lower tin prices and the emergence of lithium and tantalum as  major  revenue  earners  have  relegated  tin  to  the  position  of  a  by-product.    Tin  was  first  mined  at Greenbushes by the Bunbury Tin Mining Co in 1888.  However there was a gradual decline in tin production between 1914 and 1930.  Vultan Mines carried out sluicing operations of the weathered tin oxides between 1935  and  1943,  while  between  1945  and  1956  modern  earth  moving  equipment  was  introduced  and  tin dredging commenced.  Greenbushes Tin NL was formed in 1964 and open cut mining of the softer oxidized rock commenced in 1969.

## Tantalum

Tantalum mining at Greenbushes commenced in the 1940s with the advancement in electronics.  Tantalum hard-rock  operations  started  in  1992  with  an  ore  processing  capacity  of  800,000tpa.    By  the  late  1990s demand  for  tantalum  reached  all-time  highs  and  the  existing  high  grade  Cornwall  Pit  was  nearing completion.    In  order  to  meet  increasing  demand  a  decision  was  made  to  expand  the  mill  capacity  to  4 million  tonnes  per  annum  ('Mtpa')  and  develop  an  underground  mine,  to  provide  higher  grade  ore  for blending with the lower grade ore from the Central Lode pits.

An underground operation was commenced at the base of the Cornwall Pit in April 2001 to access highgrade  ore  prior  to  the  completion  of  the  available  open  pit  high-grade  resource.    In  2002,  the  tantalum market collapsed due to a slow-down in the electronics industry and subsequently the underground operation was placed on care and maintenance.  The underground operation was restarted in 2004 due to increased demand but again placed on care and maintenance the following year.  The lithium open pit operation has continued  throughout  recent  times  and  mining  is  now  focused  on  the  Central  Lode  zone.    Only  lithium minerals are currently mined from the open pits.  The tantalum mining operation and processing plants have been on care and maintenance since 2005.

## 6.2 Lithium Minerals

The mining of lithium minerals is a relatively recent event in the history of mining at Greenbushes with Greenbushes Limited commencing production of lithium minerals in 1983 and commissioned a 30,000tpa lithium mineral concentrator two years later in 1984-1985.  The lithium assets were acquired by Lithium Australia  Ltd  in  1987  and  Sons  of  Gwalia  in  1989.    Production  capacity  was  increased  to  100,000tpa  of lithium concentrate in the early 1990s and to 150,000tpa of lithium concentrate by 1997, which included the capacity to produce a lithium concentrate for the lithium chemical converter market.

The  Talison  Minerals  Group  was  incorporated  in  2007  for  the  purpose  of  acquiring  the  assets  of  the Advanced Minerals Division of Sons of Gwalia by a consortium of US private equity companies led by Resource Capital Funds.  The Talison Mineral Group's assets included the Wodgina tantalum mine located about 1,500km north of Perth and 120km south of Port Hedland in the Pilbara region of WA as well as the Greenbushes Lithium Operations.  Upon completion of the reorganization of the Talison Minerals Group in 2010, Talison acquired the Greenbushes Lithium Operations and the remainder of the assets were acquired by GAM.

There  are  two  lithium  processing  plants  that  recover  and  upgrade  the  spodumene  mineral  using  gravity, heavy media, flotation and magnetic processes into a range of products for bulk or bagged shipment. In the period 2005 to 2008, demand from the Chinese chemical producers was satisfied by using the Greenbushes primary  tantalum  plant  which  had  been  on  care  and  maintenance.    Products  from  that  plant  had  a  lower grade than preferred by the Chinese customers and were supplied as a temporary measure until Talison's lithium concentrate production capacity was increased.

In 2009, Talison's processing plants were upgraded to total nominal capacity of approximately 260,000tpa of lithium concentrates and  in late 2010  capacity was  increased to 700,000tpa  of ore feed yielding approximately 315,000tpa of lithium concentrates. The lithium TG processing plant is currently operating at

full production capacity. The CG plant was upgraded in 2011/2012 to enable processing of 1.3mtpa bringing the  total  capacity  at  the  Greenbushes  operation  to  1.5mtpa.  The  product  capacity  for  the  two  plants  is approximately 740,000tpa.

A summary of the last eight years production of ore and lithium concentrates at the Greenbushes Lithium Operations is shown in Table 6.1.

## 7 GREENBUSHES GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND MINERALISATION

## 7.1 Regional Geology

The Greenbushes area is underlain by rocks of the Balingup Metamorphic Belt ('BMB'), which forms the southern portion of the Western Gneiss Province, one of four divisions of the Yilgarn Craton in WA (Figure 3).  The BMB is bounded to the west by the Darling Fault and Phanerozoic rocks of the Perth Basin, to the south by the Proterozoic Albany-Fraser Mobile Belt, and to the east by the Hester Lineament.  It extends as far north as the Loguebrook Granite, where it is truncated by intrusions of the Darling Range Batholith.

The Greenbushes pegmatites lie within a 15-20km wide, north to northwest trending lineament known as the Donnybrook-Bridgetown  Shear  Zone,  characterised  by  sheared  gneiss,  orthogneiss,  amphibolite  and migmatite.    A  series  of  syn-tectonic  granitoid  intrusives  occur  within  the  BMB,  elongated  along  the Donnybrook-Bridgetown Shear Zone.

The  pegmatites  have  been  dated  at  approximately  2,525  million  years  ('Ma'),  and  appear  to  have  been intruded  during  shearing,  thereby  accounting  for  the  fine  grain  size  and  internal  deformation.    The pegmatites have been further affected by subsequent deformation and/or hydrothermal recrystallisation, the last episode dated at around 1,100Ma.

## 7.2 Local Geology

The  Greenbushes  deposit  consists  of  a  main,  rare-metal  zoned  pegmatite  body  with  numerous  smaller pegmatite dykes and pods in the footwall to the main body.  The pegmatites are concentrated within shear zones which form along the contact between granofels and amphibolite sequences.  The pegmatite strikes in a  north to north-westerly direction and dips moderately to steeply towards the west-southwest (Figure 4). Prominent mylonitic fabrics are developed, particularly along host rock contacts.

The mine sequence has been intruded by Proterozoic dolerite dykes and sills.  The dykes trend east-west and vary in width from a few centimetres to tens of metres.

In  general  the  hanging  wall  to  the  pegmatite  bodies  is  composed  of  amphibolite  (meta-basalt  and  subvolcanic intrusive bodies) whereas the footwall is granofels, dominantly of metasedimentary origin.  The amphibolites and dolerites contain occasional stringers and pods of sulphides such as pyrite, pyrrhotite and chalcopyrite.  Arsenopyrite and arsenolamprite (native arsenic) are noted in some areas, particularly within granofels and amphibolite inliers in the main pegmatite.  Some of the granofels is distinctly garnetiferous.

Weathering  and  erosion  of  the  pegmatites  has  produced  adjacent  alluvial  deposits  in  ancient  drainage systems.  These  are  generally  enriched  in  cassiterite.    All  rocks  have  been  extensively  lateritised  during Tertiary peneplain formation; the laterite profile locally reaches depths in excess of 40m below the original surface.

## 7.3 Pegmatite Zoning

The Greenbushes pegmatite is about 5km in length and up to 300m in width.  The pegmatite is variably deformed with low-strain areas preserving primary igneous textures, and highly strained zones exhibiting recrystallised and mylonitic fabrics.

Internally,  the  Greenbushes  pegmatite  consists  of  five  mineralogically  defined  zones:  the  Contact  Zone, Potassium Feldspar (Potassium) Zone, Albite (Sodium) Zone, Mixed Zone and Spodumene (Lithium) Zone. These are shown schematically in Figure 5, whereas in detail they display complex zoning, interfingering along strike and at depth.

The zones occur as a series of thick layers commonly with a lithium zone on the hanging wall or footwall, a potassium  feldspar  zone  towards  the  hanging  wall  and  a  number  of  central  albite  zones.    High-grade tantalum mineralisation (&gt;420ppm) is generally confined to the Albite Zone, whereas the Spodumene and Potassium Feldspar Zones generally have tantalum-tin grades below the open-cut cut-off grades.

## 7.4 Deposit Type and Origin

The Greenbushes lithium deposits  belong  to  the  Spodumene  sub-class  of  the  Lithium-Caesium-Tantalum pegmatite deposit class.  The pegmatites are hosted in a major regional structure and represent a late stage product of cooling granite magma.  Early crystallisation of the pegmatite formed albite-tourmaline zones, followed by albite,  cassiterite  and  tantalite  crystallisation.    Spodumene-quartz  assemblages  crystallised  at slightly lower temperatures, followed by formation of a potassium feldspar-rich zone in the hanging wall.

The  Greenbushes  pegmatites  are  considered  to  be  Archaean  in  age  (approximately  2,560  Ma),  intruded along  the  Donnybrook-Bridgetown  Shear,  coeval  with  a  second  phase  of  regional  deformation  with pressures of approximately 5 kilobars ('kb') and temperatures greater than 870°C.

Lithium-rich  zones  are  adjacent  to  tantalite-bearing  zones  which  have  been  mined  and  processed  in  the recent  past.  In  places  the  pegmatite  may  contain  economically  recoverable  levels  of  both  lithium  and tantalum, although more typically lithium ore is low in tantalum (&lt;100ppm Ta O ) and vice versa. 2 5

The Greenbushes pegmatite is distinguished from many other rare-metal pegmatites by:

-  not being symmetrically or truly asymmetrically zoned, and not having a quartz core
-  being formed at higher pressure/temperature, under synkinematic conditions.
-  having no indication of a parental granitoid at depth or in close proximity

## 7.5 Deposit Geometry

The Greenbushes pegmatite deposits extend over a strike length of 5km north-south, and have been subdivided for practical purposes into four sectors representing past and present open pit operations, known as (from north to south) the Cornwall (tantalum only), C3, C2 and C1 pits (Figure 4).

The C3 Pit contains the largest and highest grade lithium deposit and occurs in the upper part of a large (250m wide) lithium-enriched pegmatite.  The ore body is about 600m long and up to 100m wide, dipping at 30-80° to the west or southwest.  At the northern end of the ore body a highly felspathic zone separates the high-grade lithium zone from the hanging wall amphibolites and a dolerite sill.

Tantalum/tin and lithium mineralisation are conformable with the trends of the pegmatites both along strike and down dip.

The C1 area contains a second lithium deposit, some 500m long by 150m wide and dipping moderately to the west.  The C2 area lies between C1 and C3.  Limited mining has been undertaken in this part of the lithium-bearing  pegmatite  which  extends  for  about  600m,  varies  in  width  up  to  about  30m  and  dips moderately to the west.

## 7.6 Structure

The pegmatite body strikes north to north-westerly and dips moderately (45°-50°) to steeply (70°-80°) to the west-southwest.  The high-grade lodes within the main pegmatite body also exhibit variable dips from 30°80° towards the west-southwest.

Shear structures observed in the pegmatites are most strongly developed at pegmatite margins and within albite rich zones.  Foliation fabrics of variable intensity have developed within the pegmatite as a result of this  shearing.    Host  rock  greenstones  also  exhibit  foliation  fabrics,  which  are  generally  conformable  to layering observed within the pegmatites.  The orientations of shear fabrics are sub-parallel to the regional Donnybrook-Bridgetown Shear Zone.

North of the main lithium mineralization are asymmetric macro folds which post-date mylonisation of the albite zone and pre-date or are synchronous with later stages of crystallisation.  Dilatant zones formed in the footwall albite zone during folding were infiltrated by late-stage fluids and provide the focus for a second stage of mineralization.  The evidence appears to confirm that the pegmatite intrusion was synchronous with the formation of the Donnybrook-Bridgetown Shear Zone.

## 7.7 Mineralisation

## Mineralogical Zones

Continuity of lithium mineralization at +1% Li O is demonstrated from block model estimates to be over 2 2km  from  the  south  of  the  C1  area  to  beyond  the  north  of  the  C3  area.    A  narrowing  of  lithium mineralization occurs in the southern end of the C2 area. At +2.5% Li O, the lithium body breaks into a 2 490m zone in the C1 area and a 1,280m zone covering the C3 area.

Internally, the Greenbushes pegmatite consists of five mineralogically defined zones: the Contact Zone, the K-feldspar  (Potassium)  Zone,  the  Albite  (Sodium)  Zone,  the  Mixed  Zone  and  the  Spodumene  (Lithium) Zone.  These are shown schematically in Figure 5.

The zones occur as a series of thick layers commonly with a Lithium Zone on the hangingwall or footwall, K-feldspar  towards  the  hanging  wall  and  a  number  of  central  Albite  Zones.    High-grade  tantalum mineralization  (&gt;420  grams  per  tonne)  is  generally  confined  to  the  Albite  Zone  within  the  deposit. Characteristics of each of the zones are summarized in Table 7.1.

Recent exploration drilling in 2011/12 has tested some nearby pegmatite targets to the east and south of the current  mining  areas,  but  indicated  limited  potential  for  additional  high  grade  lithium  mineralisation. Opportunities to expand the lithium resource base appear to be focussed on the main pegmatite zone, with the deposits open along strike and partly open at depth.

## 7.8 Mineralogy

Major  minerals  and  approximate  abundances  in  the  Greenbushes  pegmatite  are  quartz  28%,  spodumene 26%, albite 23%, potassium feldspar 20%, tourmaline 1%, mica 1% and apatite 0.5%.

## Lithium

Table 7.2 summarizes  the main  lithium minerals associated with the economic  mineralization at Greenbushes.  The main lithium minerals are spodumene (approximately 8% Li O) and varieties kunzite and 2 hiddenite.  Minor to trace minerals include lepidolite mica, and amblygonite and lithiophilite (phosphates). The iron-bearing species hiddenite appears to increase towards the south of the deposit, with the C1 area having the highest proportions.  Lithium is strongly leached in the weathering environment and is virtually non-existent  in  weathered  pegmatite.    Lithium  grade  decreases  towards  the  footwall  of  the  high-grade Lithium Zone.  The higher lithium grade ore generally consists of 50% quartz and 50% spodumene, having a Li O grade of around 4%. 2

## Tantalum

Tantalum  and  niobium  occur  mainly  as  columbo-tantalite  and  in  numerous  trace  tantalum  minerals. Columbo-tantalite grains commonly have Ta-rich cores and more Nb-rich rims.  Grains are generally less than  350  microns  ('µm').    Columbo-tantalite  occurs  as  elongate  blebs  or  crystals  chiefly  at  the  grain boundaries  of  quartz/albite,  albite/mica  and  K-feldspar/spodumene.    The  Ta:Nb  ratio  is  typically  2:1. Mineral species include microlite, stibiotantalite, ilmenotantalite, manganotantalite and tapiolite.  Tantalum is associated with the Albite Zones.

## Sodium

The main sodium mineral is albite feldspar (approximately 12% sodium oxide ('Na O')).  The Albite Zones 2 may assay up to around 11% Na O, averaging 6-7% (approximately 50-60% albite).  Grain size is generally 2

medium to coarse (up to 5 centimetres ('cm')).  Albite is associated with quartz, tourmaline and apatite. There is prevalence for Ta on albite grain boundaries, and the highest grades of tantalum occur in the Albite Zone.

Average Na2O content in the Central Lode is around 2.5-3.5%, increasing towards the footwall.  High grades of lithium ore (&gt;4% Li O) generally contain &lt;5% albite.  Lower grades of lithium ore (3.6-4% Li O) contain 2 2 up to 10% albite.  Contacts between albite and other mineralogical zones are generally transitional.

## Phosphorus

This occurs primarily in the form of apatite (approximately 42% phosphorus oxide (P O )) and associated 2 5 minerals such as fluorapatite, occurring mainly in Albite Zones, and as blue apatite in the Kfeldspar/Spodumene  Zones.    Central  Lode  contains  0.3-0.5%  P O   overall  whereas  lithium  ore  itself 2 5 generally contains &lt;0.1% P O . 2 5

## Potassium

The  primary  potassium  minerals  are  K-feldspar  (approximately  17%  potassium  oxide  (K O))  and  mica. 2 Assays of up to 12% K O have been recorded, representing 70% K-feldspar. 2

## Tin

Cassiterite is the dominant tin mineral at Greenbushes occurring in grains of up to 50mm and at about twice the average tantalum content.

## 7.9 Conclusions

The geology and mineralisation controls at  Greenbushes  are  well  understood, based  on  a  long  history  of mining. The Greenbushes pegmatite body remains open at depth and along strike, and there are prospective near-mine exploration targets in the footwall of the main pegmatite.  However, there would appear to be limited exploration potential in the remainder of the district.

## 8 DEPOSIT TYPES

The following discussion is relevant to the formation of the pegmatite mineral deposit type at Greenbushes and to the geological concepts used in the description and definition of the Greenbushes lithium Mineral Resource.

Conventional  fractional  crystallisation  processes  operating  in  granite  melts  concentrate  incompatible elements, light ion lithophile elements and volatiles into the late-stage melt phase.  This process can form a marginal  leucocratic  granite  or  pegmatitic  granite  phase  enriched  in  these  incompatible  elements.    Such marginal  phases  typically  occur  at  the  top  of  granite  intrusions  and  are  termed  apogranites.    Late  stage volatile-enriched fluids can also form internal and external greisen zones, typically tin-rich with associated tantalum  (Ta)  and  niobium  (Nb)  mineralization.    Concentration  of  incompatible  elements  in  a  melt  (e.g. lithium (Li), phosphorus (P), fluorine (F), boron (B), rubidium (Rb) and caesium (Cs)) has a fluxing effect, enabling the melt to remain as a low viscosity liquid at very low temperatures (350ºC to 400ºC).

This allows fractional crystallisation to proceed to extreme levels, with pegmatites as the end-member of this process.    Highly  fractionated  pegmatites  can  be  found  up  to  10km  from  the  parent  granite,  and  are themselves categorised into various sub-types according to their degree of fractionation and parent protolith.

The parent protolith and evolved granite has a bearing on the final chemistry of the daughter pegmatites, with  a  broad  characterisation  based  upon  this  relationship  distinguishing  between  the  Lithium-CaesiumTantalum  ('LCT')  family  and  the  Rare  Earth  Element  ('REE')  enriched  Niobium-Yttrium-Fluorine ('NYF') family (Cerny, 1993a; Cerny and Ercit, 2005).  The broad LCT-NYF characterization is important to  consider  as  it  has  a  strong  bearing  upon  the  prospectivity  of  a  pegmatite  for  certain  commodities  and mineralization styles.  Table 8.1 outlines this broad pegmatite classification.

Note:

The Greenbushes lithium deposits belong to the Spodumene sub-class of the LCT pegmatite deposit class. The pegmatites are hosted in a major regional structure and represent a late stage product of cooling granite magma.  Early crystallisation of the pegmatite formed albite-tourmaline zones, followed by albite, cassiterite and  tantalite  crystallisation.    Spodumene-quartz  assemblages  crystallised  at  slightly  lower  temperatures, followed by formation of a potassium feldspar-rich zone in the hanging wall.

Lithium-rich zones are spatially related to tantalite-bearing zones which have been mined and processed in the  recent  past.    In  places  pegmatite  may  contain  economically  recoverable  levels  of  both  lithium  and tantalum, although more typically lithium ore is low in tantalum (&lt;100 parts per million Ta O ). 2 5

The Greenbushes pegmatite is distinguished from many other rare-metal pegmatites by:

-  not being symmetrically or truly asymmetrically zoned, and not having a quartz core;
-  being formed at higher pressure/temperature, under synkinematic conditions.
-  having no indication of a parental granitoid at depth or in close proximity; and

## 9 EXPLORATION

Exploration in the Greenbushes district dates back to the 19th century with the discovery of cassiterite in 1886.  Early production came from alluvial deposits of tin and tantalite.  Spodumene was first identified in 1949.  The extent of the pegmatite outcrop was masked by laterite cap rock and alluvium.  Development of tantalum markets stimulated exploration and mining of the pegmatite and the identification of a complexly zoned  body  enriched  in  tin,  tantalum  and  lithium.    Modern  exploration  relevant  to  the  current  lithium operations and Mineral Resources has been undertaken since the mid-1980s.  A number of operators have been involved, including Talison, Sons of Gwalia, Gwalia Consolidated Limited, Lithium Australia Limited and Greenbushes Limited.

The primary target for exploration since the 1970s has been extensions to the tantalum mineralization, with the  lithium-rich  zones  being  defined  and  extended  during  this  work.    Resource  development  for  the  two commodities often occurred within the same mining area.

A major review of previous exploration data in 2004 was followed by a work program of surface mapping and  airborne  geophysics  primarily  directed  at  building  exploration  models  for  tantalum  targets  but  also providing insight into lithium potential.  The mapping and compilation work was carried out by in-house geologists  with  assistance  in  database  manipulation,  and  in  geophysical  data  collection  and  reduction  by contractors as outlined below.

The Greenbushes pegmatite  was  mapped  at  a  scale  of  1:1,000,  using  an  orthophoto  image  and  surveyed topographic data as a base.  The geological mapping aimed to show the geometry and contact relationships of the main pegmatite and other smaller pegmatites, the internal mineralogical zoning in the main pegmatite and superimposed structural features.  Structural measurements, including contacts, foliation and lineation, were taken during the mapping program.

Geological mapping shows the overall form of the Greenbushes pegmatite to be several lens-shaped pods joined by thinner dyke-like links.  The thicker pods of pegmatite are arranged in a left stepping en echelon series, and the thin linking sections of pegmatites define S-shaped asymmetric folds where they link with the pods.  Thin linking sections of the Greenbushes pegmatite are exposed in the Cornwall and C2 pits shown in Figure 4.  Towards the north, there are increasingly numerous, thinner pegmatite dykes in the footwall of the main Greenbushes pegmatite.

The Greenbushes pegmatite is mineralogically zoned along strike and across strike.  Across strike zoning is best developed in the thicker pods of pegmatite where spodumene-rich lithium zones form the cores of the pods.  Lithium zones are generally quite 'clean', and comprised of quartz+albite+spodumene with little or no  dark-coloured  minerals.    The  lithium  zones  are  enveloped  by  sodium  zones  comprising  saccharoidal albite and quartz with variable amounts of tourmaline and apatite ± minor spodumene and mica.  Alongstrike zonation is defined by the relative abundance of tourmaline and the development of quartz-rich layers. The quartz zone is only found at the southern end of the C1 pit (Figure 4).  This is interpreted as the least fractioned part of the Greenbushes pegmatite.  There is an overall increase in the degree of fractionation from south to north in the Greenbushes pegmatite.

An aeromagnetic survey, commissioned by Sons of Gwalia was flown in April 2004, over the entire lease area, by contracting company Fugro Airborne Surveys. Survey lines were 50m apart and the flight height was 50m, except over the Greenbushes town site where survey height was up to 150m.  Radiometric data were  collected  simultaneously  with  magnetic  data.    The  data  were  gridded  and  several  images,  showing potassium, thorium, uranium, total magnetic intensity, and the first and second derivatives of total magnetic intensity  were  provided.  A  geological  interpretation  of  the  magnetic  images,  at  a  scale  of  1:25,000  was completed.  Radiometric images appear to be strongly influenced by the regolith. Thorium, and to a lesser extent uranium, are strongly influenced by topography with a strong response between approximately 200 and 250m AMSL.  Thorium anomalies are concentrated in two main bands on either side of the &gt;250m AMSL ridge on which the Greenbushes pegmatite is exposed.  These relationships suggest that thorium and uranium may be concentrated in a lateritic layer, which has been stripped (or did not form) at higher and lower topographic heights.  The Greenbushes pegmatite gives a strong potassium response but there are also potassium  responses  over  areas  of  exposed  granite  and  felsic  gneiss.    An  association  between  potassium response and drainage suggests that exposure of bedrock due to weathering strongly influences the nature of this radiometric image.

A composite grade control and exploration sampling geochemical database was built containing lithium and the  36  elements  from  X-Ray  Fluorescence  ('XRF')  scans  carried  out  at  the  Greenbushes  analytical

laboratory.  The Greenbushes laboratory provided the results of all data collected from 1995 to 2003.  The data of geological interest containing sample numbers and a full set of assay results were extracted into an ACCESS  data  base  by  contactor  company  Terra  Search  Proprietary  Limited.    Duplicate  records  were removed and exploration and grade control files merged for use in Leapfrog and DataDesk software.

Internal geochemical zoning of the pegmatite was investigated using Leapfrog.  An anisotropy that reflects the average west dip of the Greenbushes pegmatite was applied to the analysis.  In summary, the distribution of Li O highlights the concentration in the spodumene-rich lithium zones in the C3 area.  There is a strong 2 antipathetic relationship between Li O and Ta O .  The high-grade Ta O  ore lies in the hanging wall of the 2 2 5 2 5 lithium zone and lower grade Ta O  ore is produced from beneath the lithium zone in the C3 area. 2 5

This work has provided the basis for subsequent exploration programs at Greenbushes.  The geochemical model  built  from  surface  and  drill  hole  analyses  has  produced  indices  showing  magmatic  fractionation trends guiding exploration to the most prospective targets.

While  surface  exploration  has  proven  useful  in  locating  pegmatite  bodies,  weathering  and  associated leaching means that economic lithium mineralization does not occur at surface.  Consequently, diamond and reverse circulation ('RC') percussion drilling have been the primary tools in developing the lithium Mineral Resources.

Several  exploration  and  resource  development  opportunities  are  available  to  extend  and  upgrade  lithium Mineral Resources in the currently defined pegmatite structure.

The lithium Mineral Resources within the Greenbushes pegmatite are constrained by domain boundaries at approximately 0.7% Li O.  These boundaries are based on an interpretation of population statistics and yield 2 Mineral  Resource  grades  that  are  consistent  with  future  processing  requirements.  Lower  grade  lithium mineralization  occurs  outside  these  domain  boundary  constraints  and  is  not  included  in  the  Mineral Resources.

Preliminary  block-modelling  of  pegmatites  above  950mRL  and  outside  the  current  Mineral  Resource outlines  suggests  exploration  potential  exists  for  lower  grade  lithium  mineralization.  This  lower  grade mineralization is potentially within reach of a surface mining operation.  QG notes that these are conceptual targets.  There has been insufficient exploration to define a lithium Mineral Resource in these areas and it is uncertain if further exploration will result in the delineation of the targeted mineralization.

## 10 DRILLING

## 10.1 Drilling Programs

Diamond  and  RC  drilling  for  definition  of  lithium  Mineral  Resources  and  Mineral  Reserves  within  the pegmatite  has  been  undertaken  typically  on  50m  or  locally  25m  spaced  cross-sections.    Drill  patterns  in recent programs have been less regular in some areas due to mining activities which restrict access to some sectional drill sites.  This work has been undertaken in staged programs by several companies over the past 32 years.

The results of these drilling programs form the building blocks of the continuously improving interpretation of the geological solid models and geostatistical domains in the Mineral Resource model. The assay results from the drill samples are the basis for composite files used in Mineral Resource estimates.

Drill holes are generally sited on the hanging wall side of the mineralization and drilled vertically or to the east to intersect the pegmatite bodies as close to normal to the dip as possible, thereby providing nearly true thickness intersections.

The  pegmatite  and  lithium  zone  geometries  are  described  in  Section  7  -  Geological  Setting  and Mineralization. Considering the relationship between drill hole and lithium zone orientations in the C3 area, a  typical  drill  pattern  would  drill  east  at  a  declination  from  the  horizontal  of  minus  60º.  At  an  average lithium zone dip of minus 50º to the west, the drill intersection would be approximately 6% longer than the true thickness of the mineralization. In the cases where site conditions necessitate drilling vertically, the drill intersection  would  be  approximately  60%  longer  than  the  true  thickness  of  the  mineralization.  In  the  C3 area, 65% of the holes have been drilled between minus 50º and minus 70º declination from the horizontal, and 26% drilled between minus 80º and vertically.

Considering the orientation relationships in the C1 area, where the average dip of the lithium mineralization is interpreted to be approximately minus 30º to the west, drill holes directed east at a declination from the horizontal of minus 60º intersect the mineralization at approximately true thickness. Holes drilled vertically have intersections approximately 15% longer than the true thickness. In the C1 area, 44% of the holes are drilled at or near minus 60º declination from the horizontal, and 56% of the holes are drilled at or near the vertical.

Available records in the Greenbushes database for the earlier drilling programs are more limited than for drilling completed since 2000.

A total of 753 surface drill holes totalling 107,910m of drilling are contained in the Greenbushes database, defining the lithium Mineral Resources and enclosing pegmatite.  These are made up of 314 diamond holes (57,228m) and 439 RC holes (50,682m).  A further 229 underground Mineral Resource holes are in the database, targeting high-grade underground tantalum mineralization.

A summary of surface drill holes in the Greenbushes database and available for lithium Mineral Resource estimation is provided in Table 10.1. The surface drill hole collar locations are shown in Figure 6, and in long section in Figure 7.

Note:

The most recent RC and diamond drilling programs were undertaken for lithium Mineral Resources in 2011 and  2012  and  are  described  in  the  section  below.    The  programs  tested  the  lithium  Mineral  Resource distribution  and  extensions  in  the  Greenbushes  main  pegmatite  lode  and  flanking  footwall  pegmatite structures. Diamond drilling was contracted to Westcore using a LF90D Longyear rig; and RC drilling to SBD Drilling using Schramm T685WS and Explorac220 RC rigs, and to Action Drilling using an Atlas S8 rig.

For  the  RC  drilling  a  5.5  inch  diameter  hole  was  drilled  using  a  4.5  inch  diameter  rod  string  and  facesampling hammer.  A total of 12,802.3m were completed in 67 holes including 9100m in exclusively RC drill holes, 574.1m in exclusively diamond drill holes, and 3128.2m in RC holes with diamond drill tails. Samples from the RC drilling were collected every metre through a face sampling hammer, cyclone and riffle splitter system.  Limited groundwater exists and the RC samples were typically dry.

All  holes  were  logged  using  the  standard  Greenbushes  logging  templates.    Collars  were  surveyed  by  the mining surveyor and down-hole surveys run by the drilling company using a gyroscopic or Reflex survey

tool.    All  of  the  above  information  is  captured  in  the  site  acQuire  Technology  Solutions  Pty  Limited ('acQuire') database.  Generally sample recoveries are reported to have been excellent.

The data collection processes described above are typical of drilling programs since 2000.

## 2011-12 Drilling Programs

Since the last resource model update in 2011 two mine drilling programs have been completed. The programs increased  the  volume  of  the  pegmatite  bodies,  improved  interpretation  of  structures  and  increased  the confidence of block model grade estimation.

In late 2011 and early 2012 the Greenbushes main pegmatite lode and flanking footwall pegmatite structures were further tested with RC and diamond drilling programs. The objective was to increase Mineral Resources and  Mineral  Reserves  at  Greenbushes  to  increase  the  mine  life  and  support  the  long  term  operation  of  a Mineral  Conversion  Plant  treating  Greenbushes  lithium  ores.  Translation  of  Mineral  Resource  to  Mineral Reserve  tonnes  in  the  2011  Mineral  Resource  was  about  43%  indicating  that  with  more  favourable optimisation input parameters there was significant potential to expand Mineral Reserves from the existing Mineral  Resource.  In  addition,  there  remained  areas  in  the  current  geological  interpretation  where  the pegmatite volume could be better defined and the lithium Mineral Resource improved with targeted drilling. More exploratory lithium targets outside the main pegmatite structure also required better definition to assess their Mineral Resource potential.

The targeted Mineral Reserve expansion from the drilling programs was expected to result from both the upgraded  Mineral  Resource  after  drilling  and  from  improved  economic  and  scheduling  parameters  in  the optimisation and design process supporting the planned production increases in the strategic plan.

To assist with drill targeting, and to provide an preliminary indication of the impact on Mineral Reserves of revised input parameters in the pit optimisation process, a series of Whittle pit optimisations had been run on the  2011  Mineral  Resource  model.  The  outcome  produced  a  pit  shell  with  the  dominant  change  in  shape compared to the 2011 pit design being in the C2 area and the southern to mid-section of C3.

A total  of  12,802m  were  completed  in  67  holes  including  9,100m  in  exclusively  RC  drill  holes,  574m  in exclusively  diamond  drill  holes,  and  3,128m  in  RC  holes  with  diamond  drill  tails.  Diamond  drilling  was contracted  to  Westcore  using  a  LF90D  Longyear  rig;  and  RC  drilling  to  SBD  Drilling  using  Schramm T685WS and Explorac220RC rigs, and to Action Drilling using an Atlas S8 rig. The collar locations are shown in Figure 6.

Drilling data collection in the field includes geological logging, visual estimation of sample recovery, and sample collection by means of rotating cone or riffle splitter in accord with industry best practice QA/QC methods. These practices have been followed at Greenbushes for some years and are part of mine geological standard work procedures.

For the 2012 Mineral Resource model the additional 12,802m of drilling in the C1, C2 and C3 areas has extended the lithium Mineral Resource volume, upgrading the geological interpretation and the estimation confidence.  Continuous  improvements  in  data  collection  quality  follow  the  recommendations  from  the previous  Greenbushes  NI  43-101  technical  report  titled  'Greenbushes  Lithium  Operations,  Located  in Western Australia - Australia NI 43-101 Technical Report' and dated June 15, 2011, including upgrades to the drilling sampling and assay procedures to improve both grade and mineral quality boundaries data; and analysis of data to help define sampling error at the stage of splitting samples on the drill rig.

The  database  is  acQuire,  industry  recognised  software  with  built  in  internal  checking  and  validation mechanisms.  A QA/QC protocol is in place in the database to statistically analyse the results of duplicates and standards from the field and the laboratory.  The output from this protocol is covered in Section 11.

The  geological  model  was  updated  from  drilling  results.  Domained  solids  of  the  pegmatite  and  internal mineralogical/grade  zones  within  the  pegmatite  were  generated  by  QG  using  Leapfrog  software.  Talison provided existing geological interpretation wireframes and information to feed into the Leapfrog software. Talison  staff  participated  in  the  review  process  to  refine  the  Leapfrog  solid  models  to  best  represent  the known geology.

For the 2012 Mineral Resource model the geological interpretation of the pegmatite has been extended by recent deeper drilling results. Lithium mineralisation domains were created for &gt;= 0.1% &lt;= 0.7% Li O, 0.7 % 2 =&lt; Li O &lt;= 2.8% and Li O &gt;=2.8% as an improvement to the Li O &gt;=1% used in the 2011 Mineral Resource 2 2 2 model and Li O &gt;=2.8% used in the 2009 model.  This domaining was driven by exploratory data analysis 2 and addressed the need for lithium Mineral Resources to be defined at lower grades to meet the requirements of  the  processing  plant  expansion  program  whilst  not  smoothing  the  higher  grades  that  are  targeted  for upgrading  to  technical  grade  products.      The  0.7%  Li O  domain  boundary  is  consistent  with  population 2 statistics in the lower part of the lithium grade distribution curve.  The 2.8% Li O boundary represents the 2 lower limit of a high grade lithium population supported by mineralogical mapping.

Talison used the QG Leapfrog interpretations to composite the drill data and forwarded the composites to QG to use for data analysis and Mineral Resource estimation.

A Surpac block model was built on site covering the mine project area which includes C1, C2 and C3 pits. A block model was created and centroids forwarded to QG for interpolation of required values using supplied composited assay data.

Site based model validation was carried out in addition to QG model validation and the Mineral Resource block model was subsequently released to the mine engineering staff for pit optimisation and design.

## 10.2 Drill Surveys

Drill  holes  contained  in  the  Greenbushes  database  date  back  to  1977  and,  as  expected,  many  of  the  early holes have been surveyed using different methods to those typically used at Greenbushes today.  More recent (post-2000) down hole surveys have employed Eastman Single Shot cameras, while the later RC programs (since hole RC214) utilized either a gyroscopic or a Reflex electronic tool.  Eastman down-hole surveys were recorded  at  25m  down-hole,  and  thereafter  every  30m  to  a  minimum  of  10m  from  the  final  depth.    The geologist  checks  the  drillers'  dip  and  azimuth  written  recordings  by  viewing  all  single  shot  photographic discs prior to data entry into the database.

Checks of surveys within the database, by comparing overlapping data between older and post-2000 drill hole data, suggest in general that the surveying is reliable.  Some of the RC holes drilled before 2002 were apparently not down-hole surveyed, and were given design parameters in the database.  Also some of the older vertical diamond holes were not down-hole surveyed.  This is not generally an issue if the hole is short and remains relatively vertical.

Collar surveys also varied in survey method with time.  For the more recent RC and surface diamond drilling programs,  drill collars (northing, easting and  elevation) of completed  holes  were  surveyed  by  the Greenbushes survey department and imported into the database.

The drill hole surveys were also subjected to a visual check where collar locations were checked on the collar plots and on the ground to confirm the coordinates in the database.

## 10.3 Logging

All holes within the Greenbushes database have been logged to some degree. Quality and quantity of logging varies considerably, particularly in the older drill holes.  The most detailed logging exists for the underground drill  holes  and  the  recent  surface  diamond  drilling  program  (C*DD  prefix),  where  core  was  logged quantitatively for lithological, mineralogical and geotechnical data.  The core was also digitally photographed and geotechnical defect logs were conducted on selected orientated holes.

All the data is in electronic format, in general utilising Excel logging templates.  The data is downloaded into an  acQuire  database,  recording  the  data  in  tables  covering  survey,  geology,  assay  and  collar  information. Earlier drilling programs prior to 2001 often lacked geotechnical and defect logs.  All previous logging was done on paper, and only a selected proportion of these data have been converted electronically and included in the database.  Generally only Rock-Type and a limited number of other pertinent fields have been entered into the database from these paper logs.

## 10.4 Sampling Method and Approach

## General

The  Greenbushes  pegmatite  and  included  lithium  mineralization  is  sampled  by  a  combination  of  RC  and diamond drilling programs. The drill patterns, collar spacings and hole diameters are guided by geological and geostatistical requirements for reliability of geological interpretation, and for confidence of estimation in Mineral Resource block models.

Drill core samples provide continuous intact columns of rock from which geological contact relationships can be determined, mineralogical associations examined and structural conditions measured. RC drill sampling provides mixed fine rock chips over the full selected sample length of 1m from which mineral proportions in the sample can be estimated by visual examination.  The intact information from diamond drill cores can be interpolated into the samples of nearby RC holes through the common link of geochemical assays.

A sample interval of 1m is used as the default length in RC and diamond drilling. Analysis of the pegmatite geometry,  lithium  lode  widths  and  internal  waste  zones  in  conjunction  with  mineralogical  variations  and assay  population  statistics  have  been  used  to  determine  the  appropriate  sample  interval  in  drill  holes. Pegmatite intersections and the major mineralogical variations defining lithium and tantalum enriched zones within them can vary from a few meters to over 100m in thickness

.

Distinguishing the dark host waste rock and intruding dolerite from the light pegmatites in drill core is clear and  obvious.    Where  unaffected  by  shearing,  the  geological  contacts  are  abrupt,  often  regular  and  intact. Contact relationships are masked in RC chips and the host rock/pegmatite contact position is inferred within the  sample  length  from  the  proportion  of  waste  to  pegmatite  mineral  chips  and  chemical  indicators  as described in Section 14.5 - Geology and Domaining.  Internal consistencies are maintained in the diamond drill  and  RC  drill  sampling  populations,  and  the  sample  populations  are  considered  representative  of  the mineralization.

Both diamond drill and RC drill holes are distributed throughout the lithium deposits. As shown in Table 10.1,  diamond  cored  holes  make  up  42%  and  RC  holes  make  up  58%  of  the  surface  holes  available  for Mineral  Resource  modelling  in  the  lithium  mineralization  block  model  from  approximately  9,800  metres North ('mN') to approximately 14,620 mN.

## 10.5 Diamond Drilling

Diamond core is collected in aluminium trays marked with hole identification and down hole depths at the end  of  each  core  run.    Core  size  is  generally  NQ  (approximately  47mm  diameter).  Pegmatite  zones  are selected by the geologist while logging and intervals are marked up for cutting and sampling.  All pegmatite intersections are sampled for assay.  The sections of core selected to be sampled generally extend several metres into the host rock waste on either side of a pegmatite intersection. Internal waste zones separating pegmatite intersections are routinely sampled, although in a small proportion of holes drilled prior to 2000 some  waste  zones  separating  pegmatite  lenses  have  not  been  assayed.    The  geological  and  mineralogical variations in the core which guide sample intervals are easily determined by visual examination.

The core is reassembled into a continuous column in the core tray as much as fracture patterns will allow. Core recovery is generally near or at 100% and reassembly is commonly achieved. A line of symmetry is then  drawn on the core and the core is cut in half by diamond saw.  One half of the core is bagged and numbered for submission to the laboratory while the other half is returned to the core tray.  The selection of core for assay and core retained is unbiased and as far as available records show, all drill core since 2000 has been processed in the same way.

The  typical  core  sampling  interval  for  assay  is  1m,  but  shorter  intervals  are  sampled  where  required,  to honour geological boundaries and mineralogical variations. Compositing of sample lengths for geostatistical analysis is described in Section 14.6 - Composite Files.

In  general  diamond  core  recovery  and  sampling  is  considered  to  be  of  good  quality,  and  suitable  for  the purposes of Mineral Resource estimation.

## 10.6 RC Drilling

RC samples are collected for every metre drilled over the full length of the hole via a cyclone attached to the rig and split at the rig by the drilling contractor using either a riffle splitter or rotating cone splitter.  A sample of approximately 3-4 kilogram ('kg') is produced for submission to the laboratory.  In some old RC holes drilled prior to 2000 the regular sampling length was 2m.  For RC drilling post-2000, two splits have been taken from each pegmatite interval, one for analysis and the other for storage as a reference.  A third sample is  collected  at  every  20m  interval  and  submitted  to  the  laboratory  for  Quality  Assurance/Quality  Control ('QA/QC') purposes.  Excess cuttings are laid out in rows at the drill site for geological logging.  RC drill hole bit size is normally approximately 5.25 inches (13.2cm).

All pegmatite intersections are sampled for assay. The sections sampled will normally extend several metres into  the  waste  rock  flanking  the  pegmatite.  As  with  diamond  drilling,  internal  waste  zones  separating pegmatite intersections are also sampled, although in some holes drilled prior to 2000 the sampling and assay of some internal waste zones is incomplete. Pegmatite intersections are visually distinguishable from waste zones in drill  chips  during  drilling,  however,  the  inferred  position  of  the  contact  within  a  sample  interval must be determined by detailed examination of the chips.

Drill cuttings have not been weighed to provide a measure of sample recovery.  However, a Talison geologist reviews the piles of cutting rejects while undertaking geological logging, and intervals with poor recoveries are  recorded.    Talison  reports  that  the  drill  samples  are  almost  invariably  dry,  and  that  recoveries  are consistently high.

QG considers that current sampling methods conform to acceptable industry standard. An improvement in future programmes would be to record estimates of sample recovery (or better, measurements), against every interval. This facilitates the analysis of potential biases due to loss in poor recovery intervals.

## 11 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND SECURITY

## 11.1 Sample Preparation

Drill samples from RC drilling programs are collected and bagged at the rig as drilling progresses.  The RC samples are collected in sequential, pre-numbered bags directly at a discharge chute on the sample splitter to which the sample bag is attached.  The splitter is either fed via a closed sample collection circuit at the drill hole collar or is fed manually from a bagged sample at the cyclone.

Drill core samples are also collected sequentially in pre-numbered sample bags after cutting with a diamond saw.  The integrity and continuity of the core string is maintained by reassembling the core in the tray.  If any apparent  geological  discontinuities  are  noted  within  or  at  the  end  of  core  runs  these  are  resolved  by  the logging geologist.

All sample preparation and analytical work is undertaken at the operation's on-site laboratory, which is ISO 9001:  2008  certified  and  audited  in  accordance  with  this  system,  most  recently  in  September  2012.    The Greenbushes laboratory provides quick and secure turn-around of geological samples using well established quality control procedures. The laboratory also services processing plant samples and samples from shipping products.

Upon submission to the laboratory, samples are entered into the laboratory sample tracking system and issued with an analytical work order and report ('AWOR') number.  Separate procedures have been developed for RC and diamond drill samples.

Preparation,  analysis  and  management  of  geological  samples  are  covered  comprehensively  in  laboratory procedures.  The sample preparation flow sheet is shown in Figure 8 and can be summarized as follows: all samples are dried for 12 hours at a nominal 110ºC; thereafter samples are passed through a primary crusher to reduce them to minus 10mm, followed by secondary crushing in a Boyd crusher to minus 5mm.  A rotary splitter is used to separate an approximate 1kg sub-sample, which is ground in a ring mill to minus 100µm.

Two routes have historically been used for the preparation of geological samples. The first utilises standard ferrous pulveriser bowls, while the second uses a low iron preparation method with a non-ferrous tungsten bowl.  The  low  iron  preparation  as  shown  in  Figure  8  was  used  for  all  samples  in  the  2011-2012  drilling programs.  All  drilling  sample  pulp  residues  are  retained  in  storage.  Coarse  sample  rejects  are  normally discarded unless specifically require for further test work.

Sample preparation is carried out by trained employees of the company in the Greenbushes site laboratory following set laboratory procedures.

## 11.2 Analysis

Due  to  the  long  history  of  operations  at  Greenbushes,  the  meta-data  regarding  assaying  is  somewhat incomplete; however, the recording of analytical data has been at the current standard since at least 2006. As far as can be determined, all assaying of drill samples has been by XRF and Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy ('AAS').  The majority of assays have been analysed for 36 elements at the Greenbushes laboratory. Sodium peroxide dissolution and AAS is used for Li O determination.  The other elements/oxides are analysed by 2 XRF following fusion with lithium metaborate.  The analysis of geological samples for Li O by AAS and 2 other elements/oxides by XRF is documented in laboratory procedures.

Over time, the detection limits of some elements assayed at the Greenbushes laboratory have improved, as outlined in Table 11.1, with implications for the accuracy of some of the older assays in the database.  This appears only to be significant for the low concentration elements and has no material effect on the resource model estimates.  Current detection limits remain as listed for PW2400 (low level) June 2001 in Table 11.1. Detection limits are stored in the acQuire geological database.

In  2002,  a  proportion  of  underground drill  core  samples  were  sent  to  the  Ultra  Trace  Pty  Limited  ('Ultra Trace') Laboratory in Perth, WA, for analysis.  XRF was used to analyse for Ta, Sn ('Tin') and others, and Inductively Coupled Plasma ('ICP') for Li O.  It is possible that in the past some other assaying was carried 2 out off-site, however, the number of samples is not thought to be significant.

Table 11.2 summarizes the Greenbushes database with respect to assays.  In some older holes in the database drilled  prior  to  2005  not  all  samples  were  analysed  for  all  36  XRF  elements.    This  introduces  some  issues requiring management in the determination of lithium ore types in the Mineral Resource block modelling process described in Section 14 - Mineral Resource Estimates.

The  Greenbushes  laboratory  undertakes  a  regime  of  check  standards,  duplicate  analyses  and  round-robin comparisons, to support the quality of the analytical work.  In addition, the laboratory produces results for shipping samples that are confirmed by independent analyses on behalf of lithium concentrate purchasers.

QG has visited the Greenbushes laboratory on several occasions and discussed the sample preparation and analytical  process  with  the  Chief  Chemist.  The  laboratory  equipment  appears  well-maintained  and  the working spaces clear and tidy.  Analytical methods and laboratory practices are in accordance with industry standards.

QG considers that current sample preparation, security and analytical procedures are adequate for the purpose of Mineral Resource estimation, grade control and reconciliation.

## 11.3 Data Management

The management of drill hole data has progressed from original paper logs to electronic databases, initially using Paradox database software in a number of datasets.  In 2006, all site drill data, both exploration and grade control, were combined into the one master Sequential Query Language database administered through acQuire.  Data were flagged as before or after the implementation of acQuire.  Data were also flagged as belonging to Mineral Resource development and exploration or grade control.

All results are now captured electronically and transferred to the master database.  Hole collars surveys are recorded in Gemcom Surpac Limited ('Surpac') string files and the co-ordinate information read into the database.  Down hole surveys are entered manually unless collected by electronic instrumentation, in which case they are down-loaded electronically.  Assay information is provided from the laboratory in Excel spread sheets  which  are  converted  to  comma-separated  values  ('csv')  files  and  read  into  the  database.    All information such as AWOR number, date and laboratory preparation code is now captured in the database.

Geology logging is initially carried out through Microsoft Excel and the resultant spread sheet down-loaded into the master database.  Standard logging codes allow the installation of a range of filters to be applied to data entry during logging and prevent invalid coding.

## 11.4 Missing Assays

To overcome the sample intervals mainly in underground drill holes missing significant elements, over 1200 pegmatite intervals within the lithium Mineral Resource that were missing lithium assays were submitted to the laboratory as pulps for complete suite analysis.  The submission of historical pulps and core for complete suite  analysis  is  an  on-going  process  with  several  thousand  drill  hole  sample  intervals  remaining.    The affected core is mainly from underground drilling programs in or about 2002 where the primary target was tantalum mineralisation.

QG  considers  that  the  sample  preparation,  analytical  and  data  management  procedures  adopted  at  the Greenbushes  site  conform  to  industry  standards,  and  are  appropriate  for  Mineral  Resource  modelling purposes.

## 12 DATA VERIFICATION

## 12.1 QA/QC

QA/QC systems at Greenbushes have developed over time and therefore vary for the dataset used for Mineral Resource estimation.  Current drilling practice involves collection of a duplicate field sample for every 20 RC samples submitted.  Since January 2007 this has been recorded in the master acQuire database software and QA/QC reports generated for each drill program.

The site laboratory also utilizes a system of replicate analysis of samples and analysis of standards, along with each batch of drill samples, the results of which are also now captured in the master database.

Recovery logs are made of all diamond drill core as a part of the standard logging procedure which includes collection of geological, mineralogical and structural information.  Talison reports that core recoveries within the  fresh  pegmatite  range  from  95%  to  100%,  averaging  99%.  Weight  measurements  are  made  of  RC samples  from  selected  holes.    Talison  geologists  also  inspect  the  size  of  the  cutting  piles,  and  intervals differing from the norm in size or moisture content are noted on drill logs.  Talison reports that RC sample recovery generally has been excellent.

QG has reviewed and verified the quality of the database, as described in the following sub-sections.  Site visits were made in September 2009 and May 2011, during which inspections were made of the laboratory. As no RC or diamond drilling was in progress during these visits, it was not possible to review drilling and sampling practices.

## 12.2 Assay Quality

Collection  of  QA/QC  sampling  and  assay  data  has  been  improved  over  time  and  therefore  the  type  and amount of quality control data varies for different sections of the dataset.

Talison and previous operator QA/QC systems have relied partly upon the Greenbushes laboratory's internal quality systems, which include replicate (pulp repeat) laboratory analyses, analysis of known standards by XRF, and round-robin interaction with other laboratories.  Li O in geological drill samples is not analysed in 2 replicates; instead, the AAS machine is recalibrated before every batch of samples.

Known solution  standards  and  blanks  are  embedded  in  each  batch  and  the  accuracy  of  the  calibration  is monitored  regularly  during  the  analysis  of  each  batch.    The  precision  of  the  AAS  analysis  technique  is statistically monitored by the laboratory, using plant processing and shipping data.  While these samples are typically higher grade than the average drill sample, ranging up to 8% Li O, the resulting precision at mining 2 grades is very good and generally confirms the quality of the AAS method employed.

Duplicate field sample analyses exist for RC drill holes but not diamond core samples.  No routine analysis of duplicate coarse reject or pulp samples is undertaken.

Current  RC  drilling  practice  is  to  submit  a  field  duplicate  sample  for  5%  of  samples  submitted.  These duplicates are collected in the same way as the routinely assayed samples.  Since January 2007 this has been recorded in the master acQuire database software and QA/QC reports generated for each drill program.

The QQ plots of RC drill sampling results do not indicate a significant bias between the original and check sample populations. Scatter plots of original  and field duplicates for  Li O  from  2012  RC  holes  show  less 2 variability than the same plot over all the RC resource holes suggesting a reduction in sample error.  Plots for half  absolute  relative  difference  (HARD)  show  less  sampling  error  in  the  2012  RC  data  compared  to  the overall RC data. The site laboratory undertakes a system of replicates the results of which are captured in the master  database.    A  scatter  plot  for  Li O  replicates  from  RC  samples  shows  acceptable  repeatability  of 2 results.

## Standards

QG has examined the laboratory standards reports for drill samples in the period from July 2011 to June 2012, which covers the latest phase of Mineral Resource drilling (van Duuren 2012).

For XRF analyses, the laboratory routinely inserts any of four XRF standards, with multiple standards of different  expected  grades  inserted  in  each  batch.    XRF  analyses  of  four  standards  (GE16  to  GE19)  are reported over the period. GE16  to  GE19  XRF  standards  are  derived  from  run-of-mine  pegmatite

mineralisation from the Greenbushes mine chosen for their variation in Ta O  grade and designed to be bulk 2 5 in-house  standards  to  be  used  to  verify  specimen  preparation,  XRF  measurement  and  to  check  positional errors. The standards were sent to independent laboratory Gannett Holdings to be pulverised, blended and homogenised. The expected values of the standards have been derived over time by statistical methods and adjusted in line with changes in instrument precision.

AAS analyses for Li O use internal  laboratory  rock  standard  AAGEO1  with  an  expected  value  of  1.89% 2 Li O.  During  the  period  of  the  drill  program,  standard  AAGEO1  returned  results  showing  acceptable 2 accuracy of laboratory analysis at this grade and the results for this standard over time are shown Figure 9. QG  recommends  the  laboratory  closely  monitor  on-going  results  to  ensure  trends  are  identified  and  if necessary that investigations are undertaken to bring the results back to limits around the certified mean.

Notes:

- 1 Red  lines  are  acceptable  limits  derived  from  statistical  analysis  and  instrument  calibration  approximating  to  two  standard deviations
- 2 Green dotted line is the expected value

## Blanks

Solution blanks are embedded in sample batches analysed for Li O by AAS as referenced in above in this 2 Section 12.2.  No blank rock chip samples are run by the laboratory or inserted by the exploration group. However, Talison's procedures require that a preliminary charge of sample material is run to clean the mill prior to grinding the test sample.

## RC Sample Field Duplicates

Field  duplicates  were  taken  approximately  every  20  samples  and  the  basic  statistics  for  field  duplicates collected  during  the  resource  drilling  program  are  shown  below.    The  basic  statistics  show  similar populations of data although the charts show some spread in the results. QG considers the repeatability of field duplicate results would improve with a rig mounted rotary sample splitting system.  The basic statistics for the field duplicate results are shown in Table 12.1 and the scatter plots are shown in Figure 10.

Table 12.1 Basic Statistics for RC Drilling Field Duplicate Results

| Assay Field      | Mean     | Mean   | Standard Dev.   | Standard Dev.   |

Note: 1248 samples tested over the period from July 2005 to November 2012

## Laboratory Replicates

Results  of  laboratory  replicate  analyses  pairs  were  assessed  to  determine  precision  and  bias.    Laboratory replicate analysis is restricted to XRF analyses; consequently, Li O results were not included.  The laboratory 2 routinely takes replicates from every XRF sample batch.  As expected, bias is negligible and precision is at acceptable levels.  The plots of statistics for the results of laboratory replicates are shown in Figure 11.

QG is of the opinion that the QA/QC procedures used in conjunction with Mineral Resource development drilling should continue to be reinforced by:

-  generation and analysis of data to help define sampling error at the stage of splitting samples on the drill rig;
-  insertion of blind standards (made up from existing drill hole rejects) with routine drilling samples;
-  monitoring performance of the laboratory sample preparation processes;
-  inclusion of duplicate crusher and pulp samples routinely with all drilling samples; and
-  introduction of laboratory pulp replicate data for Li O. 2

The precision observed for field duplicate samples from Mineral Resource development drilling is acceptable for  Li O,  Na O  and  manganese  oxide  ('MnO') once  a  small  number  of  poorly  matched  sample  pairs  are 2 2 removed from the database.  Talison has been reviewing sampling practices at the drill rigs and has identified means where sample splitting can be improved.  A preliminary review of the size of split samples from the RC rig for laboratory analysis suggests the current size of sample is adequate.

Analytical precision of better than 5% is indicated for Li O, based on repeat analyses of shipping products. 2

QG has minor concerns about the Mineral Resource assay data quality, but comfort can be gained from

- (i) the very close similarity in mean and standard deviations of the data populations of both pairs for all elements, and
- (ii) the general agreement between Mineral Resource, grade control and mill grades as discussed in Section  16  -  Mining  Methods.    Nonetheless,  moderate  to  poor  precision  makes  accurate distinction between ore types more difficult and efforts should be made to improve data quality.

## 12.3 Survey

Visual  validation  of  collar  plots  and  drill  sections  has  been  undertaken  by  Talison.    In  addition,  Talison routinely checks the location and orientation of drill collars in the field during drilling.  All drill hole collars and  drill  traces  are  considered  by  Talison  to  be  correctly  represented  in  the  database.    In  recent  drilling programs  drill  collar  locations  and  hole  orientations  have  locally  been  less  consistent  with  the  normal sectional patterns due to drill site access difficulties around the existing pits.  Although QG made no actual field  checks  of  collar  location  and  hole  orientation,  the  drill  data  appears  to  be  consistently  and  logically distributed, and QG considers that the survey integrity is adequate for Mineral Resource estimation purposes.

## 12.4 QA/QC Conclusions and Verification

QG has reviewed QA/QC data, and concludes that:

-  sampling and QA/QC procedures have been upgraded;
-  procedures are in place for QA/QC results to be rigorously assessed on a monthly basis; and
-  better  precision  of  RC  samples  will  improve  the  accuracy  with  which  grade  and  material  quality boundaries can be drawn.

Nevertheless, the results of mining over an extended period of time indicate that there is no major problem with the primary analytical data.  Consequently, QG considers that the quality of the database is adequate for estimation of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves under the NI 43-101 guidelines.

The grade control sampling function has been reviewed following an RC drilling pilot program testing the validity of blast hole sampling methods.  Proposed improvements in QA/QC procedures, including additional field and laboratory duplicate and replicate sampling and routine inclusion of blind standards, are anticipated to be covered with current staffing levels and at minor additional assay costs in the laboratory.

## 13 MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING

Talison's  processing  operations  at  Greenbushes  include  a  crushing  plant  under  a  licence/toll  treatment arrangement, two processing plants and associated administrative, workshop, laboratory and other infrastructure,  all  located  adjacent  to  the  open  pit  mining  operation.    These  processing  plants  include grinding, classification, heavy medium  separation, gravity separation, flotation, leaching, magnetic separation, dewatering and drying processes.  Lithium ore treatment commenced at the site in 1984-1985 and has  been  progressively  expanded  to  its  current  capacity  of  about  1,500,000tpa  of  ore  feed.    The  two processing  plants,  the  TGP  and  the  CGP,  are  described  in  Section  17  -  Recovery  Methods.    The  plants produce mineral products containing a wide range of lithium grades with different iron impurity levels and size specifications.  The main usage for TG products is as feedstock for the glass and ceramic industries.  The CG products are mostly supplied to manufacturers of lithium carbonate and other lithium chemicals.

The  on-site  laboratory  described  in  Section  11  -  Sample  Preparation,  Analysis  and  Security  provides analyses of mining and processing samples for lithium content using AAS techniques and a comprehensive list of 36 elements using XRF techniques.

The Greenbushes processing operations have been treating lithium ores for over 20 years.  The metallurgical process  to  produce  concentrates  from  Greenbushes  spodumene  ore  is  well  understood.    Metallurgical  test work  is  undertaken  on  a  routine  basis  for  the  purposes  of  continued  optimization  and  improvement  with specific  objectives  including  improving  the  knowledge  of  ore  characteristics,  assessing  and  optimizing process performance, assessing circuit changes and evaluation of new equipment and technologies.  The scale and nature of the lithium processing circuits means that the majority of such test work can be carried out in the operating plant to provide a direct real measure of performance.  Where necessary either the Greenbushes laboratory,  or  outside  laboratories  or  supplier  facilities  are  also  used.    BDA  has  viewed  a  number  of  the metallurgical test work reports which describe various testwork that has been undertaken relating to some of the fundamentals of the lithium processing including:

-  the characteristics of the lithium ores and key parameters in processing;
-  liberation of the lithium ores relating to heavy media separation;
-  the capability of the crushing plant to produce 6mm product;
-  spiral concentration performance on lithium ores;
-  the application of ore sorting to lithium ores;
-  the occurrence and removal of iron from spodumene;
-  the application of flotation to lithium ores;
-  the recovery of lithium from tantalum ores; and
-  the performance of the 2010 SC6.0 upgrade post commissioning.

A critical aspect of the operation is the requirement to differentiate between feed for the TGP and the CGP, with the key parameters being the iron content of the ore and the mineral spodumene itself.  The results of analyses of samples from Mineral Resource drilling and blast hole drilling using RC drills cannot be used to differentiate  between  TGP  and  CGP  feed  because  the  drilling  process  and  sample  preparation  procedures introduce sufficient iron to interfere and also because the iron analysis does not provide any measure of iron that can and cannot be removed in the processing plant.

Talison personnel have developed a model which uses several non-iron component analyses to predict the iron content of the lithium concentrate that would be produced from a particular ore block. (BDA notes that Talison's practice is to call all its lithium concentrates SC - for spodumene concentrate - followed by the Li O  grade  of  the  concentrate.)    The  model  has  been  extensively  tested  against  plant  performance  and  is 2 considered to be reliable.

Routine test work on core and drill cuttings is not carried out as the application of the iron grade predictive model to analyses obtained from core and drill cuttings provides a more comprehensive and reliable method for assessment of plant feed type.  However, iron analyses of spodumene grains from drill core samples are carried by microprobe for metallurgical characteristics of future ores.  These analyses are used to confirm the reliability of the iron grade predictive model on the ore stream in the mine plan.

## 14 MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATES

## 14.1 Introduction

Lithium Mineral Resources at Greenbushes are concentrated in the C1 and C3 pit areas (Figure 4).  A whole-ofmine  lithium  Mineral  Resource  model  for  the  Greenbushes  pegmatite  deposits  was  prepared  by  QG  in  2007 (Jackson,  2008).    An  updated  model  for  the  C3  deposit  (between  11,800mN  and  12,600mN  and  above 1,100mRL) was completed and reported by QG in 2009 (Stewart, 2009), and the full mine Mineral Resource model  from  10,550mN  to  12,700mN  was  updated  and  reported  by  QG  in  2011  (Stewart,  2011).  The  2012 resource  block  model  has  been  extended  to  cover  between  9800mN  and  14,620mN,  and  is  reported  by  QG (Stewart, 2012).

The C3 pit constitutes the largest lithium Mineral Resource with the widest grade ranges and has been the source of most of the recent lithium production.  Mineral Resource modelling of the C3 area and differences between the  2011  Mineral Resource model and the 2012 Mineral Resource model are discussed in the following subsections.

The Mineral Resource estimate at Greenbushes was prepared using the following steps:

-  Drill data was collected, analysed and validated by Talison during 2012, and added to the existing drillhole database. QG has validated these inputs and found them to be appropriate for Mineral Resource modelling and Mineral Resource Classification according to the guidelines of the JORC Code and NI 43-101.
-  The  significance  and  impact  of  new  drilling  on  existing  interpretations  was  assessed  by  Talison geologists.
-  Talison and QG jointly interpreted the pegmatite and lithium grade domains. QG constructed new 3 dimensional  geometric  models  of  lithology  (pegmatites  and  dykes),  and  Li O  mineralisation  using 2 Leapfrog implicit modelling software. The initial version of this model was based on an interim dataset, and was reviewed in detail by QG and Talison staff to ensure coherency with geological understanding of the deposit.
-  Final versions of the lithological models and grade domains were generated based on a final extraction of drill-hole data in July 2012.
-  Drill-hole sample intervals were coded by both lithological and grade domains.
-  Drill-hole sample intervals were composited by length to a common support, and the compositing step validated.
-  Lithological  and  grade  domain  solids  were  used  to  code  a  block  model  with  parent  cells  of 20mNx20mEx5mRL and a minimum sub-block size in X and Y planes of 2.5m.
-  All drill data and model coding was carried out in Surpac software;
-  Variographic analysis and modelling was carried out on Li O, Ta O , As O , CaO, Fe O , K O, MnO, 2 2 5 2 3 2 3 2 Na2O, P2 O5 and Sn within estimation domains.
-  All geostatistical analysis and estimation was carried out in Isatis (TM) software.
-  Estimation of the block grades of these variables was made by Ordinary Kriging (OK). All variables were treated independently during estimation.
-  Grade estimates were validated statistically and visually.
-  Mineral Resource estimates were reported constrained within a long-term pit optimisation
-  Confidence  classifications  were  assigned  with  respect  to  CIM  guidelines,  taking  into  account  data quality,  geological  interpretation,  data  density  and  the  quality  of  estimation  of  Li O  in  the  lithium 2 domains, and .

## 14.2 The Significance of Iron

The  specifications  of  technical  grade  products  place  limitations  on  the  iron  content.    Iron  bearing  mineral species,  excluding  iron  contained  in  the  spodumene  crystal  lattice,  may  be  removed  during  processing  of  the spodumene concentrate. However, any iron in the spodumene crystal lattice is not removed by processing.

The  Fe O   content  in  the  products  is  managed  in  the  mill  feed  via  production  grade  control  methods  and 2 3 stockpile blending. Due to the rock abrasion of the steel sample tube when RC drilling the reported Fe O  result 2 3 for the samples collected using RC drilling will be higher than their true value.  Therefore RC drill samples do not provide a reliable iron assay value and this lack of reliability is reflected in the block values interpolated during the estimation process.

Significant in managing iron in products is whether the in-situ Fe O  is present in minerals associated with the 2 3 spodumene, or if it occurs within the spodumene crystal.  Treatment records show that almost all Fe O  present 2 3 as  'tramp'  or  country  rock  can  be  removed  through  processing,  while  Fe O   associated  with  the  spodumene 2 3 crystal lattice is not removed.  It follows that the critical aspect is not the absolute result of the Fe O  assay, but 2 3 rather the split between that contained in contaminants and that occurring in the spodumene lattice.

In 2007 this split was investigated from a series of representative composites of various ore types taken from the C1 and C3 areas during an RC drilling program.  The composites were passed over a high intensity magnet to remove all non-lattice iron. The remainder of the material was re-assayed to determine an estimate of the lattice iron.  A process was then developed to transform the sample Fe O  values to a spodumene lattice iron equivalent. 2 3

Further  investigation  of  the  spodumene  lattice  iron  using  electron  microprobe  analysis  has  contributed  to  the development  of  a  method  of  calculating  a  proxy  spodumene  lattice  iron  value.  The  method  also  draws  on experience in the mill to calculate proxy iron values using other elements within the current XRF analysis suite.

The components with the largest contributions to the calculated proxy iron value are Na O and MnO. 2

In  the  2012  Mineral  Resource  model  the  proxy  iron  is  calculated  in  Mineral  Resource  blocks  and  is  used  to highlight the expected location of Technical Grade ore type feed for internal scheduling.  Although the lithium ore types are not specifically separated by tonnage and grade in the 2012 Mineral Resource block model, the feed  available  to  the  Technical  Grade  and  Chemical  Grade  processing  plants  from  the  mining  operation  is defined by applying a process to the blocks which includes the results from application of the above method.

Raw data was loaded to Leapfrog software for modelling of geometry.  After development of geological domains in Leapfrog, wireframe solid models were exported to Talison site staff for validation. The validated solids were then used to code assay intervals in Surpac software, and composited to fixed length composite files. Final coded composites were then passed back to QG for geological modelling.

A tabulation of all drill hole collar details is included in Table 14.1. A total of 67 new RC and Diamond drill holes for 12,802m have been added since the previous estimate.  This drilling represents an increase of 10% in drilling metres over all previous resource drilling at Greenbushes.

## 14.5 Geology and Domaining

## General

The Greenbushes lithium deposits are hosted within a very large pegmatite body.  Lithium domains represent volumes with elevated concentrations of spodumene within the broader pegmatite, probably related to different phases of intrusion.  Geological models of both the pegmatite and the lithium domains within the pegmatite have been interpreted and modelled in Leapfrog software by Talison and QG.  The domains were based on crosssectional interpretations of the pegmatite and lithium mineralization.  Lithium mineralisation was modelled at thresholds of 0.7% and 2.8% Li O. In addition, a domain at 0.1% Li O was also constructed to constrain low 2 2 grade  interpretations.    A  distinction  is  made  between  the  mineralogical  zones  described  in  Section  7.8  Mineralogy and the lithium domains used for Mineral Resource estimation, which are defined by Li O content, 2 but, in general, the lithium domains can be considered a sub-set of the spodumene zone.

Talison staff reviewed the domains generated by QG using Leapfrog and suggested improvements to bring the domains  in  line  with  known  geological  structures  and  mineralisation  trends  before  transferring  the  solids  to Surpac.

## Pit Areas

The  Greenbushes  deposit  has  historically  been  mined  as  a  series  of  separate  pits  which  has  influenced  the collection of drilling data and the development of models. This separation, to some extent, reflects differences within the pegmatite geology, although the differences are not great. Geological interpretations have historically been organized by deposit.

In this estimate, for the first time, the geological model has been developed seamlessly across the entire deposit. This seamless model has then been separated into sub-domains based on grade characteristics and orientation. The resulting boundaries are close to the previous pit boundaries, but not identical.

## Modelling Approach

In this Mineral Resource estimate there has been a fundamental change in the method of domain construction. Previous  Mineral  Resource  models  have  been  based  on  conventional  wireframe  solid  models  constructed  by linking together digitised sectional interpretations. In this Mineral Resource estimate, solid models of geological and estimation domains have been constructed using the Leapfrog implicit modelling software.

In the Leapfrog approach to modelling, coded data, geological control lines and estimation parameters are used to interpolate a unique, continuous mathematical function. This function is then converted into a wireframe mesh by gridding at a specified resolution. The advantage of this method is that, once the geological control lines and estimation parameters have been defined, it is simple to incorporate new data (correctly coded) into the models.

The successful implementation of this method requires:

-  Careful  and accurate initial coding of data into coherent categories;
-  Careful interpretation and digitising of geological 'controls';
-  Correct choice of interpolation parameters; and
-  Choice of appropriate resolution in gridding of the underlying function to generate wireframes

Many geologists are initially discouraged by the results of Leapfrog models due to the rounded closures, which are  an  inevitable  feature  of  the  underlying  interpolation  process.  To  many  these  can  seem  like  unrealistic artefacts. However this is largely a question of familiarity - the more usual method of closing interpretations in conventional modelling by pushing interpretations half drill spacing beyond the last drillhole, and closing with square ends is no more geologically realistic than that seen in Leapfrog models.

The development of new Leapfrog models of geology at Greenbushes was an iterative process. Orlando Rojas (OR)  of  QG  visited  Greenbushes  to  gain  familiarity  with  the  geology  and  data,  and  subsequently  created  a preliminary model. This was taken back to site to show the geologists, and further modifications were made to the model before final solids were agreed. Drill-hole data, photos of the pit walls, pit wall mapping, blast hole logging and assays were all used in conjunction with the resource drilling holes when interpreting domains.

The order of model construction is

-  Pegmatite;
-  Mafic dykes; and
-  Li O grade shells 2

## Pegmatite

The pegmatites, host to all lithium, tantalum and tin mineralisation at Greenbushes, generally dip moderately to steeply westwards. The main pegmatite unit is some 50-100m in width, and is generally laterally continuous. There are numerous smaller discontinuous pegmatite bodies in the footwall of the main unit. The lateral extent of these  is  generally  poorly  constrained  by  drilling.  There  is  some  evidence  of  folding  of  the  pegmatites, particularly between C3 and Cornwall pit, but no folds have been specifically interpreted.

Interpolation and wire framing of the pegmatite volume used an anisotropic, west dipping search. The lateral and down-dip extension of the pegmatite is largely controlled by availability of data rather than geological closure.

Solid interpolation only extended some 50m beyond the limits of data. Long-sections of the pegmatite solid and drill hole data distribution are shown in Figure 12.

Figure 12: Lateral and Vertical Limits of Data and Pegmatite Model.

## Dykes and Internal Waste

Within  the  hosting  pegmatite  there  are  a  number  of  cross-cutting  dykes,  which  range  in  width  from  a  few centimetres to a few metres.  The dykes are of basic composition, and have substantially different chemistry to the  pegmatites.    Lithium  values  in  the  mafic  dykes  are  relatively  low,  and  dyke  material  is  separated  from lithium pegmatite during mining to avoid contamination of the final lithium products.  Assay data from dykes are identified by significantly higher calcium oxide ('CaO') and Fe O  values. 2 3

Identification of intervals as dyke rather than as pegmatite was based on both logging, and also on flagging and interpretation from multi-element geochemistry.

Volumetrically the dykes form an insignificant proportion of the total pegmatite volume. In previous estimates, the volume relating to these has been ignored. In this estimate, dykes have been modelled.  This has been done by interpolation of geometry from flagged dyke intervals - four different 'families' of dykes that cross-cut have been identified; three that cross cut the pegmatite at a high angle (and in fact continue into the host dolerites), and  one  that  is  concordant  to  the  general  orientation  of  the  pegmatites.    Each  of  the  different  sets  are  then interpolated and wire-framed separately. The results are shown in Figure 13.

After pegmatites and dykes have been modelled, the dyke volume is intersected away from the pegmatite, and the resultant volume exported to Surpac for coding.

## Li2 O Grade Shell Wireframes

Lithium occurs within distinct zones internal to the pegmatite, characterised by enrichment of spodumene.  There is  not  sufficient  detail  present  within  logging  to  enable  identification  of  spodumene  enrichment  directly,  but these  zones  are  clearly  defined  by  elevated  Li O  grades.  When  examined  in  histogram  (Figure  14)  there  is 2 clearly  a  substantial  population  of  low  Li O  grades  present.  When  examined  spatially,  there  are  a  number  of 2 sharply differentiated internal contacts where Li O grade jumps from the range 0.2-0.7% to +1%. Consequently, 2 a threshold of 0.7% Li O was used to differentiate Li O mineralization. 2 2

In the past, a 2.8% Li O threshold has been used to control the estimation of high lithium grades.  However, on 2 further examination there is little obvious differentiation in the statistical population, and this threshold does not clearly relate to regular definable internal boundaries within the 0.7% Li O volume, apart from the footwall of a 2 zone of elevated (+4%) Li O in the hanging wall of the C3 pit area.  However, in this area drilling is of sufficient 2 density, that block estimation is well constrained by data and honours the distribution seen in drillhole grades well.

A further lower grade boundary was imposed at 0.1% Li O. This threshold was used to both isolate some very 2 low grade areas of the pegmatite, and to restrict the estimation of Li O grades to a reasonable distance beyond 2 data.

The choice of a 0.7% Li O threshold to constrain estimation of Li O and other grades is felt to be robust: there is 2 2 clearly some basis in mappable geology, and the threshold is well below a current economic cut-off for Li O, 2 which enables creation of estimates that retain sensitivity to choice of cut-off grade. The declustered histogram of Li O samples within the pegmatite body is shown in Figure 14. 2

The domain wireframes were built in Leapfrog by QG with input from Talison personnel. The solids were then imported into Surpac and interrogated on site by Talison staff, both for geological sense, and for integrity and validity.  The  Solids  Validation  feature  was  used  to  check  for  solids  for  closure  and  integrity,  and  the  Report Volume feature was used to check that individual volumes were correctly designated as solids or voids.  Coding of drillhole intervals and blocks was carefully checked.

The  implicit  nature  of  the  Leapfrog  modelling  approach  (wireframe  models  are  created  by  gridding  of  an underlying mathematical function) can inherently produce a large number of solids if fine resolution is used in the gridding process (in this case over 600 solids). This is usually resolved by either reduction in grid resolution, or  by  limiting  the  volume  of  solids  during  export.  In  this  case,  grid  resolution  was  important,  so  a  minimum volume limiting was used.  Most of these solids are very small, contain few (if any) composites and have very limited material impact on the definition of a resource.

For the Li O &gt; 2.8% solid for example, there were 347 individual solids, the largest 8 of which total 15.112Mt or 2 98.8% of the total volume. The remaining 339 solids account for only 0.178Mt or 1.2% of the total volume. In the interests of materiality the approach taken in this model was to:

-  Export solids for the Li O &gt; 2.8% with volumes less than 10,000m  or approximately 5 model blocks. 2 3 This threshold volume was determined after visual checking.
-  Positive solids - those that are outside the main Li O volumes - use to set coding of both composites and 2 block model centroids back to Li O\_0.7-2.8% 2
-  This process is repeatable, and auditable. It does not change the locations of existing sub-blocks; and
-  Negative solids - small waste zones within the main Li O zone - use to set coding of composites and 2 blocks back to Li O &gt; 2.8%. This results in a more coherent coding around the main +2.8% Li O zones 2 2
-  Talison staff used the Solids Validation feature in Surpac to check wireframe domains were closed and valid and the report volume feature used to check models were correctly designated solids or voids.

## 14.6 Composite Files

Compositing of drill hole data was undertaken in Surpac software by Talison personnel.

The  most  common  sampling  length  within  the  pegmatite  domain  is  1m  and  the  average  length  is  1.3m  with sample lengths of 1.5m and 2m also common. The 2012 drilling contributed more 1m sample intervals to the dataset.  A compositing interval of 5m was selected for this resource estimate as this corresponds to the grade control flitch height of 5m currently used in mining.  A 5m length exceeds the average and common sample lengths  thus  minimising  sample  splitting.  This  composite  length  represents  an  acceptable  trade-off  between sample lengths, bench height, geological detail, and variance reduction. Because not all variable are informed at all location, each variable (10 in total) was composited separately.

Surpac outputs the 'full length' composites (above a length threshold) as string 1, and the short composites as string 2. Short composites generally occur on the downhole side of geological units, at the end of holes, or when there is  missing sample within a unit. There are no binding conventions about how to treat short composites. Some practitioners advocate discarding them, because of difference in support, and because they can cause bias

in mean grade if there is persistently higher or lower grades on the margins of the domain.  Others argue that they  should be  retained,  because  the  potential  loss  of  information  outweighs  the  geostatistical  gain  of  having common support.  In this case, the average grade of short composites was compared to full length, and it was decided to retain these composites in the data set for analysis and estimation.

Composite statistics for all domains by estimation variable are shown in Table 14.4.

## 14.7 Exploratory Data Analysis

All  geostatistical  analysis  and  spatial  modelling  was  carried  out  in  Isatis  software.    Composites  from  Surpac were first exported to ASCII CSV format, and then loaded into Isatis. Checks on number of samples and average grade were performed to ensure the integrity of this process.

## Treatment of outliers in grade populations

It  is  well  recognised that the treatment of extreme grades in Mineral Resource estimation can have a material impact on project economics.   If grade distributions are highly skewed, and contain grades that are either much lower, or more commonly much higher, than the average grade, estimates of tonnage, grade and metal at block scale can be locally (and globally ) unrealistic. Numerous examples can be found to illustrate the problem and a number of techniques have been developed to counter this problem. The most pragmatic of these simply restrict the influence that outlying grades can have in estimation of block grades.

-  Top cutting involves removal of grades above a defined threshold from estimation (essentially these are lost to the estimate);
-  Capping  (often  incorrectly  referred  to  as  top-cutting)  involves  replacing  grades  above  a  defined threshold with the threshold value; or
-  Outlier  Restriction  involves  limiting  the  use  of  samples  above  a  defined  grade  threshold  to  within  a defined distance from a block.

The necessity to control the use of outlier grades in an estimate is dictated by the purpose and nature of the model, the quantity and location of data, and the nature of the underlying grade distribution. Ultimately all of these solutions are subjective decisions - there is no definitive method to choose a top-cut.

For the current estimation no top-cuts, caps or outlier restrictions were applied. For the main economic variables, the populations are not highly skewed and there are no values regarded as outliers. For secondary variables, the number of outlier values is small, and the impact of these is mitigated by averaging during estimation. Secondary variables are not directly used in material classification, and while the presence of outliers may result in local overestimation  of  the  grades  of  secondary  variables,  this  does  not  affect  definition  of  Mineral  Resource,  and within larger volumes the average grades will be accurate.

## Variography

Experimental  variograms  were  calculated  for  all  variables  by  deposit.  Calculations  examined  the  continuity between holes in the generalised plane of dip in two directions (along strike and down dip), as well as examining continuity perpendicular to the plane using a lag equal to the composite length.  The same parameters were used to calculate all variograms for all variables within a domain.

In general, the variograms of both value variables (Li O and Ta O ) and the major elements show good spatial 2 2 5 structure, and variogram models can be fitted to these variables with a relatively high level of confidence. Some examples of experimental variograms and the fitted variogram models are shown below in Figure 17 and Figure 18.

Summary information for all fitted variogram models is given in Table 14.5.

## 14.8 Grade Estimation

## Block Models

The 2012 model limits are shown in Table 14.2.

Talison's in-house Mineral Resource modelling is carried out in Surpac software, which uses sub-blocking for control of volume.  The parent cell size is 20x20x5m while the smallest sub-block allowed is 10x2.5x5m, or 1/16th (6.25%) of the parent cell.

The 2012 grade estimation was undertaken in Isatis software.  Isatis does not support sub-blocking, so the coded sub-block centroids from Surpac were imported into Isatis as points, then migrated up into an Isatis grid with dimensions equivalent to the parent cells in Surpac.  Upon completion of estimation, grade values were then registered onto the appropriate Surpac sub-block point locations, exported to ASCII, and loaded back into the original Surpac block model.

## Kriging Estimation

Estimation was performed using OK, with each variable being estimated independently. Quantitative Kriging Neighbourhood Analysis was used to guide the choice of sensible kriging estimation parameters.  The choice of search  ellipsoid  dimensions  and  rotations  was  based  on  the  geometry  of  the  domain,  mineralization,  data distribution and modelled spatial continuity.  Choice of sample selection parameters within the search ellipsoid was guided by iterative testing of different input parameters and examination of estimation outputs.

No alternative estimation methods were tested.  The use of OK is considered adequate for the purpose of this estimate,  and  has  resulted  in  local  estimates  that  are  sufficiently  accurate  for  the  classification  level  applied. Although a linear estimate will always be smooth with respect to reality, testing was performed to show this method adequately represents the tonnage/grade relationships at mining cut-offs.

The search parameters used in estimation of all domains are tabulated below (Table 14.6). For Li O, estimation 2 was  carried  out  in  3  passes  of  increasing  dimensions  to  ensure  all  blocks  were  filled.  Other  variables  were estimated in a single pass, with a search of sufficient radius to ensure filling of blocks. Note that anisotropic search  ellipsoids  have  been  used  to  ensure  selection  of  samples  from  adjacent  holes  and  limit  the  number  of samples  taken  out  of  an  individual  hole.    These  ratios  were  guided  by  the  overall  geometry  of  the  lithium domains.

## Estimation Validation

The general purpose of validation is twofold:

-  To detect errors in implementation, for example:
- o Whether all blocks intended have been filled;
- o Whether rotation parameters have been correctly applied;
- o Whether the selections of data and blocks are as intended; and
-  To ascertain whether the estimates are geostatistically sound (whether the variance of block estimates is reasonable).

For the former, the most reliable method is visual validation.  Each domain estimate was opened as a 3D block view in Isatis software, along with the composites used to inform it.  This allows rapid assessment of domain selections, and whether any blocks have not been filled by the search applied. In addition, the search ellipsoid and samples selected were visualised in 3D - an example is shown in Figure 19.

Checks  on  statistical  validity  begin  with  global  checks  on  grade  reproduction.  Declustered  input  composite grades are compared to average block grades per domain.

Because drilling  is  generally  not  evenly  distributed  in  space,  an  arithmetic  average  of  composite  grades  will generally not represent the grade of the entire volume well, whereas block grades are estimated into the entire volume of the domain. To account for this, sample grades are normally assigned spatial declustering weights there  are  a number  of  different  methods  available  for  doing  this,  all  with  their  own  advantages  and disadvantages, and sensitivity to choice of parameters.

At Greenbushes, the method adopted for declustering was the moving window option from Isatis software. In Table  14.7  this  is  compared  to  the  average  grade  estimated  by  Ordinary  Kriging.  Note  that  OK  is  itself  a declustering  method  -  and  in  fact,  if  OK  weights  are  stored  back  to  samples  and  used  to  decluster,  then reproduction of input grades by output is guaranteed by construction.  In general however, it is more useful to decluster  samples  by  an  alternative  method.  Large  differences  should  be  examined  to  determine  whether  the issue lies in implementation of estimates, or in the declustering applied.

For the estimates compared below, the reproduction is, in general, adequate. The large differences observed can be explained by low domain volumes, or by difficulties in declustering.

An alternative check of the performance of the estimate is to plot average grades of inputs and outputs in moving window slices.  Examples of this type of plot for Li O estimation in the Main C3 lithium domain are presented in 2 Figure 20 (10m horizontal slices) and Figure 21 (25m Northing slices).  The blue line represents average Li O 2 grade of input data, the red line represents average estimated Li O grades, the green line represents the number 2 of data points per slice, and the orange line represents the average slope of regression (a measure of estimation quality). Note that slice plots only provide a partial (2D) de-clustering, evidence of which can be seen in these plots. For example, the departure between data and estimate above 1,150m RL is due to the closer drill spacing in  the  high  grade  hanging  wall  section  of  the  lithium  domain  compared  to  the  lower  grade  footwall,  and consequently the average grade of data in a horizontal slice in this zone is predictably higher than the average grade of estimates. That said, slice plots provide a useful visual check of the relative degree of smoothing present in the estimate. A full set of slice plots were created for all other variables.

## 14.9 Bulk Density

Bulk  density  for  different  rock  types  has  been  assigned  to  the  block  model  based  on  an  analysis  of  site material over a considerable time-frame.

Past Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve modelling has utilised bulk densities for the major unweathered rock types as follows: pegmatite 2.64 tonnes per cubic metre ('t/m '); granofels and amphibolite 2.90t/m ; 3 3 and dolerite 3.1t/m .  Oxide material is more variable and difficult to measure; a significant range of density 3 values  is  to  be  expected  due  to  variable  degrees  of  rock  decomposition.    The  oxide  material  has  been assigned a bulk density of 1.8t/m , which appears to be the most reliable estimate for this type of material and 3 is supported by mining records.

The bulk composition of the pegmatite is spodumene (SG~3.1) and quartz+feldpars (SG~2.65) and as the proportion  of  spodumene  varies  from  0%  to  +50%  throughout  the  pegmatite,  the  bulk  density  also significantly  varies  from  ~2.6  to  ~2.9  within  the  pegmatite.  The  Li O  assay  indicates  the  proportion  of 2 spodumene from which the SG can be calculated.

Bulk density for pegmatite has been assigned to blocks in the 2012 Mineral Resource model based on Li O 2 assays  using  the  formula Bulk  Density  =  2.59+0.7*% Li O.  The  formula  is  derived  from  bulk  density 2 measurements of drill core prior to assay and subsequently relating the bulk density measurement to the Li O 2 assay.

As shown in Figure 22, the measured values show good correlation with Li O grades and are considered an 2 improvement on the previously assigned value of 2.64 across the whole pegmatite.

Bulk density, which takes into account air/pore spaces in the material, is considered a better measure of the 'mass' of oxidised material. Over time, production truck counts versus survey measurements can be a reliable indicator of material bulk density.  The bulk density of oxide material has been assigned the value of 1.8, which is  considered  to  be  the  best  and  most  reliable  estimate  for  this  type  of  material.  Table  14.8  below summarises the densities applied to the model.

Historical mining values were used for weathered clays = 1.8 and fresh greenstone waste = 2.9.  A value was not assigned to dolerite due to its less significant volume and inexact location in the deposit.

| Material                      | No of Samples   | Analysis     | Density   | Estimation   |
|-------------------------------|-----------------|--------------|-----------|--------------|
| Oxide/Transitional Pegmatite  | N/A             | Truck/Survey | 1.8       | Assigned     |
| Fresh Pegmatite               | 385             | Experimental | ~2.6~2.9  | Calculated   |
| Oxide/Transitional Greenstone | N/A             | Truck/Survey | 1.8       | Assigned     |
| Fresh Dolerite                | 22              | Wax 1        | 3.1       | Not Used     |
| Fresh Granofels               | 27              | Wax 1        | 2.9       | Assigned     |
| Fresh Amphibolite             | 16              | Wax 1        | 2.9       | Assigned     |

## 14.10 Mineral Resource Classification

The C3 pit constitutes the largest part of the lithium Mineral Resource and the C3 area above 1,100mRL has been the source of the majority of the recent lithium production. Mineral Resource classification of the lithium domains was based on the data density, geological confidence and estimate quality of the Li O estimate.  It was 2 assumed that ore will be extracted only via open pit methods.

Essentially, for the lithium domains, blocks with good quality Li O estimates and with a drill density of around 2 or higher than 50x50m were classified as Indicated Mineral Resource.  No material inside the lithium domains has been classified as Measured Mineral Resource.  Only one small area in the south of the C3 zone, where the strike swings approximately 15°, is classified as Inferred Mineral Resource, as the data density and estimation quality in this area is poorer.

## 14.11 Mineral Resource Calculation

The  September  2012  Greenbushes  Mineral  Resource  estimate  has  been  constrained  within  the  limits  of  an economically optimised Whittle pit shell. This pit shell has been selected from a series of sequentially nested shells based on the same commercial and physical parameters and providing a range of Net Present Values.

The optimised shell selected to support the Greenbushes open pit design and subsequently the Mineral Reserves at Greenbushes is also from the same series of nested shells. This relationship ensures the Mineral Reserves can remain a subset of the Mineral Resources.

The process followed to determine Mineral Resources in September 2012 is as follows:

-  A  pit  optimisation  was  run  on  the  updated  2012  resource  model  in  Whittle  4X  software  using  revised commercial  inputs  and  processing  criteria.  This  optimisation  process  produced  a  consecutive  enveloping series of pit shells (49 in this run) relating to varying discounted and undiscounted NPVs, and with a range of revenue factors relating resource block costs to block revenues.
-  The  Whittle  optimisation  used  a  series  of  discrete  material  types  including  lithium  ores,  tantalum mineralisation and pegmatite designated as waste. All contain varying levels of lithium mineralisation.
-  The pit optimisation run producing the pit shell selected for mine design and Mineral Reserves excludes Inferred Mineral Resource blocks and is fully within the Mineral Resource shell, so the Mineral Reserves remain a valid sub-set of the Mineral Resources. The Mineral Reserves shell has the maximum NPV from the average of best and worst case DCFs, and a cost based revenue factor of 0.575.
-  The pit shell selected for constraining Mineral Resources includes Indicated and Inferred Mineral Resource blocks  and  has  a  limiting  revenue  factor  of  1.0  (i.e.  costs  vs.  revenues  for  each  block  are  break-even  or better).

The Mineral Resources within the selected Mineral Resource shell are further constrained by being:

-  Inside the 0.7% and 2.8% Li O grade domains; 2
-  Indicated or Inferred Mineral Resource classifications (none of the in-situ Mineral Resource has been classified as Measured Mineral Resource)
-  Below the 30th September 2012 mine surface;
-  lithium ore and pegmatite waste material types
-  Above 950RL (70 metres below the design floor of the new Mineral Reserves pit).

As outlined in Section 14.9, the approach to bulk density of the lithium ore types has changed from a standard value  in  previous  calculations  to  a  variable  value  in  this  2012  calculation  based  on  spodumene  content determined by Li O grade This has introduced a tonnes-weighted average increase of approximately 4% across 2 the Mineral Resource grade range.

This  process  produces  an  in-situ  Mineral  Resource  of  120Mt  at  2.42%  Li O.  There  is  no  Measured  Mineral 2 Resource  in-situ.  The  translation  rate  of  the  September  2012  Mineral  Resources  to  Mineral  Reserves  is approximately 51%, compared with 43% in the previous calculation.

The lithium Mineral Resources reported across the C1, C2 and C3 pit areas are listed in Table 14.13 and show that  the  bulk  of  the  Mineral  Resource  is  contained  in  the  C3  area,  where  most  of  the  pit  development  has occurred.

## 14.12 Review of the 2012 Mineral Resource Model

A major Mineral Resource drilling program totalling approximately 12,800m was completed in the Greenbushes pegmatite  and  flanking  structures  in  early  2012.  The  drilling  program  was  directed  at  upgrading  Mineral Resources  and  increasing  Mineral  Reserves  by  improving  the  confidence  of  the  block  model  estimates  and extending the lithium mineralisation boundaries in the mining areas, particularly in the southern C3 area. The increased Mineral Reserves were to support expansion plans in the processing plants with improved ore feed options at a wider range of lithium grades.

The drilling information and continuing mining and milling experience in C3 and C1 pits lead to a review of pegmatite structures, geological interpretation and lithium grade domaining in the pegmatite body. The lithium domains have been constructed at 0.7% Li O and 2.8% Li O boundary conditions.  The 0.7% Li O domain and 2 2 2 the Mineral Resource block model extend continuously from 9,800mN in the south of C1 to 14,620mN in the north  of  C3.  Estimation  of  the  block  model  inside  the  0.7%  Li O  domain  shows  improvement  in  estimation 2 confidence reclassifying blocks from Inferred Mineral Resources to Indicated Mineral Resources and consequently providing increased volumes potentially available to Mineral Reserves.

Geological and mineralogical variations exist for lithium mineralization between the C1, C2 and C3 areas.  All areas contain the ore types that constitute feed for the CGP. C3 has a higher lithium grade core more suitable for feed to the TGP, and not found in C1 or C2.  Lithium grade distributions and population statistics differ between the areas, and there are grade trend and structural orientation variations between the three areas. Construction of the 2.8% Li O domain is limited to the C3 area and improves the definition of high grade lithium mineralisation 2 forming the feed for the Technical Grade processing plant.

The Mineral Resource estimates forming the tables below remain current.

## 14.13 C3 Area Mineral Resource Summary

The C3 pit constitutes the largest lithium Mineral Resource and the C3 area has been the source of the majority of recent lithium production.  The Mineral Resource table for the C3 area is presented in Table 14.9.  The table is generated  from  Surpac  software  after  export  from  Isatis.    The  Surpac  model  is  used  as  the  input  to  Mineral Reserve estimation. Lithium estimates within the pegmatite zones outside the lithium domains are not classified or reported.

All Mineral Reserves are contained within the Mineral Resources.

## 14.15 Greenbushes Lithium Mineral Resources

## Qualified Persons Responsible for Mineral Resource Estimates

The Mineral Resource estimates for the Greenbushes C1, C2 and C3 lithium deposits as of September 30, 2012 were carried out under the guidelines of the JORC Code by Competent Persons as defined by those guidelines. The JORC Code guidelines are compatible with the requirements of NI 43-101.

Data collection, validation and construction of the constraining geological and grade boundaries was undertaken on site and in Perth, WA.  This work was overseen by Andrew Purvis of Talison who is a Competent Person as defined  by  the  JORC  Code  and  who  is  a  Qualified  Person  under  NI  43-101.    QG  undertook  statistical  and geostatistical analysis of the data, and constructed the 3-D Mineral Resource block model.  The QG work was undertaken or supervised by Scott Jackson of QG, who is the Competent Person as defined under the JORC Code and who is a Qualified Person under NI 43-101.  Data collection and data quality were also reviewed by Scott Jackson of QG.

## Basis of Mineral Resource Classification

The  mineralization  was  classified  according  to  the  definitions  of  NI  43-101  and  the  guidelines  published  by CIM.  The relevant definitions for the classifications are as follows:

A Mineral Resource is a concentration or occurrence of natural, solid, inorganic or fossilized organic material in or on the Earth's crust in such form and quantity and of such a grade or quality that it has reasonable prospects for  economic extraction.  The location, quantity, grade, geological characteristics and continuity of a Mineral Resource are known, estimated or interpreted from specific geological evidence and knowledge.

An Inferred Mineral Resource is that part of a Mineral Resource, for which quantity and grade or quality can be estimated on the basis of geological evidence and limited sampling and reasonably assumed, but not verified, geological and grade continuity.  The estimate is based on limited information and sampling gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes.

An Indicated Mineral Resource is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, grade or quality, densities, shape and physical characteristics can be estimated with a level of confidence sufficient to allow the appropriate application  of  technical  and  economic  parameters,  to  support  mine  planning  and  evaluation  of  the  economic viability  of  the  deposit.    The  estimate  is  based  on  detailed  and  reliable  exploration  and  testing  information gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes that are spaced closely enough for geological and grade continuity to be reasonably assumed.

A Measured Mineral Resource is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, grade or quality, densities, shape, physical characteristics are so well established that they can be estimated with confidence sufficient to allow  the  appropriate  application  of  technical  and  economic  parameters,  to  support  production  planning  and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit.  The estimate is based on detailed and reliable exploration, sampling  and  testing  information  gathered  through  appropriate  techniques  from  locations  such  as  outcrops, trenches,  pits,  workings  and  drill  holes  that  are  spaced  closely  enough  to  confirm  both  geological  and  grade continuity.

The  Mineral  Resource  estimates  are  derived  using  assay  information  from  surface  drilling  and  are  based  on geological  interpretation  from  mapping  and  drilling.    The  Mineral  Resource  category  reflects  the  degree  of confidence in the block, based both on the quantity, reliability and consistency of the data and the confidence in the geological interpretation.  The Mineral Resource is stated inclusive of Mineral Resource material used in the Mineral Reserve estimate.  Mineral Resources that are not Mineral Reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability.

QG  is  not  aware  of  any  aspects  of  the  Mineral  Resources  that  may  be  materially  affected  by  mining, metallurgical, infrastructure and other relevant factors.

## Mineral Resource Statement

Table  14.12  reports  the  current  Greenbushes  lithium  Mineral  Resources  held  by  Talison  by  category.  Table 14.13 sets out those lithium Mineral Resources within each area, excluding the stockpiles of ore which make up the total of all Measured Mineral Resources.

Ore stockpiles are surveyed at the end of each month by the mine surveyor. The stockpiles are defined as Run of Mine ('ROM') or Fine Ore (post-crushing). Broken rock specific gravities are applied to calculate tonnes. The stockpile grades are a balance between grade control sampling grades on to the stockpiles and mill feed grades off the stockpiles. The validity of the results is monitored during the monthly reconciliation process.

Notes:

- 2. The derivation of lithium carbonate equivalent is tonnes x (%Li O/100) x 2.473 = tonnes LCE. 2
- 4. Mineral Resource estimation was performed using Ordinary Kriging into 20mNx20mEx5mRL parent blocks, with each variable Li O,  calcium  oxide  (CaO),  ferric  oxide  (Fe O ),  potassium  oxide  (K O),  manganese  oxide  (MnO),  sodium  oxide  (Na O), 2 2 3 2 2 phosphorus  oxide  (P O ),arsenic  oxide  (As O ),  tin  (Sn),  and  tantalum  oxide  (Ta O ))  being  estimated  independently.  The 2 5 2 3 2 5 geostatistical analysis of the data and construction of the 3-D Mineral Resource block model was undertaken or supervised by Scott Jackson of QG, who is the Competent Person as defined under the JORC Code and who is a Qualified Person under NI 43101. Data collection, validation and construction of the geological models was overseen by Andrew Purvis, a full-time employee of Talison, who is 'Qualified Person' in accordance with National Instrument 43-101 and a ''Competent Person'' as defined by the Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves 2004 Edition (the JORC Code.

All  Mineral  Resources  are  reported  as  of  September  30,  2012  using  the  end  of  month  mining  survey. Subsequent production has occurred, but the impact on total Mineral Resources is not significant.

Notes:

- 1. There may be some rounding errors in totals.
- 2. The derivation of lithium carbonate equivalent is tonnes x (%Li O/100) x 2.473 = tonnes LCE. 2
- 4. Mineral Resource estimation was performed using Ordinary Kriging into 20mNx20mEx5mRL parent blocks, with each variable Li O,  calcium  oxide  (CaO),  ferric  oxide  (Fe O ),  potassium  oxide  (K O),  manganese  oxide  (MnO),  sodium  oxide  (Na O), 2 2 3 2 2 phosphorus  oxide  (P O ),arsenic  oxide  (As O ),  tin  (Sn),  and  tantalum  oxide  (Ta O ))  being  estimated  independently.  The 2 5 2 3 2 5 geostatistical analysis of the data and construction of the 3-D Mineral Resource block model was undertaken or supervised by Scott Jackson of QG, who is the Competent Person as defined under the JORC Code and who is a Qualified Person under NI 43101. Data collection, validation and construction of the geological models was overseen by Andrew Purvis, a full-time employee of Talison, who is 'Qualified Person' in accordance with National Instrument 43-101 and a ''Competent Person'' as defined by the Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves 2004 Edition (the JORC Code.
- 3. For the updated estimate (as of September 30, 2012) the lithium Mineral Resources are within lithium domains drawn at a 0.7% Li O grade boundary, constrained by an optimized pit shell, and above 950mRL; and Measured Mineral Resources comprises the 2 Run of Mine and Fine Ore stockpiles. For the previous estimate (as of March 31, 2011) the lithium Mineral Resources are within lithium domains drawn at a 1.0% Li O grade boundary and above 1000mRL. 2
- 5. Mineral  Reserves  are  included  in  Mineral  Resources.  Mineral  Resources  are  not  Mineral  Reserves  and,  as  such,  do  not  have demonstrated economic viability.
- 6. Mineralization  was  classified  according  to  the  definitions  in  National  Instrument  43-101  and  the  guidelines  published  by  the Council  of  the  Canadian  Institute  of  Mining,  Metallurgy  and  Petroleum  (the  CIM  Standards).    Categorisation  of  Mineral Resources under NI 43-101 is consistent with the JORC Code.

## ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS FOR ADVANCED PROPERTY TECHNICAL REPORTS

## 15 MINERAL RESERVE ESTIMATES

## 15.1 Qualified Persons Responsible for Mineral Reserves

The Mineral Reserve calculations for the Greenbushes Central Lode lithium deposits have been carried out under the guidelines of the JORC Code by Competent Persons as defined by those guidelines.  The JORC Code guidelines are compatible with the requirements of NI 43-101 in this regard.

The mining team at the Greenbushes Lithium Operations undertook the determination of Mineral Reserves. This team was led by Stephen Green of Talison, who is a Competent Person as defined by the JORC Code. Peter Ingham of BDA, a Qualified Person under NI 43-101, has reviewed the Greenbushes Mineral Reserves process and determined that the assumptions and parameters used in the preparation of the Mineral Reserves are appropriate,  and  that  the  Mineral  Reserves  statement  fairly  represents  the  Mineral  Reserves  at Greenbushes.  For the purposes of this independent technical report, Peter Ingham is the Qualified Person responsible  for  the  Greenbushes  Lithium  Operations  Mineral  Reserves  calculation  and  is  independent  of Talison.    Peter  Ingham  is  a  mining  engineer  with  over  30  years'  experience  in  the  mining  industry,  with particular  expertise  in  open  pit  and  underground  mining  including  mine  planning,  Mineral  Reserve preparation and independent review of Mineral Reserves.

In  accordance  with  NI  43-101,  Proven  and  Probable  Mineral  Reserves  are  derived  from  Measured  and Indicated  Mineral  Resources,  respectively,  once  it  has  been  shown  that  those  Mineral  Resources  can  be extracted at a profit.  Mining, metallurgical, engineering and cost studies have been completed, and legal and environmental aspects confirmed.  Inferred Mineral Resources cannot be converted to Mineral Reserves.

## 15.3 Mineral Reserves Basis

The  Mineral  Reserves  for  the  Central  Lode  area  comprises  open  pittable  material,  and  were  developed through  Whittle  Four-X  pit  optimization  software  ('Whittle  software')  of  Indicated  Mineral  Resources contained  within  the  2012  Mineral  Resource  model.    Mine  design  was  completed  in  accordance  with established slope stability criteria, using Surpac mining software.  The Central Lode pit has been designed with 30m benches, 18m bench widths and overall wall angles of between 30° and 50°.  Local berm angles vary with local ground conditions.  Ramp width is 18m for single-way and 24m for two-way traffic.  Ramp gradient is 1:10. The pit design floor is at 1,020mRL, with a high wall of approximately 310m.

Product yields in the Whittle software vary according to the product specification, and, in the case of CG material, the plant producing the product.  Consequently, no single yield figure can be applied to the various plant feed types and classes.  Total product yield over the life of the project is estimated to be approximately 35%.

Based on a review of reconciliation data, Talison has allowed for the recovery of 93% of the mining tonnes at 100% of the grade.

The Mineral Reserves estimates forming the basis of Table 15.1 below remain current.

## 16 MINING METHODS

## 16.1 Pit Optimization and Designs

The defined lithium Mineral Reserves are contained within the Central Lode zones. The design of the Central Lode open pits which contain all the lithium Mineral Reserves was based on optimization work undertaken by  Talison  and  an  independent  consultant  and  then  reviewed  by  BDA.    Whittle  software  with  the  LerchGrossman algorithm was used to create optimized pit shells from the Mineral Resource block model.  A 1.8% Li O cut-off grade has been applied to the Mineral Reserves. 2

The mining cost parameters used in the modelling were based on the site's existing drill and blast, and load and  haul  contract  costs  adjusted  to  current  rates  via  the  rise  and  fall  formulae  within  the  contracts.    The assumption  for  the  pit  slopes  for  all  walls  was  45º;  the  basis  of  slope  angles  is  further  discussed  under geotechnical assessment.  Based on recent results of the C3 pit reconciliations of the mine production against the Mineral Resource model, the mining input parameters for the optimization were set at 0% dilution and 93% recovery of ore; further discussion of grade control and mine to mill reconciliation is set out below.

The  other  key  parameters  used  in  the  optimization  were  processing  costs  of  between  A$20  and  A$48/t depending on grade and product specifications.  Product yields, production rates and product pricing used in the  optimization were reviewed by BDA and were considered appropriate for the optimization modelling. With the need to balance total production and corporate marketing requirements, the scheduling modelling considered both TGP and CGP feed requirements.

The selected Whittle shells from the optimization modelling were used to design mineable pits that satisfied the design criteria of the site Slope Stability Management Plan (Sons of Gwalia, 2005), utilized parts of the existing ramps, minimized narrow mining widths and met the required bench mining widths.  The final pit has been designed with 30m bench heights, 18m bench widths and overall wall angles of between 30º and 50º.  Local batter angles vary with local ground conditions summarized in Table 16.1.  Ramp width was set at 18m single lane and 24m for two way traffic.  Haul road gradient was set at 1:10 or approximately 6º.  The final pit floor is at 1,020mRL, with a high wall of approximately 310m.

The  Central  Lode  pit  is  planned  to  be  mined  in  stages  to  ensure  continuity  of  TGP  and  CGP  feed requirements and to minimize waste removal over the life of the pit.  The stages are designed to be mined concurrently.  The mining parameters used in determining the Mineral Reserves were the same as used in the optimization modelling; mining dilution of 0% and a mining recovery of 93%. The final Central Lode pit design crest is shown on Figure 4 and on Figure 6.

The volumes, tonnes and grade for the pit design for the Central Lode pit excluding stockpiles at September 30, 2012 are summarized in Table 16.2.

Note:

(1)  'Mbcm' = million bank cubic metre.

## 16.2 Geotechnical and Hydrological

The geotechnical parameters including slope angles used in the optimization were drawn from recommendations  in  the  BFP  Consultants  Pty  Limited  slope  stability  report  (BFP,  1999)  and  subsequent annual design reviews by independent consultants.  Allowances for haul road segments were included in the design parameters.  The designs are consistent with current operating practices for the C3 pit, which include steeper batters with more horizontal catchment on the berms.  The Cornwall pit, which is adjacent and to the north of the C3 pit, was mined to a depth of 270m between 1992 and 2003 using the same overall slope angles and its walls remain stable.

On-going  geotechnical  data  collection,  test  work  and  review  are  planned  as  the  pits  increase  in  depth  to ensure the risk of slope failure is minimized.  Slope profiles have been designed for the various geotechnical domains within the Mineral Resource model and are summarized in Table 16.1.

No recent hydrological studies for the pit have been undertaken; however, based on the current open pit and underground tantalum mining below the open pit mining of the C3 pit, there is no evidence of ground-water being a potential problem for Greenbushes.  In view of a larger rainfall catchment area, as the 'footprint' approaches the final pit shell, additional pumping from the pit will be required.

## 16.3 Grade Control

Talison's grade control procedure is based on sampling of blast holes drilled by open-hole percussion drills on  a  spacing  of  3m  x  3m  or  less  depending  on  blasting  requirements.    However,  prior  to  drilling  the lithological boundaries between pegmatite and waste (greenstone) are identified from blast hole logging and geological bench mapping. For those holes within pegmatite, grab samples are collected for analysis from cuttings at the collar representing the 5m drill length.  Duplicate samples are subsequently collected at a ratio of approximately 1:20 and submitted for analysis for QA/QC purposes.

## 16.4 Ore Blocking

Ore outlines  are  based  on  interpretation  of  blocks  above  the  Li O  cut-off  grade,  which  is  presently  2.0% 2 Li O, taking account of practical mining limitations, with blocks providing feed for the TGP being identified 2 from Li O grade and estimated Fe O  product content.  Predicted mining tonnes and grade are calculated in 2 2 3 Surpac software.

In order to maximize the recovery and quality of blocks providing feed for the TGP, these blocks are blasted separately from CGP feed where possible.  A further precaution to reduce iron contamination is the practice of covering these blast blocks with lithium tailings prior to blasting of adjacent ore or host rock areas.  The tailings  are  then  removed  prior  to  mining  the  block.  The  final  control  is  visual  ore  spotting  with  ore movement restricted to daytime operations wherever possible.

## 16.5 Production Reconciliation

## Process

Reconciliation between the Mineral Resource model, mine production (from grade control blast hole data) and  mill  production  is  carried  out  routinely  and  reported  monthly.    The  reconciliation  trends  are  used  to

monitor performance of the Mineral Resource model and to determine factors translating Mineral Resources to  Mineral  Reserves.  Talison  provided  records  of  Mineral  Resource  to  grade  control  to  mill  production reconciliation  for  the  12  month  period  from  July  2011  to  June  2012.  Reconciliation  has  been  reasonably consistent over this period.

Mine, stockpile and mill daily and monthly production data are stored in a database tracking system.  The reconciliation process uses the 2012 Mineral Resource model and matches lithium ore streams from in-situ Mineral Resources through the stockpiles to the mill, applying end-of-month pit and stockpile surveys, mine ore  movements,  stockpile  balances  and  mill  processing  figures.    The  outcome  is  a  back-calculated  mine production tonnage and grade based on mill figures balanced by stockpile movements.  This tonnage and grade is then reconciled against the depleted Mineral Resource in the pits, and, as a secondary check, against the cumulative daily trucking figures.  The reconciliation of Mineral Resource against back-calculated mine production figures guides mill-based factors used to translate Mineral Resources to Mineral Reserves in the pit optimization and design process.

The weaknesses inherent in the reconciliation process over short time periods are the relatively low tonnages moved each month compared to the Mineral Resource model block size, the potential for stockpile survey error, and the definition of the blend fed to the mill. The results and trends gain credibility as the time period increases.    The  mill  figures  are  taken  as  fixed  and  any  reconciliation  issues  sheeted  back  to  the  Mineral Resource block model and/or mine performance.  As mine production relies on blast hole sampling for grade control  and  ore  blocking  there  is  a  natural  separation  between  the  Mineral  Resource  model  and  the production stream common to many mining operations.

## Results

Over the 12 months July 2011 to June 2012 the lithium grade control cut-off in ore fed to the mill has been 2.0% Li2 O.  Therefore the 2012 Mineral Resource model has been reported at 2.0% Li O and compared to 2 mine production figures back-calculated from stockpile balanced mill tonnes and grade.   Lithium-bearing material less than 2.0% Li O cut-off is identified during grade control and moved to low grade stockpiles. 2

The reconciliation summary over the 12 month period from July 2011 to June 2012 at the nominal cut-off of 2.0% Li O is shown in Table 16.3 below. 2

## Mineral Resources to Mineral Reserves Conversion Factors

Talison has adopted a tonnage factor of 93% and a grade factor of 100% for the ore types feeding the TGP and CGP. These factors imply 0% dilution and 93% mining recovery. In practice, the pit based grade control processes that define ore types feeding the mill at the time of mining are anticipated to result in the overall recovery of the tonnage in the Mineral Resource model that is depleted by mining activity, at the grade of those tonnes depleted from the Mineral Resource model. Talison is aware of the ore definition issues and consider these factors  as  representative  of  ore  recovery  trends.    Considering  the  low  tonnages  of  material mined, it is not possible to determine the recovery and dilution factors to a high degree of accuracy, but the increasing complexity of ore type definition anticipated from the 2011 and 2012 Mineral Resource models suggests that there will be growing challenges facing grade control in identifying and blocking out ore types below the current pit floor.

The following mining parameters have been used in the optimisation:

-  Mining dilution of

0%

-  Mining Recovery of

93%

These parameters effectively denote a recovery of 93% of the resource model tonnes at 100% of the Mineral Resource model grade.

The 2012 reconciliation calculated over the 12 months from July 2011 to June 2012 shows 85% tonnage and 110% grade recoveries of the Mineral Resource model in the mill, which equates to a 93% contained Li O 2 reconciliation  from  model  to  mill.  Over  this  time  the  mine  was  processing  the  higher  grade  ores  and stockpiling  lower  grade  ores,  which  has  the  potential  to  distort  the  reconciliation  outcomes.  Talison determined  that  rather  than  applying  a  positive  lithium  grade  reconciliation  factor  to  convert  Mineral Resources  to  Mineral  Reserves,  the  positive  grade  reconciliation  would  be  incorporated  in  the  tonnage reconciliation to calculate an overall mining recovery.

BDA  has  reviewed  the  production  and  reconciliation  data  and  agrees  that  the  definition  of  lithium  ore distribution in the Mineral Resource model blocks from drilling at 50m intervals is not particularly accurate compared to the detailed grade control drilling. However, significant improvement has been introduced to the model from the 2010 and 2012 Mineral Resource drilling programs and the subsequent review of the Mineral Resource  model  estimations.    BDA  considers  that  Talison's  decision  to  use  the  93%  recovery  and  0% dilution factors for Mineral Resource blocks for use in mine design and production planning can be justified on  the  basis  of  the  recent  reconciliation  data  and  the  review  of  additional  ore  availability,  although  it  is possible that there may be a declining trend in future for feed to the TGP due to the increasing geological complexity at depth in C3. These assumptions have been adjusted from the March 2011 parameters of 100% recovery and 0% dilution.

## 16.6 Mining Operations

Since completion of the Cornwall open pit in 2003, open cut mining has moved to the Central Lode open pits to  the  south  of  the  Cornwall  pit.    The  higher  grade  lithium  ore  is  mined  from  a  distinct  zone  within  the pegmatite on the hanging wall side of the C3 (North) zone and from the large zone within the C1 (South) zone.  The mining plan for C3 involves a series of stages.  The various stages of the pit are a western cutback, southern cutback and eastern cutback; the western cutback is staged between the north and south sections to allow waste movements to be scheduled within current haulage capacity.  The C2 zone becomes the access to the C3 zone to allow the pit to be deepened.  The current final Central Lode pit will be approximately 310m deep, 2,000m north-south and up to 650m east-west.

The open pit operation currently utilizes conventional mining methods with drilling and blasting both ore and waste.    Within  ore,  the  drill  pattern  is  either  2.3m  x  2.7m  or  2.5m  x  2.9m  for  5m  benches  with  nominal 115mm diameter blast holes.  Within the greenstone waste the drill pattern is 4.1m x 4.8m for 10m benches with nominal 127mm diameter blast holes.  Emulsion explosives are used for blasting.

The  load  and  haul  fleet  consists  of  a  120t  hydraulic  excavator,  four  100t  dump  trucks  (with  six  trucks available but requiring four trucks for most hauls) and an auxiliary fleet including front end loader, two track bulldozers, water truck and grader.  Ore is taken to the ROM pad where it is stockpiled according to ore type, mineralogical characteristics and grade. Tantalum mineralisation mined as a consequence of lithium mining is  either  stockpiled  separately  or  within  the  open pit as Talison  has  no  rights over  the  tantalum  ore  types. Waste is taken to the waste dump to the east of the pits.  Total material movement is between 1.2Mbcm and 1.5Mbcm per annum.  Material movements will peak at between 6Mbcm and 7Mbcm per annum between years 12 and 15.

Near  the  base  of  the  Cornwall  open  pit  there  is  adit  access  to  the  underground  tantalum  mine.    The underground operation was put on care and maintenance in 2002.  Subsequently the operation was restarted in  2004  due  to  increased  demand  but  again  placed  on  care  and  maintenance  the  following  year.    GAM currently maintains the pumping system within the mine to maintain access.  The southern limit of the current underground mine extends beneath the central area of the C3 pit.

For annual mine production rates over the life of mine reference should be made to Table 21.1, Section 21 Capital and Operating Costs; and to Table 22.1, Section 22 - Economic Analysis.

## 17 RECOVERY METHODS

## 17.1 Introduction

As  noted  in  Section  13  -  Mineral  Processing  and  Metallurgical  Testing,  two  lithium  mineral  processing plants are located adjacent to the open pits.

The two plants produce a range of lithium concentrate products.  SC6.0 is CG lithium concentrate produced from the CGP.  Four other lithium concentrates (SC5.0, SC6.5, SC7.0 and SC7.5) are produced from the TGP.

The grades of the lithium products reflect the relatively low lithium content of lithium minerals.  Naturally occurring  spodumene  can  contain  7%  -  8%  Li O  while  pure  spodumene  from  the  Greenbushes  Lithium 2 Operations contains close to 8% Li O.  The SC7.5 lithium concentrate is a high grade concentrate comprising 2 around 94% spodumene.

At about 4% Li O, Greenbushes lithium TG ore contains 50% spodumene and is regarded as very high grade, 2 compared to other hard rock lithium deposits which contain about 1-2% Li O.  The mineral suite in the ore 2 includes  quartz,  sodium  and  potassium  feldspars,  micas  (muscovite,  biotite  and  lepidolite),  phosphates (apatite,  amblygonite  and  lithiophilite),  tourmaline,  minor  carbonates,  tantalum  minerals,  cassiterite  and arsenic minerals.

Overall production is tailored to meet market demand.

For the requirements for water, energy and processing reference should be made to Section 5 - Accessibility, Climate, Local Resources, Infrastructure and Physiography.

Talison  considers  the  design  of  the  two  lithium  processing  plants  to  be  commercially  sensitive  and  the description below is restricted to generalities.  However, BDA has inspected the two plants, has had access to recent production reports and has been provided with information on the plant upgrades which are planned so that plant production can be progressively increased.  BDA considers that the two lithium processing plants have  the  capability  to  produce  the  projected  tonnages  of  lithium  concentrates  provided  that  the  proposed upgrades are carried out as planned.

## 17.2 Crushing Plant

The two lithium plants receive crushed ore from a four stage crushing plant which also processes tantalum ore  when  required.    The  crushing  plant  comprises  a  1600mm  x  2500mm  Nordberg  C160  jaw  crusher,  a Nordberg 1560 Omnicone secondary cone crusher, a  Schenck  3.6m  x  7.6m  double  deck  vibrating  screen fitted with a 25mm aperture upper deck and 6 or 12mm aperture lower deck, a Nordberg 1560 Omnicone tertiary cone crusher and two Nordberg HP500  quaternary cone crushers.  Lower screen deck undersize is the crushing plant product and is conveyed to stockpiles for the TGP and CGP.  Upper deck oversize is fed to the tertiary crusher and lower deck oversize is fed to the two quaternary crushers.

Tantalum ore is not currently being processed and a portion of the spare crushing capacity is utilized when the ore is dry by changing the lower screen deck to 6mm aperture.  This enables a finer feed to be presented to the CGP.

The crushing plant generally operates at a throughput of 650 tonnes per hour ('tph') on tantalum ore and 250tph on lithium ore to minus 6mm and has an availability of 78%, giving it an annual throughput capacity of approximately 3.5Mtpa.  About 30% of the available crushing plant operating time is required for crushing the lithium ore and this proportion may increase with time as the tonnage of lithium ore processed increases.

## 17.3 Technical Grade Plant

The TGP is fed with lithium ore types in which the iron content of the spodumene is sufficiently low to enable production of higher grade lithium concentrates containing low levels of Fe O . 2 3

Crushed ore is fed by front-end loader from stockpiles to a feed bin from which it is discharged at a rate of between 27tph and 30tph to the wet grinding circuit.    The  grinding  circuit  comprises  two  ball  mills  (300 kilowatts ('kW') and 200kW installed power) closed by 700 µm aperture vibrating screens, which produce material ground to 80% finer than approximately 450 µm.

Ground TG feed is treated in a series of gravity, magnetic separation and flotation stages to produce the range of TG concentrates before these are filtered and dried.

TG concentrates scheduled for bulk shipment are stored in silos from which it is discharged into trucks for transport  to  Talison's  storage  sheds  in  the  Bunbury  area  to  await  shipment  to  customers.    Lithium concentrates  are  also  bagged  in  bulk  bags,  containerised  and  transported  to  Fremantle  for  shipment  on container vessels.

## 17.4 Chemical Grade Plant

The  CGP  is  fed  with  ore  in  which  the  iron  content  of  the  spodumene  is  too  high  to  produce  lithium concentrates meeting the specifications of TGP products.  CG ore is processed at a rate of 160tph through milling to 3mm and processing by gravity separation and floatation. The SC6.0 chemical grade product is filtered and transported to Bunbury Port for bulk shipment.

## 17.5 Production Capacity

In FY 2012, approximately 785,000t of ore was processed to produce 357,000t of lithium concentrates.  The lithium TG processing plant is currently operating at full production capacity. The CG plant was upgraded in 2011/2012  to  enable  processing  of  1.3mtpa  bringing  the  total  capacity  at  the  Greenbushes  operation  to 1.5mtpa. The concentrate product capacity for the two plants is approximately 740,000tpa.

## 19 MARKET STUDIES AND CONTRACTS

## 19.1 Lithium Market

## Background

Lithium is currently commercially produced from two sources: lithium rich salt brines and lithium bearing minerals (spodumene, petalite and lepidolite).

Two  distinct  markets  for  lithium  exist,  based  on  chemical  products  and  on  technical  products.    Lithium chemicals  are  used  in  a  wide  range  of  applications  including  primary  (non-rechargeable)  and  secondary (rechargeable) batteries, greases, aluminium production, air-conditioning systems, catalysts, pharmaceuticals, polymers  and  cements.    The  lithium  technical  market  comprises  the  glass,  ceramics  and  metallurgical industries which typically require products with low iron content.

Production  from  brines  is  the  major  source  of  lithium  chemicals,  while  minerals  can  either  be  consumed directly in the technical market or converted into lithium chemicals.

## Lithium Supply Outlook

Lithium market supply information has been compiled from various sources of publicly available information as well as Talison's view on the outlook for the supply of lithium.

## Existing Producers

Global production of lithium is highly concentrated by geography, corporate ownership and source of lithium (brine  lakes  or  mineral  deposits).  Roskill  Information  Services  Limited  ('Roskill'),  an  international marketing research group, estimated total global lithium production in 2010 to be approximately 123,000t LCE.  Roskill  estimates  that  in  2010  Talison  was  the  world's  largest  producer  of  lithium,  with  an approximately 28% market share, and Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile SA ('SQM') was the world's second largest producer, with an approximately 25% market share.  Figure 23 provides Roskill's estimate of global lithium supply by company in 2010.

The major global producers of lithium from mineral deposits are:

-  Talison, located in Australia;
-  Sociedade Mineira de Pegmatite, LDA, located in Portugal;
-  Galaxy Resources Limited, located in Australia;
-  Bikita Minerals (Pvt) Ltd, located in Zimbabwe; and
-  Various producers located in China.

Lithium  minerals  are  converted  into  lithium  chemicals  in  China.    The  majority  of  these  chemicals  are consumed  domestically  in  China;  however,  lithium  carbonate,  lithium  hydroxide  and  high  purity  lithium chemicals sourced from minerals are also exported by the Chinese chemical converters.

The major global producers of lithium from brine lakes are:

-  SQM, which has operations in the Salar de Atacama region in Chile;
-  Rockwood Lithium (previously known as Chemetall GmbH), which has operations in Chile adjacent to  SQM's  Salar  de  Atacama  facility,  as  well  as  the  Silver  Peak  plant  in  Nevada,  United States of America;
-  FMC Corporation, which has operations at the Salar del Hombre Muerto in north west Argentina;
-  Tibet  Zabuye  Lithium  Industry  High  Technology Co., Ltd.,  which  has  operations  in  Zabuye  Salt Lake in western Tibet; and
-  Qinghai  CITIC  Guoan  Science  and  Technology Co., Ltd.,  which  has  operations  near  Golmud  in central Western China.

Most of the lithium production from brines is used in the chemicals market with a small amount in the glass and  ceramics  technical  markets.    However,  the  lower  price  per  unit  of  lithium  minerals  compared  to chemicals as  well  as  the  inherent  benefits  of  the  alumina  and  silica  content  makes  minerals  the  preferred feedstock in the glass and ceramics market.

## Potential New Projects

The growth in lithium demand has resulted in renewed interest in the development of new and previously known lithium resources worldwide. There are a number of lithium brine deposits currently being assessed in Argentina,  Bolivia,  Chile,  China  and  the  United States  of America.  The  development  of  lithium  mineral projects is also being actively pursued in China, Canada, Finland, the United States of America and Australia. Alternative sources of lithium other than brines and traditional minerals are also being investigated, including hectorite clays in the United States and jadarite in Serbia.

Talison considers that the  key  reason  these  potential  new  projects  have  not  been  developed  in  the  past  is economic, as most of these new projects have lower grade deposits than the existing producers and therefore require  high  product  prices  in  order  to  be  viable.    Talison  believes  that  the  timelines  published  for development of some of these new projects are optimistic, that it will take longer to commence production of lithium at the maximum designed capacity than anticipated, and that the cost of production will be higher than anticipated. As such, Talison considers that some market commentators are overestimating the potential supply from new projects.

## Lithium Demand Outlook

Future lithium demand estimates have been prepared on the basis of various sources of publicly available information as well as Talison's view on the outlook for demand for lithium.

Roskill estimated total global lithium demand in 2011 to be approximately 125,000t LCE, with the largest markets  for  lithium  estimated  to  be  glass  and  ceramics  (30%)  and  lithium-ion  batteries  (22%).  Figure  24 provides Roskill's estimate of global lithium demand by application in 2011.

Figure 24: Estimated Lithium Demand by Application, 2011

Roskill

Growth in demand for lithium since 2000 has been primarily driven by demand for lithium chemicals in the secondary lithium battery market, where lithium batteries have become the primary power storage source for hand-held  electronic  equipment  such  as  cell  phones  and  portable  entertainment  devices  as  well  as  laptop computers and high-powered cordless tools.

Talison anticipates  that  global  growth  in  demand  for  lithium  will  continue,  driven  by  demand  for  lithium chemicals for use in lithium-ion batteries for consumer applications and electric vehicles.

## Lithium Chemicals

Strong  growth  in  lithium  consumption  is  expected  to  continue,  driven  primarily  by  the  secondary  lithium battery  market.    As  a  sign  of  confidence  in  future  market  growth,  many  of  the  large  secondary  battery manufacturers, such as Sony, Panasonic, LG Chem, and Samsung, have announced significant expansions to their production capacity.

As well as the traditional hand-held electronic and laptop markets for secondary batteries, there are further growth opportunities in a number of new applications, including electric bicycles and scooters, large format batteries for electric grid storage, such as storage for eco-power sources such as wind and solar energy. There is also potential growth in demand for lithium for use in nuclear reactors and large scale solar thermal power.

The most significant potential upside in demand is the development of electric vehicles powered by lithiumion batteries.  Major battery producers and vehicle manufactures around the world are currently developing lithium-ion batteries and electric vehicles, and several have entered into long term off-take agreements with lithium producers to secure supply of lithium.  As a result of concerns about energy security, as well as to reduce  dependence  on  imported  oil  and  assist  in  reducing  carbon  dioxide  emissions,  many  governments across the world have publicly announced policies and stimulus packages to advance the development and production of electric vehicles.

## Technical Market

While growth in the technical market for lithium is expected to be more modest than the chemical market, there are a number of growth areas, including using lithium as a replacement for lead in lighting glass and its use in new fibreglass applications.  The superior strength to weight ratio of lithium fibreglass is expected to allow  significant  increases  in  the  size  of  wind  turbine  blades,  thereby  improving  power  efficiency.  The introduction  of  lithium  into  the  production  of  glass  and  ceramics  lowers  the  melting  temperature,  thereby assisting to reduce energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions.

In  2009,  the  supply  of  lithium  minerals  into  the  technical  market  declined  with  the  closure  of  Tantalum Mining Company of Canada Ltd.'s ('TANCO') spodumene operation at Bernic Lake in Canada.  Talison believes it is now the sole supplier of low-iron lithium minerals into this market.

## 19.2 Contracts

Talison  has  various  contracts  providing  services  for  mining  and  product  shipments  for  the  Greenbushes Lithium Operations.  The major contracts are summarized in Table 19.1.  BDA has reviewed these contracts and  considers  that  they  are  in  line  with  current  industry  practice  and  the  rates  are  generally  in  line  with Australian  mining  industry.    Those  contracts  that  are  based  on  a  schedule  of  unit  rates  for  the  various activities include rise and fall formulae to allow for changes to the major contract components, such as labour costs and consumables, and reflect the structure of the contractors' inputs.  The original terms of the contracts are up to five years (with up to one year remaining) and the lease agreement with the Bunbury Port Authority was originally for a 21 year period and expires in 2018.  All contracts have the capacity to be extended at the consent of both parties which is within the expected terms for such contracts and lease agreements.

Talison  sells  the  majority  of  its  various  lithium  concentrates  through  sales  contracts/agreements  with  a number of overseas customers under terms of between per shipment and three years.  These sale agreements are  based  on  specific  shipment  volumes  per  year  and  specify  grain  size  and  the  minimum  and  maximum chemical composition of various minerals within the products.

Lithium concentrate pricing is generally set in the agreement and is either bulk shipments or bagged product depending on specifications.  Lithium concentrate pricing can be based either free on board at the port of shipment or cost of goods, marine insurance and all transportation (freight) charges paid to the foreign point of delivery.  The various contracts and sales agreements are considered by BDA to be in line with the norms for  the  industrial  minerals  industry.    Quality  control  of  products  is  essential  in  meeting  the  terms  of  sales contracts especially for some of the TG lithium concentrates; Talison has advised BDA that since Talison took  ownership  of  the  Greenbushes  Lithium  Operations,  the  specifications  have  generally  been  met  on shipments with the occasional element being outside specification but with no recorded rejection of lithium concentrate by customers.

## 20 ENVIRONMENTAL  STUDIES,  PERMITTING  AND  SOCIAL  OR  COMMUNITY IMPACT

## 20.1 Environmental Considerations

## Waste Rock Storage

The site's main waste rock dump is located immediately east of the open pits and is an approved facility. The LOM plan will require an approval from the DMP to lift the current waste dump by 10m to 20m and to extend the dump to the south.  Discussions have commenced with the DMP in relation to this proposal and a mining proposal will be submitted before the limit of the existing waste dump capacity is reached.  Approvals to clear native vegetation will also be required for the southern extension. An application for this clearing has been submitted and is currently being assessed.

On commencement of tantalum operations by GAM, Talison and GAM will agree on the cost of any waste dump expansions to meet joint future requirements.  Any capital cost in expanding the dumps will likely be offset by the contractor unit cost benefits (i.e. reductions) from the increased joint volume movement

.

## Tailing Storage Facilities

Tailings are stored on site in tailings storage facilities ('TSF') 1 and TSF 2. These two TSFs are located to the south of the plant with sub aerial deposition from the peripheral embankments, and water released from the tailings returned to the plant through centrally located pump-out decant.

TSF 2, the latest storage facility, was commissioned in 2006.  At present, TSF 2 provides adequate capacity and beaching area without the need to also operate TSF 1.  Further increases in the height of both TSF 1 and TSF  2  are  allowable  under  the  current  approval.  Geotechnical  work  is  currently  being  carried  out  to determine the ultimate heights and capacities of the TSFs.

## Environmental Management

Talison's  Greenbushes  Lithium  Operation  has  stringent  environmental  operating  conditions  which  are managed  through  an  Environmental  Management  System  which  is  certified  under  ISO  14001:2004 Environmental Management Standards.

Water for processing is sourced from rainfall and stored in several site process dams, with the majority of the water used being recovered and recycled throughout the site.  Surface water quality is measured and reported on a monthly basis.  Water quality monitoring bores located around the process plant and tailing dams are monitored quarterly to ensure the operation has minimal impact on ground water quality.

## Water Management

Water management on site aims to recycle and reuse as much water as possible.  The main process water flows  circulate  between  the  tantalum  primary  processing  plant  and  lithium  plants,  the  TSFs  and  the Austin's/Southampton  Dams.    Additional  flows  exist  between  other  constructed  water  storage  facilities (including Cowan Brook Dam, the site's largest water storage), the tantalum secondary plant and the mining pits.

## Environmental Bond

A statutory requirement of the DMP is the deposit of a site rehabilitation bond prior to the commencement of mining operations.  This bond is largely determined by the area of site disturbance and rehabilitation unit costs. The  bond  is  eventually  discharged  by  approval  of  DMP  at  the  completion  of  mining,  site decommissioning  and  final  rehabilitation.    The  current  environmental  bond  quantum  calculated  for  the Talison mine tenements by the DMP is A$3.91M.  Talison has lodged this bond amount with the DMP. The Western Australian Government is currently legislating to introduce a Mine Rehabilitation Fund into which mining  companies  will  pay  an  annual  fee  based  on  mine  disturbance.  This  will  replace  the  current  bond system.

## Plant Decommissioning and Site Rehabilitation Plan

The objective for closure, decommissioning and reclamation is to ensure, as far as practicable, that reclamation achieves  a  stable  and  functioning  landform  that  is  consistent  with  the  surrounding  landscape  and  other environmental values.

| Talison Lithium Limited - Greenbushes Lithium Operations                                            December 2012                    |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Behre Dolbear Australia Pty Limited                                                                                          Page 92 |

Adequate closure planning is required in all phases of project development to ensure that Talison and its key stakeholders are fully aware of the requirements of closure and that appropriate provisions are made to ensure that  decommissioning  and  rehabilitation  is  completed.  Talison  has  calculated  an  estimated  closure  cost  of A$16.4M based on the current site disturbance documented in the 2011-2012 Annual Environmental Review Report.

There are areas of historic mining disturbances of which about half the area is subject to hand-back negotiations with regulators which are expected to be completed within two years.  Of the total 1,800ha disturbed by mining it  is  expected  that  1,200ha  will  be  required  to  be  excised  from  the  State  Forest.    An  appropriate  provision  to purchase an equivalent area of land to exchange with the State has been included in the closure cost estimate.

## 21 CAPITAL AND OPERATING COSTS

## 21.1 Life of Mine Production Plan

The  LOM  production  plan  is  prepared  from  the  start  of  the  FY  2013,  taking  into  account  the  Mineral Reserves  and  the  actual  production  during  the  third  quarter  of  2012  (July  to  September).    As  part  of  the production plan, an estimate of the feed tonnages to the two plants, TGP and CGP, has been made.  The following paragraphs set out the procedure of defining the TG feed tonnages, with the remaining feed going to the CGP.

## Definition of Technical Grade Ore Feed in the Processing Plant

TG ore types feed a specific circuit in the processing plant to produce lithium products with specific chemical and physical characteristics. The TG ore type has been defined in previous Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves by limits placed on contained iron, sodium and potassium for a specific range of lithium contents. Characterisation  of  the  TG  ore  type  in  the  mine  production  stream  assists  in  managing  the  scheduling  of production of TG lithium concentrate from the TGP.

The in-pit definition of the ore types that will produce TG lithium concentrates in the processing plant is becoming  increasingly  complex  as  the  pit  progresses  and  complexity  of  ore  type  distribution  in  the  pit increases. Ore blending opportunities from the ROM stockpiles have also increased the flexibility of the TGP to produce TG lithium concentrates. Due to the wide range of chemical variables that impact on the quality and  specific  characteristics  of  the  TG  lithium  concentrates,  a  high  degree  of  flexibility  is  required  in  the selection  of  ore  types  to  feed  the  TGP  and  produce  TG  lithium  concentrates  suitable  to  customer requirements.

In addition, the updated 2012 Mineral Resource model is based on lithium domains constructed with 0.7% Li O and 2.8% Li O boundary conditions whereas the previous Mineral Resource model applied a 1.0% Li O 2 2 2 boundary condition. The updated 2012 Mineral Resource model produces a better supported and smoother estimate at average and low lithium grades. Further, by applying at 2.8% Li O boundary condition it also 2 supports  the  tonnage  and  grade  distribution  relationships  at  the  higher  Li O  grade  ranges  which  are  the 2 sources of the ore types that feed the TGP.

As in the 2011 Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves, a separate definition of the tonnage and grade of both TG and CG ore types is not included in the updated 2012 Mineral Resources or the Mineral Reserves. A schedule of feed material to the TGP, including tonnage and grade, is required for the operational plan. To achieve  this,  in  the  2012  mining  and  processing  schedules  TG  ore  types  are  defined  by  experience-based criteria for Li O and Fe O  contents.  This quantity of TG ore type is approximately 3.4Mt at 4.2% Li O. 2 2 3 2

## Production Forecast

Table  21.1  provides  a  forecast  production  schedule  based  on  the  Proven  and  Probable  Mineral  Reserves contained within the current pit designs.  The orebody is already exposed in both the C1 and C3 pits and the current LOM strip ratio of waste to ore is 2.2:1.

| 2019                    | 1,926             |                        2.1 | 780                         |
| 2020                    | 2,071             |                        1.9 | 870                         |
| 2021-36                 | 48,380            |                        2.3 | 17,068                      |
| Total                   | 61,296   1        |                        2.2 | 22,179                      |

Note:  (1) Total ore mined exceeds the in-pit Mineral Reserves due to the inclusion of three months production from July to September in FY 2013.

Talison's development strategy is to continue to maintain Mineral Reserves in excess of a 20 year mine life at any point in time.  Further opportunities exist to either increase production or extend mine life with additional exploration drilling, as the orebody remains open both along strike and at depth.

Production  in  previous  years  has  been  limited  by  the  capacity  of  Talison's  processing  plants.    In  2009, Talison's processing plants were upgraded to nominal production capacity of approximately 260,000tpa of lithium concentrate then in 2010 they increased further to a nominal production capacity of approximately 315,000tpa of lithium concentrates and in mid-2012 they increase to the current nominal production capacity of approximately 740,000tpa of lithium concentrates to meet the anticipated demand for lithium concentrate. The lithium industry is driven by market demand. Talison's production assumptions are based on increasing production in line with an anticipated strong demand growth, particularly in China. The expanded CGP is not operating at full capacity; however, the expanded CGP provides Talison with the capacity to respond quickly to meet the expected strong growth in demand and to maintain market share.

## 21.2 Capital and Operating Costs

## Capital Costs

Total capital expenditure in FY 2012 was A$68.5M which was mainly related to the expansion of the CGP, and A$4.4M is estimated to be spent in FY 2013, of which, A$0.8M is for research and development and A$3.7M is estimated to be spent on sustaining capital.

Capital expenditure of A$201M is forecast to be expended over the LOM from and including FY2013.   A breakdown of the proposed capital expenditure is presented in Table 21.2.

Table 21.2 Forecast Capital Expenditure

| Activity                 |   LOM Total  (A$M) |
|--------------------------|--------------------|
| Research and Development |                 11 |
| Process Improvements     |                 11 |
| Capacity Expansions      |                136 |
| Sustaining Capital       |                 43 |
| Total                    |                201 |

## Operating Costs

A summary of the estimated average LOM operating costs is listed in Table 21.3.  Projected average operating costs over the LOM are lower than expected operating costs in FY 2013, as rates of production are expected to be higher and economies of scale achieved as production increases.

Table 21.3 Projected Average LOM Operating Costs

| Activity         | Unit                     |   Unit Cost |
|------------------|--------------------------|-------------|
| Mining           | A$/t ore mined           |          18 |
| Processing       | A$/t ore processed       |          23 |
| G&A              | A$/t ore processed       |           2 |
| Selling Expenses | A$/t lithium concentrate |          80 |

Mining costs vary between A$12/t and A$28/t of ore, depending on the waste to ore strip ratio, over the LOM.

Selling expenses include packaging, land transport, storage, ship loading, royalties and marketing development costs as well as shipping freight costs.

Operating costs do not include Talison's corporate costs.

## 22 ECONOMIC ANALYSIS

## 22.1 Economic Analysis

Talison has developed a detailed LOM cash flow forecast model for the Greenbushes Lithium Operations using only Proven Mineral Reserves and Probable Mineral Reserves based on the following macroeconomic assumptions.

## Exchange Rates

The product prices in US$ have been converted into A$ using an exchange rate of US$/A$1.01 for FY 2013, US$/A$0.98  for  FY  2014  and  US$/A$0.96  thereafter;  the  exchange  rate  forecast  has  been  provided  by Talison's management.

## Prices

BDA notes  that  spodumene  is  not  a  publicly  traded  commodity  and  therefore  limited  publicly  available reference  prices  are  available  for  the  range  of  lithium  concentrates  produced  by  Talison.    The  weighted average  real  (2012)  price,  over  the  entire  range  of  lithium  concentrates,  used  in  the  economic  analysis, averages US$346/t over the LOM.

The basis for the pricing is as follows:

FY  2013  prices  reflect  contracted  pricing  achieved  by  Talison  and  Talison  management's  forecasts  for unpriced sales for the year.

Global production of TG lithium concentrates declined in 2009 with the closure of TANCO's spodumene operation.    During  FY  2011,  supply  tightened  and  Talison  was  not  been  able  to  meet  global  demand; however,  in  2012  demand  has  been  affected  by  poor  global  economic  conditions,  particularly  in  Europe Despite  the  softening  in  demand,  Talison  achieve  a  15%  price  increase  across  all  TG  lithium  concentrate products in January 2012.  Talison management is forecasting prices of TG lithium concentrates to increase in FY 2013, FY 2014 and FY 2015 before remaining flat thereafter. Production of TG lithium concentrates is currently scheduled to finish in FY 2028.

The price of CG lithium concentrate was reduced in late 2008 in response to the global financial crisis and the announcement by SQM in late 2009 of a 20% reduction in lithium carbonate prices kept prices subdued in  calendar  2010  and  2011.    Global  demand  for  lithium  increased  during  calendar  2012  and  Talison management expects it to continue to increase, driven primarily by the secondary lithium battery market for consumer applications in the next few years and by demand for batteries for electric vehicles from around 2015.  Talison management is forecasting prices for CG lithium concentrate to increase in FY 2013 and in FY 2014 before remaining flat in real terms thereafter.

## Tax and Royalty

In WA, a royalty of 5% is paid to the State Government for lithium mineral production and is described in Section 4.4 - Royalties.  Royalties are included in Operating Expenditure in Table 22.1.

The Australian tax system is controlled by the Australian Taxation Office.  Corporate income tax is applied at a rate of 30%.  The economic analysis of the Greenbushes Lithium Operations has been prepared on a pre-tax basis.

The Australian Government introduced carbon price tax on 1 July 2012 at an initial rate of A$23 per tonne of carbon emitted above a certain level. The Greenbushes Lithium Operations does not emit sufficient carbon to trigger the carbon tax; however, it is expect that the carbon tax will indirectly lead to a one time increase in costs throughout the Australian economy which will impact on the Greenbushes Lithium Operations.

## Forecast Cash flows

The project's real, before tax, ungeared project cash flows are presented in Table 22.1

Based on Talison's cost and production projections, the operation remains cash flow positive throughout the LOM.  The NPV of the Greenbushes Lithium Operations, based on the projected pre-tax cash flows and applying a real discount rate of 9%, is A$1,043M.

The sensitivity of the NPV to ±5%, ±10% and ±15% changes to capital costs, operating costs, product yields (metric for grade) and prices is presented in Figure 25.

The yield and prices sensitivities are similar given that changes to yield, providing more or less product to be sold at base case pricing, provides a similar result to holding production constant and varying prices.

Talison Lithium Ltd

## 23 ADJACENT PROPERTIES

Greenbushes  is  the  only  major  lithium  deposit  of  its  type  in  the  southern  portion  of  the  Western  Gneiss Province of WA. Tenements adjacent to the Talison properties do not contain any reported lithium Mineral Resources and are therefore not relevant to this assessment.

## 24 OTHER RELEVANT DATA AND INFORMATION

## 24.1 Company Structure

The following details of property and mineral rights over the Greenbushes Lithium Operations and associated tenements are provided to give clarification of the rights applying to Talison.

Talison  has  six  wholly-owned  subsidiaries  as  set  out  in  Figure  26.    Talison  owns  and  operates  the Greenbushes Lithium Operations through its wholly-owned subsidiaries TLA, Talison Services and Talison Minerals, which are each incorporated under the Corporations Act 2001 (Commonwealth of Australia).

Figure 26:  Talison Lithium Limited Corporate Structure

Talison Lithium Ltd

Talison acquired the Greenbushes  Lithium  Operations  comprising  real  property, mining  tenements, intellectual  property,  goodwill,  contracts,  and  plant  and  equipment,  including  two  lithium  ore  treatment plants, three open pit mines, and associated infrastructure at Greenbushes in south-west WA in 2010 upon completion  of  the  reorganization  of  the  lithium  and  tantalum  businesses  previously  held  by  the  Talison Minerals Group.

As a result of the reorganization the tantalum business was acquired by GAM, including the rights to all other minerals other than lithium on the Greenbushes tenements, the crushing facility, the tantalum primary and secondary  plants  and  access  to  the  Greenbushes  tenements.    The  lithium  Mineral  Reserves  and  Mineral Resources and the tantalum mineralization and related processing facilities are located on the same tenements at Greenbushes.  GAM's operations are currently on care and maintenance.

Talison and GAM, through their respective subsidiaries, are party to a series of agreements entered into in connection with the reorganization relating to development, production and operational matters at Greenbushes.

While Talison is the registered owner of the mining tenements, a Reserved Mineral Rights Agreement dated November 13, 2009 provides GAM with the rights to access the Greenbushes tenements to explore for all minerals other than lithium and, if economically viable, to mine and process these minerals.  Included within this agreement are the mechanisms for both parties to agree on exploration and mining for their respective minerals.

The crushing license agreement dated November 13, 2009 provides Talison with a license to crush its ore though the crushing facility  owned by GAM.  In the event that GAM re-starts the tantalum operations at Greenbushes,  Talison  may  either  negotiate  to  continue  crushing  its  ore  through  the  facility  or  source  an alternative facility to crush lithium ore.  GAM must provide Talison with 12 months' notice if it intends to restart the tantalum operations and utilize the crushing facility.

Talison  owns  the  infrastructure  for  the  Greenbushes  Lithium  Operations,  including  the  buildings,  utilities (gas, water supply, power) waste dumps and tailings dams.  A shared services agreement dated November 13, 2009 provides a mechanism for GAM to access and share these facilities.

The areas containing  the  crusher,  tantalum  primary  and  secondary  plants  on  Talison's  tenements  are  subleased to GAM.

## 24.2 Mine Life and Exploration Potential

Talison's  Greenbushes  Lithium  Operations  has  a  LOM  plan  for  24  years  after  completion  of  a  further expansion to treat 3.0mtpa of ore in 2018.

No significant Mineral Resource or Mineral Reserve extensions to the ore types providing feed to the TGP are known at this time.  However, there is potential for additional Mineral Resources providing feed to the CGP to be developed:

-  From existing Indicated Mineral Resources not currently included in the mine schedule - some 57Mt of lithium Indicated Mineral Resources remain outside the current pit designs and above 950RL, primarily in the C3 area.  These Mineral Resources are not translating to Mineral Reserves under current operating parameters, but further improvement in lithium prices, plant performance or operating costs could allow their  development.    Equally,  re-opening  of  tantalum  mining  in  the  C3  area  would  provide  low  cost access to the adjacent lithium Mineral Resources.
-  North of, and at depth in the C3 mining area, south of the C1 mining area, and in the footwall of the Central Lode, based on current Inferred Mineral Resources, and on recent exploration targeting under the weathering surface.

In addition, there is lithium contained within the tantalum mineralization areas which is currently not being mined. If the tantalum operation is reactivated, lithium can be recovered as a by-product from the tantalum tailings stream under an agreement with GAM, provided the grade and recovery are sufficient.

As this report has been prepared in connection with the recent update of Talison's lithium Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves at its Greenbushes Lithium Operations, no capital is required to be spent in the future in relation to this update of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves, and therefore the calculation of and discussion in relation to a payback period is not relevant.

## 25 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS

The geology of the Greenbushes deposit is reasonably well understood.

The data that has been used to estimate lithium Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves have been checked and validated.  Assay precision for Li O is considered acceptable and on-going work is aimed at improving 2 precision further.

The Mineral Resources total 0.6Mt at 3.2% Li O of Measured Mineral Resource (stockpiles), 117.9Mt at 2 2.4% Li2 O of Indicated Mineral Resource and 2.1Mt at 2.0% Li O of Inferred Mineral Resource at a 0.7% 2 Li O domain boundary condition. The majority of the Mineral Resources lie within and adjacent to the C3 2 and C1 pits.

The Mineral Reserves total 0.6Mt at 3.2% Li O of Proven Mineral Reserves and 61.0Mt at 2.8% Li O of 2 2 Probable  Mineral  Reserves  at  a  1.8%  Li O  cut-off  grade.    All  Mineral  Reserves  are  contained  within  the 2 Mineral Resources.

The open pit ore zones are relatively wide, with typical mining block (blasting) widths of between 20-30m and  ground  conditions  are  good.    BDA  considers  the  mine  design  generally  appropriate  and  the  mine schedule achievable.  The estimated mine recovery and dilution factors appear optimistic, but are in line with historical reconciliation data and are therefore accepted as generally reasonable.

The future recovery of feed for the TGP may be slightly optimistic and require some improvement to grade control and mining practices to achieve the same recovery as previously achieved, given that the C3 deposit becomes more complex at depth. The operation has a history of reliable production over more than twenty five  years.    Talison's  projections  of  future  production  include  progressive  increases  in  the  tonnage  of products.    These  increases  are  justified  by  market  research  which  predicts  continuing  growth  in  lithium consumption  driven  primarily  by  the  lithium  secondary  battery  market  which  included  batteries  for  the developing electric and hybrid vehicle market.

There is potential for additions to the Greenbushes lithium Mineral Resource along strike to the north and south of the current mining areas, and at depth.

## 26 RECOMMENDATIONS

Further investigation into the definition of ore types suitable as feed to the TPG in situ and in the block model is recommended.

QG recommends that Talison considers improvement in grade control procedures for the determination of TGP feed within the orebody in the C3 pit to minimize any potential risk to the production schedule from dilution due to the added complexity of the mineralization at lower levels within the planned open pit. The cost of this recommendation is expected to be minimal and absorbed into the unit costs of grade control. The sampling  and  analysis  QA/QC  procedures  applied  to  grade  control  and  Mineral  Resource  drilling  should continue  to  be  assessed  and  upgraded  to  help  define  sampling  errors  at  each  stage  of  the  process  and  to improve the accuracy with which grade and material quality boundaries can be drawn.

It  is  recommended  that  drilling  and  modelling  continue  to  be  carried  out  to  improve  planning  and  design options leading to improved recovery of the resource, and to upgrade the Mineral Resource category of the known Inferred Mineral Resources.  The cost of such drilling and modelling is estimated at around A$0.3M in FY 2013.

Further opportunities for extensions to the current Mineral Resources and additions to the current Mineral Reserves exist  within  and  around  the  current  mining  areas.  Drilling  programs  are  proposed  over  the  next three years to test these opportunities. The cost of the programs outlined above is not considered significant and Talison has indicated that they can be funded from operating cash flow.

While there has been on-going geotechnical review of the open pit over many years and there have been no significant issues with wall stability, it is recommended that a review of the open pit slope design of the final Mineral Reserve pit be carried out.  It is envisaged that the review would determine whether the parameters used in the design could be further optimised and whether the risk levels are appropriate.  This work should occur over the next 10 years prior to commencement of the final pit cutback.
