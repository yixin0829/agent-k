## 1.0) SUMMARY

- · This report provides an update of exploration and a tungsten resource evaluation for  the  Jersey-Emerald  property,  located  near  to  the  community  of  Salmo  in south-eastern  British  Columbia.    The  authors  of  this  report  were  retained  by Sultan  Minerals  Inc.  to  review  and  assess  the  results  of  exploration  work conducted  on  the  property  and  complete  preliminary  resource  calculations  for tungsten  mineralization  within  the  Emerald  Mine  and  East  Emerald  Tungsten zones  of  the  property.    This  preliminary  resource  follows  a  2006  preliminary tungsten  resource  that  was  reported  for  the  Invincible  and  Dodger-East  Dodger zones of the property.  Most of the background information contained within this report  was  extracted  from  the  2006  report.    Recommendations  for  further exploration are provided. Author Perry Grunenberg, P.Geo, has directly supervised much of the work carried out by Sultan Minerals Inc. on the property to date. Author  Gary  Giroux,  P.Eng,  is  an  independent  qualified  person contracted  to  complete  modeling  and  resource  calculations  on  the  project  data, collected by Sultan Minerals Inc.
- · In  October  of  1993,  Sultan  Minerals  Inc  entered  into  an  option  agreement  with Lloyd Addie and Robert Bourdon to purchase a 100% interest in the Jersey Claim Group near Salmo, British Columbia. The claims overlie the former Jersey and Emerald lead-zinc-silver mines and the Emerald, Dodger and Invincible tungsten mines  operated  by  Canadian  Exploration  Ltd.  a  wholly-owned  subsidiary  of Placer Development Ltd. (now Placer Dome) from 1947 to 1973.  Sultan Minerals Inc. also acquired a 100% ownership in the surrounding ground by staking.  Once the  property  was under agreement, Sultan conducted exploration programs with the intent of exploring for precious and base metals.
- · The property is located in south-eastern British Columbia centred at approximate UTM  coordinates  of  5438700  N  and  0484000  E.    The  claims  are  located approximately ten kilometres southeast of the community of Salmo.  The JerseyEmerald Property covers an area of approximately 30 square kilometres, between the Salmo River on the west and the peak of Nevada Mountain on the east, and is bounded  on  the  north  by  Sheep  Creek  and  on  the  south  by  Lost  Creek.    The property consists of a block of 44 crown granted claims totalling 660.36 ha, and 72 mineral claims comprising 8634.5 ha, in the Nelson Mining Division.
- · Access to the Jersey-Emerald Property is via Highway 6 between the town of Salmo and the Highway 3 junction to Creston.  A network of good quality, gravel mine roads provide excellent access to the centre of the property from Highway 6, which is situated along the west edge of the property.
- · The earliest record of exploration in the area dates to 1895 when gossanous outcrops on the south side of Iron Mountain attracted the attention of prospectors.  In 1906 lead  mineralization  was  discovered  on  the  Emerald  claims.    Several  small,  high

grade  ore  shipments  were  made  and  in  1910  Iron  Mountain  Ltd.  was  formed  by Pacific  Coast  Steel  of  San  Francisco  to  develop  the  property.    A  25  ton  mill  was erected in 1919 and operated until 1926 when low metal prices forced closure.  In 1934  the  mill  was  destroyed  by  a  major  forest  fire.    In  1938,  tungsten  and molybdenite  mineralization  was  discovered  in  skarn  bands  at  the  site  of  the  long abandoned  gold  workings  on  the  Emeral,  Emerald  Fraction  and  Gold  Standard claims.  In 1942, the Emerald Tungsten Mine was put into production for the war effort by Wartime Metals Corp., a Federal Government Agency.  Operations were suspended in 1943 when the war demand for tungsten eased.  The property remained inactive  until  1947  when  Canadian  Exploration  Ltd.  (later  Placer  Dome  Ltd.) purchased the property of Iron Mountain Ltd.  Placer Dome eventually purchased the  government  held  tungsten  reserves  and  tungsten  mill  in  1952.    Tungsten production recommenced in 1947 and lead-zinc production began in 1949.  Leadzinc concentrate was produced from two zones:  the Jersey and the Emerald LeadZinc Deposits.  Tungsten concentrate was produced from four zones:  the Emerald, Feeney,  Invincible  and  Dodger  deposits.    Production  continued  until  September 1973  when  the  mine  was  closed  due  to  low  metal  prices  and  negative  economic factors.  Over the mine life 7,968,080 tons of lead-zinc ore grading 1.95% Pb and 3.83% Zn, and 1,597,802 tons of tungsten ore grading 0.76% WO3 were mined and milled.

- · In  October  of  1993,  the  property  was  optioned  by  Sultan  Minerals  Inc.    Sultan undertook  an  exploration  program  that  entailed  ground  and  airborne  geophysical surveys,  prospecting  and  rock  chip  sampling.    This  work  led  to  the  identification  of several targets believed to have potential for gold mineralization.  During the winter of 1994-95  an  eleven  hole  (1,324  metres)  diamond  drill  program  was  undertaken  by Sultan to follow up targets identified by the previous work.  Drilling resulted in the discovery of several gold bearing zones in the vicinity of both the Jersey Lead-Zinc Deposit and the Emerald Tungsten Deposit.  The drilling also intersected a lead-zinc zone  situated  55  metres  below  the  former  Jersey  Lead-Zinc  Deposit.    In  1996,  an exploration program consisting of soil and silt sampling, geological mapping, prospecting,  rock  sampling  and  diamond  drilling  was  carried  out  on  the  property  to better delineate mineralized areas identified to date.  A total of 3 underground and 13 surface diamond drill holes were completed for a total of 1,707 metres.  Drilling was designed  to  test  the  gold  potential  of  the  Bismuth-Gold  zone,  Emerald  Gold  zone, Leroy Gold zone and the lower lead-zinc horizon.  Three drill holes were completed to the  east  of  the  mine  area  to  test  an  anomalous  multi-element  geochemical  zone delineated  from  surface  exploration,  called  the  East  Ridge  zone.    Exploration  on  the claims  was  inactive  until  market  values  for  molybdenum  increased  dramatically  in 2005.  With the improved molybdenum prices, Sultan Minerals conducted exploration for molybdenum focussing on the Dodger Mine area where mine records indicated the presence  of  molybdenite.  As  well,  an  assessment  of  the  potential  tungsten  resources was undertaken and target areas surrounding the Dodger Tungsten, and Emerald and Invincible Tungsten historic mines were delineated.
- · In  2006  and  2007  exploration  on  the  property  continued  in  an  effort  to  expand  the molybdenum mineralization in the Dodger Mine area, expand the tungsten

mineralization in the Invincible and Emerald mine areas, and continue to test for leadzinc resources.

- · The Jersey Emerald property lies near the south end of the Kootenay Arc and is underlain by rocks of the Cambrian Laib Formation and the Ordovician Active Formation. This is a sequence of transitional rocks comprised of mixed carbonates and  pelites.    In  the  vicinity  of  the  property  the  Laib  Formation  has  been  further subdivided into the Truman Member, comprised of interbedded thin grey and white, locally  dolomitic  limestone;  the  Emerald  Member,  a  black  argillite  unit;  and  the Upper Laib Formation, comprised of green phyllite and micaceous quartzites. These rocks, have been intruded by granite of the Nelson batholith.
- · Mineralization  on  the  Jersey  property  is  associated  with  the  east  limb  of  a complex major anticlinal structure referred to locally as the Jersey anticline and regionally  as  the  Salmo  River  anticline.    The  HB  lead-zinc  mine  located  four kilometres  to  the  north  and  the  Reeves  MacDonald  lead-zinc  mine  located  ten kilometres  to  the  south  are  also  associated  with  this  major  structure.    Several zones of significant and often very different mineralization have been identified on the property.  Historically mined areas produced lead-zinc and tungsten, with known  areas  of  high molybdenum,  gold,  bismuth,  arsenic, copper, silver, cadmium and barium.
- · To date,  within  the  Emerald  East  Tungsten  target  area,  Sultan  has  completed  a total of 24 diamond drill holes totalling 3689 metres (12,102 feet).  This drilling was  designed  to  intersect  a  skarn  band  that  was  shown  to  contain  tungsten mineralization  as  evidenced  by  historic  diamond  drilling  conducted  during  the 1940's to 1970's.
- · The  tungsten  resource  estimate  in  this  study  is  made  up  of  several  different discrete  tungsten  bearing  zones:  the  Emerald,  which  surrounds  the  old  mine workings, and the East Emerald and the Lower East Emerald (both to the Northnortheast of the Emerald).
- · In the Emerald mine area a cap level of 2 standard deviations above the mean of population 2, a value of 8.0 % WO3, was used to cap 16 assays. Within the East Emerald zones a total  of  6  overlapping  lognormal  populations  were  partitioned from the total data set.  A similar strategy was used to cap 5 assays at 1.1 % WO3.
- · For  all  zones  10  foot  (3.05  m)  down  hole  composites  were  produced  for  the segments  of  drill  holes  within  the  mineralized  solids.    Tungsten  grades  were interpolated into the block model by ordinary kriging.
- · A total of 100 pieces of drill core from the East Emerald zone were measured for specific gravity by the weight in air-weight and in water method.  Samples were taken from both mineralized and unmineralized sections of core.  Blocks within the  mineralized  zone  but  with  grades  less  than  0.05  %  WO3  were  assigned  an

average SG of 3.05 (tonnage factor of 10.51 cu. ft./ton).  Blocks with grades from 0.05  to  0.1  %  WO3  were  assigned  a  specific  gravity  of  3.11  (tonnage  factor  of 10.31 cu.  ft/ton).    Blocks  with  grades  from  0.1  to  0.5  %  WO3  were  assigned  a specific gravity of 3.16 (tonnage factor of 10.14 cu. ft/ton) the average of samples between 0.1 and 0.5 % WO3.  Blocks with grades greater than 0.5 % WO3 were assigned a value of 3.24 (tonnage factor of 9.89 cu. ft/ton).  The parts of blocks in the  waste  surrounding  the  skarn  zone  were  assigned  a  value  of  2.77  (tonnage factor of 11.57 cu. ft./ton).

- · Within  the  Emerald  tungsten  zone  tonnages  within  blocks  were  adjusted  to account for underground mining.  Detailed underground level plans and sections were digitized to produce a reasonable 3 dimensional model of the underground stopes  and  drifts.    The  proportion  of  underground  voids  within  each  block  was determined  and  this  amount  of  material  was  subtracted  from  the  tonnage calculated for each block.
- · The results are presented in two forms, one set estimated if the company could mine  to  the  limits  of  the  mineralized  three  dimensional  solids  and  a  second estimated if  one  had  to  mine  to  the  limits  of  the  25  x  25  x  25  ft.  blocks.    The results  obtained  from  actual  mining  would  probably  lie  between  these  two extremes.
- · The results for the mineralized solids provide an indicated resource of 256,000 tons averaging 0.19% WO3 at a 0.15% cutoff, and 18,000 tons with an average grade of 0.28% WO3 at a 0.24% cutoff.  The inferred resource is 1,122,000 tons with average grade of 0.27% WO3 at 0.15% cutoff and 430,000 tons averaging 0.45% WO3 at a cutoff of 0.24%.
- · The results  for  the 25  x  25  x  25  foot  blocks provide  an indicated resource  of 209,000 tons averaging 0.19% WO3 at a 0.15% cutoff, and 12,000 tons averaging 0.29%  WO3  at  a  0.24%  cutoff.    The inferred resource  is  1,110,000  tons averaging  0.29%  WO3  at  a  0.15%  cutoff,  and  470,000  tons  averaging  0.43% WO3 at a 0.24% cutoff.
- · The 2006 report (Grunenberg and Giroux) on the resource estimate for tungsten in the Dodger 4200 and Invincible mine areas provided a measured and indicated resource  of  2,510,000  tons  averaging  0.37%  WO3,  and  an  inferred  resource  of 1,210,000  tons  averaging  0.40%  WO3,  all  at  a  0.15%  cutoff.    The  additional resource  estimate  provided  in  this  2008  report  totals  209,000  tons  averaging 0.19% indicated and 1,110,000 tons averaging 0.29% inferred.
- · By combining the weighted average of the 2006 and 2008 reported resources, the total  resource  estimate  is  2,719,000  tons  averaging  0.36%  WO3  measured  plus indicated, and 2,320,000 tons averaging 0.34% WO3 inferred.

- · Recommendations are made to further explore the tungsten mineralization on the Jersey  Project.    The  preliminary  resource  estimates  are  substantial,  but  further infill definition drilling, and drilling within the historic mined  zones  for verification of the historic reported grades, is required to move the resource to the 'measured'  category.    As  well,  scoping  and  economic  studies  are  required  to establish cutoff grades for possible underground and open pit mining scenarios.
- · Recommendation,  consistent  with  the  2006  Preliminary  Resource  Estimate,  is also made to dewater the Invincible Mine workings to provide direct access to the tungsten  resource  available  surrounding  the  mine  workings,  and  sections  of  the East Emerald target zone.
- · Total cost for continued exploration with definition and verification drilling, and trenching  of  the  tungsten  resource,  is  estimated  at  $1,295,500.    Total  cost  for completion  of  work  required  to  complete  an  economic  study  for  tungsten extraction  is  estimated  at  $99,000.    The  combined  total  cost  to  complete  the recommended work is estimated at $1,358,500.

## 2.0) INTRODUCTION

This report provides a summary and updated resource evaluation for tungsten mineralization on the Jersey-Emerald property, located near to the community of Salmo in  south-eastern  British  Columbia.    The  authors  of  this  report  were  retained  by  Sultan Minerals Inc. to review and assess the results of the previous 2 years exploration work conducted on the property, and update the preliminary resource calculations for tungsten mineralization encountered on the property.  The tungsten resource had been previously assessed  and  summarized  in  a  report  completed  by  Giroux  and  Grunenberg  in  2006 (Summary Report and Preliminary Resource Calculation on the Dodger 4200 Molybdenum  Zone,  and  Tungsten  Zones,  Jersey-Emerald  Property).    At  that  time  a preliminary resource for tungsten mineralization within the Invincible and Dodger-East Dodger zones of the property was estimated.  Recommendations for further exploration were also provided.

Sultan  Minerals  has  continued  exploration  as  recommended  to  expand  the  tungsten mineralization on the property, thus providing increased data for updating the tungsten resource evaluation.  This exploration for tungsten has primarily taken place within the Emerald  Tungsten  Mine  and  East  Emerald  zones.    A  review  and  update  of  historic drilling conducted by previous property owners was also utilized in the resource estimate for tungsten provided in this report.

Author Perry Grunenberg, P.Geo, directly supervised the majority of work carried out by Sultan  Minerals  Inc.  on  the  property  to  date.    Author  Gary  Giroux,  P.Eng,  is  an independent qualified person contracted to complete modeling and resource calculations on the project data being collected by Sultan Minerals Inc.  Author Giroux has visited the property on February 19 -20, 2009.

This  technical  report  is  prepared  in  compliance  with  the  requirements  of  National Instrument 43 - 101 and is intended for use as a supporting document to be filed with the British Columbia Securities Commission and the TSX Venture Exchange.  Imperial Units of measure are used in the Resource estimation and for all property work in order to be consistent with the  historic mine grid and the results of more than 5,000 diamond drill holes completed over the 60 year mine life.

In October of 1993, the Company entered into an option agreement with Lloyd Addie and Robert Bourdon, whereby the Issuer acquired an option to purchase a 100% interest in the  Jersey  Claim  Group  near  Salmo,  British  Columbia,  for  consideration  of  200,000 shares of the Issuer and cash payments totaling $43,389. The claims overlie the former Jersey and Emerald lead, zinc and tungsten mines operated by Placer Dome from 1947 to 1973.

The Company's interest in the Jersey Emerald property is subject to a 3% NSR, which can be reduced to 1.5% by making additional cash and share payments totaling $500,000 and 50,000 shares on completion of a positive feasibility study. The property is subject to an  advance  royalty  payment  that  was  due  to  commence  on  October  2000.    In  October 2000 an amendment to the agreement extended the start of the royalty payments to 2004 and in October 2004 a second amendment extended the start of the royalty payments to 2009. In consideration, 400,000 common shares were issued to the royalty holders.

In May 2005, the Company entered into a purchase agreement to acquire the Invincible Tungsten  Mine  property,  covering  an  area  of  25  hectares.    Sultan  will  purchase  the property  from  the  Seller  for  a  cash  payment  of  $3,000  and  9,000  common  shares  of Sultan  common  stock  and  will  acquire  a  100%  right,  title  and  interest  in  and  to  the property, subject to a 2% Net Smelter Return royalty ("NSR"), which Sultan may, at its discretion,  reduce  to  a  0.5%  NSR  by  the  payment  of  $150,000  to  the  Seller  after  the completion of a positive feasibility study; and an Annual Advance Royalty Payment of $3,000,  which  will  commence  in  year  2010.    The  Invincible  Mine  property  is  located within the Jersey Emerald property boundary.

The  optioned  property  is  comprised  of  28  crown  granted  mineral  claims,  4  two-post claims and 80 mineral units encompassing approximately 1,700 hectares in the Nelson Mining  Division.  The  property  has  since  been  expanded  by  staking,  optioning  and purchasing additional claims and now includes 47 crown granted mineral claims, 60 twopost claims and 278 mineral units in 15 four-post claims.

There are no other pre-production royalties, back-in rights or other agreements or encumbrances to these claims with respect to Sultan's option right to them known to the author.  There are no environmental liabilities existing on the property.

Sultan Minerals has been actively purchasing surface lands that cover the Jersey Property and area.  This includes nearly 1000 acres of land in 2 titles that covers a large portion of the old mine workings in the Jersey mine area.

The authors foresee no permitting obstacles for a year round drill program.  Prior drill programs have been permitted and conducted throughout the property in the past.

## 5.0) ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE AND PHYSIOGRAPHY

Access to the Jersey-Emerald Property is via Highway 6 between the town of Salmo and the Highway 3 junction to Creston (see Figure 3).  A network of good quality, gravel mine roads provide excellent access to the centre of the property from Highway 6, which is situated along the west edge of the property.

Salmo  enjoys  a  pleasant  summer  climate  with  August  temperatures  averaging  25 C  and o moderate precipitation.  Winter temperatures average -10 C in January with moderate snowfall. o Total  annual  precipitation  is  on  the  order  of  750  millimetres  of  moisture  with  much  of  this falling during the rainy season from April to June.  The property is not in a heavy snow belt but up to four feet or more can be expected at the mine site during the winter months.  Snow free conditions at higher elevations can be expected from late April to early November.  Access to the property can be attained for year-round exploration.

The Highway 6 corridor carries a power line and rail bed.  Teck Cominco Trail Smelter facility  is  located  about  45  minutes  drive  south  of  the  property.    Crew  lodgings  are available  in  Nelson  or  Salmo.    A  skilled  labour  force  for  mining  and  exploration  is available  in  Nelson,  Salmo,  Trail  and  Castlegar.    Trail,  Nelson  and  Castlegar  are  also major supply and service centres for resource industries.

The  property  is  situated  in  the  rugged  mountainous  physiographic  division  known  as  the Selkirk Mountains.  In the vicinity of the claims relief is on the order of 1200 metres (4000 feet)  between  Salmo  Creek  in  the  valley  bottom  at  600  metres  (2000  feet)  and  the  crest  of Nevada Mountain at 1860 metres (6100 feet).  Slopes vary from rolling within the centre of the claims  to  moderately  steep  along  the  east  and  west  margins.    Preliminary  inspection  of topography indicates that there are numerous areas for development of infrastructure required for mining and milling within the claims.

Much of the area has been logged or previously burned resulting in vegetation consisting of small diameter stands of larch, balsam, fir, jackpine and mountain alder.  In many areas second growth vegetation is extremely dense making movement through the forest difficult.  Several areas of extensive outcrop occur over and immediately north of the Jersey mine site but much of the property is covered by a veneer of glacial till.  Till cover varies in thickness, from less than one metre on the slopes to more than 20 metres in valley bottoms.

## 6.0)   HISTORY

The earliest record of exploration in the area dates to 1895 when gossanous outcrops on the south  side  of  Iron  Mountain  attracted  the  attention  of  prospectors.    The  area  was  initially explored for gold and the 1896 Minister of Mines Report states that assays as high as $70.00 per ton in gold (about 3.5 oz/t or 100 g/t) were obtained from the area.

Prospecting continued and in 1906 lead mineralization was discovered on the Emerald claims. Several  small,  high  grade  ore  shipments  were  made  and  in  1910  Iron  Mountain  Ltd.  was formed by Pacific Coast Steel of San Francisco to develop the property.  A 25 ton mill was erected in 1919 and operated until 1926 when low metal prices forced closure.  In 1934 the mill was destroyed by a major forest fire.

In 1938, tungsten and molybdenite mineralization was discovered in skarn bands at the site of the long abandoned gold workings on the Emaral, Emerald Fraction and Gold Standard claims. In 1942, the Emerald Tungsten Mine was put into production for the war effort by Wartime Metals Corp., a Federal Government Agency.  Operations were suspended in 1943 when the war demand for tungsten eased.

The property remained inactive until 1947 when Canadian Exploration Ltd. (later Placer Dome Ltd.)  purchased  the  property  of  Iron  Mountain  Ltd.    Placer  Dome  eventually  purchased  the government  held  tungsten reserves and tungsten mill in 1952. Tungsten  production recommenced in 1947 and lead-zinc production began in 1949.  Lead-zinc concentrate was produced  from  two  zones:    the  Jersey  and  the  Emerald  Lead-Zinc  Deposits.    Tungsten concentrate  was  produced  from  four  zones:    the  Emerald,  Feeney,  Invincible  and  Dodger deposits.  Production continued until September 1973 when the mine was closed due to low metal prices and depleted lead, zinc and tungsten reserves.  Over the mine life 7,968,080 tons of lead-zinc ore grading 1.95% Pb and 3.83% Zn, and 1,597,802 tons of tungsten ore grading 0.76% WO3 were mined and milled.

In  1979   Mentor Exploration Ltd carried out a diamond drill program to explore the south extension of the Emerald Shaft tungsten zone.  This work encountered favourable geology but the target zone was found to be too deep and too narrow to be adequately tested by surface drilling.

In 1981 Mentor Exploration Ltd completed a five hole diamond drill program totalling 1,070 metres to test for molybdenum mineralization in the Emerald stock area. This work provided valuable information on the nature of the intrusive in this area, being the deepest testing carried out to that time.  However,  no economic zones of molybdenite were encountered.

In 1990, the property was sold to Nu-Dawn Resources Inc. who in 1993 sold it to Lloyd Addie and Bob Bourdon, both of Nelson, B.C.  In 1993, Addie and Bourdon found that fine particles of free gold could be panned from the tungsten tailings.  A prospecting and lithogeochemical sampling program was therefore initiated over the known tungsten zones.  This work lead to the  discovery  of  significant  bedrock  gold  values  in  the  vicinity  of  the  Jersey  and  Emerald zones.

In October of 1993, the property was optioned by Sultan Minerals Inc.  Sultan undertook an exploration program that entailed ground and airborne geophysical surveys, prospecting and rock  chip  sampling.    This  work  led  to  the  identification  of  several  targets  believed  to  have potential for gold mineralization.

During  the  winter  of  1994-95  an  eleven  hole  (1,324  metres)  diamond  drill  program  was undertaken by Sultan to follow up targets identified by the previous work.  Drilling resulted in the discovery of several gold bearing zones in the vicinity of both the Jersey Lead-Zinc Deposit and the Emerald Tungsten Deposit.  The drilling also intersected a lead-zinc zone situated 55 metres below the former Jersey Lead-Zinc Deposit.

In  1996,  an  exploration  program  consisting  of  soil  and  silt  sampling,  geological  mapping, prospecting,  rock  sampling  and  diamond  drilling  was  carried  out  on  the  property  to  better delineate the mineralized areas identified by Sultan.  A total of 3 underground and 13 surface diamond drill holes were completed for a total of 1,707 metres.  Drilling was designed to test the  gold  potential  of  the  Bismuth-Gold  zone,  Emerald Gold zone, Leroy Gold zone and the lower lead-zinc horizon.  Three drill holes were completed to the east of the mine area to test an anomalous  multi-element  geochemical  zone  delineated  from  surface  exploration,  called  the East Ridge zone.

Exploration  on  the  claims  was  inactive  until  market  values  for  molybdenum  increased dramatically  in  2005.    With  the  improved  molybdenum  prices,  Sultan  Minerals  conducted exploration for molybdenum focussing on the Dodger Mine area where mine records indicated the presence of molybdenite.  As well, an assessment of the potential tungsten resources was undertaken  and  target  areas  surrounding  the  Dodger  Tungsten,  and  Emerald  and  Invincible Tungsten historic mines were delineated.

In 2006 and 2007 exploration on the property continued in an effort to expand the molybdenum mineralization in the Dodger Mine area, expand the tungsten mineralization in the Invincible and Emerald mine areas, and continue to test for lead-zinc resources.

## 7.0)   GEOLOGICAL SETTING

## 7.1 Regional Geology

The Jersey Emerald property lies near the south end of the Kootenay Arc and is underlain by rocks of the Cambrian Laib Formation (CmL) and the Ordovician Active Formation (OA). The Laib Formation is comprised of mixed carbonates and pelites that have been subdivided  into  the  Truman  Member  brown  argillites,  the  Emerald  Member  black argillites and the Reeves Member limestones (see Figure 4).

The  eastern  part  of  the  property  has  historically  been  mapped  as  a  much  younger (Ordovician)  Active  argillite,  however  recent  work  by  the  Company  indicates  that  the contact  may  in  fact  be  conformable  and  that  the  Active  Formation  appears  to  be geochemically identical to the Laib Formation Emerald Member black argillites.

The  sedimentary  formations  are  intruded  by  granitic  dykes,  sills  and  bodies  mapped  as Creatceous Granite  (Hoy and Dunne, 1997).

## 7.2 Local and Property Geology

The property is underlain by rocks of the Cambrian Laib Formation.  This is a sequence of transitional rocks comprised of mixed carbonates and pelites (Little, 1960).  In the vicinity of the  property  the  Laib  Formation  has  been  further  subdivided  into  the  Truman  Member, comprised  of  interbedded  thin  grey  and  white,  locally  dolomitic  limestone;  the  Emerald Member, a black argillite unit; and the Upper Laib Formation, comprised of green phyllite and micaceous quartzites.

The sedimentary rocks are intruded by small plugs, dykes and sills of Cretaceous granite. The sedimentary rocks that are in contact with the granitic bodies are typically skarnified, resulting in  a  variety  of  skarn  rocks  ranging  from  re-crystallized  coarse  grained  marble  to  garnetpyroxene bearing skarn.

The  Laib  Formation  has  been  deformed  by  three  phases  of  folding  all  at  least  of  local significance.  Within the mine area structure is dominated by a major north-northeast trending anticline known locally as the Jersey anticline.

Three  small  stock-like  bodies  of  Cretaceous  biotite  granite,  elongate  parallel  with  the  local foliation, intrude the Jersey anticline and locally cut the ore-zones near the Jersey mine.  From south to north these are the Jersey, Emerald and Dodger stocks.  Potassium-argon age dates obtained from biotite from the Dodger stock give a date of 100.0 +/- 3.0 million years.  One kilometre west of the Jersey mine the Laib sediments are intruded by a small circular body of Tertiary, augite monzonite referred to as the Salmo River stock.  Biotite from this stock gave a potassium-argon age of 50.6 +/- 1.5 million years.

## 8.0)   DEPOSIT TYPES

## 8.1 Lead Zinc Deposits

Lead-zinc  deposition  on  the  Property  is  located  mostly  within  the  Reeves  member dolomites. The deposits have been categorized as primary bedded Irish-Style Sedimentary Exhalative (SEDEX) deposits.  Some zones within the deposits also display aspects indicative of replacement deposition within limestone.

## 8.2 Tungsten Deposits

Tungsten mineralization has been discovered in two distinct environments.  The first is skarn style mineralization where granitic intrusions contact the limestone.  The second is in favourable zones within the Truman member as stratabound disseminate mineralization.

## 8.3 Gold Deposition

Gold values  have  been  obtained  from  areas  historically  mined  for  tungsten.    Work  by Sultan  minerals  indicated  that  the  gold  is  believed  to  be  skarn-related,  occurring  in silicified horizons with pyrite, pyrrhotite, arsenopyrite, stibnite and native bismuth.

## 8.4 Molybdenum Porphyry

At  different  periods  during  exploration  and  development  of  lead-zinc  and  tungsten deposits  on  the  property,  quartz  stockwork  veining  and  alteration  zones  suggested  the potential for gold mineralization within the granites underlying the existing mined areas. As well, mapping of underground headings and sampling of diamond drill core during mining  operations  indicated  the  presence  of  molybdenite  within  these  porphyry-style veined  zones.    Based  on  these  positive  indicators,  in  2005  and  2006,  and  2007 exploration focused on molybdenum including diamond drilling within the Dodger zone.

## 9.0)   MINERALIZATION

Mineralization  on  the  Jersey  property  is  associated  with  the  east  limb  of  a  complex  major anticlinal structure referred to locally as the Jersey anticline and regionally as the Salmo River anticline.    The  HB  lead-zinc  mine  located  four  kilometres  to  the  north  and  the  Reeves MacDonald lead-zinc mine located  ten  kilometres  to  the  south  are  also  associated  with  this major structure.

Several zones of significant and often very different mineralization have been identified on the property.  Historically mined areas produced lead-zinc and tungsten, with known areas of high

molybdenum,  gold,  bismuth,  arsenic,  copper,  silver,  cadmium  and  barium.    Work  done  by Sultan Minerals outlined numerous mineralized zones that are discussed below, along with the historically known mineralized zones.

## 9.1 Lead Zinc Zones

## Jersey Lead-Zinc Deposit

The Jersey lead-zinc deposit occurs in dolomite near the base of the Reeves limestone member. Five ore bands, ranging in thickness from 0.3 to 9.0 metres were mined.  These bands in order of stratigraphic sequence are:  1) upper lead band; 2) upper zinc band; 3) middle zinc band; 4) lower zinc band; 5) lower lead band.  The five ore bands are locally very close together and in the A Zone frequently have been mined as a unit up to 24 metres thick.  Ore mineralization consists of fine-grained sphalerite and galena with pyrite, pyrrhotite and minor arsenopyrite. Cadmium is associated with the sphalerite and silver with galena.  Iron content of the sphalerite is low, about 6%.  The overall grade for the 7,968,080 tons milled averaged 3.83% zinc and 1.95% lead.  Mining ceased in 1970 with unmined reserves of 106,000 tons grading 3.10% zinc and 0.80% lead.

## Emerald Lead-Zinc Deposit

The  Emerald  lead-zinc  deposit  is  located  immediately  to  the  north  of  the  Jersey  lead-zinc deposit, along the same host structure.  Mineralization in the Emerald lead-zinc mine consists of banded limestone and dolomite of the Reeves Member hosting stratabound  lead and zinc bands.

## 9.2 Gold Zones

## Bismuth Gold Zone

The Bismuth Gold Zone (known in the underground workings as part of the F zone) is located along the east side of the Jersey lead-zinc deposit at the contact between the Reeves limestone and the underlying Reeves dolomite.  Gold mineralization was initially recognized here in 1963 when  Placer  Dome  obtained  0.12  oz/t  (3.4  g/t)  gold  from  four  samples  assayed  from  an extensive  native  bismuth  and  arsenopyrite  bearing  zone.    The  zone  was  intersected  while exploring the Jersey lead-zinc deposit and the underlying East Dodger tungsten zone.  The zone was rediscovered in 1993 by the present property owners while inspecting Placer Dome drill logs.  The gold mineralization, believed to be skarn-related, occurs in a silicified horizon with pyrite, pyrrhotite, arsenopyrite, stibnite and native bismuth.  Underground samples assay up to 0.28 oz/t (8.0 g/t) gold across widths of 96.0 centimetres.  Placer Dome drill logs suggest that this siliceous zone may be 20 metres or more in thickness.  It was intersected in four surface drill holes along a strike length of 300 metres.

## #1 Zone

The #1 Zone is located in the area of the 1994 diamond drill holes DDH94-1 and 2.  This zone is located along the contact of the Reeves limestone and the Emerald argillite members where they trend south from the Emerald Tungsten open pit mine.

A series of small to large pits and trenches trend for 300 metres along the limestone-argillite contact.    In  the  workings,  rusty  banded  sulphide  mineralization  occurs  with  iron  oxides (limonite and goethite) and coarsely recrystallized limestone.  Sulphide mineralization occurs as massive pyrrhotite bands, which return high values for arsenic, copper and zinc, with minor gold, silver and molybdenum.

## Emerald Gold Zone

The Emerald gold zone was first recognized in 1895 and may be coincident with the Emerald tungsten zone.  The zone was prospected for gold from 1895 to 1906 and assays up to 3.5 oz/t (100.0 g/t) were reported.  After the lead-zinc potential of the property was recognized in 1906 and later with the discovery of the tungsten mineralization over this area the gold potential of this  zone  was  not  explored.    The  zone  was  rediscovered  in  1993  when  the  current  property owners found that free gold could be panned from the tungsten tailings.  Gold mineralization has been found to be associated with the quartz and pyrrhotite rich sections of the skarn and sulphide-type tungsten zones.

The  Emerald  gold  zone  occurs  along  the  contact  with  the  Reeves  limestone  and  Emerald argillite, and trends from the Emerald Tungsten deposit towards the #1 Zone.  These three areas may actually represent mineral zonations grading away from the Emerald Stock.

## Leroy Gold Zone

The Leroy gold zone is  located  approximately  one  kilometre  north  of  the  Emerald  gold  and tungsten zones.  Gold mineralization was discovered here in the late 1890's and the zone was explored with a series of pits, adits and hand trenches along an 800 metre strike length.  Gold exploration ceased with the discovery of lead-zinc in 1906.

Over  the  Leroy  zone  gold  mineralization  is  associated  with  pyrrhotite,  pyrite  and  native bismuth in a silicified horizon at the contact between the Reeves limestone member and the Emerald argillite member.  Recent sampling of this zone gave gold grades up to 0.898 oz/t (25.5 g/t) from grab samples and up to 0.174 oz/t (4.8 g/t) across a true width of 3.0 metres for chip samples.

## ABC Zone

The ABC zone occurs just to the east of the Jersey and Dodger underground workings along the Iron Mountain Fault.  This major fault structure represents the contact of the Ordovician Active Formation argillites with the Cambrian Reeves Member limestones.

Anomalous samples were collected from slices of pyritic garnet-diopside skarn bands entirely within  Active  Formation  argillite,  but  adjacent  to  the  Reeves  limestones.    Rusty,  limonitic, decomposed argillite(?) with minor quartz stockworking is found on the west side of the skarn banding.  Sulphide mineralization is confined to pyrite within the skarn bands, with limonite occurring adjacent to this unit.  Assays indicate the presence of high arsenic and minor gold, molybdenum and lead values.

## 9.3 Tungsten Zones

## Dodger Tungsten Deposit

Near  the  Jersey  Lead-Zinc  Mine,  skarn-type  tungsten  mineralization  occurs  where  the Cretaceous intrusions are in contact with either of the calcareous Truman or Reeves members. Tungsten was mined from two distinct zones on the property:  The Dodger zone located along the east side of the Jersey lead-zinc deposit; and the Emerald zone comprised of the Emerald, Feeney and Invincible deposits located along the west side of the lead-zinc deposit.

The  Dodger  tungsten  skarn  deposit  is  comprised  of  three  zones  with  finely  disseminated scheelite grains in light brown to green garnet-diopside skarn.  The conformable deposit occurs in a skarnified limestone unit near the top of the Truman Member.  The mineralized zones are separated by a tongue of granite believed to be an appendage of the Dodger Stock.

In this deposit, scheelite is accompanied by pyrrhotite, biotite, quartz, molybdenite and minor powellite.  The ore zones range from 2.0 to 9.0 metres in width and average 3.0 metres.

The Dodger tungsten zone was mined intermittently from 1951 to 1973 and averaged 0.56% WO3 for 521,023 tons of production.  Production ceased in 1973 leaving unmined reserves of 42,500 tons grading 0.45% WO3.  During the final year of operation extensive reserves of low grade ore were found to the north and south of the East Dodger deposit.  These reserves were not developed due to low tungsten prices.

## Dodger "D" Zone

The Dodger "D" Zone is represented by a series of pits and trenches located along the contact of the Dodger Stock and skarnified Truman Member argillites.  This zone is located about 300 metres southwest of the Dodger 4400 Adit.

In  the  vicinity  of  the  workings,  the  Dodger  Stock  is  pegmatitic,  consisting  entirely  of  white quartz  and  feldspar  phenocrysts  up  to  15  centimetres  diameter.    The  workings  are  located within very rusty, skarn banded Truman Member sediments.  Visible mineralization consists of massive to disseminated and banded pyrrhotite, pyrite, bismuth, molybdenite, and chalcopyrite, with assays also indicating the presence of gold, zinc, and tungsten.

## Emerald Tungsten Deposit

The Emerald tungsten deposit occurs along the contact between the Reeves limestone member and the Emerald argillite member, located along the west side of the Emerald stock.  Within the deposit  four  distinct  types  of  mineralization  are  recognized:    skarn,  sulphide,  greisen,  and quartz ores.  The skarn-type of ore occurs mainly along or near the limestone argillite contact. It  consists  of  garnet,  diopside,  calcite  and  quartz  with  lesser  amounts  of  pyrrhotite,  pyrite, scheelite and molybdenite.  The sulphide-type of ore, consisting of pyrrhotite, calcite, biotite and  scheelite,  is  often  spatially  associated  with  the  skarn  mineralization  and  consists  of irregularly  shaped  "replacement"  bodies  in  limestone  and  dolomite.    Locally  quartz,  pyrite, molybdenite and chalcopyrite may be present.  The greisen-type of ore occurs in altered granite and extends up to 12 metres into the granite from the limestone contact.  The ore consists of potash  feldspar  -  in  some  places  completely  kaolinized,  abundant  quartz,  sericite,  pyrite, tourmaline and scheelite.  Locally, calcite, ankerite, apatite, pyrrhotite or molybdenite may be present.    The  quartz-type  ore  in  many  places  grades  into  greisen.    It  consists  of  silicified limestone  cut  by  numerous  veins  of  quartz  with  ankerite,  scheelite,  minor  molybdenite  and apatite.  The veins are enveloped by disseminated mineralization comprised of scheelite, pyrite, pyrrhotite and tremolite.

Scheelite is the main tungsten mineral but minor powellite and wolframite was also recovered. Most  of  the  scheelite  ore  was  recovered  from  lenticular  skarn  zones  developed  along  the contact between the Emerald argillite and the Reeves limestone.

The Emerald tungsten zone was mined intermittently from 1943 to 1973.  Grades ranged from 0.5  to  1.5%  WO3  and  averaged  0.86%  WO3  for  the  entire  1,076,799  tons  of  production. Mining ceased in 1973 due to low tungsten prices leaving recoverable reserves of 34,800 tons grading 0.73% WO3.   Potential is believed to exist north of the Invincible and south of the Emerald deposits but due to low tungsten prices there was no incentive to explore and develop these potential reserves.

## East Emerald Tungsten Zone

The East Emerald Tungsten Zone, is located about 300 metres southwest of the Dodger 4400 Adit  and  approximately  100  metres  stratigraphically  above  the  Invincible  Tungsten Deposit.  Also referred to as the Dodger "D" Zone,  it is represented by a series of pits and trenches located along the contact of the Dodger Stock and two parallel skarnified Truman Member argillite bands, each about 10 metres in thickness.  Evidence of the potential for Dodger-type  mineralization  was  provided  in  historic  drilling  to  the  north  and  east  of  the Emerald and Invincible mines..  This  stratabound  mineralization  is  in  the  stratigraphically higher metamorphosed Truman rocks.  Twenty four(Wartime Metals) and sixteen(Canex) historic drill holes were completed through this zone, herein termed the East Emerald Zone. Drilling  into  this  zone  encountered  tungsten-skarn  mineralization  adjacent  to  and  distant from the granitic contact similar to that historically mined in the Dodger Tungsten deposit to the east.  In 2006 Sultan Minerals completed a four hole drill program into this mineralized zone  in  order  to  verify  the  presence  of  the  reported  tungsten  grades  and  the  widths  of

mineralization.    A  preliminary  assessment  of  the  potential  of  this  zone  is  covered  in  this report.

These  tungsten-bearing  horizons  have  been  shown  by  historical  drilling  and  surface sampling to be more than 1,100 metres long and to extend up to 300 metres down dip. Drill  logs  show  that  the  zone  ranges  from  4.0  feet  (1.2  metres)  to  more  than  60.0  feet (20.0  metres)  in  thickness  with  tungsten  assays  varying  from  less  than  0.10%  WO3  to greater than 0.28% WO3.

In  the  vicinity  of  the  workings,  the  Dodger  Stock  is  pegmatitic,  consisting  entirely  of  white quartz and feldspar phenocrysts up to 15 centimetres in diameter.  The workings are located within very rusty, skarn banded Truman Member sediments.  Visible mineralization consists of massive to disseminated and banded pyrrhotite, pyrite, bismuth, molybdenite, and chalcopyrite, with assays also indicating the presence of gold, zinc, and molybdenum with the tungsten.

## Invincible Tungsten Deposit

The Invincible Tungsten Deposit is adjacent to the western margin of the Late Jurassic Dodger stock where it transects flat-lying beds of the Reeves Member limestone of the Lower  Cambrian  Laib  Formation.  The  deposit  lies  1,500  metres  northeast  and  along strike,  but  on  the  east  side  of  the  Emerald  granite  stock  from  the  Emerald  tungsten deposit.

The  orebody  is  bounded  above  and  below  by  skarn  and  argillite  of  the  Truman  and Emerald  members  of  the  Laib  Formation  respectively.  Most  of  the  scheelite  occurs  in lenticular  zones  that  extend  at  a  high  angle  from  the  granitic  stock,  more  or  less conformable with layering of the host rocks. The scheelite occurs as fine, disseminated grains  within  garnet-diopside  skarn  and  is  accompanied  by  pyrite,  pyrrhotite,  minor powellite  and  traces  of  molybdenite  and  wolframite.  Quartz  is  common  in  zones  of mineralized granite.

The ore zone extends up to 24 metres from the stock, and may be more than 3 metres thick  in  places.  The  zone  lies  about  260  metres  below  surface  and  produced  256,480 tonnes of 0.65 per cent WO3 from 1970 to 1973 (Geology, Exploration and Mining in British  Columbia  1973,  pages  54-57)..  The  northern  extension  of  the  Invincible  mine remains untested.

## Feeney Tungsten Deposit

The  Feeney  tungsten  deposit  is  located  on  the  east  side  of  the  Emerald  granitic  stock along strike to the north of the Emerald mine and south of the Invincible mine. The zone forms a relatively shallow ore body within the Lower Cambrian Laib Formation along the granite-limestone contact between the Reeves Member limestone and Emerald Member argillite.

The mineralization consists of scheelite with minor powellite, rare wolframite and traces of molybdenite in a green and brown garnet-diopside skarn containing augite, actinolite,

epidote, pyrrhotite and quartz. Most of the scheelite occurs as fine, disseminated grains in lenticular  skarn  zones  which  extend  from  the  granite  contact  out  into  the  limestoneargillite country rock conformable to bedding. The skarn zones are up to 6 metres long and average about 2 metres in width. Grades are about 0.5 to 1.5 per cent tungsten. The Feeney mine operated between 1951 and 1955 and produced about 54,000 tonnes of ore averaging 0.92% WO3 (Bulletin 41, page 119).

## 9.4 Molybdenum Zones

## Dodger Zone

Molybdenum mineralization was noted in several areas within the historic Jersey, Dodger, Invicible, Emerald and Feeney mine workings.  Follow-up work during 2000 to 2005 field seasons indicated that the most readily accessible area for initial molybdenum exploration is within  the    Dodger  4200  mine  workings.    These  workings  were  found  to  be  in  good condition  where  access  drifts  were  completed  during  the  historic  mining  for  tungsten. Mapping of the drifts indicated that the granitic rock that underlies the Dodger-type skarn tungsten mineralization contains porphyry style quartz veining with molybdenite mineralization.

Exploration of the molybdenum-bearing porphyry system, along the margin of the historic Dodger  East  Tungsten  zone,  revealed  a  stockwork  of  quartz  veining  and  fractures  with molybdenite.  The general orientation of fractures and quartz veins was found to be crosscutting north-south and east-west, with steep dips.  Several high grade molybdenite zones were intersected, including 1% to 3% Mo over short widths of 3 to 5 feet (0.9 to 1.5 metres). The 20 hole drill program completed during the 2005 field season indicated the potential for larger  volumes  of  lower  grade  molybdenum  containing  short  sections  of  higher  grade material.  The current resource calculation summarized in this report has been undertaken to further assess this zone.

## East Zone

During  the  1995  field  season,  a  large  mineralized  zone  was  discovered  to  the  east  of  the previous workings entirely within the Ordovician Active Formation argillites.

An  anomalous  area  trending  north-south  for  two  kilometres  and  up  to  one  kilometre  wide contains significant copper, zinc, silver, barium and molybdenum values in soils.  The black, shaly argillites are cross-cut by quartz stringers in many areas, but mineralization is believed to be hosted within the argillite beds.

## Posie Zone

The Posie claim occurs to the south of the Jersey lead-zinc mine, on the south side of Lost Creek.  Preliminary work done on this claim in 1995, returned anomalous metal values from soil samples.

The Posie mineralized zone occurs within Ordovician Active Formation argillites with interfingered limestones of the Lower Cambrian Reeves Member in the north.  The limestone tends to be skarnified in some areas, while other areas have the appearance of fresh limestone but are completely silicified.  A zone of anomalous soil sample results trends from Lost Creek southsouthwest for over one kilometre, roughly following the argillite-limestone contact.  Along this zone,  soil  samples  are  highly  anomalous  in  copper,  silver,  zinc,  cadmium  and  barium,  with scattered elevated values for gold, tungsten and molybdenum .

## 10.0)  EXPLORATION

Sultan  Minerals  Inc  has  undertaken  a  number  of  exploration  programs  on  the  JerseyEmerald Property.    These  have  been  summarized  in  the  History  section  of  this  report. Perry Grunenberg (author) managed or monitored much of this work.

Perry  Grunenberg has monitored the progress of exploration and has been involved in documenting  periodic  reports  in  the  form  of  letters  and  news  releases  regarding  the Jersey-Emerald property.

A total of 20 underground diamond drill holes and 2 surface drill holes were completed on the property for the exploration of molybdenum in 2005.  The 20 underground drill holes were all located within areas of the Dodger Tungsten Mine workings, particularly the Dodger 4200 Drift North and associated cross-cuts, herein referred to as the Dodger 4200 zone.  The 2 surface diamond drill holes were located at distance from the Dodger 4200  zone  to  the  west  and  north  to  test  for  other  potential  zones  of  molybdenum mineralization.  Drill hole locations are provided on Figure 8.

In 2006, a total of 431 metres of drilling in 4 drill holes was completed on the Emerald East Tungsten zone.  This drilling was located in an area of historic diamond drilling for tungsten mineralization that was carried out when mining for tungsten was active on the property.  This tested for grade and continuity of tungsten mineralization, and provided verification of results presented  in  drill logs  and  maps  contained  in  the  historic information.

Following completion of a preliminary resource estimate in early 2006, Sultan continued drilling within the East Emerald zone with an additional 4 drill holes totalling 585 metres (1918 feet).  In 2007, Wardrop completed a technical report for Sultan that involved developing conceptual design of all aspects of the project, including mine design, mineral processing, tailings disposal, concentrate transportation and economic evaluation.

Sultan  utilized  the  results  of  the  Wardrop  study  as  a  guide  for  further  exploration  for tungsten and molybdenum on the property.

In  2007,  Sultan  completed  a  total  of  19  underground  drill  holes  totalling  3886  metres (12,749  feet).    This  drilling  was  primarily  designed  to  follow  up  the  molybdenum mineralization outlined by previous drilling in the East Dodger zone.  Sultan continued drilling on surface, with an additional 61 drill holes totalling 9147 metres (30,010 feet). These  drill  holes  were  distributed  over  the  property  in  order  to  test  for  lead-zinc, molybdenum and tungsten mineralization.  Prior to the writing of this  report,  nineteen drill holes were completed within the East Emerald tungsten zone target area, the results of which were used in this resource evaluation.

Sultan is continuing exploration, including database update and diamond drilling, of the Jersey property into 2008.

## 11.0)  DRILLING

Sultan Minerals Inc completed a number of drill programs during exploration for gold, tungsten and lead-zinc on the property.  These programs have been summarized in the History section of this report.  Prior to 2005 a total of 3,031 metres of diamond drilling were completed by Sultan Minerals on the property.

Sultan  Minerals  directed  exploration  primarily  towards  the  molybdenum  and  tungsten potential of the property from 2005-2008, with lesser exploration for lead and zinc.  This work was conducted over a large area of the property, within and adjacent to the historic workings.  Drilling took place within an approximate 2.5 square kilometre area.

## Molybdenum Exploration

As of writing of this report, Sultan has completed 51 diamond drill holes totalling 9,297 metres  (30,501  feet)  within  the  East  Dodger  Molybdenum  zone.    Results  of  the  most recent drilling completed in 2008 are currently being compiled and assessed.

Molybdenum mineralization has been intersected in many sections of the underground drill  holes.    The  mineralization  is  comprised  of  a  network  of  high-grade  molybdenite bearing quartz veins hosted within a granite intrusive body. The  grade of the mineralization  is  variable  over  the  1,000-foot  (300  metre)  long  zone  and  is  highest  in areas where there are a greater number of veins.  Assay results from this drilling included drill hole JM05-02 which assayed 0.13% Mo over its entire 58.5 metre (192 foot) length, and hole 3 which averaged 0.068% MoS2 over 150.9 metres (495 feet).  Assays as high as 3% Mo over 1 metre lengths were also encountered.

Continued drilling within the underground Dodger 4200 zone was designed to more fully assess the molybdenum potential within the zone.  Sultan is contemplating completion of an updated preliminary resource calculation to reflect continued exploration of the zone. Drilling of the zone indicates the potential for large volumes of lower grade molybdenum

mineralization (0.05 to 0.1%  Mo)  containing  more  limited  zones  of  high  grade mineralization (0.5 to 1% Mo).

## Tungsten Exploration

To  date  Sultan  has  completed  a  total  of  24  diamond  drill  holes  totalling  3689  metres (12,102 feet) within the Emerald East Tungsten target area.  This drilling was designed to intersect a skarn band that was shown to contain tungsten mineralization as evidenced by historic  diamond  drilling  conducted  during  the  1940's  to  the  1970's.    The  tungsten bearing  bedrock  had  also  been  historically  trenched  and  sampled,  suggesting  that mineralization extends to surface. Tungsten, as scheelite, was intersected within the drill holes,  associated  with  a  skarn  band  that  is  located  marginal  to,  and  extends  northward from, the Emerald Tungsten mine workings.

Sultan is currently testing the shallow, in places extending to surface, mineralization by completing a series of short diamond drill holes.

## 12.0)  SAMPLING METHOD AND APPROACH

Drill core was removed from each drill site at the end of each shift.  Drill core was logged at a fenced compound facility located on the property near Salmo.  Following drill core logging and sample layout, the core was split using a standard manual core splitter, and, for some intervals by using a diamond saw.  One half of the core was then placed in a sample bag labelled with an assay tag number and the second half returned to the core box with its location marked with the same assay tag number.

Sample intervals were determined based on lithological changes, structures and observed mineralization within the core.  Minimum sample intervals were set at approximately 1 metre (3 feet).

## 13.0)   SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND SECURITY

The core to be assayed was shipped by trucking company from site directly to one of two laboratories  located  in  Vancouver,  BC.    This  included  Acme  Labs  Ltd  and  Assayers Canada Ltd.  All sample preparation was done at the laboratory by their staff.

Laboratories  utilized  by  Sultan  are  registered  with  ISO  9001:2000  accreditation.    The International Standards Organization (ISO) adopted a series of guidelines (ISO 9000 to 9004) for the global standardization of Quality Assurance for products and services.  A company seeking accreditation must implement and maintain a quality assurance system that is compliant with one of the three applicable models (i.e. ISO 9001, 9002 or 9003).

Some of the aspects specifically addressed in a quality assurance system include:

- · Responsibility of management in defining and achieving quality goals,
- · Contract review to ensure customer needs are understood and met,
- · Procurement of supplies and services capable of delivering  the  desired  level  of quality,

- · Handling of material supplied by the customer to ensure integrity,
- · Inspection and testing to ensure that all work meets or exceeds quality criteria,
- · Controlling processes to ensure consistency of quality,
- · Correction and prevention of non-conformities (errors),
- · Statistical analysis to ensure quality criteria are met.
- · Training of staff, and

The  Labs  utilize  standards  and  duplicate  analysis  of  samples  as  part  of  their  quality assurance.    The  laboratory  identifies  and  remedies  situations  where  the  analysis  of duplicates or standards is not within allowable levels of variation.

Perry Grunenberg personally monitored procedures for sample collection and delivery to courier in either Salmo or Castlegar, BC.  From point of collection until delivery to the courier, the samples were under complete control of Sultan Minerals contractors.

The assay laboratories catalogue all samples and assure a complete chain of custody of each sample through the analytical process.  The samples were analyzed for greater than 30 elements by ICP methodology.  In the analysis a representative sample is crushed and pulverized  to  95%  passing  150  mesh.    A  split  of  minimum  15  gram  is  leached  in  hot Aqua Regia.  The resulting solution is analyzed by ICP-ES and ICP-MS.  The lab reports that  solubility  of  some  elements  will  be  limited  depending  on  mineral  species  present. Samples  that  returned  elevated  levels  of  either  molybdenum  or  tungsten  were  further analyzed by more complete leaching, and analysis by ICP-ES.

## 14.0)  DATA VERIFICATION

Data  used  in  the  preparation  of  this  report  were  predominantly  generated  by  Sultan Minerals Inc. during past and current exploration programs.  All data is stored in Sultan's office  in  Vancouver  and  within  the  exploration  office  located  in  Salmo,  BC.    Perry Grunenberg  managed  or  otherwise  participated  in  most  of  the  previous  exploration. There  appears  to  be  no  reason  to  doubt  the  accuracy  or  veracity  of  the  geological exploration data that is presented as written material and as illustrations on maps, sections or diagrams.

Historic drilling dating from as early as the 1940's provided a great amount of data to the database  used  by  Sultan  to  establish  areas  of  interest  for  further  exploration.    In particular,  drilling  performed  by  Wartime  Metals  in  the  East  Emerald  Tungsten  target area was instrumental in indicating the potential of that area.  Drilling in 2006, 2007 and 2008  by  Sultan  Minerals  has  verified  the  existence  of  this  mineralization,  with  grades intersected in recent drilling verifying the grades reported in the historic drill logs.

## Assay Checks With a Second Laboratory

During the program it was standard practice to have the lab crush, pulverize and split out two 250 gram samples.  One sample was for analysis and the second was for storage.  A

representative from Sultan would pick up the second pulps and selections would be made for submittal to an alternative laboratory for reanalysis.

In  2006  and  2007,  reanalysis  for  tungsten  was  done  by  Becquerel  Laboratories  Inc.  in Ontario using neutron activation procedures.   The inter lab precision was an excellent 12.3 %.  In 2006, the comparison of the two sets of tungsten assays show the Becquerel Laboratories results to be 8.52% higher.

The higher results for the neutron activation analysis were expected as this method will determine total tungsten content of the sample while the acid digestion procedure used by Acme will not determine encapsulated tungsten.

In 2007 an additional 17 samples were sent to Becquerel Laboratories Inc. as a check on the  Primary  Lab  Acme.    The  mean  grade  of  samples  from  Becquerel  was  2232  ppm compared to 2286 ppm determined by Acme with a correlation of coefficient between the two data sets an excellent 0.9999.  The scatter plot below shows a slight proportional bias (Bequerel underestimating W relative to Acme) with the best fit regression line pulled slightly away from the equal value line based on one very high sample (164000 ppm at Bequerel vs 174000 ppm at Acme.  There is no apparent bias present in the remaining samples and the overall sampling precision between the two labs is ± 4.3%.

During  the  resource  estimation  numerous  checks  of  the  digital  database  through  basic software analysis identified typos which were corrected from original drill hole logs and assay  sheets.    The  level  of  data  accuracy  was  within  industry  standards  for  a  resource estimation.

## 15.0)  ADJACENT PROPERTIES

The area around the Jersey-Emerald property has undergone extensive historic exploration and development.  A listing of Minfile occurrences from the BC Ministry of Energy and Mines website indicates numerous past producers in close proximity to the Jersey  Emerald.    A  summary  of  the  significant  listings  are  provided  below.    The information  presented  is  not  necessarily  indicative  of  the  mineralization  on  Sultan Minerals Inc Jersey-Emerald Property.

## 15.1 Molly

The Molly molybdenum property is located at about 1219 metres elevation on the south side of Lost Creek, 12.8 kilometres south-southeast of Salmo. The 4 claims comprising the property were the Bromyrite King, Bromyrite, Molybdenite, and Molybdenum No.1. In 1914, the property was leased for 6 months to Bell brothers of Salmo and molybdenum ore was shipped to Denver, Colorado from open cuts and pits. Early in 1915 the property was leased for one year to B.C. Molybdenite Company, Limited and additional ore was shipped to Denver. In 1916, the property was under lease to International Molybdenum Company, Limited who shipped about 90 tonnes of ore to their plant at Renfrew, Ontario. The original owners resumed work on the property in 1917 and shipped about 45 tonnes of ore to the Mines Branch, Ottawa.

The  property  was  restaked  as  the  Molly  and  Molly  1-9  claims  (Lots  14232-14241 respectively).  The  Consolidated  Mining  and  Smelting  Company  of  Canada  Limited purchased the property in 1926 and a small amount of underground work and diamond drilling  was  carried  out  the  following  year.  The  claims  were  Crown-granted  to  the company  in  1930.  The  workings  at  that  time  included  about  30  metres  of  drift  and crosscut, an 18-metre raise, and a winze.

Scheelite  was  discovered  on  the  Molly  4  claim,  about  305  metres  southeast  and  122 metres above the molybdenum showing, by Joe Gollo, of Howser, in 1942; the company carried  out  considerable  exploration  for  scheelite  that  same  year.  Further  work  by  the company  on  the  molybdenum  showing  during  the  period  July  1942-February  1943 included 35 metres of crosscut, 21 metres of drift, and a 5-metre raise; a small tonnage of ore was mined but not shipped.

The  Molly  mine  is  hosted  by  granites  of  the  Lost  Creek  stock  of  the  Middle  to  Late Jurassic  Nelson  Intrusions,  which  are  intruded  into  a  sequence  of  argillites  and  limy argillites of the Ordovician Active Formation. The granite is quartz rich and appears to have an upper fine-grained, aplitic chilled zone or border capping in the order of 2 metres thick.

The  aplite  is  sparsely  impregnated  with  molybdenum  but  the  main  molybdenum  ore occurs below this capping within a zone about 3 metres thick containing numerous joints parallel to the intrusive contact. The best mineralization appears within this sheeted zone where the intrusive contact dips at low angles and/or where there are prominent fractures intersecting this sheeting.  Molybdenite  occurs  as  selvages  on  the  joint  planes  or

disseminated between the joints. The more massive granite below the sheeted zone is host to  very  little  molybdenite.  Tungsten,  as  scheelite,  occurs  locally  disseminated  in  skarn zones of small size.

Records indicate that the Molly mine produced at least 171 tonnes of ore which carried 3.5  to  5.88  per  cent  MoS2.  From  1914  to  1917,  a  total  of  11,366  kilograms  of molybdenum were produced. Minor pyrite, pyrrhotite, and uraninite are also associated with  the  deposit.  A  sample  assayed  0.13  equivalent  uranium  (Geological  Survey  of Canada, Economic Geology #16).

## 15.2 HB

The HB property is located on Aspen Creek, a tributary of Sheep Creek, directly north of the  Jersey-Emerald  property.    The  north  end  of  the  No.  1  ore  body  outcropped  at  an elevation  of  1219  metres,  west  of  Aspen  Creek  and  almost  a  1.6  kilometres  north  of Sheep Creek.

The  Consolidated  Mining  and  Smelting  Company  of  Canada  (Limited)  optioned  the claims in 1911.  The No. 2 level crosscut was driven during the winter but results were disappointing and the option was dropped in 1912.  On the expiry of the  lease the entire property  was  optioned  to  a  Spokane  syndicate  operating  under  the  name  Hudson  Bay Zinc  Company.  The  low  level  No.  7  crosscut  (3,100  level)  was  started  in  1915  and reached a length of 579 metres on completion in 1916. Diamond drilling (473 metres) from the crosscut failed to find ore and the option was given up in 1917.  Exploration work was all done in the heavily oxidized zone at the north and on No. 1 ore body where the  flat-plunging  ore  was  exposed  on  surface.    The  Consolidated  Mining and Smelting Company  returned  in  1927  and  starting  about  1946,  the  company  began  geological investigations that led to an intensive diamond drilling program beginning in 1948. Large bodies of low-grade disseminated sulphides plunging gently south from the oxidized ore body  were  indicated  by  this  drilling.    In  1951  construction  of  a  1,000  ton  per  day concentrator began and a new adit level (No. 8) was driven 823 metres north from the Sheep Creek valley mill site to the ore zone.

David Minerals Ltd. by an agreement dated May 8, 1981 purchased the mine, mill and adjacent properties from Cominco Ltd.  Renovation of the H.B. mill was carried out to prepare a flotation circuit to custom mill gold-bearing sulphide ores, and a second circuit to  treat  molybdenite-gold  ore  from  the  company's  Rossland  properties.    A  gold  circuit was put into operation for a short period on ore from the Gold Belt property in December 1981.

The  HB  ore  bodies  are  currently  thought  to  be  Kootenay  Arc-type  carbonate  hosted sedimentary exhalative (sedex) deposits.  The ore bodies are located within dolomitized limestone  of  the  Lower  Cambrian  Laib  Formation,  Reeves  Member  (correlative  with limestone  of  the  Badshot  Formation).    The  east  boundary  of  the  Laib  Formation  is  in contact with argillites of the Lower to Middle Ordovician Active Formation, on a fault contact, with the Active rocks overthrust from the east over the Reeves rocks.

Two distinct calcareous layers of the Reeves Member can be recognized in the area, an upper one about 110 metres thick separated from a lower 12-metre member by 15 to 30 metres of micaceous brown limey argillite. The HB ore bodies occur within a hundred metres or so to the west of the thrust fault. It is thought that the mineralization is related to the intrusion of granitic stocks of the Middle to Late Jurassic Nelson Intrusions with the nearest outcrop about 1 kilometre away from the mine.  The only intrusives present in the mine are post-ore diabase dykes up to 3 metres thick.

In  the  vicinity  of  the  HB  mine,  the  beds  are  folded  into  a  broad  synclinorium,  and  the limestone  layers  in  the  mine  are  on  the  west  limb  of  this  structure.    The  principal  ore zones consist  of  three  steeply  dipping,  parallel  zones  lying  approximately  side  by  side and extending as pencil-like shoots for about 900 metres along the gentle south plunge of the controlling structures. The largest and most easterly ore zone has a maximum height of about 140 metres and a maximum width of 30 metres. Within these zones are steeply dipping discontinuous ore stringers with a lead to zinc ratio of 1:5.  There is evidence to indicate  ore  deposition  was  controlled  by  shear  zones  within  the  folded  limestone;  the best  ore  concentrations  occurring  at  the  junctions  between  steeply  dipping  shears  (the pencil-like ore bodies) and flat lying shears (the flat-lying brecciated ore bodies).

The mineralogy of the ore is relatively simple with pyrite, sphalerite and galena in order of abundance and minor pyrrhotite found locally.  The northern portion of these bodies is exposed at surface, near the original HB claim, and are oxidized to a depth of about 100 metres at that point.  A smaller zone, located to the southwest of the main HB mine, is known as the Garnet ore body.  The Garnet zone was mined from the surface from a small open pit, whereas the main mine is entirely underground.

The HB mine produced a total of 6,656,101 tonnes of ore in 29 years between 1912 and 1978. Recovered from this ore were 29,425,521 grams of silver, 49,511,536 kilograms of lead, 260,431,646 kilograms of zinc, 2,019,586 kilograms of cadmium,  105,412 kilograms of copper and 6,159 grams of gold. Measured and indicated reserves published December 31, 1978 by Canadian Pacific  Limited  were  given  as  approximately  36,287 tonnes  grading  0.1  per  cent  lead  and  4.1  per  cent  zinc  (Energy,  Mines  and  Resources Canada Mineral Bulletin MR 198, page 209).

## 15.3  Summit, Ore Hill, Bonanza

A series  of  historic  mines  that  produced  silver,  gold,  lead  and  zinc  are  located  to  the northeast of the Jersey-Emerald property.   These are generally quartz vein occurrences that cut the Lower Cambrian Laib formation limestone and schist.

The  Summit  occurrence  is  a  quartz-siderite  vein  deposit  which  contains  erratically distributed  pyrite,  galena  and  sphalerite  within  a  narrow  fault  zone  striking  55  degrees and dipping southeast.   Most of the mine production was from a 20 metre long "Glory Hole". Production from 1906 to 1938 totalled about 1094 tonnes which contained 27,059 grams of gold, 37,883 grams of silver, 13,728 kilograms of lead and 12,988 kilograms of zinc.

The Ore Hill vein deposit includes several adits with over 1000 metres of underground development.  Between 1906 and 1940, a total of 2,241 tonnes of ore were mined and 88,612  grams  of  gold,  168,424  grams  of  silver,  80,257  kilograms  of  lead  and  75,651 kilograms of zinc were recovered.  South of the adits a trench exposes limestone in fault contact with schists. The fault strikes 050 degrees and dips 75 degrees southeast.  A one metre wide lamprophyre dyke is injected along the fault and there is about 30 centimetres of fine-grained galena, sphalerite, pyrrhotite and pyrite on the footwall side, within highly altered limestones.  North of this exposure, in the adits, the vein is about 45 centimetres wide within quartzite but narrows along strike as it crosscuts argillites.  No mineralization is reported in the quartzite section.

The Bonanza North and South veins are developed by four adits on the Dip claim.  About 17 tonnes were shipped in 1910 but the value of the shipment was not reported (Minister of Mines Annual Report 1910, page 110).  In 1963, a total of 14 tonnes were mined, from which  124  grams  of  gold,  2,861  grams  of  silver  and  118  kilograms  of  lead  were recovered.  Results of a 1982 sampling program indicates that there is an ore shoot above and below the second level on the North vein.  Potential is indicated at depth where the productive  horizon  is  projected  to  below  an  elevation  of  914  metres.    In  1983,  2720 tonnes of proven and possible ore at a grade of 18.86 grams per tonne gold was outlined on the North Bonanza vein (Assessment Report 11249).  A later estimate of the ore on the  property  was  reported  to  be  14,254  tonnes  grading  10.28  grams  per  tonne  gold (George Cross News Letter No.217 (November 12), 1987).

## 16.0)  MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING

With regards to tungsten recoveries, the best information available is from the last few years of operation of the Invincible and East Dodger mines.  According to Ed Lawrence, P.Eng., the mine manager for Placer Dome at that time, the total throughput was 370,600 short  dry  tons  with  a  WO3  recovery  of  81.5  %  during  the  last  two  years  of  normal operations 1971-1972.

## 17.0) RESOURCE ESTIMATION 17.1  Tungsten Resource

This  tungsten  resource  reported  here  is  made  up  of  several  different  discrete  tungsten bearing  zones:  the  Emerald  (although  partially  mined  as  this  zone  surrounds  old workings), the East Emerald and the Lower East Emerald (both to the North-northeast of the Emerald).  These resources are additional to the Invincible, Dodger and East Dodger zones estimated in 2006 (see Giroux and Grunenberg, 2006).

## 17.11  Statistics and Grade Capping

Data  provided  for  the  2008  tungsten  resource  estimate  consisted  of  633  diamond  drill holes totalling 121,248.6 ft. within the Emerald  zones area. Of these 242 had intersections within the mineralized zones for a total of 42,303 ft. (see Appendix 1 for a listing  of  holes  used  in  this  study).  Missing  assays  between  assayed  intervals  were replaced  with  a  nominal  0.0001  %  WO3  taking  the  total  number  of  assays  to  7,732. Geologic domain 3 dimensional solids were constructed to constrain three mineralized areas: the Emerald Mine Area, East Emerald - Upper and East Emerald - Lower.  The assays  were  compared  to  these  solids  and  each  assay  within  each  domain  was  tagged. The statistics  for  assays  within  the  Emerald  Mine  Area  and  those  within  the  two  East Emerald zones are tabulated below.

Lognormal  cumulative  frequency  plots  were  produced  for  WO3  assays  in  both  the Emerald Mine and East Emerald Zones.

Within  the  Emerald  mine  zone  a  total  of  5  overlapping  lognormal  populations  were partitioned from the total data set.  The partitioned populations are tabulated below.

## Individual Overlapping Populations for WO3 in the Emerald Mine Zone

|   Population |   Mean  WO3 % | Proportion of  Total Data Set   |   Number of Samples |

Population 1 appears to be erratic high grade that is widely scattered throughout the zone. A cap level of 2 standard deviations above the mean of population 2, a value of 8.0 % WO3 was used to cap 16 assays.

Within  the  East  Emerald  zones  a  total  of  6  overlapping  lognormal  populations  were partitioned from the total data set.  A similar strategy was used to cap 5 assays at 1.1 % WO3.

The effects of capping three samples, within the two zones, adjusted the mean grade and coefficient of variation slightly downward as shown in Table 13.

## 17.12  Geologic Model

Based  on  cross sections and underground  workings,  QP  P.  Grunenberg  built 3 dimensional  geologic  solids  to  outline  the  tungsten  skarn  zones  (see  Figure  15). Underground workings were modelled by A. Walcott.

Figure 8:  Isometric drawing of Mineralized Domains: Emerald in Yellow, East Emerald in Blue, Lower East Emerald in Green and Underground workings shown in Magenta.  Drill hole composites are shown in red.

## 17.13  Compositing

All  drill  holes  were  'passed  through'  the  geologic  tungsten  solids  with  the  points  each  hole entered and left the solid determined.  For all zones 10 foot (3.05 m) down hole composites were produced for the segments of drill holes within the mineralized solids.  Composites less than 5 ft. (1.52 m) at the end of holes were joined with the adjoining samples to produce a uniform support of composites 10 ± 5 ft.  For intervals of holes with missing assays a nominal 0.0001 % WO3 was inserted.  Statistics for 10 ft composites are shown in Table 14.  Similar 10 ft. composites were also formed for the Waste material from parts of drill holes outside the mineralized solids.

## 17.14   Variography

Tungsten 10 ft. composites within the Emerald and Emerald East zones were examined using pairwise relative semivariograms.  Nested anisotropic spherical models were fit along the strike of both zones.  Maximum continuity of 300 ft. for tungsten mineralization was along azimuth 285  dip  0  within  the  Emerald  Zone  and  at  220  ft.  along  azimuth  300  dip  0  within  the  East Emerald zones.  There was insufficient data to model the East Emerald Lower zone so the East Emerald model was applied.   The semivariogram parameters are summarized in Table 15 and the models are shown in Appendix 2.

## 17.15   Block Model

Rotated block models with block dimensions 25 x 25 x 25 ft. were placed over all solids with the proportion of each block below the topographic surface and inside the solid recorded.  The block model parameters are listed below.

Minimum Easting 7800 E

blocks 25 ft wide

72 columns 256 rows 66 levels

Minimum Northing 5000 N

blocks 25 ft long

Maximum elevation 4650

blocks 25 ft high

No Rotation

For each block the percentage within underground workings was also recorded.  The percentage of underground workings was always assumed to be within the mineralized solid and was subtracted out.

## 17.16   Grade Interpolation

Tungsten grades were interpolated into the block model by ordinary kriging.  Each of the three solids was estimated using only composites within that solid.  Search ellipses to constrain the ordinary kriging runs were based on the ranges of the semivariograms along the three principal directions of anisotropy.  A minimum of 4 composites were required to estimate a block and a maximum of 12 composites were allowed.  If more than 12 composites were found the closest 12 were used.  The blocks were estimated in a series of runs or passes with the search ellipse for Pass 1 set at ¼ the ranges of the semivariogram.  For blocks not estimated during Pass 1 the search ellipse was expanded to ½ the ranges of the semivariogram and the kriging exercise was repeated.  For blocks still not estimated the search ellipse was expanded to the full range of the semivariogram.  Finally a fourth pass using dimensions of the search ellipse equal to twice the semivariogram range was completed to fill in blocks still not estimated.  An isotropic search for estimated  blocks  containing  some  percentage  of  waste  was  completed  in  three  passes  and  the waste part of the blocks was estimated from composites outside the mineralized zones.

## 17.17   Specific Gravity

During 2008, a total of 100 pieces of drill core from the East Emerald zone, were measured for specific gravity by the weight in air-weight in water method.   The East Emerald Zone consists of finely disseminated scheelite grains in light brown to green garnet-diopside skarn.  Samples were taken from both mineralized and unmineralized sections of core within the skarn zone with the results sorted into 5 grade ranges (see Table below).

Clearly, bulk density is a function of the tungsten grade within a sample.  This increase in SG is also the result of increased garnet and diopside content with increased scheelite.  Blocks within the mineralized zone but with grades less than 0.05 % WO3 were assigned an average SG of 3.05 (tonnage factor of 10.51 cu. ft./ton).  Blocks with grades from 0.05 to 0.1 % WO3 were assigned a specific gravity of 3.11 (tonnage factor of 10.31 cu. ft/ton).  Blocks with grades from 0.1 to 0.5 % WO3 were assigned a specific gravity of 3.16 (tonnage factor of 10.14 cu. ft/ton) the average of  samples  between  0.1  and  0.5  %  WO3.    Blocks  with  grades  greater  than  0.5  %  WO3  were assigned a value of 3.24 (tonnage factor of 9.89 cu. ft/ton).  The parts of blocks in the waste surrounding the skarn zone were assigned a value of 2.77 (tonnage factor of 11.57 cu. ft./ton).

The Emerald Zone occurs along the contact between the Reeves limestone member and the Emerald argillite  member  located  along  the  west  side  of  the  Emerald  stock.    This  is  a  different  geologic domain  with  scheelite  mineralization  accompanied  by  pyrrhotite,  biotite  and  quartz.  Within  the deposit four distinct types of mineralization are recognized:  skarn, sulphide, greisen, and quartz ores. The skarn-type of ore occurs mainly along or near the limestone argillite contact.  It consists of garnet, diopside, calcite and quartz with lesser amounts of pyrrhotite, pyrite, scheelite and molybdenite.  The sulphide-type of ore, consisting of pyrrhotite, calcite, biotite and scheelite, is often spatially associated with the skarn mineralization and consists of irregularly shaped "replacement" bodies in limestone and

dolomite.  Locally quartz, pyrite, molybdenite and chalcopyrite may be present.  The greisen-type of ore occurs in altered granite and extends up to 12 metres into the granite from the limestone contact. The ore consists of potash feldspar - in some places completely kaolinized, abundant quartz, sericite, pyrite, tourmaline and scheelite.  Locally, calcite, ankerite, apatite, pyrrhotite or molybdenite may be present.  The quartz-type ore in many places grades into greisen.  It consists of silicified limestone cut by numerous veins of quartz with ankerite, scheelite, minor molybdenite and apatite.  The veins are enveloped by disseminated mineralization comprised of scheelite, pyrite, pyrrhotite and tremolite.

Only historic drilling was used for the estimate on the Emerald and as a result no drill core was available to test.  Ed Lawrence took samples from the dumps around the mine and tested them for specific gravity.  A total of 21 samples of waste rock consisting mostly of Reeves limestone had  an  average  specific  gravity  of  2.71  (tonnage  factor  of  11.83  cu.  ft./ton).    A  total  of  13 samples of mineralized rock with a high proportion of pyrrhotite present had an average specific gravity of 5.63.  Considering the fact that the majority of this high grade style mineralization has been  mined  and  using  the  geological  sections  of  the  Emerald  mined  stopes  as  a  guide,  Mr. Lawrence estimates to proportion of ore to waste in the remaining mineralized zone to be 15 to 85.  Using these estimates, a reasonable specific gravity for the material remaining might be (.15 * 5.63) + (.85*2.71) or 3.15 (tonnage factor of 10.18 cu. ft./ton).

## 17.2  Classification

## 17.21   Introduction

Based on the study herein reported, the delineated mineralization at the Emerald Tungsten Zones is classified as a resource according to the following definition from National Instrument 43-101:

- ' In  this  Instrument,  the  terms  "mineral  resource",  "inferred  mineral  resource", "indicated mineral resource" and "measured mineral resource" have the meanings ascribed to those terms by the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and  Petroleum,  as  the  CIM  Standards  on  Mineral  Resources  and  Reserves Definitions and Guidelines adopted by CIM Council on August 20, 2000, as those definitions  may  be  amended  from  time  to  time  by  the  Canadian  Institute  of Mining, Metallurgy, and Petroleum.'
- 'A Mineral  Resource is a concentration  or  occurrence  of  natural,  solid, inorganic or fossilized organic material in or on the Earth's crust in such form and quantity and of such a grade or quality that it has reasonable prospects for economic extraction. The location, quantity, grade, geological characteristics and continuity  of  a  Mineral  Resource  are  known,  estimated  or  interpreted  from specific geological evidence and knowledge.'

The terms Measured, Indicated and Inferred are defined in 43-101 as follows:

- 'A 'Measured Mineral Resource '  is  that  part  of  a  Mineral  Resource  for  which quantity,  grade or quality, densities, shape, physical characteristics are so well established  that  they  can  be  estimated  with  confidence  sufficient  to  allow  the appropriate  application  of technical and  economic  parameters,  to  support production planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit. The estimate  is  based  on  detailed  and  reliable  exploration,  sampling  and  testing information  gathered  through  appropriate  techniques  from  locations  such  as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes that are spaced closely enough to confirm both geological and grade continuity.'
- 'An ' Indicated Mineral Resource '  is  that  part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity,  grade or quality, densities, shape and physical characteristics, can be estimated with a level of confidence sufficient to allow the appropriate application of technical and economic parameters, to support mine planning and evaluation  of  the  economic  viability  of  the  deposit.  The  estimate  is  based  on detailed  and  reliable  exploration  and  testing  information  gathered  through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes that are spaced closely enough for geological and grade continuity to be reasonably assumed.'
- 'An ' Inferred Mineral Resource '  is  that  part  of  a  Mineral  Resource  for  which quantity  and  grade  or  quality  can  be  estimated  on  the  basis  of  geological evidence and  limited sampling  and  reasonably  assumed,  but  not verified,

geological and grade continuity. The estimate is based on limited information and sampling  gathered  through  appropriate  techniques  from  locations  such  as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes.'

## 17.22 Results

Geologic continuity  of  the  Emerald  tungsten  zones  has  been  established  through  underground mapping  and  diamond  drilling.    Grade  continuity  has  been  quantified  through  the  use  of  the semivariograms.    Within  the  Emerald  Zone  that  surrounds  the  old  mine  workings  all  of  the resource is classified as inferred at this time due to the lack of current drill holes and specific gravity  determinations.    For  the  East  Emerald  and  East  Emerald  Lower  zone  the  blocks  are classified as Indicated and Inferred based on grade continuity.  Blocks estimated in Pass 1 or 2 using search ellipse dimensions of up to ½ the semivariogram range were classified as Indicated. The remaining blocks estimated were classified as Inferred.

The following grade tonnage tables outline the results at a series of WO3 cutoff grades.  At this time no economic analysis has been completed and as a result no economic cutoff is known.  A cutoff of 0.15 % WO3 has been highlighted as a possible open pit cutoff while a cutoff of 0.24 % WO3 might reflect underground mining.

For the Emerald zone the existing underground workings were modeled and the proportion of blocks mined out were removed from the resource.  In addition for the Emerald Zone north of 6750 N and above the 3950 level all blocks were presumed to be mined out by the surface open pit and were removed from the resource.

Figure 9: Isometric drawing showing blocks above the 3950 level and north of 6750 N (in yellow) that were removed from the resource in the open pit area.

The results  are  presented  in  two  forms.    The  tables  titled  Resource  within  Mineralized  Solids reflect the grade and tonnage estimated if one could mine to the limits of the mineralized three dimensional solids.  The tables titled Resource within Total Diluted Blocks reflect the grade and tonnage estimated if one had to mine to the limits of the 25 x 25 x 25 ft. blocks.  The results obtained from actual mining would probably lie between these two extremes.

The results for the mineralized solids provide an indicated resource of 256,000 tons averaging 0.19% WO3 at a 0.15% cutoff, and 18,000 tons with an average grade of 0.28% WO3 at a 0.24% cutoff.    The inferred resource  is  1,122,000  tons  with  average  grade  of  0.27%  WO3 at 0.15% cutoff and 430,000 tons averaging 0.45% WO3 at a cutoff of 0.24%.

The results  for  the 25  x  25  x  25  foot  blocks provide  an indicated resource  of    209,000  tons averaging 0.19% WO3 at a 0.15% cutoff, and 12,000 tons averaging 0.29% WO3 at a 0.24% cutoff.  The inferred resource is 1,110,000 tons averaging 0.29% WO3 at a 0.15% cutoff, and 470,000 tons averaging 0.43% WO3 at a 0.24% cutoff.

## 18.0)  OTHER RELEVANT DATA AND INFORMATION

The Jersey-Emerald property has undergone historic mining over a significant span of time, for a variety of commodities.  Both underground and surface mining methods have been utilized in the extraction of ore.  Remnants of this historic work exist on the property surface, including open cuts  and  pits,  portals  to  underground  access,  waste  dumps  and  mill  tailings.    The  zones  of mineralization covered in this report are primarily within or adjacent to these areas of previous mining, and is therefore considered to be 'brownfields' exploration.   Brownfields exploration may allow for more readily available permitting and advancement of continued work, and for eventual development of resources on the property.  Further consideration is required to ascertain the  level  of  liability  attached  to  the  remnant  disturbed  areas  from  historic  mining.      Sultan Minerals is continuing baseline environmental data collection on the property, including surface stream water sampling and sampling of waters draining the underground workings.

## 18.10  Total Tungsten Resource Estimate, 2006 to 2008

The 2006 report (Grunenberg and Giroux) on the resource estimate for tungsten in the Dodger, East  Dodger  and  Invincible  mine  areas  provided  an  measured  and  indicated  resource  of 2,510,000 tons averaging 0.372% WO3, and an inferred resource of 1,210,000 tons averaging 0.397% WO3, all at  a  0.15%  cutoff.    The  additional  resource  estimate  provided  in  this  2008 report  totals  209,000  tons  averaging  0.188%  indicated  and  1,110,000  tons  averaging  0.285% inferred.

By combining the weighted average of the 2006 and 2008 reported resources, the total resource estimate is 2,719,000 tons averaging 0.358% WO3 measured plus indicated, and 2,320,000 tons averaging 0.341% WO3 inferred.

## 19.0)  INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS

This study was conducted as a preliminary assessment of the potential of the Emerald mine and East Emerald exploration zones on the Jersey property. The results of the study summarized in this report demonstrate potential for tungsten resources in  both the Emerald mine and the East Emerald Zone.

This preliminary resource study indicates that average grades of Tungsten within the two zones are significant enough  for  underground  mining  methods  of  extraction.   The  near-surface geometry of some portions of the zones also suggest potential for open pit extraction.

The skarn mineralization associated with the deposition of tungsten is primarily generated by the intrusion  of  the  underlying  granitic  stock  into  limey  country  rock.    Drill  hole  compilations indicate  that  the  granite  surface  is  extensive  and  is  possibly  more  complex  in  geometry  than shown on current interpretations.  The model showing the granite surface should be updated with the recent drill hole data in order to provide a more detailed interpretation of the geometry of that surface with emphasis on its proximity and contact with limey host rock.

Based on the results of this preliminary resource calculation, further work is recommended to better define and upgrade the Tungsten resources in the Emerald and East Emerald area of the property, as well as the Invincible and Dodger Tungsten zones previously covered in the 2006 Grunenberg-Giroux report.    Continued  exploration  for  tungsten  outside  of  these  zones  is  also recommended.

## 20.0)  RECOMMENDATIONS

The  recommendations  presented here are designed for further exploration for tungsten mineralization  on  the  property,  as  well  as  addressing  requirements  to  advance  the  presently defined resources toward a mining feasibility study.

Several drill holes are required to verify intercepts reported in the historic drilling used to obtain preliminary resources in the Emerald Mine area.  More drilling is required in the East Emerald zone in order to better define the resource therein, especially within the Lower mineralized zone where limited information is available. It is estimated that 5,000 metres of diamond drilling may be required to fully define the Emerald and East Emerald tungsten zones.

The East Emerald zone has been historically trenched at surface and has been shown to extend northward  from  the  north  end  of  the  historic  Emerald  Mine,  geometrically  above  the  historic Feeney and Invincible mines.  Definition of this zone should include surface trenching along this corridor.   Trenching of the zone is possible where surface exposures occur to the north of the Feeney Mine and where the zone projects to the south of the historic Emerald mine workings.   A total of 20 trenches is proposed to test the East Emerald zone and its projected extension to the north and south.

As  was  discussed  previously  in  the  2006  report,  the  Invincible  Mine  workings  may  provide further  access  for  underground  testing  of  the  East  Emerald  Tungsten  zone.  This  access  would also allow  further investigation of molybdenum mineralization within the Invincible Mine area noted in mine plans and observed within waste piles from the decline development.  Dewatering of the mine workings and stabilization of access portals is required for re-establishment of this access.

Historic mine plans and drill hole data indicate that there are remaining tungsten reserves within the East Dodger Mine.  Sultan has recently completed diamond drilling within the East Dodger Mine while exploring for molybdenum potential.  Some of these drill holes would have passed through remnant tungsten mineralization adjacent to the workings.  It is recommended that the tungsten model  in  this area be updated  to include the recent drilling. This tungsten mineralization  may  potentially  be  added  to  the  resource  estimate  calculated  in  the  2006 Grunenberg-Giroux report.

Completion of the 5000 metres of surface diamond drilling, surface trenching, and support, for tungsten mineralization on the property is estimated at a cost of $1,005,000. Dewatering of the Invincible Mine workings and access rehabilitation/stabilization is estimated to cost $90,000.

It is recommended that an economic scoping study be completed by the company at this stage. This will update the 2007 Wardrop study further toward a feasibility decisions.  The study for the tungsten deposits will include:

- 1. Preparation of a mine plan.
- 2. Design and costing of surface facilities
- 3. Continuing implementation of environmental studies
- 4. Review of ore transport options.
- 5. Review of tailings disposal options.
- 6. Review wastewater disposal alternatives
- 7. Review historic metallurgy and conduct further metallurgical testing

Costing for completion of the preliminary economic scoping study will vary depending upon the level of work required at this site.  Based on review of similar studies, the cost associated will range  between  $100,000  and  $200,000.    Some  of  this  work  has  been  completed  by  Waldrop, providing a base for continued work and possibly decreasing the cost under $100,000.

Total cost for continued exploration with definition and verification drilling, and trenching of the tungsten  resource,  is  estimated  at  $1,295,500.    Total  cost  for  completion  of  work  required  to complete an economic study for tungsten extraction is estimated at $99,000.  The combined total cost to complete the recommended work is estimated at $1,358,500.
