## 1 Summary

This  Technical  Report  (the  'Report')  is  written  for  the  Chu  Chua  Property  ('the Property') in which Reva Resources Corp. ('Reva') has 100 percent (%) interest subject to two separate 1% net smelter return (NSR) royalties. This report has been prepared for  Newport  Exploration  Ltd.  ('Newport')  and  Reva  for  the  purposes  of  completing  a 'Reviewable Transaction' under the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange.  The Chu Chua  Property  consists  of  two  active  mineral  claims  totaling  282.5  hectares  (ha); located 24 km northeast of Barriere, B.C. Pursuant to an agreement dated November 22, 2010, Reva granted Newport an option to acquire a 50% interest in the Chu Chua Property.  On September 10, 2013, Newport and Reva entered into a new agreement, which is to supercede and replace the November 22, 2010 option agreement, whereby Newport will acquire Reva's 100% interest in the Property, subject to the two existing 1% NSR royalties, in consideration of the payment of $1,500,000 and the issuance of 5,436,000 shares of Newport. This agreement remains subject to the acceptance of the TSX Venture Exchange.

During 2011, APEX was retained by Newport to construct a National Instrument (NI) 43-101  compliant  resource  calculation.  Mr.  Michael  Dufresne,  M.Sc.,  P.Geol,  Mr. Kristopher Raffle, B.Sc., P. Geol., and Mr. Steve Nicholls, BASc, M-AIG of APEX are the independent qualified persons as defined by the Canadian Securities Administration (CSA) National Instrument (NI) 43-101, and are the authors of this report.  Mr.  Raffle supervised  the  2011  exploration  program  at  the  Property,  which  included  the  resampling of historic core.  Mr. Raffle conducted a property visit on June 26 th , 2012. The mineral resource estimation of the Chu Chua mineralised zone was completed by Mr. Nicholls  under  the  direct  supervision  of  Mr.  Dufresne  and  Mr.  Raffle.  This  report  is written  to  comply  with  standards  set  out  in  NI  43-101  for  the  Canadian  Securities Administration, and is a technical summary of available historic geological, geophysical and geochemical information in addition to recent work completed.

The property is host to the Chu Chua deposit, a Cyprus-type volcanogenic massive sulphide  body  first  discovered  in  1978.    The  property  is  largely  underlain  by  the Mississippian to Permian aged Fennell Formation which comprises basaltic and rhyolitic volcanic rocks, clastic and chemical sedimentary rocks and diabase sills.  This volcanic stratigraphy  is  prospective  for  other  Cyprus-type  and  Kuroko-type  massive  sulphide deposits and also has potential to host precious- and/or base-metal-bearing epithermal deposits.

A total of 99 diamond drill holes, totaling 19,707 m were completed to delineate the Chu Chua deposit between 1978 and 1991. Craigmont Mines Ltd. (Craigmont) drilled a total  of  10,820  m  in  55  core  holes  between  1978  and  1982.  The  drilling  defined  two areas of relatively thick, high grade sulphide mineralization occurring within 100 m of the surface. Highlights from this early drilling included  drill hole CC-6 which  yielded 3.4% copper (Cu), 0.6% zinc (Zn), 0.86 grams per tonne (g/t) gold (Au) and 12.14 g/t silver (Ag) over 23 m core length and drill hole CC-16 which yielded 3.82% Cu, 0.47% Zn, 0.53  g/t  Au  and  11.88  g/t  Ag  over  22.7  m  core  length.    Additional  drilling  to  test  the grade, thickness, lateral and depth extent and continuity of the deposit was completed

by Minnova Inc. (Minnova) between 1988 and 1991.  Minnova drilled a total of 46 holes (8,887 m) during the period.  Highlights from the Minnova drilling include drill hole CCF19 which yielded 4.53% Cu, 0.21% Zn, 0.36 g/t Au and 13.86 g/t Ag over 21.5 m core length and drill hole CCF-22 which yielded 4.61% Cu, 0.67% Zn, 1.7 g/t Au  and 19.59 g/t Ag over 25.5 m core length.

The  2011  Chu  Chua  Property  exploration  program  included  differential  global positioning  system  (DGPS)  surveying  of  historic  diamond  drill  hole  collars,  select  resampling  of  historic  diamond  drill  core  stored  at  the  Property,  and  the  creation  of  a DGPS digital elevation model (DEM) over the Chu Chua deposit. A total of 60 drill holes were  re-located  and  surveyed,  a  total  of  110  core  samples  were  collected  from  the historic core, and an area of 55 ha was surveyed to produce a DEM over the Chu Chua deposit.  Exploration  was  completed  between  the  dates  of  July  6  and  July  16,  2011, inclusive.

The mineral resource estimate comprises an inferred mineral resource of 2.5 million tonnes averaging 2.0 % copper, 0.3% zinc, 9.4 g/t silver, 0.5 g/t gold at a copper block cut-off grade of 1.0% (see table below). The mineral resource modelling and estimation was carried  out  using  a  3-dimensional  block  model,  using  commercial  mine  planning software Micromine. Out of the 99 diamond drill holes, a total of 50 were used in the resource estimation.  Spacing between drill lines is quite varied with drilling conducted not on set line spacing.  The drill line spacing varies from 10 m to 45 m, with an average of about 20 m between drill lines. A total of 251 composites of 5 m length, capped at 5.90% copper, 0.86% zinc, 32 g/t silver and 1.4 g/t gold, were used for the estimation. The  mineral  resource  was  estimated  by  ordinary  kriging  within  a  three-dimensional mineralization  envelope,  defined  by  similar  geological  characteristics  in  terms  of alteration and mineralogy, using a 0.5% copper cut-off grade.

|                  0.5 | 2,805,117 |   1.91 |   0.32 |     8.99 |     0.47 |
|                  0.6 | 2,770,947 |   1.93 |   0.32 |     9.05 |     0.47 |
|                  0.8 | 2,672,315 |   1.97 |   0.33 |     9.18 |     0.47 |
|                  1   | 2,505,581 |   2.04 |   0.33 |     9.41 |     0.48 |

To date, mineralization has been modeled over a 480 m strike length and to a depth of  180  m  from  surface.  Additional  drilling  is  warranted  to  define  the  extent  of  near surface mineralization at the north end of the deposit; at depth within and beneath the currently  modeled  Main  Lens;  and  to  the  south  where  limited  deep  drilling  has encountered narrow sulphide intercepts. Given that approximately 75% of the deposit as  currently  modeled  lies  within  a  100  m  depth  from  surface,  further  drilling  and

economic  studies  to  determine  if  all  or  portion  of  the  Chu  Chua  deposit  may  be amenable to open pit extraction are also warranted.

A  two  phase  drilling  program  recommended.  The  first  stage  should  consist  of  a confirmatory drill program to test the main zone and north zone in order to aid in the validation of the historic drilling and to convert some of the resource into an indicated category as well as provide samples for metallurgical work. Six holes, totalling 810 m, are recommended for the first stage of drilling. The first stage is estimated at $ 202,500. Further drilling of south end of the main zone and below the main zone is recommended in  order  to  test  the  lateral  and  depth  extent  of  known  sulphide  mineralization.  Seven holes, totalling 2,160 m, are recommended for the second stage of drilling. The exact number of holes and the total depth would depend on the results of the first stage of drilling.  Any  new  deeper  drilling  should  include  downhole  electromagnetic  surveys measuring conductivity, which can directly assist in extending the current known extent of  the  Chu  Chua  massive  sulphide  lenses  and  in  targeting  new  separate  zones.    In addition,  systematic  downhole  multi  trace  element  and  whole  rock  geochemical  work should  be  conducted  on  any  new  core  in  order  to  identify  and  better  map  out  the existing volcanic stratigraphy associated with the Chu Chua massive sulphide lenses. The  second  stage  is  estimated  at  CDN$  648,000.  The  total  cost  of  the  both  drilling programs combined is CDN$ 850,500.

## 4 Property Description and Location

The  Chu  Chua  property  consists  of  two  active  mineral  claims  (529300,  529301) totaling 282.5 hectares (ha) held by Reva (Table 1).  These claims are located about 24 kilometers (km) northeast of Barriere, B.C., centred at  703,859 m E / 5,695,730 m N (UTM NAD83 Zone 10), and are located within NTS map sheet 92P/8 (Figures 1 and 2). The  claims  were  staked  by  Strongbow  Exploration  Inc.  ('Strongbow')  through  online staking on March 2 nd , 2006 and subsequently transferred online to Reva on December 16, 2009.  The Chu Chua massive sulphide deposit is located on claim 529300 (Chu Chua 1).

Pursuant  to  an  agreement  dated  November  22,  2010,  Reva  granted  Newport  an option to acquire a 50% interest in the Chu Chua Property.  On September 10, 2013, Newport and Reva entered into a new agreement, which is to supercede and replace the November 22, 2010 option agreement, whereby Newport will acquire Reva's 100% interest in the Property, subject to the two existing 1% NSR royalties, in consideration of the  payment  of  $1,500,000  and  the  issuance  of  5,436,000  shares  of  Newport.    This agreement remains subject to the acceptance of the TSX Venture Exchange.

In British Columbia, the owner of a mineral claim acquires the right to the minerals which were available at the time of claim location and as defined in the Mineral Tenure Act of British Columbia.  Surface rights are not included.  Claims are valid for one year and the anniversary date is the annual occurrence of the date of record (the staking completion date of the claim).  To maintain a claim in good standing the claim holder must, on or before the anniversary date of the claim, either: (a) record the exploration and development work carried out on that claim during the current anniversary year; or (b) pay cash in lieu of work.  Payment of cash in lieu of work requirements are assessed at double the corresponding assessment work value; and a minimum of 6 months and a maximum of 12 months.  The amount of work required in the first  2  years  is  $5  per hectare per year; and $10 per hectare per year in years 3 and 4; $15 per hectare per year in years 5 and 6; and $20 per hectare per year in subsequent years.  Only work and  associated  costs  for  the  current  anniversary  year  of  the  mineral  claim  may  be applied toward that claim unit.  If  the  value  of  work  performed  in  a  year exceeds  the required  minimum,  the  value  of  the  excess  work,  can  be  applied  to  cover  work requirements for that claim for  additional  years  (subject  to  the  regulations).    A  report detailing work done and

<!-- image -->

expenditures  must  be  filed  with,  and  approved  by,  the  B.C.  Ministry  of  Energy  and Mines MTO website.

Changes to the Mineral Tenure Act effective July 1, 2012 will affect the Chu Chua Property claims.  Because of changes to the yearly assessment work requirements, as of July 1, 2012, all mineral claims within B.C. will be treated as if they are in their first anniversary  year,  regardless  of  the  issue  date  of  the  claim.    This  has  the  effect  of reducing the overall yearly assessment work requirements for the Property for the next two anniversary years.

All  work  carried  out  on  a  claim  that  disturbs  the  surface  by  mechanical  means (including  drilling,  trenching,  excavating,  blasting,  construction  or  demolishment  of  a camp  or  access,  induced  polarization  surveys  using  exposed  electrodes,  and  site reclamation) requires a Notice of Work permit under the Mines Act and the owner must receive  written  approval  from  the  District  Inspector  of  Mines  prior  to  undertaking  the work.    The  Notice  of  Work  must  include:  the  pertinent  information  as  outlined  in  the Mines Act; additional information as required by the Inspector; maps and schedules for the proposed work; applicable land use designation; up to date tenure information; and, details of actions that will minimize any adverse impacts of the proposed activity.  The claim owner must outline the scope and type of work to be conducted, and approval generally takes one month.

Exploration activities that do not require a Notice of Work permit include: prospecting with hand tools, geological/geochemical surveys, airborne geophysical surveys, ground geophysics  without  exposed  electrodes,  hand  trenching  (no  explosives)  and  the establishment of grids (no tree cutting).  These activities and those that require Permits are outlined and governed by the Mines Act of British Columbia.

The Chief Inspector of Mines makes the decision whether or not land access will be permitted.  Other agencies, principally the Ministry of Forests, determine where and how the access may be constructed and used.  With the Chief Inspector's authorization, a mineral  tenure  holder  must  be  issued  the  appropriate  "Special  Use  Permit"  by  the Ministry of Forests, subject to specified terms and conditions.  The Ministry of Energy and Mines makes the decision whether land access is appropriate and the Ministry of Forests  must  issue  a  Special  Use  Permit.  However,  three  ministries,  namely  the Ministry  of  Energy  and  Mines;  Forests;  and  Environment,  Lands  and  Parks,  jointly determine the location, design and maintenance provisions of the approved road.

Notification  must  be  provided  before  entering  private  land  for  any  mining  activity, including non-intrusive forms of mineral exploration such as mapping surface features and collecting rock, water or soil samples.  Notification may be hand delivered to the owner shown on the British Columbia Assessment Authority records or the Land Title Office  records.    Alternatively,  notice  may  be  mailed  to  the  address  shown  on  these records  or  sent  by  email  or  facsimile  to  an  address  provided  by  the  owner.    Mining activities cannot start sooner than eight days after notice has been served.  Notice must include a description or map of where the work will be conducted and a description of what type of work will be done, when it will take place and approximately how many

<!-- image -->

people will be on the site.  It must include the name and address of the person serving the notice and the name and address of the onsite person responsible for operations.

Newport  does  not  currently  hold  a  Notice  of  Work  permit  for  the  Property. Approval of a completed Notice of Work permit application takes approximately 1 to 2 months  from  the  date  of  submission.    At  present,  the  author  does  not  know  of  any environmental liabilities to which the property may be subject.

## 5 Accessibility, Climate, Local Resources, Infrastructure and Physiography

The Chu Chua claims are located 24 km northeast of Barriere, B.C., centered on the Chu Chua deposit  (120°4'15'  W  longitude  and  51°22'34'N  latitude  or  703,859  m  E  / 5,695,730  m  N  UTM  NAD83  Zone  10).  The  property  is  vehicle-accessible  along  the paved Barriere Lakes Road and either the North Barriere Lake or Birk Creek logging roads. The Chu Chua deposit can be accessed via 4x4 vehicle from the end of the Birk Creek logging road.  The climate varies seasonally with temperature ranging from -30 to +40 o C. Experiencing heavy snowfall in the winter, the work season lasts from late June to mid-October. Elevation varies from 900 to over 2200 metres (m).  Snow may still be present  into  July  at  higher  elevations.  Vegetation  varies  with  elevation  from  alpine  to sub alpine below 1800 m. Logging status has had great effect on the area with clear cut, second growth, spruce pine and cedar forests all being present on the property.

Barriere  (population  3,450)  is  the  closest  town  to  the  property;  accommodations, RCMP  and  a  health  center  can  be  found  there.  Lodging  may  be  found  at  other communities between Barriere and Kamloops. Kamloops is the nearest major center, providing  all  services;  located  64.1  km  south  of  Barriere  along  Highway  5  (The Yellowhead). Kamloops has an airport that provides charters along with scheduled air service.

If an exploration camp were to be established on the property electric power would be provided by a diesel generator and water may be sourced from numerous streams in the Chu Chua area.

## 6 History

## 6.1   Historical Exploration Programs

In 1977, Vestor Explorations Ltd. (Vestor) conducted a stream sediment survey and located  a  10  square-metre  (m )  limonite  gossan  on  the  south  slope  of  Chu  Chua 2 Mountain near a northerly striking massive magnetite body (Vollo, 1979a). The property was optioned by Craigmont Mines Ltd. and subsequently drilled with a total of 2,843 m in  23  holes  in  1978  (Figure  3).  Twenty-two  of  these  holes  are  located  within  claim 529300 and one hole (CC-8) falls approximately 45 m north of the claim boundary. This initial drilling outlined the Chu Chua massive sulphide body with thicknesses up to 15 m, a strike length of 300 m and a vertical depth of 200 m. Highlights from this early drilling include  sample  2436  from  drill  hole  CC-6  which  assayed  4.41%  copper  (Cu),  0.69% zinc  (Zn),  1.23  grams-per-tonne  (g/t)  gold  (Au)  and  15.09  g/t  silver  (Ag)  over  5  m, sample 2305 from drill hole CC-16 which assayed 7.47% Cu, 0.75% Zn, 0.69 g/t Au and

22.6 g/t Ag over 5 m, and sample 2313 from drill hole CC-17 which assayed 14.54% Cu, 0.93% Zn, 1.03 g/t Au and 9.3 g/t Ag over 4.2 m (Vollo, 1979a).

Between April 5 and May 20, 1979, a Digital Helicopter Electromagnetic (DIGHEM) survey of 2,274 line-km was flown in the North Thompson River Area, including over the Chu Chua deposit, by DIGHEM Ltd. for Craigmont (Fraser and Dvorak, 1979). Following the survey 21 holes totaling 3,330 m were drilled. A total of 15 holes (2,655 m) targeted the  main  area  of  interest  identified  by  the  1978  drilling,  these  holes  fall  within  claim 529300. Eleven of these holes intersected massive sulfides. An additional 4 holes (CC34, CC-35, CC-37, and CC-39) were drilled to test the extent of the deposit along strike to the north of the Property.  At a depth of 15.0 m, drill hole CC-34 intersected chert matrix agglomerate containing up to 5% pyrite-chalcopyrite-pyrrhotite mineralization at a depth of 15.0 m that returned assays of 0.17% Cu, 0.06% Zn, 0.25 g/t Au and 4 g/t Ag over 1.3 m.  Drill holes CC-35 and CC-37, collared at distances of 200 and 400 m to the north of CC-34, respectively, did not intersect significant mineralisation.  At a depth of 85.0  m  drill  hole,  CC-39  collared  600  m  to  the  north  of  CC-34,  intersected  rhyolite containing 5-10% pyrite mineralization that returned assays of 0.3 g/t Au and 0.6 g/t Ag over 5 m (Cu, Pb and Zn were not analyzed).  Two holes (CC-43, and CC-44) were drilled approximately 1.3 km east of the deposit to test nearby conductors that proved to be graphitic cherts (Vollo, 1979b, c).

By the early 1980s it was evident that the Chu Chua deposit consisted of at least two sulfide  lenses  within  the  Fennell  Formation  (Vollo,  1981,  1982a).  In  October  1980  a Horizontal Loop Electromagnetic (HLEM) survey was carried by Craigmont. The survey covered  area  extending  from  southern  tip  of  Chu  Chua  to  1  km  to  the  south  of  the deposit. A total of 6.7 line-km was surveyed over 100 m spaced east-west lines with 200 m coil separation. A north-south conductor was detected along the southern tip of the deposit, extending approximately 180 m (Hallof et al. 1981). In 1981, three additional holes were drilled to test the extent of the known ore zone. Two holes (CC-45, 46) fall on claim 529300 and one hole (CC-47) lies just south of the claim. Hole CC-45 (319 m total depth) was drilled to test the down-dip extension of Chu Chua sulphide zone and encountered  tuffite  with  minor  chalcopyrite  (Vollo,  1981).  Hole  CC-46  (420  m  total depth) intersected beds of massive, cupriferous pyrite, magnetite and talc in a siliceous tuffite  unit.  Hole  CC-47  (110.5  m  total  depth)  was  drilled  on  a  parallel  conductor  but intersected only basalt (Vollo, 1982a).

In  1982,  Craigmont  drilled  eight  holes  totalling  3,992  m  targeting  the  Chu  Chua mineralized  zone  (all  on  claim  529300).  Hole  CC-48  intersected  massive  to  weakly banded chalcopyrite, magnetite and talc in a siliceous tuff unit that assayed 2.4% Cu, 0.34% Zn, 2.61 g/t Au and 13.8 g/t Ag over 6.7 m (Vollo, 1982a). Three additional holes (CC-49,  CC-54  CC-55)  tested  the  depth  extent  of  the  Chu  Chua  sulphide  lens  and intersected  narrow  zones  of  massive  sulphides,  tuff  and  altered  basalt  at  downhole depths up to 600 m (Vollo, 1982b).  Additionally in 1982, Craigmont conducted VLF-EM and  magnetic  surveys  over  a  35  km  grid,  516  soil  samples  were  collected  and  four holes (CC-50 to CC-53) totalling 229.5 m were drilled, 3 km to the northeast of the Chu Chua deposit. The drilling intersected graphitic argillite and tuff containing disseminated pyrite and pyrrhotite; no samples were submitted for analysis (Vollo, 1982c).

The Craigmont exploration program at Chu Chua was cancelled in 1983 due to the closure  of  the  Craigmont  Mine  near  Merritt,  B.C.  and  difficult  deep  hole  drilling conditions (Morganti, 1983). The property was returned to Vestor.

During October of 1984, Vestor conducted an electromagnetic survey to the south of the1980 HLEM grid (to the northeast of the Property), extending the surveyed as south as Cowell Creek. A total of 19 line-km were surveyed over 200 m spaced lines. Several strong  northwest  trending  conductors  were  detected,  with  the  most  prominent  one stretching along the survey grid, measuring close to 2 km in strike length (Candy and White, 1984).

In August 1985, Falconbridge Copper (Falconbridge) acquired the Chu Chua deposit. Subsequently, 82.5 line-km of horizontal-loop EM (HLEM) surveys were carried out on 3 grids.  The  Chu  Chua grid  covered  the  Chu Chua  deposit and adjacent  claims  to  the east of the Property. The other two grids (SC/CH and Anna grids) were located to the approximately 7 km to south of the Chu Chua deposit (Pirie, 1985a). Three drill holes located  east  of  the  Chu  Chua  deposit,  totalling  618  m  were  drilled  to  test  HLEM anomalies and adjacent stratigraphy but no significant sulfides were intersected (Pirie, 1985b).

In 1986, Falconbridge extended the Chu Chua grid 1.5 km south, and collected 30 line-km  of  HLEM  data  and  1,074  soil  geochemical  samples  to  test  for  strike  parallel mineralization to the east of the Chu Chua deposit. The geophysical survey defined an approximately  100  x  1400  m,  north-south  trending  conductive  anomaly  crossing  the entire  survey  grid.    An  approximately  25  x  300  m,  Pb,  Zn,  Cu,  Ag  soil  geochemical anomaly is broadly coincident with the northern third of the conductive anomaly (Pirie, 1986).

In 1987, Falconbridge changed its name to Minnova Inc. (Minnova) and completed diamond drilling of 6 holes totalling 852 m. Minnova's drilling continued to test the HLEM conductive  anomaly  east  of  the  Chu  Chua  deposit;  and  a  quartz-feldspar  porphyry rhyolite  dome within  the  SC/CH grid at  head of Slate Creek.  Four holes (CCF-12 to CCF-15)  drilled  within  the  Chu  Chua  grid  did  not  intersect  massive  sulphides.    Drill holes CCF-16 and CCF-17 targeted the flanks of a rhyolite dome.  Silica-sericite altered rhyolite and tuffaceous argillite intersected within drill hole CCF-16 returned assays of 1.1 g/t Au over 3 m between 94.5 and 97.5 m depth.  CCF-17 did not return significant assays (Gray, 1987).

The  1988  field  season  consisted  of  a  focused  drilling  program  on  the  Chu  Chua deposit and an extension of the Chu Chua Main HLEM Grid to the north of the Property As noted above, drilling by Craigmont in the late 1970's and early 1980's had defined two zones of relatively thick, high grade mineralization  occurring  within  100  m  of  the surface  which became known as the Main and North Lenses. Minnova's  1988  drilling was  designed  to  test  the  continuity  of  grade  and thickness of both lenses of the Chu Chua sulfide deposit by establishing drill intercepts at 25 m spacing. The program consisted of 13 holes totalling 1,152 m (all holes were within claim 529300). As a result of this drilling significant tonnage was added to the deposit and the western margin of

the  Main  sulphide  lens  was  defined.  The  Main  Lens  was  determined  to  be  a  funnel shaped body with two zones of mineralization termed the Footwall and Hanging Wall Zones. The Footwall Zone was found to be a well-developed, continuous zone of highly variable  thickness  located  along  the  footwall  contact  of  the  lens.  It  had  an  average thickness of about 7.2 m and contained the highest grade mineralization in the deposit. The Hanging Wall Zone was found to be thinner, less continuous and of lower grade, with an average thickness of about 4.5 m. The North Lens was found to be thinner than the upper part of the Main Lens, contained uniform mineralization but with lower grades than the Footwall Zone (Blackadar, 1989 and Lear, 1989).

During the 1989 field season, 21 holes totalling 1,663 m were drilled in the deposit area (all  holes  were  within  claim  529300).    The  drilling  further  delineated  of  the  near surface  mineralization  and  showed  that  the  highest  copper  grades  occurred  in  the Footwall and Hangingwall massive sulphide zones. Grades within the massive sulphide zones  tended  to  be  highly  variable;  though  increased  copper  grades  correlated positively  with  zinc,  silver,  and  gold  values.  Additionally,  Quantech  Consulting  Inc. completed a 24.3 line-km of transient electromagnetic (TEM) survey over the deposit and  area  to  the  north  and  south.    The  survey  defined  a  subtle  conductive  anomaly extending  north  from  the  Chu  Chua  deposit  a  distance  of  200  m.    Beyond  this,  the anomaly is more evident and extends a further 650 m to the northwest, suggesting the potential  for  the  discovery  of  additional  deep  massive  sulphide  mineralization  (Wild, 1989).

During 1990, Minnova drilled eleven holes, totaling 1,731 m. Three holes were drilled into  the  Chu  Chua  deposit  to  test  specific  targets  in  the  footwall  and  on  the  plane  of mineralization. Two holes (CCF-61 and CCF62), totalling 1,014.1 m, on claim 529300, and one hole (CCF-60) totalling 100.9 m falls to the north of the Property. At a depth of 83  m,  drill  hole  CCF-60  intersected  s  sequence  of  fine  grained  siliceous  sediments containing 2-10% pyrite bands and stringers and trace chalcopyrite that returned assays of 0.18% Cu, 0.03% Zn and 4.4 g/t Ag over 4.3 m.  Hole CCF-61 did not identify any new mineralization, but did provide an additional, shallow intersection of the North Lens. Hole  CCF-62  demonstrated  that  the  massive  sulfide  extends  to  550  m  depth  and identified a zone of zinc rich massive sulphide; something that had not been previously observed at Chu Chua (Heberlein, 1990). In addition, eight diamond drill holes (MCC-52 through  MCC-59)  were  completed  to  test  coincident  EM  and  magnetic  anomalies  at pass separating the headwaters of Birk and Chu Chua creeks (3 km south of the Chu Chua  deposit).  The  drill  holes  intersected  a  sequence  of  sericite  altered  sediments, argillite and magnetic diorite sills that explained the geophysical anomalies.  Drill hole MCC-56  intersected  a  3.7  m  cherty  interval  containing  1-3%  bedded  pyrite,  trace chalcopyrite, and  a  15  cm  interval  of  massive  sulphide  with  approximately  3% chalcopyrite.    The  massive  sulphide  interval  returned assays  of  1%  Cu and  9  g/t  Ag. Drill hole MCC-37 through MCC-39 tested the potential for additional mineralization to the north and south but did not intersect massive sulphides (Heberlein, 1990).

Minnova completed their  last  work  in  the  Chu  Chua  area  in  the  fall  of  1991.  Nine deep drill holes totalling 4,957 m tested the Chu Chua sulphide horizon along strike and down-dip. Four of the drill holes (CCF-63, 64, 67 and 69) were surveyed with downhole pulse  EM.    Six  holes,  totalling  3,793  m,  are  located  within  claim  529300.  Two  holes

<!-- image -->

(CCF-64 and CCF-65) to the north of Chu Chua deposit and one hole (CCF-68) to the south were also drilled.  Holes CCF-63 to CCF-66 tested the Chu Chua horizon at depth to  the  north  of  the  Main  Lens.    Drill  hole  CCF-63  intersected  silicified  basalt  and sulphide  stringers  interpreted  as  a  footwall  alteration  zone  that  returned  assays  of 0.12% Cu over 11.7 m; and drill hole CCF-66 intersected two separate intervals of pyrite exhalite that returned assays of 0.21% Cu, 360 ppm Zn over 4.3 m, and 0.33% Cu, 330 ppm Zn over 1.5 m.  Holes CCF-67 and CCF-68 tested the Chu Chua horizon to the south  of  the  Main  Lens  and  did  not  intersect  significant  mineralization  or  alteration. Hole  CCF-69  was  drilled  to  test  the  down-dip  extent  of  the  Main  Lens.    The  hole intersected a new hanging wall massive sulphide zone at a depth of 381 m that returned assays of 0.97% Cu, 0.84 g/t Au over 14.85 m occurring 1.9 m above a second zone assaying 0.75% Cu, 1.37 g/t Au over 4.65 m.  Drill hole CCF-70 was collared 150 m southwest of CCF-69 and intersected an 11.5 m zone of chert and magnetite-hematitepyrite  exhalite;  a  distance  of  230  m  further  down  dip  than  the  massive  sulphide intersected in CCF-69 (Wells, 1991).  Hole CCF-71 tested the down-dip and northern strike extent of mineralization within CCF-69, and intersected massive sulfide zone at a depth of 658 m that returned assays of 0.69% Cu, 0.13% Zn, 0.14 g/t Au and 5.69 g/t Ag over 9.95 m.

Strongbow acquired the claims overlying the Chu Chua deposit by online staking on March 2nd, 2006. During fall 2006, Strongbow completed a soil geochemical survey and a  compilation  of  historic  Craigmont  and  Minnova  soil  sampling.    A  total  of  302  soil samples were collected at a spacing of 50 m over a series of selecteast-west oriented gridlines designed to test the geochemical response over the Chu Chua deposit, and select  conductive  anomalies  from  Craigmont's  1979  DIGEM  airborne  geophysical survey  (Fraser  and  Dvorak,  1979).    Of  the  302  samples  collected  by  Strongbow,  38 were collected within the Property.  A series of six consecutive samples collected over the  Main  Lens  of  the  Chu  Chua  deposit  returned  anomalous  values  ranging  from between 27 and 335 ppm Cu. A line crossing just north of the Main Lens, and a second line 400 m further to the north, did not return anomalous values.  A series of 100 and 400 m spaced soil lines completed DIGEM and HLEM conductive anomalies within the southern  part  of  the  Falconbridge's  Chu  Chu  grid  (Pirie,  1985b;  and  Pirie  1986) correlated with a number of single and two sample greater than 100 ppm Cu anomalies. Two soil lines spaced at 100 m tested the area above Minnova's MCC-52 through MCC55 drill sites (Heberlein, 1990), but did not return significant anomalies.  Compilation of 2,703  historic  Craigmont  and  Minnova  soil  samples  revealed  numerous  single  and multi-sample greater than 100 ppm Cu, and 125 ppm Zn, soil anomalies to the north and south of the Chu Chua deposit (Gale, 2007).

In 2008 the field program for the Chu Chua property included a helicopter-borne time domain geophysical survey and a property visit by  Mr. Raffle (Figures 4 and 5). During  summer  2008,  Aeroquest  Limited  completed  an  840  line-km  helicopter-borne AeroTEM  III  survey  (covering  the  Chu  Chua  property  and  surrounding  area).    The AeroTEM III, time-domain EM system in conjunction with a cesium vapour magnetometer was flown east-west with a 100 m cross line spacing from June 29 to July 5, which identified the Chu Chua deposit as a magnetic anomaly accompanied by a slightly  offset  strong  EM  anomaly  likely  representing  the  juxtaposition  of  the  massive sulphide body and magnetite alteration of the host rocks. The anomalies revealed that

the Chu Chua deposit has an approximate strike length of between 400 and 450 m and is  fairly  steep  in  nature.    The  elongated  magnetic  contours  to  the  south  may  indicate that the deposit plunges to depth to the south. During fall 2008, Mr. Raffle visited the Chu Chua Property and collected a total of 5 rock and/or historic core samples from the Property.    Three  rock  samples  of  variably  altered  volcanic  rocks  were  collected  from around the Chu Chua deposit and two samples from historic core were collected from drill  hole CC-21 at approximate depths of 193 and 208 m, respectively (Raffle, 2008). Pyrite  and  magnetite  were  associated  with  the  rock  samples,  the  best  of  which (08KRP800) assayed 0.086% Cu, 0.027% Zn, 0.129 g/t Au and 2.93 g/t Ag.  The core samples comprised chalcopyrite-bearing volcanic rocks and massive sulphide, the latter of  which  (08KRM002)  assayed  3.78%  Cu,  0.6%  Zn,  0.318  g/t  Au  and  7.35  g/t  Ag (Raffle, 2008).

## 6.2   Historical Mineral Estimates

During August and September, 2009, Strongbow acquired and made available the proprietary Minnova resource and metallurgical reports, which have been reviewed by the  authors.  A  preliminary  resource  summary  was completed for Minnova in 1989 by Mintec Inc. (Davies, 1989; Purkis, 1991). Mintec Inc. (Mintec) outlined an unconstrained (no cutoffs) total resource of 2.91 million tonnes at a grade of 1.60% Cu, 0.26% Zn, 6.9 g/t Ag, 0.4 g/t Au (Purkis, 1991).  In the same memo, Mintec provided a near surface potentially open pittable 'dipper pit' resource of 798,611 tonnes using a 2.0% Cu cutoff yielding 3.87% Cu, 0.45% Zn, 0.69 g/t Au and 12.8 g/t Ag (Davies, 1989 and Purkis, 1991).

The  resource  work  was  done  in  August-September  of  1989  and  was  done  as  a polygonal block model using Medsystem. The memo style report constructed by Mintec is summary  in  nature  and  contains  few  details  of  any  data  review  and  Quality Assurance/Quality  Control  (QA/QC)  work  that  might  have  been  performed  (Davies, 1989; Purkis, 1991).  Even though the drill hole spacing is good and the continuity of the zones reasonable, there is data that was never captured or has been lost including little if  any  QA/QC  work  was  ever  completed  for  the  assaying  and  SG  work,  there  is  no evidence of systematic and accurate collar surveys, there is no good quality topographic surface that was produced and there is a complete lack of downhole azimuth surveys for most if not all the drill holes in the resource area.  The Mintec report and all of the resource  calculations  contained  within  it  are  not  acceptable  for  the  purposes  of  a National Instrument 43-101 resource of any category as defined in 'CIM Estimation of Mineral  Resources  and  Mineral  Reserves  Best  Practices  Guidelines'  dated  May  30, 2003  and  'CIM  Definition  Standards  for  Mineral  Resources  and  Mineral  Reserves' dated November 27 th , 2010.  A qualified person has not done sufficient work to classify any of the historical resource estimates for Chu Chua as current mineral resources or mineral reserves and as such none of the historical estimates should be relied upon.

## 7 Geological Setting and Mineralization

## 7.1   Regional Geology

Schiarizza and Preto (1987) mapped the Adams Plateau Clearwater-Vavenby area at 1:100,000 providing a concise regional geological picture  for  the Chu  Chua  property. The following regional geology section is taken from thier work.

The Chu Chua area is on the western edge of the Omineca Belt and is underlain by the Fennell Formation of the Slide Mountain Assemblage to the west and by the Eagle Bay Assemblage to the east (Figure 6).  The Early Cambrian to Mississippian Eagle Bay Assemblage is in the pericratonic Kootenay Terrane and consists of metasedimentary and  metavolcanic  rocks  which  are  repeated  in  four  Northwest-dipping  thrust  sheets. The assemblage is comprised of a Lower Palaeozoic succession of clastic metasediments, carbonate and  mafic  metavolcanic  rocks,  and  an  overlying  DevonoMississippian succession of felsic to intermediate melavolcanic rocks and metasediments.  The Homestake and Rea VMS deposits are hosted by intermediate to felsic metavolcanic rocks of the Lower Devono-Mississippian succession.

The Slide Mountain Assemblage is part of Slide Mountain Terrane and consists of the Devonian to Middle Permian Fennell Formation. The formation is an oceanic sequence consisting of two major divisions. The structurally lower (eastern) division comprises a heterogeneous assemblage of bedded chert, gabbro, diabase, pillowed basalt, clastic metasediments,  quartz-feldspar-porphyry  rhyolite  and  intrafonnalional  conglomerate. The  upper  (western)  division  consists  almost  entirely  of  pillowed  and  massive  basalt with  gabbro  and  minor bedded chert and  argillite.    Both  intrusive  and extrusive  mafic igneous rocks are tholeiitic. Tops throughout the succession consistently face west.

The Fennell Formation and Eagle Bay Assemblage are intruded by mid-Cretaceous granodiorite  and  quartz-monzonite  of  the  Raft  and  Baldy  batholiths.  The  package  is locally  overlain  by  Eocene  Kamloops  Group  volcanic  and  sedimentary  rocks  and Miocene  lavas.  The  map  area  is  dominated  by  easterly  directed  thrust  faults,  which imbricate  the  Fennell  Formation  and separate it from  the  underlying  Eagle  Bay Assemblage.    Tectonic  emplacement  of  the  Fennell  Formation  over  the  Eagle  Bay Assemblage  was  followed  by  southwesterly-directed  folding  and  associated  thrust faulting.    Folding  and  fabrics  associated  with  this  event  are  evident  in  the  Eagle  Bay Assemblage, but are rarely seen in the Fennell Formation.

## 7.2   Local Geology

The  following  summary  of  the  local  geology  is  reprinted  from  Heberlein  (1990). Detailed discussion of individual lithological units can be found in Wild (1989).

The Chu Chua property is underlain by rocks of the Mississippian to Permian Fennell Formation  (Schiarizza  and  Preto,  1987).    Two  litho-structural  packages  make  up  the Fennell Fm.  These are called the upper and lower divisions.  The lower division forms a north-south belt that extends from the Barriere River fault in the south to Clearwater in the  north.  It  is  composed  of  a  complexly  interbedded  and      thrust      imbricated sequence   of   massive  basalt,  clastic  metasediments (greywackes and argillites),

ribbon  cherts,  quartz-feldspar  phyric  rhyolite  and  intraformational  conglomerate.    The upper division underlies most of the property area and hosts the Chu Chua deposit.  It consists  of  pillowed  to  massive  basalt  flows,  diabase  sills,  argillite  and  rare  chert. These rocks can be traced from Barriere as far north as Wells Grey Park.   They are responsible for the rugged cliff exposures on either side of the North Thompson River Valley between Little Fort and Clearwater.  Both divisions of the Fennell Formation are intruded by the Cretaceous Baldy Batholith, which forms a prominent easterly trending mountain range to the northeast of Barriere.

Deformation in the Fennell formation is not intense.  Units have been rotated into a vertically dipping west facing homocline that is interpreted to be the western limb of a thrust-dismembered anticline (Schiarizza and Preto, 1987).  There is little evidence for mesoscopic  folding  and  penetrative  fabrics  are  mostly  absent.    Late,  north  and  east trending (Tertiary?) normal faults cause local offsets of the Upper Fennell stratigraphy. A west-dipping thrust fault is inferred to separate the upper and lower divisions of the Fennell  Fm.    This  is  based  on  conodont  ages  determined  from  chert  beds  in  both divisions.  The Lower Fennell sequence is also inferred to be thrust imbricated based on fossil data (Schiarizza and Preto, 1987).

Both Fennell Formation divisions are regionally metamorphosed to lower greenschist facies.    Close  to  the  contact  of  the  Baldy  Batholith  (within  approximately  500  m)  the regional  metamorphism  is  overprinted  by  a  contact  thermal  aureole.    Locally  this reaches hornblende hornfels grade.  Despite the metamorphism, primary textures are well preserved in both volcanic and sedimentary units.

## 7.3   Mineralization

The work of Wild (1989) offered an excellent description of Chu Chua mineralization; the subsequent three paragraphs are from this work.

The  Chu  Chua  deposit  consists  of  two  major  and  several  minor  sulphide  lenses hosted  by  massive  and  pillowed  green  basalt  of  the  Upper  Fennell  Formation.    The lenses are oriented along a north-south trend dipping from vertical to very steeply west. The  principal  axes  of  the  lenses  appear  to  plunge  gently  to  the  south.    The  strike extension of near surface mineralization is approximately 300 m and total thicknesses for the mineralized zones range up to 80 m.

Massive sulphides lie immediately below a very sharp contact with the hangingwall basalts.  Pyrite makes up approximately 90% of the massive sulphide, often occurring as coarse anhedral grains displaying annealed textures.  Chalcopyrite is the main ore mineral  occurring  as  massive  streaks  up  to  25  cm  thick,  as  small  inclusions  in  both pyrite  and  magnetite, and as fracture fillings  and  interstices  in  coarse  granular  pyrite. These textures suggest a large degree of remobilization.  Thin section work (Manley, 1988  -unpublished  paper),  has  shown  good  triple  junctions  in  granular  pyrite  with chalcopyrite often occurring in the interstices, as tiny anhedral blebs (50-200 micrometres), and as inclusion trails inside pyrite grains.  Megascopically, sections of massive sulphide show good rolled textures and brecciation, indicating either primary collapse structures or, more likely, tectonic activity.

<!-- image -->

Other economic minerals identified in drillcore include covellite, chalcocite, sphalerite and magnetite.    Cubanite  (CuFe,S3)  and  stannite  are  also  present  (Aggarwal,  1982). Covellite occurs in chalcopyrite-rich sections as fracture fillings.  Chalcocite occurs as discrete  grains  within  either  pyrite  or  chalcopyrite  (Manley,  1988).    Sphalerite  and possibly trace amounts of galena occur as fine grained and massive blebs usually but not  exclusively  with  copper  mineralization.    Magnetite  content  increases  toward  the footwall  occurring  as  subhedral  grains  possibly  mixed  with  or  replacing  pyrite.    The matrix  is  likely  quartz  and  barite.    Other  metals  present  in  the  ore  zone  include  gold (commonly 1 g/t), silver (commonly 15-30 g/t), cobalt (310-475 ppm), and trace amounts of tin (stannite), platinum, and palladium (Aggarwal, 1982).

## 8 Deposit Types

The  principal  deposit  of  interest  on  the  Chu  Chua  property  is  a  Cyprus-type volcanogenic massive sulphide (VMS).  The stratigraphy underlying the property is also prospective for  Kuroko-type  massive  sulphide deposits  evidenced  by  the  presence of several of these proximal to the property. In general terms, volcanic-associated massive sulphide deposits (VMS) are an important source of copper, lead and zinc with lesser precious metals and comprise a massive sulphide ore lens underlain by a stringer zone of  intensely  altered  rocks  hosting  vein  and disseminated  ore (Franklin, 1993).  These deposits are generally hosted in volcanic rocks of varying compositions with associated but  less  abundant  sedimentary  rocks.    Quartz  veins  hosting  base-  and/or  preciousmetals  may  also  be  significant  when  considering  the  numerous  occurrences  of  this mineralization type surrounding the Chu Chua property.

## 8.1   Cyprus Type Massive Sulphide

Cyprus-type massive sulphide deposits are part of the volcanic-associated massive sulphide  deposits  spectrum,  present  in  ophiolite  sequences,  dominated  by  mafic  and ultramafic volcanic rocks (Galley and Koski, 1999).  These ophiolite sequences form in fore-arc and back-arc environments and comprise sheeted dyke complexes overlain by volcanic successions of lava flows, pillow lavas, breccias, hyaloclastites, feeder dykes and sills and interstitial sediments.  Driven by the heat of underlying magma chambers, hydrothermal fluids circulate through the volcanic pile scavenging metals, redepositing them as massive, stratiform sulphide lenses typically composed of pyrite, chalcopyrite, sphalerite and magnetite; the underlying stringer/feeder zone typically consists of quartz and  pyrite  with  minimal  base  metal  content.    The  sulphide  lenses  are  commonly clustered  in  groups  and  can  often  be  found  along  strike  of  other  lenses.    In  British Columbia, workers have noted a common alignment of these lenses near steep, normal faults (Hoy, 1995).

Cyprus-type deposits in British Columbia are primarily Mississippian-Permian or lateTriassic in age; the most significant of which are the Anyox deposits which range from 0.2 to 23.7 million tonnes in size and average grades of 1.5% Cu, 9.9 g/t Ag and 0.17 g/t  Au  (Hoy,  1995).    The  authors  have  not  verified  the  size  and/or  grade  of  these deposits  as  described  by  Hoy  (1995)  and  the  mineralization  contained  within  these deposits may or may not be indicative of the mineralization on the Chu Chua Property.

<!-- image -->

Exploration for these deposits is aided by the highly conductive nature of the massive sulphide  bodies  which  can  be  readily  identified  using  various  electromagnetic  or induced-polarization  geophysical  techniques  or  the  associated  magnetite  mineralogy resolved  by  magnetic  geophysical  techniques.    Soil  sampling  will  typically  display anomalous levels of the relevant metals including copper and zinc or other associated elements.    When  rock  exposure  allows,  prospecting  and  mapping  should  focus  on altered packages  of submarine  volcanic rocks of mafic-ultramafic compositions. Alteration  of  these  rock  types  results  in  common  chlorite-talc-carbonate-magnetite assemblages;  the  underlying  stringer  zone  can  be  typified  by  this  assemblage  with accompanying quartz-pyrite veins (Hoy, 1995).

## 8.2   Kuroko Massive Sulphide

Kuroko (or Noranda) type massive sulphide deposits are typically present within felsic volcanic  rocks  in  calc-alkaline,  bimodal  arc  successions.    They  form  during  the development  of  island  arc  complexes  during  rifting  within  or  behind  an  oceanic  or continental  margin  (Hoy,  1995).    Host  rocks  to  these  deposits  are  typically  rhyolitedacite  submarine  volcanic  rocks  with  associated  andesites  or,  less  commonly,  mafic volcanic rocks or sedimentary rocks.  Mineralization, including pyrite, sphalerite, galena and chalcopyrite, is found within one or more lenses of massive sulphides, commonly zoned  with  a  Cu-rich  base  and  a  Pb+Zn-rich  top.  These  deposits  can  also  have  a significant  concentrations  of  precious-metals  including  silver  and  gold.    Underneath these  lenses,  low-grade  stringer  zones  are  common,  while  barite  or  chert  layers commonly overlie these lenses.  As with the Cyprus-type deposits, the massive sulphide lens  forms  above  a  hydrothermal-fluid  cell  with  the  stringer  zone  representing  the remains of the channel way of these fluids. Individual sulphide lenses vary in thickness from 1 to 10's of metres with strike lengths of 10's to 100's of metres.

In  British  Columbia,  Kuroko-type  deposits  are  the  most  common  form  of  VMS deposits,  principally  hosted  by  the  late-Devonian  Eagle  Bay  Assemblage  located northeast of Kamloops and the late-Devonian Sicker group on Vancouver Island (Hoy, 1995).    Less  commonly  they  are  Permian-Mississippian,  late-Triassic,  early-middle Jurassic, and Cretaceous in age.  A typical deposit in British Columbia can range from less  than  1  million  tonnes  to  more  than  10  million  tonnes.    The  most  notable  Kuroko deposits in British Columbia, the H-W and Kutcho, are reported to contain 10.1 million tonnes grading 2.0% Cu, 3.5% Zn, 0.3% Pb, 30.4 g/t Ag and 2.1 g/t Au and 17 million tonnes grading 1.6% Cu, 2.3% Zn, 0.06% Pb, 29 g/t Ag and 0.3 g/t Au, respectively (Hoy, 1995).  The authors have not verified the grade and tonnage information provided by Hoy (1995).

Exploration for Kuroko deposits parallels that for the Cyprus deposits save the host rocks  and  associated  alteration.    Felsic  volcanic  domes  and  centres  should  be investigated  along  with  pyrite  and  chert  horizons,  all  of  which  display  quartz-sericitechlorite alteration with distal clay mineral-, albite-, or carbonate-alteration.

## 8.3   Epithermal Veins

Epithermal veins represent a broad spectrum mineral exploration target in that they are present in rocks of all types and ages in a range of tectonic settings and can host a

<!-- image -->

wide variety of metals, including but not limited to Au, Ag, Cu, Pb, Zn, solely or as part of a polymetallic assemblage.  Because of this variability it is difficult to describe them in general terms.  The common association of these veins to massive sulphide deposits increases  their  importance  in  the  Chu  Chua  area.    Deposits  of  this  kind  are  typically manifested as a collection of quartz veins which formed penecontemporaneously thus they may cross-cut one another but were generated from the same event.  The location and morphology of these veins are largely controlled by rheological contrasts in the host rocks  and  by  ore-controlling  structures.    These  deposits  can  also  contain  multiple stages  of  mineralization,  presumably  related  to  periodic  tectonism  associated  with increased  intrusive  activity  and  magmatic  hydrothermal  fluid  generation  (Panteleyev, 1996).  The country rock surrounding epithermal veins is commonly extensively altered even though the vein walls may be sharply defined.  Alteration can be areally restricted but large overprints of clay minerals, sericite and chlorite are possible; more proximal alteration will comprise pyrite and quartz with lesser carbonate minerals.  It is also not uncommon to find large, highly coloured supergene gossans covering epithermal ores.

Lefebure and Church (1996) suggest that for polymetallic veins in British Columbia which are larger than 20,000 tonnes, the average size is 161,000 tonnes with grades of 304 g/t Ag, 3.47 % Pb and 2.66 % Zn.  Within these, gold and copper are of significant abundance in only half of the instances with average grades of 4 g/t Au and 0.09% Cu. The authors have not verified the information provided by Lefebure and Church (1996).

Exploration for these deposits focuses on second-order structural features adjacent to crustal-scale faults or structures surrounding volcanic centres.  Geophysically, these deposits will commonly display as linear, magnetic lows and may have electromagnetic or  induced-polarization  potential  due  to  the  sulphide  content.    Soil  geochemistry  can show elevations of the aforementioned principal elements as well as arsenic, mercury, antimony, bismuth, molybdenum, tin, tungsten and manganese.

## 9 Exploration

The  2011  Chu  Chua  Property  exploration  program  included  differential  global positioning  system  (DGPS)  surveying  of  historic  diamond  drill  hole  collars,  select  resampling  of  historic  diamond  drill  core  stored  at  the  Property,  and  the  creation  of  a DGPS digital elevation model (DEM) over the Chu Chua deposit. A total of 60 drillholes were re-located and surveyed, a total of 110 core samples were taken from the historic core, and an area of 55 ha was surveyed to produce a DEM over the Chu Chua deposit. Exploration was completed between the dates of July 6 and July 16, 2011.

Summary results of drill hole collar surveys, drill core re-sampling and creation of the DEM are presented below. Copies of the drill core re-sampling results, and the original lab analytical certificates are presented in appendices 1 and 2 respectively.

## 9.1  Drill Hole Collar Surveys

DGPS  surveys  of  historic  drill  collar  locations  at  the  Chu  Chua  deposit  were completed in an effort to confirm historically reported drill hole locations, and to provide precise data horizontal location (X-Y) and elevation (Z) of the drill holes.  Drill hole collar surveys were completed using a pair of Trimble R8 Global Navigation Satellite System

<!-- image -->

(GNSS) receivers as base and mobile (rover) units.  Drill collar surveys were completed in  Real  Time  Kinematic  (RTK)  survey  mode,  whereby  the  stationary  base  receiver broadcasts a correction signal to the mobile receiver via UHF radio connection providing horizontal accuracies of up to 10 cm and vertical accuracy of up to 20 cm.

Location of drill sites was aided by reviewing historic exploration reports and site plan maps  showing  drill  sites  in  relation  to  access  trails,  clearings  and  creek  drainages. Individual  drill  sites  were  located  based  on  comparing  historic  plan  maps  with  the current site layout.  Of the 99 historic drill hole locations (ranging from CC-1 to CC-59 and CCF-18 to CCF-71), 60 were re-located and surveyed (Figure 7). Typically drill hole sites were represented by exposed casing, obvious cleared areas, and rarely by collar identification posts or marked tags.

## 9.1 Re-Sampling of Historic Drill Core

During 2011 a total of 110 samples were taken from the historic drill core stored in racks  located  on  the  Chu  Chua  property.    The  objective  of  the  2011  drill  core  resampling program was to verify the presence of historically reported mineralization at the  Chu  Chua  massive  sulphide  deposit.    Drill  core  intervals  to  be  re-sampled  were chosen  based  on  a  previously  completed  compilation  of  historic  diamond  drill  hole results (Raffle and Dufresne, 2010).  Specific re-sampled intervals were selected based on the drill core currently available on site; and in an effort to replicate select historic high  grade  intercepts  from  both  the  north  and  south  sulphide  lenses  at  both  near surface and relatively deep drill intersections.

Historically,  a  total  of  99  diamond  drill  holes,  totalling  19,707 m  were  completed  to delineate  the  Chu  Chua  deposit  between  1978  and  1991.    The  110  core  samples collected during 2011 were selected from high grade intercepts within historic drill holes CC-16, CC-17, CC-21, CC-26, CC-54, CC-55 and CC-57, comprising a total sampled core  length  of  103.7  m.    Samples  of  quartered  drill  core  were  collected  using  a mechanical core splitter. The 110 core samples along with 12 Quality Assurance/Quality Control  (QA/QC)  samples  were  shipped  for  gold  fire  assay  and  Inductively  Coupled Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) analysis by ALS Minerals (ALS).

A comparison of historic and current composite grades has been competed for a total of  82.3  m  of  the  103.7  m  of  drill  core  re-sampled  during  2011.    The  reduction  in comparable assays was due to the fact that in some cases the complete historic sample interval  was not available for assay.  Only results for which the entire historic sample interval was available (ranging from 2.5 to 6 m) have been included in the comparison Of the 103.7 m of drill core re-sampled during 2011, it is possible to complete a direct comparison of 82.3 m.  Comparison of historic and current composite grades indicate that  no  significant  variability  exists  between  historically  reported  versus  current  resampling for zinc gold and silver assays at the Chu Chua deposit (-0.07% Zn, -0.07 g/t Au and, -0.41 g/t Ag of the length weighted average difference based on 82.3 m of drill core  re-sampled,  Table  2).    Copper  values  indicate  a  -0.39%  Cu  length  weighted average difference between the re-sampled and historically reported drill core assays available for comparison.  The difference in re-sampled versus historically reported

<!-- image -->

copper values is largely due to grade apparent grade variability within the drill hole CC16  where  particularly  high  historic  copper  grades  (up  to  7.57%  Cu  over  5  m)  were reported.    Re-sampling  of  the  same  high-grade  interval  returned  assays  of  4.6%  Cu over 5 m (Table 2).  It is considered reasonable for grade variation to occur, in particular with respect to relatively high grade intervals such as those found within CC-16, given the inherent variability of disseminated to semi-massive and massive sulphide mineralization  within  the  Chu  Chua  deposit.    An  exclusion  of  the  results  for  CC-16 returns a -0.14% Cu length weighted average difference between the re-sampled and historically reported drill core assays (64.7 m of drill core directly compared).

The 2011 re-sampling included the collection of four (4) samples as quarter-split drill core  duplicates.    A  comparison  of  duplicate  analysis  permits  an  assessment  of  Chu Chua drill core mineralization heterogeneity (within sample variation).  A comparison of 4  duplicate  samples  collected  during  2011  indicates  that  no  significant  within  sample variability exists for silver and gold (Table 3).  The length weighted average difference of duplicate sample  analysis for copper  and  zinc are 0.20%  Cu  and  0.14%  Zn, respectively.          The  results  indicate  that  at  a  significant  part  of  the  copper  variability between  historically  reported  and  the  2011  re-sampled  drill  core  is  a  result  of  the inherent variability of disseminated to semi-massive and massive sulphide mineralization within the Chu Chua deposit.

Plots of historic and 2011 re-sampling analytical results for gold, silver, copper versus depth (m) for all re-sampled drill holes (CC-16, 17, 21, 26, 54, 55, 57) are presented in Appendix 4.  The figures permit a direct comparison of historic versus 2011 re-sampled assay  results  for  each  drill  hole,  and  further  highlight  within-interval  variability  (i.e. variability in the distribution of sulphide mineralization).

Individual data points were plotted at the midpoint of the respective interval.  Missing data or gaps in the sampling, both from the original sampling or the 2011 re-sampling, are  represented  as  data  gaps  in  the  charts.    Drill  hole  CC-17  (Figure  7)  in  particular indicates  that  a  relatively  wide  zone  of  moderate  grade  mineralization  between  the depths of 45-57 m is directly underlain by a narrower higher grade interval between 5762.6m.  Re-sampling indicates that discrete intervals of high grade mineralization are present within the majority of drill holes.  Increased base metal and silver values do not appear to be accompanied by a corresponding increase in gold assays within drill hole CC-17.  However, higher grade base metal and silver mineralization within drill holes CC-26, 54 and 55 is associated with slight increases in gold assay values (Appendix 3).

## 9.2  Digital Elevation Model

In an effort to aid future exploration and potential mineral resource estimates at the Chu Chua deposit a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) was completed in conjunction with historic drill collar surveys.  The DEM was produced over a 650 m (east-west) x 850 m (north-south),  approximately  55  ha  rectangular  survey  grid  encompassing  the  known surface  and  subsurface  expression  of  the  Chu  Chua  deposit.    The  survey  was completed using a single Trimble R8 GNSS receiver operating without a base station correction  signal,  and  providing  accuracies  of  approximately  2  m  vertically  and  4  m horizontally.  Survey accuracy was reduced in comparison to historic drill collar surveys when  it  was  determined  that  the  UHF  radio  connection  between  base  and  mobile receivers was unreliable due to heavy tree cover and topographic variation.

The  DEM  survey  progressed  via  a  series  of  35  east-west  oriented  survey  lines spaced at intervals of 25 m over the Chu Chua deposit.  Individual DGPS observations (data points) were collected along each line at an observation frequency of 3 Hz.  The receiver was programmed to collect an observation only if position accuracies of better than 2 m horizontally and 4 m vertically were available.  Under certain circumstances,

for example due to heavy tree cover, accuracies of better than 2 m horizontally and 4 m vertically  were not achievable.  In such cases the survey crew was instructed to stop and wait for higher position accuracies enabling an observation to be collected, or in areas  of  very  thick  tree  cover  to  continue  the  survey  and  accept  the  resultant  lower observation density.

The  completed  survey  covering  and  area  of  approximately  55  ha  resulted  in  the collection  of  9,807  individual  location  observations,  having  an  approximately  data density  of  one  observation  every  2-3  m  (east-west)  and  one  observation  every  25  m (north-south).  Each observation consisted of the following data channels: UTM NAD83 Zone  10  (XY)  location,  elevation  in  metres,  number  of  satellites  tracked,  horizontal precision  estimate,  vertical  precision  estimate,  and  Position  Dilution  of  Precision (PDOP) value (Table 4).  PDOP position accuracy values of  1 through 5 are considered ideal to good; values of 5 through 20 are considered moderate or fair; while values of &gt;20 are considered poor.

Table 4: Summary of DEM Observation Accuracy

| Number of  Observations =  9,807   |   Minimum  (m) |   Maximum  (m) |   Mean (m) |   Standard  Deviation |
|------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|------------|-----------------------|
| Horizontal Precision               |          0.054 |          2.814 |      1.315 |                 0.362 |
| Vertical Precision                 |          0.076 |          4.568 |      2.094 |                 0.662 |
| PDOP                               |          1.7   |         61.5   |      3.39  |                 1.54  |
| Satellites Tracking                |          5     |         10     |      5.57  |                 0.77  |

The resultant survey data was analyzed and processed using Geosoft Oasis Montaj software.  Data processing was limited to the application of a B-Spline smoothing filter to the elevation channel (0.6/1 smoothness, and 0.2/1 tension parameters).  This was done  due  to  the  lower  absolute  accuracy  of  elevation  data  in  comparison  to  the horizontal position accuracy.  It was found that the use of a B-Spline filter reduced the 'spikiness'  apparent  in  the  elevation  data.    This  resulted  in  a  smoother  and  more realistic  DEM  product  in  comparison  to  unfiltered  data.    No  filtering  or  processing  of horizontal position data was conducted.  The resultant unfiltered horizontal position and smoothed elevation data was gridded via minimum curvature using a 6.25 m cell size. The resultant minimum curvature grid was re-sampled at a 1 cell size to produce the final  DEM  and  contours  polylines  were  extracted  at  5  m  intervals.    The  final  colourshade DEM data including 5 m contours is presented in Figure 7.

## 11 Sample Preparation, Analyses and Security

## 11.1  Historic Samples

There  is  little  information  available  for  the  sampling  method  and  approach  for  the historic  soil,  rock  and core  sampling. Where information is available, the historic core sampling methodology is discussed below the Data Verification section as part of the ongoing drill hole database validation.

## 11.2 Core Re-Sampling 2011

In July of 2011, a total of 110 core samples were re-sampled in the field by APEX geologists from existing historic core present on the Chu Chua property.  A rock splitter was on site and the core was split and bagged into plastic sample bags. On every 10 th sample, a QA/QC sample (Standard, Blank, or Duplicate) was inserted into the stream of samples, a total of 12 QA/QC samples were added. Sample identifiers were written on the outside of each bag and part of the sample card with the sample number was placed  in  the  bag  with  the  rock  sample  number  written  on  it.  All  sample  bags  were closed using zip ties.   Upon completion of sampling the total of 122 (QA/QC) samples were  placed  in  poly-woven  bags  and  sent  to  ALS  in  North  Vancouver,  BC  for processing.  The authors have no reason to believe that the security of the samples was compromised.    Although  an  exhaustive  sampling  was  not  conducted,  the  samples collected  represent  select  mineralized  intervals  based  on  previous  historic  data.    All core samples collected on the property had their sample numbers recorded along with the  drill  hole  identification  depth  interval  (from-to)  in  metres.    Any  missing  sections within the sampled intervals were recorded and are noted within Appendix 1.

Samples at ALS are received, sorted and verified according to a Sample Submittal Form. The shipment is  assigned  an  ALS  reference  number,  after  which  a  worksheet with analyses requested is generated. Excessively wet samples are first dried in drying ovens and then crushed.  Large rock or core samples are typically coarse crushed using an oscillating jaw crusher to 70% passing a Tyler 9 mesh (2.0mm) screen. The sample is then split using a riffle splitter.  A sample split of up to 250g is then ring-mill pulverized to better than 85% of the sample passing a Tyler 200 mesh (75 microns) screen.  At the beginning of each shift and/or the start of a new group, samples are screened to ensure correct  particle  sizes.  Crushers,  rifflers  and  pans  are  cleaned  with  compressed  air between samples. Pulverizing pots and rings are brushed, hand cleaned and air blown.

A 30 gram nominal sample weight charge is then taken and the entire plus fraction is retained.  Sample decomposition is performed by fire assay fusion (FA-FUS) and the digested solution is analyzed by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) against matrix-matched standards.  Gold detection limits for FA by ICP-AES is 0.001 to 10 ppm.  The default overlimit method (Assay procedure AuAA25) for an ore grade anyalyte is by atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS) which has a detection limit of 0.05 to 100 ppm.

A prepared 0.25 gram minus fraction was sent for multi-acid ICP-AES and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) analysis.  The ICP analysis detects 48 elements  and  the  use  of  the  multi-acid  (HNO3-HCLO4-HF-HCL)  digestion  liberates

more elements than the Aqua Regia partial leaching process.  The four acid digestions are  able  to  dissolve  most  minerals;  however,  although  the  term  ' near-total '  is  used, depending  on  the  sample  matrix,  not  all  elements  are  quantitatively  extracted.    The elements are then detected by their characteristic wavelength specific light, which can then be measured by the ICP Spectrometer and the results are corrected for spectral interelement interferences.

The  assay  procedure  ME-OG62  is  the  default  overlimit  method  for  ore  grade analytes.  The evaluation of ores and high-grade materials are optimized for accuracy and  precision  at  high  concentrations  using  conventional  ICP-AES  analysis  which provides greater upper limits.  The samples are similarly decomposed by the same four acid digestion and the results from the Spectrometer are equally corrected for spectral interelement interferences.

## 12 Data Verification

## 12.1  Historic Core Sampling

The diamond drill re-sampling was done at 1 m intervals unless the length of the core was insufficient and the intervals had to be reduced.  The resampling was completed on cut core so most samples were quartered.  The 1 m interval data was then combined into 5 m data groups in order to be compared with historic data.  Duplicates were taken every 30 samples; standards and blanks were included every 30 samples as  well so that every 10th sample (10%) was a part of QA/QC.

Laboratory  pulp  standards  inserted  into  the  sample  stream  by  the  field  crew  were compared to the expected certified values and if the lab results fell significantly outside the  established  third  standard  deviation  confidence  levels,  the  internal  batch  or  the entire sample shipment was requested to be re-run. In addition, an analytical batch was considered a failure if two or more values from that same analytical batch fell outside the +/- 2 standard deviation (SD) lines.

The assay for Zn, Au and Ag were all within the two SD limits while one Cu and one Pb value fell outside the two standard deviation limits, triggering a provisional warning but not a failure (Appendix 1).  The assay for the blanks showed consistent results with &lt;0.01%  Cu,  &lt;0.01%  Zn,  &lt;0.001%  Pb,  &lt;1ppm  Ag,  and  &lt;0.01ppm  (Appendix  1). Additionally  the  assay  for  the  duplicate  samples  was  comparable  to  the  assay  of  the primary samples considering the heterogeneity of core samples.

All samples taken were processed at ALS in which additional QA/QC measures are undertaken.  As part of their in house quality QA/QC program, ALS inserts blank and standard samples in addition to repeat sample analysis.   Quality  control samples are inserted on each analytical run, based on the rack sizes associated with the method. Regular AAS, ICP-AES and ICP-MS methods use a rack size of 40 and are allocated 2

<!-- image -->

standards, 1 duplicate and 1 blank.  Regular fire assay methods use a rack size of 84 and are allocated 2 standards, 3 duplicates, and 1 blank.  The blank is inserted at the beginning, standards are inserted at random intervals, and duplicates are analyzed at the  end  of  the  batch.    ALS  in-house  standards  are  tested  by  internal  round  robin exchanges and by external proficiency tests.

## 12.2  Drill Hole Collar Surveying

## 12.2.1 Surveyed  DDH  in the field

A total of 60 drill hole collars were surveyed during the 2011 field program, of which 45 were exposed rods that were in place.  For the remainder of the holes surveyed, a point was taking from middle of the clearing or where the collars seem most likely to be based on orientation of the holes.  The data was post-processed and corrected after the field visit to obtain sub-meter accuracy of absolute locations of surveyed data.

Drill  collar  surveys  were  completed  in  RTK  survey  mode,  whereby  the  stationary base  receiver  broadcasts  a  correction  signal  to  the  mobile  receiver  via  UHF  radio connection providing horizontal accuracies of up to 10 cm and vertical accuracy of up to 20  cm.  The  locations  of  drill  hole  collars  surveyed  from  a  clearing  site  were  verified using historic plan maps and their relative position to the surveyed holes with exposed rod in-situ. The orientation and set-up of the drill were also considered in order minimize errors.

## 12.2.2  Digitized Drill Hole Collars

All the historic diamond drilling plans from the original assessment reports available were rectified  using  Google  Earth  imagery,  NTS 1:50k base map data, and the 2011 drill  hole collar survey. In the case of digitization with the 2011 drill hole collar survey only drill hole with sub-meter accuracy values were used to rectify the old drilling plans.

The locations of 32 drill hole collars, which could not be verified via surveying, were digitized  using  the  rectified  plan  maps,  and  the  previously  verified  drill  hole  collars locations.  The  newly  digitized  locations  honored  the  relativity  of  holes  within  historic plans  in  relations  to  the  2011  surveyed  drill  hole  collars,  while  falling  within  areas  of roads-trails, and clearings.

## 12.3  Digital Data

Basic digital data from the Chu Chua property was provided to APEX by Strongbow which  served  as  the  base  for  a  geographic  information  systems  (GIS)  project, specifically for an ArcGIS project built by APEX.  An access digital drill hole database was also provided. Apex proceeded to compile and digitize all available data pertaining to the Chu Chua deposit and relevant to the property.

Drill logs and assay data for 99 diamond drill holes, totaling 19,707 m, that targeted the  Chu  Chua  deposit  were  compiled  and  validated  against  available  paper  copies. Drilling completed from 1978 to 1982 by Craigmont included 55 holes.  The holes were documented only with hand written logs; holes CC-1 to -49 have been validated against paper  copies.  It  is  unclear,  but  unlikely,  that  any  collar  surveys  were  done  hence  an uncertainty exists about the exact location of the collars.  Only downhole acid dip tests

<!-- image -->

were carried out, with the data recorded on the logs. No downhole azimuth or specific gravity  (SG)  measurements  were  taken.    The  logs  show  that  most  of  the  sample intervals within the massive sulphide zones are on the order of 4 to 5 m in length for single  samples.  The  assays  are  hand  written  on  the  logs,  with  no  assay  certificates available.  No  QA/QC samples were analysed (i.e. no standards, duplicates or blanks were processed and analysed). The 1978 to 1982 drill core was stored in racks on site; it has been verified to be present and is in reasonable shape.

A total of 46 holes were drilled by Minnova between 1988 and 1991. The Minnova data is comprised of computer generated drill logs that contain information on the collar locations and downhole surveys. Most of the available drill logs indicate that the collars have not been properly surveyed after completion of the drill hole.  For two of the collars that have been surveyed a discrepancy exists between the plotting coordinate and an alternate coordinate and it is unclear which the final surveyed collar location is.  There is no downhole azimuth data for the 1988 and 1989 drill holes, which represent the bulk of the  Minnova  drilling  into  the  massive  sulphide  zones.    For  the  1990  and  1991  deep drilling single shot azimuth and dip data is recorded on the logs, however, it is unlikely the original  shots  are available.    It  should  be  noted  that  for  the  deep  holes  drilled  by Minnova, the end of hole northing coordinate versus the collar northing coordinate due to azimuth deviation of the easterly drilled holes ranges from a few meters up to more than 60 m (hole CC-71 drilled to a depth of 667.7 m core length).  It is highly likely that some of the deeper Craigmont BQ core holes drilled to depths of between 300 and 668 m core length in the period between 1978 and 1982 would have encountered significant downhole deviation for some of the holes, throwing into question the exact location of the deeper massive sulphide intercepts due to a lack of downhole survey information.

The 1988 to 1991 drill hole data includes a significant amount of SG data, however, there  is  no  indication  on  how  the  measurements  were  taken.    Sampling  of  the  core during  1988  to  1991  through  the  massive  sulphide  zones  was  done  with  more reasonable  intervals  with  samples  taken  at  1  to  1.5  m  sample  lengths.  The  samples were analysed by Min En Laboratories and assay data have been validated against the assay certificates for samples from drill holes CCF-31-34, 43-47 and partially for CCF49.  In a number of cases, high grade base and precious metal zones identified in the Minnova drilling lack adjacent wall rock sampling in order to characterize the grade of potential wall rock dilution.  Whole rock geochemical samples were also collected and processed  at  Min  En  Laboratories.  A  thorough  review  of  the  paper  and  digital  data indicates  that  there  is  no  obvious  QA/QC  data  for  the  assay,  geochemical  or  SG analyses (i.e. no evidence of any blanks, standards and duplicates). The 1988 to 1991 drill  core is reported to have been retained and stored by Minnova in a warehouse in Barierre, however, Strongbow indicates that the core has been disposed of (Gale, pers comm., 2009).

Overall,  it  can  be  said  that  the  hardcopy  data,  the  drill  hole  database  and  the contained data for the Chu Chua property are of a reasonable standard and relatively complete.

## 13 Mineral Processing and Metallurgical Testing

Minnova completed a fairly extensive program of metallurgical test work during 1989 to  1991  (Purkis,  1991).    The  reported  metal  recoveries  from  the  Chu  Chua  ore,  in particular for Cu, were less than desirable, however, the test work was conducted solely based  on  the  Afton  Mill  flow  sheet  and  then  was  looked  at  as  feedstock  for  the Samatosum  Mill.    The  ore  processing  flow  sheet  at  both  mills,  both  of  which  are currently not in operation, was less than optimum for processing Chu Chua ore.  Further metallurgical work was strongly recommended for the Chu Chua ore (Purkis, 1991).

## 14 Mineral Resource Estimates

## 14.1  Introduction

The mineral resource estimation of the Chu Chua mineralised zone was completed by Mr. Nicholls under the direct supervision of Mr. Dufresne and Mr. Raffle whom are all deemed as a 'Qualified Person' with respect to the style of mineralisation and mineral resource  estimation  as  defined  by  NI  43-101.    The  mineral  resource  modelling  and estimation was carried out using a 3-dimensional block model, using commercial mine planning software Micromine (version 12.05.03).

The Chu Chua mineralised zone block model utilised a parent block size of 25 m x 2 m x 10 m with sub blocking down to 2.5 m x 0.5 m x 1 m.  The resource modelling utilised  55  historic  core  holes  completed  between  1978  and  1990.    APEX  personnel have not overseen any of this historic drilling but site visit has been performed by Mr K. Raffle on June 26 th , 2012.  Mr Raffle has overseen the compilation of the historical drill hole data for the use in this resource estimation.

The mineral resource for the Chu Chua mineralised zone is reported in accordance with  the  Canadian  Securities  Administrators  National  Instrument  (NI)  43-101  and  has been estimated using the CIM 'Estimation of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves Best Practice Guidelines' dated November 23 rd , 2003 and CIM 'Definition Standards for Mineral Resources  and  Mineral  Reserves'  dated  November  27 th , 2010.  Mineral resources are not mineral reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability. There is no guarantee that all or any part of the mineral resource will be converted into a mineral reserve.

## 14.2  Data

## 14.2.1 Micromine Database

The  drilling  database  used  is  current  up  to  April  1,  2012.    This  incorporates  all available diamond drilling and analytical data.  All data provided for the mineral resource estimation was copied from excel spread sheets into Micromine format. The five main .xlsx files that were unitised were:

-  CC\_DH\_Collars\_2011.xlsx - Collar file
-  DH\_downhole surveys verified2010.xlsx - Survey file
-  DH\_Chu-Chua logs verified2010.xlsx - Geology file
-  DH\_Assays\_verified 2010.xlsx - Sample file

<!-- image -->

-  Chuchua\_DEM\_final.XYZ - DEM surface file

There were a total of 99 diamond drill holes within the provided export of which 50 were used in the resource estimation.  Spacing between drill lines is quite varied with drilling conducted not on set line spacing.  The drill line spacing varies from 10 m to 45 m, with an average of about 20 m between drill lines.  The sample file comprises 873 samples of  variable  length  but  when  composited  in  Micromine  yielded  a  database  of 251 sample composites for the Chu Chua mineralisation that were used for the mineral resource estimation.

Data  supplied  and  utilised  in Micromine  included  collar  easting,  northing  and elevation co-ordinates, lithology information, and Cu, Pb, Zn, Ag, and Au assay data, as well as bulk density data (specific gravity) data.  The collar co-ordinates were obtained by  a  combination  of  Differential  GPS  drill  hole  collar  pickups  and  the  use  of  historic collars provided from the drill logs.  The elevation of the drill holes that did not have their collar  picked  up  had  an  Reduced  Level  (RL)  assigned  using  the  provided  DEM topographic surface in Micromine.  The method of the down hole surveys for the Chu Chua mineralised zone varies from dip only acid etch surveys to single shot down hole surveys which provided a dip and an azimuth for the drill hole orientation.  The initial collar  setup  was  performed  using  a  compass  and  a  clinometer.   Where no  azimuth's were not able to be obtained from the down hole surveys then the collar azimuth setup was applied to the dip only down hole surveys.

## 14.2.2 Collar Coordinates

A total of  99 diamond drill holes are known to have been drilled on the Chu Chua properties of which fifty of these holes were used in the resource.   Due to the lack of historic documentation of the drill hole collar set out, it was decided to ground truth the collar positions and resurvey where possible.  This was conducted using a Trimble R8 GNSS GPS system that has a horizontal accuracy of 0.25m and vertical accuracy of 0.5m.    Out  of  a  total  of  50  diamond  drill  holes  that  have  been  used  in  the  resource estimation a total of 26 holes have had the drill hole collars picked up by locating the actual drill hole collar casing sticking out of the ground.  Of the remaining 24 holes there were an additional 4 holes where a 10m x 10m clearing was visible and picked up.  For the remaining drill holes that could not be verified on the ground, a variety of registration techniques were utilised to better constrain the reported historic drill hole co-ordinates. The original historic drill plans that were completed soon after the completion of drilling were  registered  using  the  26  re-surveyed  drill  holes  and  used  in  conjunction  with notable  cleared  drill pads  observed  on  Bing  Maps  aerial  photography.  From  a combination of these techniques new easting and northing co-ordinates were generated for the remaining 20 drill holes.  The elevation for these drill hole collars were generated by assigning a new RL using the surveyed topographic DTM surface in Micromine.

This  surface  DTM  was  created  by  walking  25m  spaced  line  traverses  with  points collected every 3m along the lines.  This was conducted using the Trimble R8 GNSS GPS system.  Due to some spikes in the data this data set was then smoothed out to provide a more realistic set of points that could be used for the surface DTM surface. The size of the surface DTM covered the entire resource area of which is 650m wide x 850m long in size.

## 14.2.3 Sampling/Assaying

Due  to the historic nature of the diamond  drilling and the lack of historic documentation there is limited information about the sampling and assaying methodology conducted for the Chu Chua diamond drilling.

## 14.2.4 Downhole Surveys

Craigmont drilled  55 BQ  and AQ diamond drill holes  between 1978 and 1982.The down hole surveys (acid  etch)  that  were  completed  on  this  drilling  only  recorded  the down hole dip of the drill  hole.    There  were  no  azimuth  surveys  able  to  be  collected using  the  acid  etch  technique.    An  assigned  azimuth  was  assigned  to  the  drill  hole based on the collar setup (usually 90°).  The maximum hole depth of these drill holes range from 37 to 688 m.  Due to the depth of the drill holes drill hole deviation in the azimuth is expected and as such raises concerns over the exact location of the massive sulphide/stringer mineralisation intersected in the drilling.

During  1988  and  1991  Minnova  completed  46  NQ  size  diamond  drill  holes.    The holes  that  were  drilled  between  1998  and  1989  had  down  hole  dip  measurements collected  every  30  to  40  m  using  an  acid  dip  test  but  failed  to  collect  any  azimuth readings.    These  holes  were  generally  shallow  with  the  maximum  depth  of  120  m. Although  these  holes  are  relatively  shallow  drill  hole  deviation  in  the  azimuth  is  still expected.    As  such  it  raises  into  question  the  exact  locations  of  the  deeper  massive sulphide/stringer intersections.

The 1990 to 1991 drilling that Minnova conducted were all deeper drill holes ranging from 100 to 813m in depth.  These drill holes had sporadic dip and azimuth surveys collected on average every 250m intervals down the hole.  There was dip only surveys collected at around 60 metre intervals.  All of these 1990 to 1991 drill hole surveys were collected using a single shot camera.

Based  on  the  above  mentioned  concerns  over  the  accuracy  of  the  down  hole positions of the drill holes drilled at the Chu Chua  mineralised zone, this has a direct implication on the classification of the resource.

## 14.3  Geological Modelling

## 14.3.1 Wireframing

Mineralized  lode  wireframes  were  constructed  and  used  to  constrain  the  resource block model (Figure 8).  The Chu Chua mineralisation  consists of copper, lead, zinc, silver,  and  gold.    A  correlation  table  of  the  five  elements  indicated  that  there  was  a strong correlation between copper and silver.  As copper and silver are the dominate metals  of  interest  it  was  decided  to  use  these  as  the  control  on  the  interpretation  of mineralisation.  A primary lower cut off of 0.5% copper and secondary 1 to 5 g/t silver cut off was used to constrain the outer edges of the lode interpretation.

The wireframes included some zones where there was no mineralisation, but as long as the down hole length was less than two metres this was included.  There are gaps in the samples  that  have  been  collected  over  the  mineralised  ore zones,  so  for

<!-- image -->

completeness dummy intervals were inserted in these gaps and assigned a 0.0% or 0.0 g/t grade.  This is discussed further under Drill hole Flagging and Compositing.

The interpretation was conducted on 25 m spaced east-west cross sections looking north with a window of 12.5 m towards and away.  The lodes were extrapolated 12.5 metres along strike or halfway to the next drill hole (whichever one was less), and up to around 30 m up/down dip depended on the mineralisation on neighbouring sections.

The current lode interpretation was conducted with the aim to wireframe mineralisation that had reasonable prospects of economic extraction.  The width of the ore zones tends to drop off around the 180m below surface. Widths range from up to over  40  m  to  less  than  one  metre.    Although  mineralisation  extends  down  to  560m below  surface  it was  decided  to  only wireframe  mineralisation with reasonable prospects of economic extraction.

All drilling data was used to conduct and guide the lode wireframe interpretation.

## 14.3.2 Assay Summary Statistics

There are five elements of interest that were defined by the Chu Chua Mineralisaed Zone resource.  These include Copper Cu, Pb, Zn, Au, and Ag.  A typical down hole copper profile is shown in Figure 9. Summary statistics and histograms were calculated for the Chu Chua mineralised zone (Table 4 and Figures 10 through 15).

The precious metal Lead (Pb) was reviewed and excluded from the resource work below, because only it is in such low concentrations (with the exception of CC-28) at and near it's detection limit, therefore it is not included in the  final resource estimate. For this reason the grades displayed in CC-28 raise concerns over the Pb analysis of this particular drill hole.  It is recommended that this drill hole be re-analysed for Pb.  Of the  total  597  samples  within  the  Chu  Chua  mineralised  domain  only  80%  of  these samples  assayed  for  Pb.  The  statistics  for  Lead  are  presented  in Table  4  for comparative purposes; however, they are not included in the resource estimate or any other tabulation below.

Correlations  between  the  various  metal  grades  were  calculated  for  the  Chu  Chua mineralised  zone.    There  is  a  strong  correlation  between  copper  and  silver  and  also between gold and silver (Table 5 and Appendix 4). A moderate correlation between gold and  copper  exists  and  to  a  lesser  degree  between  silver  and  zinc.    There  is  a  poor correlation with lead in respect to the other metals.

Table 4. Correlation Between Assay Values Within the Chu Chua Mineralised Zone

|----|-------|-------|------|-------|-------|
| Cu |  1    | -0.02 | 0.25 |  0.74 |  0.48 |

| Au |  0.48 | -0.02 | 0.32 |  0.69 |  1    |

## 14.3.3 Drill hole Flagging &amp; Compositing

Drill  hole  samples  that  were  situated  within  the  Chu  Chua  mineralised  wireframes were selected and flagged with the wireframe name/code.

The  flagged  samples  were  checked  visually  next  to  the  drill  hole  to  check  the automatic flagging process worked correctly.  All samples were correctly flagged and there was no need to manually flag or remove any samples.

A review of the sample lengths was conducted for all Chu Chua samples that were constrained within the mineralised zone.  The review showed that the Chu Chua sample lengths vary form 0.2 m to 11.4 m in length (Table 6 and Figure 15).  Looking at the samples, there were four main populations, one being 0.5 m to 1.0 m in length, 1.0 m to 1.5 m in length, 1.5 m to 2.0 m in length and finally 4.5 m to 5 m in length.  Essentially 99% of the sample data is less than 5 m in length.  It was decided that 5 m should be used for a composited sample length.

Table 5. Sample Length Statistics for the Chu Chua Domain

|           |   Un Composited Width |
|-----------|-----------------------|
| Number    |               597     |
| Minimum   |                 0.2   |
| Maximum   |                11.4   |
| Mean      |                 1.754 |
| Median    |                 1.5   |
| Std Dev   |                 1.22  |
| Variance  |                 1.49  |
| Std Error |                 0.002 |
| Coeff Var |                 0.696 |

It should be noted that there exists gaps in the samples that have been collected to date.  It is unknown if these gaps were in fact core loss or visually not mineralised and

deemed not required for sampling.  Either case missing sampled should be inserted.  A part  of  the  compositing  process  was  to  insert  these  missing  intervals  in  the  existing sampling.  These samples were given a 0.0 % or 0.0 g/t grade for copper, lead, zinc, silver and gold.  There were a total of 8 samples/gaps inserted into the sample file prior to compositing.

Length  Weighted  composites  were  calculated  for  Cu,  Pb,  Zn,  Ag  and  Au.    The compositing process starts from the first point of intersection between the drill hole and the  Chu  Chua  mineralised  wireframe,  and  is  halted  upon  the  end  of  the  mineralised wireframe.

Upon  completion  of  the  5  m  compositing  it  was  decided  to  examine  the  sample population which is less than 5m in width.  The average of the remaining samples less than 5 m in length was 1.973% Cu compared to the 5 m composite length samples of 1.981%  Cu.    The  inclusion  of  the  sub  5  m  composite  lengths  dropped  the  global average  copper  grade  by  0.002%.    It  was  decided  to  include  all  samples  in  the estimation as this was deemed to be within tolerances. This produced 251 composited with an average grade of 1.979% Cu.

The  compositing  process  did  not  add  any  undue  bias  to  the  data  (Table  7).  The composited samples were used for all sample statistics, capping, estimation input file and validation comparisons.

## 14.3.4 Top Cut / Capping

The composited sample data within the Chu Chua lode wireframes were used for top cut/capping  analysis.  All  elements  within  the  Chu  Chua  mineralised  domain  were examined  individually  to  determine  suitable  capping  to  apply  to  the  respective  grade populations.  A combination of histograms and probability plots were used to determine the extreme values to be cut (Appendix 6).  During the estimation the extreme values were capped to the values provided in (Table 8).

## 14.3.5 Grade Continuity

The variography utilized  the  composite data  within  the  mineralised  Chu  Chua  lode wireframes  to  produce  spherical  semi  variograms.    Each  element  was  modelled individually to determine  the  continuity  and  orientation  of  mineralisation.    Some difficulties were encountered with the semi variograms for some of the elements due to limited number of samples.  Table 9 provides the search criteria and the limits used in the estimation process.  The individual variograms are provided in Appendix 7.

## 14.4  Block Modelling

## 14.4.1 Block Model Extent &amp; Size

As a result of the varied historic drill spacing a parent block model size of 25 m x 2 m x 10 m was chosen for the Chu Chua resource estimation.  This block selection honours the approximate drill hole spacing.  The block model extents were extended far enough past the mineralised wireframe to encompass the entire mineralised domain. Table 10 presents  the  coordinates  ranges  and  block  size  dimensions  used  to  build  3D  block model from the mineralisation wireframes.  Sub blocking was used to more effectively honour  the  volumes  and  shapes  created  during  the  geological  interpretation  of  the mineralised lodes. The blocks were oriented in a north-south orientation parallel to the strike of the mineralisation. There were a total number of 19,426 blocks.

Table 9. Block Model Extents and Cell Dimensions for the Chu Chua Domain

| Deposit   | Block Model Dimensions   |   Easting |     Northing |   RL (m) |
|-----------|--------------------------|-----------|--------------|----------|
| Chu Chua  | Maximum                  |  704600   |  5.6965e+06  |     1860 |
| Chu Chua  | Minimum                  |  704400   |  5.69586e+06 |     1180 |
| Chu Chua  | Parent Cell Size         |       2   | 25           |       10 |
| Chu Chua  | Sub Blocking Cell Size   |       0.5 |  2.5         |        1 |

discrepancies between the two.  The block volume was only 0.01% different from the wireframe volume.  Refer to Table 11 for a comparison.

## 14.4.2 Bulk Density

A total  of  522  bulk  density  measurements  were  collected  from  drill  core  within  the Chu Chua area.  The samples were tagged with the lode name and separated for use in the  estimation  process.    A  total  of  465  samples  were  collected  from  within  the mineralised  horizon  at  Chu  Chua.    The  bulk  densities  for  each  lode  were  examined using  normal  histograms  to  determine  if  there  were  any  outliers  present.    Only  one outlier was identified (CCF-31 - 6.49t/m ) and subsequently was removed from the bulk 3 density dataset.  This produced an average bulk density (specific gravity) of 4.366 t/m . 3 A breakdown of the bulk density by lode is presented in Table 12.

The bulk density samples were collected by Minnova Inc. between 1998 and 1991. Due to the lack  of  historic  documentation  the  methodology  adopted  to  calculated  the bulk densities is unknown, but is of the authors opinion that these measurements seem realistic based on the geology encountered in the drill logs.

Table 11. Bulk Density Values by Lode

| Lode   |   No. Samples |   Average  Density |
|--------|---------------|--------------------|
| All    |           464 |              4.362 |
| Lode01 |           107 |              4.372 |
| Lode02 |           331 |              4.329 |
| Lode03 |            26 |              4.732 |

## 14.4.3 Mining and Geological Surfaces

The  Chu  Chua  mineralisation  is  overlain  with  between  1  and  17  m  of  transported overburden.  A DTM surface of the base of the overburden was created using the down hole geology logs from the diamond drilling.  This was intern used to cut the top of the mineralised lode wireframes as the overburden.  The block model was then constrained to the modified Chu Chua lode wireframes.

There is no open pit or underground workings to Boolean out of the block model.

## 14.5  Grade Estimation

## 14.5.1 Ordinary Kriging

The  Chu  Chua  mineral  resource  estimation  was  calculated  using  Ordinary  Kriging (OK) grade estimation technique for each metal element.  No trends were applied to the OK  grade  estimation.    The  kriging  parameters  were  based  on  the  variography conducted on the individual grade elements within the Chu Chua mineralised domain. Estimation was only calculated on parent blocks.  All sub blocks within the parent block were assigned the parent block grade.  A block discretisation of 2 (X) x 5 (Y) x 3 (Z) was applied to  all  blocks  during  kriging.    The  Chu  Chua  lode  wireframes  were  treated  as hard boundaries, which meant that only samples within the lode were used to estimate the grade of the blocks within that particular lode.

There were four passes of estimation conducted.  The size of the elliptical  search ellipsoid  was  based  on  the  suggested  ranges  obtained  from  the  variography.    The estimation criteria for each pass are provided in Table 12.

Table 12. Search Ellipsoid Criteria for the Chu Chua Grade Estimation

|   Run  Number |   Minimum  No. of  Samples |   Minimum  No. of  Holes |   Factor  x  Radius | % Blocks  Estimated   |
|---------------|----------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------|
|             1 |                         12 |                        3 |                   1 | 0%                    |
|             2 |                          8 |                        2 |                   2 | 46%                   |
|             3 |                          4 |                        1 |                   3 | 52%                   |

## 14.5.2 Search Parameters

The estimation of the Chu Chua mineralised zone was constrained within an-isotropic ellipsoids.    The  ellipsoid  orientation  was  aligned  to  the  strike  and  the  dip  of  the  lode being  estimated.    Each  grade  element  was  looked  at  individually  and  the  search ellipsoid  plunge  was  tailored  to  the  observations from  the  variographic analysis.    The search ellipsoid orientation is shown in Table 13. These search orientations honour the geological interpretation of the Chu Chua mineralisation.

Table 13. Search Ellipsoids Used in the Chu Chua Estimation Process

outlier was identified (CCF-31 - 6.49t/m ) and subsequently was removed from the bulk 3 density dataset.  This produced an average bulk density (specific gravity) of 4.366 t/m . 3 A breakdown of the bulk density by lode is presented in Table 14.

The bulk density samples were collected by Minnova Inc. between 1998 and 1991. Due to the lack  of  historic  documentation  the  methodology  adopted  to  calculated  the bulk densities is unknown, but is of the authors opinion that these measurements seem realistic based on the geology encountered in the drill logs.

## 14.6  Model Validation

## 14.6.1 Visual Validation

The blocks were visually validated on cross section comparing block grades versus the  sample grades for all sections and drill  holes.    In  addition,  the  block  and  sample data  were  compared  for  each  grade  element,  by  lode,  northing  and  RL.    These comparisons are present in Table 15, Figures 16, 17 and 18, and in Appendix 8.

Table 15. Global Average of Capped and Composited Sample Grades vs. Calculated Model Grades

| Grade Element   |   Sample    (average) | OK Block Model (calculated grade)   |
|-----------------|-----------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Cu %            |                  1.92 | 1.90                                |
| Zn %            |                  0.3  | 0.32                                |
|                 |                  9.12 | Ag g/t  8.96                        |
| Au g/t          |                  0.47 | 0.47                                |

## 14.6.1 Statistical Validation

Figure 14 and Table 15 show the average grade of the composited capped sample data versus the block model data.  It can be concluded that the average grade of the OK block model data is very close to or generally slightly lower than the composited and capped sample data.  This is the expected result for well-behaved data and if the block model  estimation  process  is  being  done  correctly.    The  model  data  tends  to  have  a reduced  dispersion  of  the  block  grades  resulting  from  the  grade  estimation  process. The  OK  block  modelling  and  estimation  process  tends  to  lower  the  high  end  grades compared to the sample data and increase the low end grades compared to the sample data.  This is expected with the overall smoothing of the estimation process.

## 14.6.1 Lode Comparison

The input composited sample average that was broken down by lode was compared to  the  reported  OK  block  model  grade  for  each  metal  of  interest  for  the  Chu  Chua Mineralised Zone (Appendix 8).  Overall the copper, zinc, silver and gold comparisons compare very well.  There is some slight local over and under estimation but on a whole the  differences  in  grade  displayed  in  the  comparisons  are  deemed  to  be  within acceptable tolerances. These in combination with the global comparisons indicate that there are no concerns over the calculation of the Chu Chua estimation process.   Refer to Appendix 8.

## 14.6.2 Northing Comparison

The  input  sample  and  block  model  averages  were  calculated  on  25  m  composite sections down the northing for the Chu Chua Mineralized Zone (Appendix 8). Due to the near vertical nature of the deposit this is parallel to the strike of the mineralization. The purpose is to compare the input sample file with the resulting block model data to make sure  there  is  no  gross  over  or  under  estimation  occurring.  The  northing  composites generally compare quite well. There is some local over and under estimation observed but this is to be expected with the estimation process. Overall the block averages follow the  general  trend  of  the  input  sample  data.  Graphs  of  the  individual  grade  element comparisons are provided in Appendix 8.

## 14.6.3 RL Comparison

The sample and block model averages were calculated on 10 m composite  slices through the RL for the Chu Chua Mineralized Zone (Appendix 8). Due to the vertical nature of the deposit this is parallel to the dip of the mineralization. The purpose is to compare the input sample file with the resulting block model data to make sure there is

no  gross  over  or  under  estimation  occurring.  The  RL  composites  generally  compare quite  well.  There  is  some  local  over  and  under  estimation  observed  but  this  is  to  be expected  with  the  estimation  process.  Overall  the  block  average  grades  follow  the general  trend  of  the  input  sample  data.  Graphs  of  the  individual  grade  element comparisons are provided in Appendix 8.

## 14.7  Classification

The mineral resources were classified in accordance with guidelines established by the CIM  'Estimation  of  Mineral  Resources  and  Mineral  Reserves  Best  Practice Guidelines'  dated  November  23 rd , 2003  and  CIM  'Definition  Standards  for  Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves' dated November 27th, 2010.  The Chu Chua mineral resource is classified as inferred:

An 'Inferred Mineral Resource' is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity and grade or quality can be estimated on the basis of geological evidence and limited sampling  and  reasonably  assumed,  but  not  verified,  geological  and  grade  continuity. The estimate is based on limited information and sampling gathered through appropriate  techniques  from  locations  such  as  outcrops,  trenches,  pits,  workings  and drill holes.

Mineral resources are not mineral reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability. There is no guarantee that all or any part of the inferred mineral resource will be converted into a mineral reserve.

This is the mineral resource estimate completed for the Chu Chua mineralised zone. This  mineral  resource  estimate  has  been  classified  as  inferred  according  to  the  CIM definition standards.  This classification is based on a number of factors which are noted below:

-  Historical  nature  of  the  drilling  and  no  recent  confirmation  drilling  has  been carried out.
-  Limited  down  hole  surveys  that  have  been  performed  and  the  uncertainty associated with down hole intersection locations.
-  Lack of documentation on QAQC and assaying/sampling procedures.
-  In ability to re-survey the collar locations of lack of collar location survey control.
-  Good continuity of mineralisation from section to section along 630m of strike.
-  Good geological control of mineralisation along strike and up and down dip.

## 15 Adjacent Properties

The  section  titled  'Adjacent  Properties'  is  based  on  a  review  of  available  public company  documents  including  press  releases, annual reports, and  NI 43-101 technical  reports  as  listed  in  the  'References'  section.  However,  all  sources  of information referred to in this section were prepared by Qualified Person's as defined by  NI  43-101  and  are  assumed  accurate  based  on  based  on  the  data  review conducted by the author. All diamond drill intercepts reported are core length and may not be indicative of true width of mineralization.

## 15.1  Windpass and Sweethome

Windpass  and  Sweethome  Properties  are  gold  properties  consisting  of  seven contiguous  mineral  leases  totaling  389  hectares.  The  properties,  owned  100%  by Nevada Clean Magnesium Inc., and lie 7 km north-northwest of Chu Chua Property.

The Windpass mine is located between Dunn Lake and Baldy Mountain. Sweethome Showing located 1 km to the north of Windpass Mine. Mineralization in both Windpass and  Sweethome  is  in  gold-bearing  quartz  veins,  which  cut  the  Devonian  to  Permian Fennell  Formation  of  the  Slide  Mountain  Group.  Both  the Windpass  and  Sweethome veins dip at variable angles to the north and cut the western margin of a steeply westdipping  diorite  sill  and  an  adjacent  bedded  chert  horizon  within  the  lower  Fennell Formation, directly east of the upper Fennell contact.

The Windpass workings to 1939 include 457 m of drift and cross-cut in the main (200 level) adit. Two inclined shafts, the Pioneer and Telluride, were sunk from surface to the adit level. An internal shaft (Davis Winze, on an incline averaging 25 degrees) was sunk to the 900 level and drifting carried out east and west on each level. The Sweethome vein was developed by a 36 m inclined shaft (30 degrees) that connects with a 106 m crosscut adit, and 137 m of drift in the footwall of the vein. The production of Windpass and  Sweethome  ore  totalled  93,435  tonnes,  yielding  1,072  kilograms  of  gold,  53 kilograms of silver and 78,906 kilograms of copper.

In  1972,  Dalion  Res  Ltd  performed  trenching  and  152  m  of  drilling.  Surveying  and sampling of the Windpass and Sweethome dumps indicated 32,655 tonnes at 6.99 g/t Au  and  16,146  tonnes  at  0.68  g/t  Au.  In  1987,  Kerr  Addison  Mines  Ltd  carried  out geological  mapping,  magnetometer  surveys,  trenching  and  2,010  m  of  NQ  diamond drilling in 11 holes. Highlights from 1987 diamond drilling include 1 m interval of 16.3 g/t Au (Kikauka, 2004).

The most recent exploration was done by Moly Gold Corp. in 2003 and 2004. Rock chip sampling of trenches on the Windpass shear vein system in 2003 revealed values of  21.78  g/t  Au  over  0.25  (Pioneer  South  Trench)  and  1.45  g/t  over  2.0  m  (Telluride Shaft Area). Rock chips samples from a quartz vein in the Weather Station Zone, about 300 m north of the main Windpass zone, returned values of 36.94 g/t Au across 4.0 m in the area of a silicified and carbonitizd breccia zone (Kikauka, 2004). In 2004, Moly Gold Corp. drilled 2 diamond drill holes totaling 152 m on the Weather Station Zone. The two drill  holes  cut  Cu-Au  bearing  mineralization  hosted  in  quartz-sulphide  veins  and/or magnetite veins on the Weather Station Zone. Several anomalous gold value intervals were intersected, but the drilling failed to produce economical values. The highest grade intersected was 2.25 g/t Au over 0.3 m (Kikauka, 2005).

## 15.2  Rea and Somatosum Deposits

The Rea volcanogenic sulphide deposit is located 35 km to the southeast of the Chu Chua  Property and  was  first discovered in 1983. Subsequent  exploration by Corporation  Falconbridge  Copper  (later  Minova  Inc.,  now  Inmet  Mining  Inc.  'Inmet') resulted  in  the  discovery  of  the  Samatosum  massive  sulphide  deposit  in  1986;  a distance of 500 m to the northeast.

The Rea deposit comprises two northwest trending massive sulphide lenses, named the  RG8  and  L100  lenses,  which  contain  fine  to  medium  grained,  banded  to  breccia texture  pyrite,  sphalerite,  galena,  arsenopyrite,  chalcopyrite  and  tetrahedrite  massive sulphide mineralization.  The RG8 lens occurs over a surface strike length of 75 m and a down-dip extent of 80 m; the L100 lens has a surface strike length of 50 m and downdip extent of 120 m (Bailey, eta al., 2000).  The Samatosum deposit comprises a tabular 5 m thick, shallowly northeast dipping orebody having a northwesterly strike length of 500 m and down-dip extend of 100 to 150 m (B.C. Minfile 082M 244).

The Rea and Somatosum deposits occur within Devonian to Mississippian rocks of the Eagle Bay Assemblage near the stratigraphic top of a unit of mafic metavolcanics, flows and volcaniclastics; overlain by phyllite and quartz-sericite schist metasediments (unit EBF of Schiarizza and Preto, 1987).  The deposits are hosted within two zones of

sericite-quartz-carbonate-pyrite altered metasediments termed the Rea and Samatosum Horizons.  Structurally, the deposits appear to lie on the west limb of an overturned,  southwest-verging  anticline.    Recent  mapping  by  Bailey  et  al.  (2000) suggests both deposits occur within the same stratigraphic sequence that has been repeated by faulting.

The Samatosum deposit was mined by Inmet between 1989 and 1992 and produced 14 million ounces silver, 21 thousand ounces gold, 8 million pounds copper, 11 million pounds  lead  and  21  million  pounds  zinc  from  612,000  tons  (555,000  tonnes)  of  ore milled  (B.C.  Minfile  082M  244).    Before  commencement  of  production,  Pirie  (1989) reported a Samatosum mineral resource of 634,984 tonnes grading 1,035 g/t Ag, 1.9 g/t Au, 1.2% Cu, 1.7% Pb and 3.6% Zn.  The Rea deposit was never put into production, however historic mineral reserves of 376,000 tonnes grading 69 g/t Ag, 6.1 g/t Au, 0.3% Cu, 2.2% Pb and 2.3% Zn have been reported (Northern Miner, 1987; Table 21).

*The resources are considered historic in nature and do not meet the criteria for a NI 43-101 compliant resource of any category as defined in 'CIM Definition Standards on Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves' dated November 27th, 2010, and as such should not be relied upon.

## 15.3  Harper Creek Deposit

Yellowhead  Mining  Inc's  (Yellowhead)  Harper  Creek  polymetallic  volcanogenic sulphide deposit is located 23 km to the northeast of the Chu Chua Property.  Noranda Exploration  Company  originally  discovered  the  deposit  in  1966,  and  subsequent exploration  through  1974  defined  a  historic,  non  43-101  compliant  resource  of  77.6 million  tonnes  (Mt)  grading  0.39%  Cu  (Rennie  and  Scott,  2010,  Table  22).    Between 1967 and 1996, Noranda and its joint venture partners completed diamond drilling of 176 holes totalling 21,292 m.

The  Harper  Creek  Deposit  occurs  within  rocks  of  the  Devonian  to  Mississippian Eagle  Bay  Assemblage  (unit  EBA  of  Schiarizza  and  Preto,  1987).    The  deposit  is hosted  within  a  moderately  north  dipping,  thrust-imbricated,  sequence  of  volcanic derived  felsic  to  intermediate  sericite-chlorite-quartz-feldspar  phyllite,  and  silicified sandstone-siltstone rocks. Mineralization comprises foliation and stratigraphy conformable lenses of disseminated, fracture-filling and banded pyrite-pyrrhotite and chalcopyrite mineralization and accessory magnetite.

Yellowhead acquired the Harper Creek Property  in 2005 and completed re-logging and sampling of historic drill core, and a 7 hole program of confirmatory diamond drilling totalling 2,324 m.  In November 2007 Yellowhead released the first NI 43-101 compliant

resource estimate for the Harper Creek deposit.  The estimate comprised an indicated resource of 451 million tonnes grading 0.32% Cu, and an inferred resource of 142 Mt grading 0.33% Cu at a copper block cut off grade of 0.2% (Rennie and Scott, 2007).

Through the end of 2008 Yellowhead completed diamond drilling of 75 holes totalling 27,584 m.  During 2009, re-sampling of historic drilling core was completed to permit incorporation of precious metal values into the resource model database.  On March 8, 2011, Yellowhead released the results of preliminary economic assessment (PEA) and an updated resource estimate.  The resource estimate, at a 0.2% Cu cut-off comprised measured  resources  of  90.0  Mt  grading  0.30%  Cu,  0.033  g/t  Au  and  1.18  g/t  Ag; indicated resources of 442.1 Mt grading 0.31% Cu, 0.032 g/t Au and 1.06 g/t Ag for a total measured and indicated resource of 532.1 Mt grading 0.31% Cu, 0.032 g/t Au and 1.08 g/t Ag (Narcisco et al, 2011).

*The resources are considered historic in nature and do not meet the criteria for a NI 43-101 compliant resource of any category as defined in 'CIM Definition Standards on Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves' dated November 27th, 2010, and as such should not be relied upon.

During 2010 and 2011 Yellowhead completed an additional 44 diamond drill holes totalling  14,330  m  (119  diamond  drill  holes  totalling  41,914  m  were  completed  by Yellowhead between 2006 and 2011).  On February 16, 2012 Yellowhead released and updated resources estimate; and announced completion of a feasibility study (FS) on March 2, 2012.  The current resource estimate (effective December 20, 2011) for the Harper Creek deposit, at a 0.2% Cu cut-off, comprises measured resources of 348.5 Mt grading 0.31% Cu, 0.034 g/t Au, 1.3g/t Ag; indicated resources of 466.5 Mt at 0.28% Cu, 0.03g/t Au, 1.3g/t Ag for a total measured and indicated resource of 815 Mt grading 0.29% Cu, 0.032 g/t Au and 1.3 g/t Ag. A further 80.2 Mt grading 0.30% Cu, 0.033g/t

Au, and 1.4g/t Ag were classified in the inferred resource category.  The FS included a mineable  reserve  estimate  for  the  Harper  Creek  Deposit.    The  mineable  reserve estimate;  based  upon  certain  economic  parameters,  geotechnical  design  criteria  and metallurgical  recovery  assumptions;  comprises  proven  reserves  of  401.2  Mt  grading 0.27% Cu, 0.031 g/t Au and 1.15 g/t Ag; probable reserves of 303.3 Mt grading 0.25% Cu, 0.027 g/t Au and 1.13 g/t Ag for total proven and probable reserves of 704.4 Mt grading 0.26% Cu, 0.029 g/t Au and 1.14 g/t Ag (Collins et al, 2012).

## 15.4  CM

Six  and  a  half  km  southwest  of  the  Property  is  the  CM  Cyprus-type  massive sulphide prospect, located on the north slopes of Chinook Mountain and currently held by  JC  Resources.  Similar  to  Chu  Chua,  the  CM  is  hosted  in  the  mafic  volcanicdominated Upper Fennell Assemblage with mineralization comprising variably massive  pyrite,  chalcopyrite  and  sphalerite  with  an  associated  quartz-pyrite  stringer zone and hydrothermal alteration of the volcanic pile (B.C.  Minfile 092P  101).  From 1987 to 1994, a total of 34 holes were drilled throughout the area. The most significant intersection occurred in drill hole 87-2 from the Gold zone, which is characterized by vuggy quartz-carbonate fracture-filling which is anomalous in gold and may represent a  late  stage  epithermal  event.  Mineralization  consists  of  semi-massive  pyrite  and chalcopyrite in silica-rich sediment. The intersection grades 4.8 % Cu, 0.2 % Zn, 14.1 g/t Ag and 0.12 g/t Au over 2.9 m. Subsequent drilling in the area was unsuccessful at expanding this intersection. Sulphides at the Lower showing consist of semi-massive to disseminated pyrite with lesser chalcopyrite and sphalerite in a chert/argillite unit. In 1994, a grab sample across 2 m of massive sulphides at the Lower showing analysed 8.6% Cu, 0.39% Zn, 4.23 g/t Au, and 30 g/t Ag (Casselman, 1993).

## 17 Interpretation and Conclusions

The Chu Chua property, located 24 km northeast of Barriere, B.C., is host to the Chu Chua deposit,  a  Cyprus-type  volcanogenic  massive  sulphide  body  first  discovered  in 1978.  The property is largely underlain by the Mississippian to Permian aged Fennell Formation which comprises basaltic and rhyolitic  volcanic  rocks, clastic  and  chemical sedimentary rocks and diabase sills. The Chu Chua deposit consists of two major and several  minor  sulphide  lenses  hosted  by  massive  and  pillowed  green  basalt  of  the Upper Fennell Formation.  The lenses are oriented along a north-south trend dipping from vertical to very steeply west.  The principal axes of the lenses appear to plunge gently to the south.

A total of 99 diamond drill holes, totaling 19,707 m were completed to delineate the Chu Chua deposit between 1978 and 1991. Craigmont drilled a total of 10,820 m in 55 core holes between 1978 and 1982. The drilling defined two areas of relatively thick, high grade sulphide mineralization occurring within 100 m of the surface. Deep drilling during 1989 to 1991 by Minnova seems to indicate that the main deposit may plunge to

the south as suggested by the 2008 airborne magnetic data.  For the most part little in the way of massive sulphide has been intersected deer than 200 m below the surface. However, other than a series of about 10 deep drill holes with targeted depths of about 500 to 600 m below surface, there is little drilling that has targeted the area between the deep drilling and the known bottom of the sulphide zones.  At the south end of the main Chu Chua deposit, deep drilling by Craigmont and by Minnova did encounter a couple of narrow intersections of massive sulphide and/or wider stockwork breccia zones with disseminated sulphide in drill holes CC-54, CC-57 and CCF-62.

The  2011  Chu  Chua  Property  exploration  program  included  DGPS  surveying  of historic  DDH  collars,  select  re-sampling  of  historic  diamond  drill  core  stored  at  the Property, and the creation of a DGPS DEM over the Chu Chua deposit. A total of 60 DDH were re-located and surveyed, a total of 110 core samples were taken from the historic core, and an area of 55 ha was surveyed to produce a DEM over the Chu Chua deposit. A comparison of historic and current composite grades indicate that there is a significant  difference  between  historically  reported  values  and  the  2011  re-sampling values with respect to copper and zinc.  Length weighted average difference composite grades returned from current re-sampling indicate a decrease of 0.90% copper and a decrease of 0.13% zinc in total composition comparison to historically reported results. No  significant  difference  was  noted  for  gold  and  silver  values  between  historically reported results and the 2011 samples. Historic drill core was sampled at approximately 5 m intervals and locally smaller intervals where discreet zones of mineralization were encountered.  During 2011, drill core was sampled at 1 m intervals in an effort to better assess the within-intercept variability of Chu Chua deposit sulphide mineralization. The use of smaller sample intervals reveals that most of the mineralization within the historic intervals is relatively homogeneous.

A  modern  NI  43-101  compliant  resource  estimation  of  the  Chu  Chua  mineralised zone was completed by Mr. Nicholls under the direct supervision of Mr. Dufresne and Mr.  Raffle  whom  are  all  deemed  as  a  'Qualified  Person'  with  respect  to  the  style  of mineralisation and mineral resource estimation as defined by NI 43-101. The estimate comprises an inferred mineral resource of 2.5 million tonnes averaging 2.0 % copper, 0.3% zinc, 9.4 g/t silver, 0.5 g/t gold at a copper block cut-off grade of 1.0% (Table 20).

The  mineral resource modelling and  estimation was  carried out using a 3dimensional block model, using commercial mine planning software Micromine (version 12.05.03).  Out of the 99 diamond drill holes, a total of 50 were used in the resource estimation.  Spacing between drill lines is quite varied with drilling conducted not on set line spacing.  The drill line spacing varies from 10 m to 45 m, with an average of about 20  m  between  drill  lines.  A  total  of  251  composites  of  5  m  length,  capped  at  5.90% copper,  0.86%  zinc,  32  g/t  silver  and  1.4  g/t  gold,  were  used  for  the  estimation.  The mineral resource was  estimated by ordinary kriging within a three-dimensional mineralization  envelope,  defined  by  similar  geological  characteristics  in  terms  of alteration  and  mineralogy,  using  a  0.5%  copper  cut-off  grade.  The  search  ellipsoid orientations were based on variography and ranged in size from 30 to 50 m along the primary axis, depending on the metal of interest. The search ellipsoids were used for grade interpolation into 2 m (X) x 25 m (Y) x 10 m (Z) parent blocks. All blocks were

classified as being in the inferred category. A total of 464 bulk density measurements were used to calculate the average for each of three modeled massive sulphide lenses. The average density of each of the three lenses varied from 4.33 to 4.73 g/cm . Due to 3 the lack of historic documentation, the methodology used to calculate the bulk densities is  unknown,  however  the  densities  used  in  the  resource  estimate  are  considered consistent with the geology and style of mineralization of the Chu Chua deposit.

The Chu Chua project is considered to be an early stage project, therefore little is known  about  the  potential  mining  or  metallurgical  characteristics  of  the  massive sulphide deposit. The base case cut-off threshold of 1.0% Cu, which yields 2,506,000 tonnes  at  an  average  grade  of  2.0%  Cu,  0.3%  Zn,  9.4  g/t  Ag  and  0.5  g/t  Au,  is considered to be prospective for development based on the projects favourable location for access, power, water, labour force and other assumptions derived from deposits of similar type and scale.

To date, mineralization has been modeled over a 480 m strike length and to a depth of  180  m  from  surface.  Additional  drilling  is  warranted  to  define  the  extent  of  near surface mineralization at the north end of the deposit; at depth within and beneath the currently  modeled  Main  Lens;  and  to  the  south  where  limited  deep  drilling  has encountered narrow sulphide intercepts. Given that approximately 75% of the deposit as  currently  modeled  lies  within  a  100  m  depth  from  surface,  further  drilling  and economic  studies  to  determine  if  all  or  portion  of  the  Chu  Chua  deposit  may  be amenable to open pit extraction are also warranted.

## 18 Recommendations

Based on the data compilation, re-interpretation of geology, and the 2012 resource calculations two stages of drilling is warranted.

The first stage should consist of a confirmatory drill program to test the main zone and north  zone  in  order  to  aid  in  the  validation  of  the  historic  drilling  and  to  convert some  of  the  resource  into  an  indicated  category  as  well  as  provide  samples  for metallurgical  work.  Six  holes,  totalling  810  m,  are  recommended for  the first  stage of drilling. The first stage is estimated at $ 202,500 not including GST (Table 23).

Further  drilling of south  end  of  the  main  zone  and  below  the  main  zone  is recommended  in  order  to  test  the  lateral  and  depth  extent  of known  sulphide mineralization. Seven holes, totalling 2,160 m, are recommended for the second stage of drilling. The exact number of holes and the total depth would depend on the results of the first stage of drilling. Any new deeper drilling should include downhole electromagnetic surveys measuring conductivity, which can directly assist in extending the current known extent of the Chu Chua massive sulphide lenses and in targeting new separate zones.  In addition, systematic downhole multi trace element and whole rock geochemical work should be conducted on any new core in order to identify and better map  out  the  existing  volcanic  stratigraphy  associated  with  the  Chu  Chua  massive sulphide lenses. The second stage is estimated at $ 648,000  not  including  GST  (Table 23).
