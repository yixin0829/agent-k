## 1.0 SUMMARY

## 1.1 Executive Summary

SLR Consulting (Canada) Ltd. (SLR) was retained by Search Minerals Inc. (Search Minerals) to prepare an independent Technical Report on the Deep Fox and Foxtrot Rare Earth Element (REE) Project (the Project or  the  Property),  located  near  St.  Lewis,  Newfoundland  and  Labrador,  Canada.    The  purpose  of  this Technical Report is to disclose the results of a Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA) on the Project based on a new mineral processing method and updated Mineral Resource estimates for both the Deep Fox deposit (Deep Fox) and the Foxtrot deposit (Foxtrot).  This Technical Report conforms to National Instrument 43-101 (NI 43-101) Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects.  SLR visited the Property and field office on August 26, 2015, and November 9 to 12, 2021.

Search Minerals is a public company that trades on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) Venture Exchange under the symbol SMY, and on the OTCQB Venture Market under the symbol SHCMF.  Search Minerals, through its wholly-owned subsidiary Alterra Resources Inc. (Alterra), owns Deep Fox and nearby Foxtrot, as well as a number of mineral prospects on its 100% owned Critical REE District spanning approximately 64 km.  Search Minerals holds REE properties in the Red Wine Complex of Central Labrador and the Henley Harbour properties, located in southeast Labrador.

This Technical Report is considered by SLR to meet the requirements of a PEA as defined in Canadian NI 43-101 regulations.  The PEA production scenario for the Project consists of initial mining at Deep Fox followed  by  Foxtrot,  using  both  open  pit  and  underground  mining  methods,  at  a  production  rate  of 2,000 tonnes per day (tpd) or 720,000 tonnes per annum (tpa).  Mineralized material from Deep Fox and Foxtrot will be fed to a magnetic separation plant (Primary Production Plant), which is to be built adjacent to Deep Fox, where mineralized material will be concentrated from approximately 0.87% total rare earth oxides (TREO) plus Yttrium (Y) to produce a rare earth mineral concentrate (approximately 26% mass pull) grading between 4% TREO+Y to 6% TREO+Y with 90% TREO+Y recovery.

The rare earth mineral concentrate will then be shipped from an upgraded port facility in Labrador to a hydrometallurgical processing plant (Hydrometallurgical Processing Plant) to be constructed on the island of Newfoundland for processing into a refined rare earth carbonate for further down stream processing (i.e., separation by others).  The Hydrometallurgical Processing Plant utilizes a direct extraction process developed  by  Search  Minerals.    Search  Minerals  is  investigating  the  potential  to  undertake  further refinement of products using its own separation facility.

Both  the  Primary  Production  Plant  and  the  Hydrometallurgical  Processing  Plant,  with  all  supporting infrastructure,  were  designed  and  engineered  by  NewPro  Consulting  &amp;  Engineering  Services  Pty  Ltd. (NewPro).  Engineering designs and discussion is reported in NewPro's report 'Search Minerals Inc., Fox Harbour Rare Earths Project, Processing Plant Scoping Study Update' identified as Revision C and Issued on January 25, 2022 (the NewPro Report).

It is estimated  that  the  average  annual  production  of  refined  rare  earth  carbonate  will  contain 1,437 tonnes (t)  of  the  primary  rare  earth  oxides  (REO)  of  Neodymium  (Nd),  Praseodymium  (Pr), Dysprosium (Dy), and Terbium (Tb) which account for approximately 92% of the Project's revenue.  REO price forecasts were provided by Adamas Intelligence (AI), an independent research and advisory service focused on strategic metals and minerals.  SLR notes that forecasts from AI were provided in October 2021 and subsequently updated in February 2022.  There was a significant increase in REO prices, especially for

Nd and Pr (approximately 90%) as a result of a long term supply shortage.  This supply shortage is directly related to the increased demand for critical metals to supply the green economy.

The economic analysis contained in this PEA is based, in part, on Inferred Resources, and is preliminary in nature.  Inferred Resources are considered too geologically speculative to have mining and economic considerations applied to them and to be categorized as Mineral Reserves.  There is no certainty that the reserves development, production, and economic forecasts on which this PEA is based will be realized.

All currency in this Technical Report is Canadian dollars (C$) unless otherwise noted.

## 1.1.1 Conclusions

Robust economic results indicate that the Project has good potential to become a long-life producer of critical REEs, providing an independent Canadian source of materials which are key to the green economy. Further conclusions by area are as follows:

## 1.1.1.1 Geology and Mineral Resources

- · Significant REE deposits have been delineated at Deep Fox and Foxtrot by the Search Minerals exploration  team.    Deep  Fox  is  located  approximately  two  kilometres  northeast  of  St.  Lewis, Labrador.  Foxtrot is located approximately 10 km west of St. Lewis, Labrador.  Both deposits are located in the Fox Harbour Volcanic Belt (FHVB), which also hosts other REE prospects and targets owned by Search Minerals.
- · Deep Fox mineralization is steeply dipping (approximately 80°) at an azimuth of 275°, with a strike length of approximately one kilometre.  The majority of Deep Fox high grade mineralization occurs within steeply dipping packages of pantellerite.  Two mineralized wireframes were modelled, a higher  grade  and  more  extensive  footwall  zone,  and  a  thinner  hanging  wall  zone.    Deep  Fox remains open at depth with potential to extend Mineral Resources to the east and west.
- · Foxtrot mineralization consists of three steeply dipping mineralized zones, a thicker, predominantly pantellerite core, and a hanging wall and footwall zone consisting of pantellerite and low zirconium (Zr)-pantellerite bands.  Foxtrot mineralization is steeply dipping (70° to 80°), with a strike length of approximately 765 m at an azimuth of 285°.  Foxtrot remains open at depth and there is potential to extend Mineral Resources west and east of the current footprint.
- · For both Deep Fox and Foxtrot, Search Minerals collected core and channel samples, assayed samples  with  a  quality  assurance  and  quality  control  (QA/QC)  program,  conducted  surface exploration, and produced drill hole databases.  SLR verified the content of the assay databases, reviewed the QA/QC programs and logging and sampling procedures, and performed location spot checks.  The assay database, logging and sampling procedures, and QA/QC programs are acceptable for Mineral Resource estimation.
- · SLR  estimated  Mineral  Resources  for  the  Project  using  all  drill  hole  and  channel  sample  data available as of December 31, 2021.  Mineralization wireframes were modelled at Deep Fox and Foxtrot, using a nominal cut-off of $260/t Net Value.  Open pit resource shells were generated for both deposits to constrain open pit Mineral Resources.  Material with Net Value of $335/t and higher was used to report underground Mineral Resources remaining below the resource shells assuming an underground scenario.  The underground Mineral Resources were reported at a block cut-off and validated using underground reporting shapes to ensure Reasonable Prospects of Eventual Economic Extraction (RPEEE).

- · Deep Fox Mineral Resources include 5.1 million tonnes (Mt) classified as Indicated at average grades  of  394 ppm Pr,  1,469  ppm  Nd,  202  ppm  Dy,  and  34  ppm  Tb,  and  3.3  Mt  classified  as Inferred at average grades of 366 ppm Pr, 1,381 ppm Nd, 198 ppm Dy, and 33 ppm Tb.
- · Foxtrot  Mineral  Resources  include  10.0  Mt  classified  as  Indicated  at  average  grades  of 366 ppm Pr, 1,368 ppm Nd, 176 ppm Dy, and 30 ppm Tb, and 3.0 Mt classified as Inferred at average grades of 371 ppm Pr, 1,384 ppm Nd, and 177 ppm Dy, and 30 ppm Tb.

## 1.1.1.2 Mining and Mineral Reserves

- · Mining on the Property will be carried out using open pit and underground methods at a rate of 2,000 tpd starting at Deep Fox and followed by Foxtrot.  Deep Fox will be mined over an 11 year period (seven years open pit and four years underground) and Foxtrot will be mined over a 16 year period (seven years open pit and nine years underground) for a total mine life of 26 years (the Foxtrot open pit and Deep Fox underground will both be mined in Year 11).
- · A total of 18.137 Mt of mineralized material will be mined at grades of 1,416 ppm Nd, 379 ppm Pr,  188 ppm Dy,  and  32  ppm  Tb  with  an  estimated  average  value  of  $756/t  (net  of  process recoveries and payability terms).
- · The PEA mineable quantities are based on 86% Indicated Mineral Resources and 14% Inferred Mineral Resources.
- · The Deep Fox and Foxtrot open pits are planned to be mined using conventional truck and shovel operations using a contractor.
- · The Deep Fox and Foxtrot underground mines are planned to be trackless mechanized operations accessed from the open pits by a single main ramp each and will be owner operated.  Deep Fox and Foxtrot are generally steeply dipping with average widths of 15 m.  The deposit configurations are suitable for mining using longhole mining methods with transverse and longitudinal accesses.
- · The  Deep  Fox  and  Foxtrot  underground  mines  will  be  a  continuation  of  the  open  pit  mining operations and will be mined at a production rate of 2,000 tpd.
- · Mineral Reserves have not yet been estimated for the Project.

## 1.1.1.3 Mineral Processing

- · SLR has reviewed the metallurgical test work reports and summaries provided by Search Minerals. The test work has been performed by SGS Canada Inc. (SGS), which is a highly experienced and competent laboratory.  The interpretation of the test work appears to be reasonable.
- · Although additional test work is required, the qualified person (QP) is of the opinion that the available test work is sufficient to define the design of recovery methods at a PEA level.
- · The  proposed  Primary  Production  Plant  includes  a  simple  comminution  circuit  which,  given adequate test work on a range of samples and competent design based on such test work, should be easily implemented.  Similarly, the proposed magnetic separation circuits are standard in other industries and should operate as projected provided that test work confirms the preliminary test results forming the basis for the present design.
- · The  proposed  hydrometallurgical  process  starts  with  an  acid  bake  process.    This  is  a  widely practised method of decomposing REE minerals and is presently used to produce most of the world's REEs.  The proposed Hydrometallurgical Processing Plant would dissolve the REE from the acid bake product in water and remove impurities through hydrolysis using a standard process.

The balance of the process includes REE precipitation and releach followed by multiple stages of purification ahead of REE carbonate precipitation.  As noted by NewPro, additional test work is required to confirm process details.  SLR is of the opinion that the process might be simplified.

- · Although additional test work, including pilot plant operations, are required, SLR is of the opinion that the design and resulting equipment requirements and reagent demand are adequate for a PEA level of study.

## 1.1.1.4 Environment

- · Search  Minerals  has  a  Code  of  Business  Conduct  policy,  Integrated  Policy  on  Health,  Safety, Environment  and  Community  Relations,  Insider  Trading  Policy,  Whistleblower  Policy,  and Disclosure Policy.  Additional policies are under development.
- · Search  Minerals  has  corporate  environmental  and  social  policies,  although  these  are  being expanded and further developed.
- · Baseline studies have been initiated based on preliminary Project information.
- · The Project will require provincial approvals and permits.  The revised project scope as currently configured does not trigger a federal Impact Assessment under the Impact Assessment Act (IAA).
- · Search Minerals conducts community engagement in relation to exploration activities and plans to conduct further engagement activities in 2022.  It has initiated some social initiatives such as offering limited scholarships to people in the local community.
- · Search Minerals signed an agreement with the NunatuKavut Community Council (NCC) on August 27, 2012, to address exploration activities and this remains valid.
- · Deep  Fox  lies  within  the  St.  Lewis  protected  water  supply  catchment  area.    Search  Minerals continues to work directly with the St. Lewis Town Council to ensure that residents are informed of activities and that concerns are addressed in a timely manner.  This is a key risk to manage as the Project progresses.  Surface water studies are required to understand any potential quality and quantity impacts on the water resource.    Surface water studies were initiated in 2020, have been  ongoing  since  then  and  will  continue  throughout  the  exploration  and  development activities.
- · A Rehabilitation and Closure Plan (RCP) and financial assurance for rehabilitation and closure costs will be required to obtain environmental approvals.

## 1.1.2 Recommendations

Advanced engineering studies (Pre-Feasibility, Feasibility) on the Project are merited, through further data collection, testing, and analysis.

SLR offers the following specific recommendations by area:

## 1.1.2.1 Geology and Mineral Resources

- 1. Expand the master drilling database content to include all QA/QC data.
- 2. Review and update the QA/QA protocols to address potential improvements regarding usage of coarse blank samples, type and number of certified reference materials (CRMs), nominal values of internal standards, and batch failing criteria and re-assay procedures.
- 3. Collect wider channel samples to generate field sample duplicates.

- 4. Conduct infill drilling on portions of Deep Fox and Foxtrot to a spacing of 15 m to 30 m.  This is expected  to  suffice  for  Measured  Resources  (although  this  is  subject  to  confirmation  via variography).  SLR understands that Search is currently undertaking a 11,000m infill exploration program.
- 5. Continue exploration for the expansion of Deep Fox and Foxtrot, with mineralization down-plunge and lateral extent targeted drilling.
- 6. Continue exploration of high grade REE prospects in the area.

## 1.1.2.2 Mining and Mineral Reserves

- 1. Develop  a  better  understanding  of  the  geotechnical  conditions  in  order  to  optimize  stope dimensions and potentially reduce the amount of development.  SLR understands that Search Minerals is currently undertaking a 3,000 m geotechnical drilling program.
- 2. Continue drilling campaigns focusing on areas where Inferred Mineral Resources can be upgraded to the Indicated category.
- 3. Complete a study which assesses the required cemented rock fill (CRF) strength to confirm the stability of the exposed stope walls.
- o Additionally, assess the optimum backfill granulometry and cement content.  This will provide information on cement content required and can provide opportunity for reduced operating costs.
- 4. Investigate using tailings in paste fill applications for backfill in primary transverse stopes.

## 1.1.2.3 Mineral Processing

- 1. Consistent with Search Minerals' plans, continue additional laboratory test work to confirm, or improve upon, present recovery and reagent consumption values and to examine the response of the beneficiation and hydrometallurgical processes to mineral variability.
- o Future test work must also include pilot-scale operations, the determination of engineering parameters  such  as  liquid-solid-separation  requirements,  and  the  characterization  of effluents and residues to allow the design of suitable handling, storage, and disposal facilities.
- o Waste solids and solutions from the beneficiation and hydrometallurgical processing plants need to be tested to allow for the design of suitable handling systems and ensure compliance with all applicable regulations.

## 1.1.2.4 Infrastructure

- 1. Complete  a  detailed  environmental  assessment  and  detailed  engineering  for  the  tailings  site adjacent to the Primary Production Plant, identified by SLR, to confirm its viability.  Identify and complete investigations for a tailings site for the Hydrometallurgical Processing Plant.
- 2. Continue investigating port locations.  SLR understands that the Port of Fox Harbour has a limited draft of approximately nine metres which could allow for up to 15,000 deadweight tonnage (dwt) vessels.  Fox Harbour will also have a limited shipping season and consideration for scheduling allowance will need to be accounted for.

- 3. Investigate the viability of the route proposed by SLR has, which utilizes an access road connecting Highway 513 to Deep Fox in order to avoid traffic in St. Lewis.  These investigations should include environmental and engineering assessments.

## 1.1.2.5 Environment

- 1. Develop the corporate environmental and social policies and publish these on Search Minerals website.
- o Develop plans to implement and audit the requirements of these policies
- 2. Plan, progress, and expand on ongoing environmental and social baseline studies to ensure that all  Project  infrastructure  and  activities  are  covered.    Ensure  that  all  environmental  and  social aspects are fully addressed to provide a comprehensive baseline record for the Project, and to meet regulatory requirements for provincial and federal applications for approval and permitting.
- o These studies should include other receptor pathways that could affect human health e.g., soil, water, vegetation, animals, toxicity testing on target species, geochemical studies, and technological options to limit potential environmental and social risks.
- 3. Develop and implement a plan to obtain all the required federal and provincial approvals and permits  and  ensure  that  these  are  in  place  in  advance  of  construction.    This  plan  should  be developed in consultation with the regulators, fully integrate with environmental study planning and engineering studies, and identify any risks to the approval processes and mitigation measures, if applicable.
- 4. Implement the community engagement plan and ensure that all stakeholders are included.  The engagement plan should detail the process for engaging Indigenous communities interested in the Project.
- 5. Continue to honour the Mining Exploration Activities Agreement with the NCC which was signed on  August  27,  2012.    Determine  the  need  for  additional  community  agreements  through engagement processes.
- 6. Continue to implement social initiatives and expand on these as appropriate and as needs are identified through stakeholder and Indigenous community engagement.
- 7. Continue surface water studies to understand any potential quality and quantity impacts on the St. Lewis protected water supply catchment area, and develop management and mitigation plans. Continue stakeholder engagement on this issue.
- 8. Conduct additional test work on the beneficiation and hydrometallurgical residues and effluents. As part of regulatory approval processes, compile an RCP in accordance with legal requirements and applicable guidelines, considering best practice where possible and ensuring that the financial assurance is in place as required by law.

## 1.2 Economic Analysis

An economic analysis was performed using the assumptions presented in this Technical Report.  The QP notes  that,  the  economic  analysis  contained  in  this  Technical  Report  is  based,  in  part,  on  Inferred Resources, and is preliminary in nature.  Inferred Resources are considered too geologically speculative to  have  the  economic  considerations  applied  to  them  that  would  enable  them  to  be  categorized  as Mineral  Reserves.    Unlike  Mineral  Reserves,  Mineral  Resources  do  not  have  demonstrated  economic viability.  There is no certainty that economic forecasts on which this PEA is based will be realized.  Table 1-2 presents the after-tax cash flow summary for the Project.

## 1.2.2 Cash Flow Analysis

Considering the Project on a stand-alone basis, the undiscounted pre-tax cash flow totals $6,716 million over the mine life, and simple payback occurs 1.5 years from start of production.

## 1.2.3 Sensitivity Analysis

Project  risks  can  be  identified  in  both  economic  and  non-economic  terms.    Key  economic  risks  were examined by running cash flow sensitivities:

- · TREE Head Grade
- · Net Value ($/t) (reflects REE price variations)
- · Recovery
- · Exchange Rate
- · Operating Cost
- · Capital Cost

Pre-tax IRR sensitivity over the base case has been calculated for a range of variations for each of the key parameters.  The sensitivities are presented in Figure 1-1 and Table 1-3.

The sensitivities for REO prices range from 0.6 to 1.3 to capture the volatility in the REE market.  This lower end of the range (0.6) was selected to overlap the October 2021 price forecasts by AI and the upper range (1.3) is to capture future upside.

The sensitivities for operating and capital costs range from 0.8 to 1.5.  The higher sensitivity of 1.5 reflects the risk of sustained increased costs relating to supply chain issues.

All other sensitivities were carried out in the typical +/- 20% ranges.

## 1.3 Technical Summary

## 1.3.1 Property Description and Location

Deep  Fox  and  Foxtrot  are  located  in  southeast  Labrador,  Canada.    Deep  Fox  is  approximately  two kilometres  northeast  of  St.  Lewis,  Labrador,  and  approximately  47  km  east-southeast  of  Port  Hope Simpson, Labrador.  Foxtrot is located approximately 10 km west of St. Lewis, Labrador, and approximately 36 km east-southeast of Port Hope Simpson, Labrador.

## 1.3.2 Land Tenure

Deep Fox and Foxtrot are located on licences 023108M and 022088M, respectively.  License 023108M contains 63 mineral claims covering an area of 1,575 ha, and licence 022088M contains 245 mineral claims covering an area of 6,125 ha.

Both licences are registered to Alterra, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Search Minerals.  No surface rights for construction or quarrying are known to exist on the Foxtrot property.  One quarry permit was issued for  License  023108M  (Deep  Fox)  in  2021  -  this  permit  is  for  an  existing  quarry  approximately two kilometres south of the proposed open pit site.  All licences are currently held in good standing.

## 1.3.3 History

Complete  aeromagnetic  coverage  and  lake-sediment  geochemical  surveys  were  conducted  over  the region by the Geological Survey of Canada (GSC) in 1974 and 1984.  Geological mapping at 1:100,000 scale was carried out from 1984 to 1987 by the Newfoundland and Labrador Geological Survey, as part of a five year  Federal-Provincial  joint  project  aimed  at  mapping  an  80  km  coastal  fringe  of  the  Grenville Province in southern Labrador.  A detailed lake sediment survey was released by the Newfoundland and Labrador government in 2010 and covered the area of the claims.

In June 1996, Devonian Resources Inc. (Devonian) conducted work on a historic licence presently covered by mineral licence 022088M.  Work included ground follow-up of the GSC lake sediment survey that indicated anomalous copper, nickel, and cobalt values.  Devonian concluded that no further exploration was recommended.

From May to August 1996 Greenshield Resources Inc. conducted work on a historic licence presently covered  by  parts  of  mineral  licences  022088M  and  023108M.    The  program  consisted  of  geological mapping, prospecting, lithogeochemical sampling, and diamond drilling.  Exploration focused on assessing the potential for economic magmatic copper-nickel mineralized areas, however, no significant economic mineralization was observed.

The Foxtrot property was staked in 2009 and became part of the option agreement with B&amp;A Minerals Inc. in 2009; the Foxtrot deposit was discovered in 2010.  The Deep Fox property was part of an option agreement with the Quinlan's in 2011; the Deep Fox deposit was discovered in 2014.

In 2014, a master's thesis was completed to determine the geology, mineralogy, age, and origin of the rare earth minerals at the Foxtrot property.

Search Minerals entered into an option agreement to acquire the Deep Fox (formerly Deepwater Fox) property in 2011.  The Deep Fox deposit was discovered in 2014 and the acquisition completed in 2015.

## 1.3.4 Geology and Mineralization

Deep Fox and Foxtrot occur in the 64 km long FHVB, which ranges in width from less than 50 m in the northwest to three kilometres in the east.  Units dip steeply in a northerly direction and generally strike westerly to northwesterly, parallel to bounding faults to the north and south.  The FHVB contains one peralkaline belt in the northwest and three peralkaline belts in the east, these belts of bimodal rocks dominated by REE-bearing felsic peralkaline flows and ash-flow tuffs and mafic to ultramafic volcanic and related subvolcanic units.

The three bimodal belts in the FHVB, from north to south: the Road Belt (RB), the Magnetite Belt (MTB) and South Belt (SB), have been the focus of REE exploration.

Deep Fox is hosted in the RB.  In the Project area, the RB consists of, from north to south: 1) northern comendite,  2)  anorthositic  suite  rocks  consisting  of  anorthositic  gabbro  and  anorthosite,  3)  nonperalkaline  rhyolite,  4)  southern  comendite,  5)  mafic  and  ultramafic  volcanic  rocks,  6)  mineralized pantellerite with interbedded non-peralkaline rhyolite and mafic volcanic rocks, and 7) a footwall nonperalkaline rhyolitic ash-flow tuff.  Minor units of locally derived volcanogenic sediments, mafic volcanic flows, and related subvolcanic units and pegmatites occur throughout this sequence.  Mineralized units are  commonly  interbedded  with  mafic  to  ultramafic  volcanic  units,  quartzite,  and  locally  derived volcanogenic sediments.  Most units generally dip 75° to 85° northerly and drill data indicates that the mineralized zone plunges towards the northeast.  The anorthositic suite and mineralized units form a prominent east-west trending ridge in the area.  At Deep Fox the pantellerite mineralization is up to 42 m in thickness and typically averages 15m to30 m in thickness.

Foxtrot is  hosted  in  the  MTB.    In  the  Project  area,  the  MTB  consists  of  pantellerite,  comendite,  nonperalkaline rhyolite, and mafic to ultramafic volcanic and related subvolcanic units.  Mineralized units commonly range from five  metres  to  20  m  in  thickness.    Mineralization  is  up  to  100  m  in  thickness (comendites plus pantellerites) at Foxtrot, medium to high grade mineralization (pantellerite) is up to 25 m in thickness and typically averages 10 m to 14 m in thickness

## 1.3.5 Exploration Status

Search  Minerals  has  conducted  extensive  exploration  campaigns  in  the  FHVB,  over  a  strike  length  of greater than 60 km, and identified more than 20 targets along with Deep Fox and Foxtrot.  Exploration to date consists of prospecting, mapping, lithogeochemical grab sampling, clearing, hand trenching, bulk sampling, channel sampling, and diamond drilling.  At Deep Fox, a total of 100 drill holes and channels were completed and sampled, with a combined length of 12,920.7 m.  A total of 119 diamond drill holes and channels with a total length of 19,399 m were completed at Foxtrot.

## 1.3.6 Mineral Resources

The  Mineral  Resource  estimate  for  the  Project  is  summarized  in  Table  1-4.    SLR  estimated  Mineral Resources using drill hole and channel sample data available as of December 31, 2021.  The Mineral Resources  are  reported  based  on  a  potential  open  pit  and  underground  mining  scenario  as  of December 31,  2021,  at  Net  Value  cut-off  values  of  $260/t  for  open  pit  resources  and  $335/t  for underground resources.  No Mineral Reserves have been estimated for the Project.

The  Mineral  Resources  were  constrained  by  mineralized  wireframes  that  took  into  consideration geological and Net Value continuity.  A nominal Net Value of $260/t was used as cut-off for wireframing. Samples were composited to two metre length.  Evaluation of raw assay grades prior to compositing

indicated that capping of high grade values was not necessary.  Composites were used to estimate block grades within discrete mineralized wireframes.  Ordinary kriging (OK) methodology was used for block grade estimation at Deep Fox, while inverse distance cubed (ID ) was used for Foxtrot. 3

Net Value was derived from the estimated operating costs for open pit and underground mining methods. Grades for all assays were combined with estimated metallurgical recoveries and prices to estimate the Net Value.

To convert volume to tonnes, simplified lithological models were created and bulk density factors were assigned for each lithology by determining the mean value of each rock type or interpreted lithological unit from bulk density testing carried out on the drill core and channel samples by Search Minerals.

Classification  into  the  Indicated  and  Inferred  categories  was  guided  by  drill  hole  and  surface  channel spacing, the reliability of data, and geological confidence in the continuity of grade.

Notes::

- 1. Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (CIM) Definition Standards for Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves (CIM (2014) definitions) were followed for Mineral Resources.
- 2. Open Pit Mineral Resources were reported inside a resource shell at pit discard Net Value cut-off value of $260/t. Underground Mineral Resources were constrained with mineralization wireframes below the resource shell and validated using underground mining solids based on a Net Value cut-off value of $335/t.  Both cut-off values account for all processing, G&amp;A, refining, and transportation charges.  Mining costs were assumed at $6.50/t ore mined and $5.00/t waste mined for open pit and $75.00/t for underground
- 3. Net Value was assigned to blocks using metal prices, metallurgical recoveries, payables (as shown in their respective sections of this Technical Report) for each individual element.
- 4. A minimum mining width of two metres was used for both open pit and underground.
- 5. Bulk density varies from 2.71 t/m 3 to 2.92 t/m 3 .
- 6. Revenue attributable to Pr, Nd, Dy, and Tb represents 92% of the total revenue.
- 7. The estimate is of Mineral Resources only and because these do not constitute Mineral Reserves, they do not have demonstrated economic viability.
- 8. Totals may not add or multiply accurately due to rounding.

The QPs are not aware of any environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, socio-economic, marketing, political, or other relevant factors that could materially affect the Mineral Resource estimate.

## 1.3.7 Mining Method

Mining  is  proposed  to  be  carried  out  at  Deep  Fox  and  Foxtrot  using  a  combination  of  open  pit  and underground methods.  Mining will first take place at Deep Fox using open pit and underground methods over  a  period  of  approximately  11  years.    Open  pit  operations  at  Foxtrot  will  commence  in  the  last two years of the Deep Fox underground operation.  Once mining is completed at Deep Fox, mining will transition completely to Foxtrot to extend the mine life an additional 15 years for an overall mine life of approximately 26 years.

The open pit mining production rate is assumed to be 720,000 tpa, or 2,000 tpd, of REE bearing material. For the purposes of this Technical Report, it is assumed that mining would be carried out year-round, however, given the relatively low production rate, there is the possibility of carrying out mining over a condensed period (six months) to avoid harsher conditions during the winter season.

Run of mine (ROM) mineralized material will be placed in a stockpile adjacent to the Primary Production Plant located near Deep Fox.  ROM material will be fed to the concentrator using a front-end loader (FEL).

Open pit mining will be carried out by a contractor year-round using conventional truck and shovel open pit methods consisting of the following activities:

- · Drilling performed by conventional production drills
- · Blasting using ammonium nitrate fuel oil (ANFO) and a down-hole delay initiation system
- · Loading and hauling operations performed with hydraulic shovel, FEL, and rigid frame haulage trucks

The production equipment will be supported by bulldozers, graders, and water trucks.  Search Minerals will supervise the overall mining operation with its own employees including mining engineers, geologists, surveyors, and support staff.

Underground mining operations have been envisaged for mineralization not captured by open pit mining for  both  Deep  Fox  and  Foxtrot.    The  production  rate  for  the  underground  mines  is  assumed  to  be 720,000 tpa, or 2,000 tpd, of REE bearing material and will operate year-round.  The underground mine will be owner operated.  Underground capital (consisting of mobile equipment and mine development) will be spent during open pit operations, allowing funding via operating profit.  Considering the geometry, continuity, and average width of the mineralized zones, both deposits are amenable to longhole mining methods.  Sublevel stoping using transverse accesses will be used for areas where stope widths exceed 10 m while narrower stopes will be accessed using a longitudinal access.

Transverse longhole stopes will be mined using primary and secondary stopes and mining will progress from the lowest level of each mining panel and progress in a bottom-up fashion.  Each mining panel consists of three to four stoping levels.  Primary stopes will be mined first, starting from the bottom level and progressing vertically to  the top.    Once  a  vertical  column  of  primary  stopes  has  been  mined  the secondary stopes on either side will be mined.  Transverse longhole mining allows for greater flexibility with the number of stopes that can be mined at any given time.

Longitudinal longhole stopes will be mined using a drive on each sublevel driven along the strike of the orebody.  Mining will progress in a bottom-up sequence where stopes on the first level of each mining panel will be mined first before progressing to the next level.

A crown pillar of 25 m in height will be left under the bottom of the pit, which can be recovered by drilling upward from the first level of mining at the end of the LOM.  CRF and unconsolidated rock fill (URF) will be used to satisfy backfill requirements at Deep Fox and Foxtrot

Underground  mining  will  consist  of  development  and  production  drilling,  ground  support,  blasting, loading, hauling, and backfilling activities.  The stationary equipment required for mining will include main and secondary ventilation fans combined with a propane heating system, air compressors, and a mine dewatering infrastructure (pumping stations, sumps, and pumps).

## 1.3.8 Mineral Processing

The majority of mineral processing and metallurgical testing on mineralized material from the St. Lewis area deposits has been conducted at SGS's Lakefield facility.

Magnetic separation of a rare earth mineral concentrate from various deposits was studied at SGS and reported in Search Minerals news releases on January 12, 2021, and April 12, 2021.  The first deposit to be tested was Silver Fox.  A channel sample was selected with 4.26% ZrO2, 0.08% HfO2 and 1.02% TREO. The sample was treated by low-intensity magnetic separation (LIMS) to recover an iron oxide rich material followed by wet high-intensity magnetic separation (WHIMS) up to 15,000 Gauss to recover a rare earth concentrate.  The WHIMS nonmagnetic fraction was then tested for zircon flotation.

The combined grade of the WHIMS concentrate was re-analyzed and reported at 8.42% TREO+Y.  The results demonstrated that the mass of the rare earth containing concentrate was only approximately 10% and the recovery of indicative elements (Ce, Nd for the LREE, and Y for HREE) was between 70% and 88%. This was a superior result compared with the earlier work (2012) and hence further work was performed on Foxtrot, Deep Fox, and the Fox Meadow deposits.  These results were reported on April 12, 2021.

A batch test program was conducted to optimize the acid baking and water leaching process.  An acid baking temperature of 190 ° C was selected with an acid addition of 145 kg/t H2SO4 for four hours.  The particle size, water leach temperature, and % solids were studied.  The extraction values for test 2 were 89% Pr, 90% Nd, 78% Tb, and 77% Dy.

Mineralized material from Deep Fox and Foxtrot will be processed through a beneficiation system using physical means followed by hydrometallurgical processing to form a marketable precipitate of mixed REE carbonate.  The beneficiation operation will take place in a plant constructed near the deposits in Labrador - the Primary Production Plant.  Mineral concentrates will be shipped to a brownfield site on the island of Newfoundland located close to a source of reagents and power for hydrometallurgical processing.  The Hydrometallurgical Processing Plant is planned to be constructed on an existing brownfield site on the island of Newfoundland.  The exact location of the Hydrometallurgical Processing Plant has not yet been selected.

## 1.3.9 Project Infrastructure

As of 2021, the nearby communities of Port Hope Simpson, St. Lewis, and Mary's Harbour, which have populations of approximately 403, 181, and 312, respectively, have various services including grocery stores, fuel stores, hotels, heavy equipment rentals, and labour resources.  All three communities have port  access  as  well  as  airstrips  that  can  facilitate  transportation  of  goods  required  for  exploration programs.  St. Lewis has deep water dock facilities and a small gravel airstrip suitable for small aircraft. Core storage, company lodging, and office space is located within the town of St. Lewis, in the Search Minerals owned and renovated Loran C building, formally occupied by the Canadian Coast Guard.

There  is  no  electricity  currently  available  on  the  Project  site.    The  closest  source  is  diesel  generated electricity  in  the  town  of  St.  Lewis,  located  10  km  and  two  kilometres  from  Deep  Fox  and  Foxtrot, respectively.

Water sources are plentiful over the Property.

SLR  has  envisaged  access  roads  being  constructed  to  connect  the  513  with  the  Deep  Fox  property (bypassing the town of St. Lewis) as well as a section of road that would connect the Deep Fox property with the Port of Fox Harbour.

New infrastructure proposed in the PEA includes facilities at both the Project site in Labrador and the Hydrometallurgical Processing Plant in Newfoundland:

- · Labrador Mine Site and Primary Production Plant
- o Water services including raw water intake, potable water, fire water, and sewage treatment
- o Power supply via diesel generation, with secondary heat recovery
- o Fuel storage
- o Buildings including the Primary Production Plant, site laboratory, office complex, maintenance shops, warehousing, and accommodation camp
- o Port facility
- o Access roads
- o Dry-stack filtered tailings storage
- · Island of NL Hydrometallurgical Process Plant
- o Water services including raw water intake, process water, demineralized water plant, potable water, fire water, sewage treatment
- o Power supply via waste heat from the acid plant, plus grid connection
- o Steam plant
- o Fuel storage
- o Buildings including process plant, reagent storage, site laboratory, services building, offices, maintenance shops, warehousing, and concentrate storage
- o Port facility
- o Dry-stack residue storage pad

## 1.3.10 Market Studies

The supply side portion of the REE market is primarily driven by a select few countries: China, Australia, Malaysia, and the US.  If supply chain issues continue, demand will outpace supply and price appreciation is anticipated to sustain.

Prices are currently substantially higher than 2020 and although there may be a scenario where supply is unobstructed in the short term, price depreciation is not expected to return to 2020 levels.

Looking forward, AI forecasts that the global rare earth market will consistently underproduce NdPr oxide from 2022, resulting in shortages by as early as 2023 if production does not increase beyond what is currently projected.  Looking forward, from 2022 through 2035 AI forecasts that global TREO demand will rise at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.0%, from 190,476 t to 407,621 t, driven primarily by the  permanent  magnet  sector.    TREO  demand  relating  to  permanent  magnets  (NdFeB  magnets)  is

<!-- image -->

expected to rise at a CAGR of 8.3%, from 87,000 t to 246,000 t, boosted by strong demand growth from electric vehicle, wind power, general automotive, and other applications of NdFeB magnets.  AI expects that electric vehicles will be responsible for over 40% of global magnet earth oxide demand by 2035.

Similarly, AI forecast that the global rare earth market will consistently underproduce Dy oxide resulting in shortages by as early as 2023 should production not increase beyond what is currently anticipated.

AI forecasts that the global rare earth market will consistently underproduce Tb oxide, resulting in ongoing and increasing shortages should production not increase beyond what is currently expected.

SLR notes that Nd, Pr, Dy, and TB make up approximately 92% of the Project value.

## 1.3.11 Environmental, Permitting and Social Considerations

Search Minerals has corporate environmental and social policies which are being expanded and further developed.  The Project is in an early stage of development and baseline studies have been initiated based on preliminary Project information.  Additional baseline work will be required to support environmental approvals and permitting.

The  Project  will  require  provincial  approvals  and  permits.    The  revised  project  scope  as  currently configured does not trigger a federal Impact Assessment under the Impact Assessment Act (IAA).

Search  Minerals  conducts  community  engagement  in  relation  to  exploration  activities  and  plans  to conduct further engagement activities in 2022.  Search Minerals holds an agreement with the NCC to address exploration activities and has initiated some social initiatives such as offering limited scholarships to people in the local community.

Deep Fox lies within the St. Lewis protected water supply catchment area.  SLR understands that Search Minerals continues to work directly with the St. Lewis Town Council to ensure that residents are informed of activities and that concerns are addressed in a timely manner.  This is a key risk to manage as the Project progresses.  Surface water studies were initiated in 2020, have been ongoing since then, and will continue throughout the exploration and development activities to provide a better understanding of any potential quality and quantity impacts on this water resource.

An  RCP  and  financial  assurance  for  rehabilitation  and  closure  costs  will  be  required  to  obtain environmental approvals.

## 1.3.12 Capital and Operating Cost Estimates

The  capital  and  operating  costs  for  the  processing,  transport,  and  infrastructure  were  estimated  by NewPro  and  reviewed  by  SLR.    SLR  estimated  costs  related  to  mining,  tailings,  and  some  additional infrastructure not covered in the NewPro estimate.

SLR  notes  that,  due  to  global  events  relating  to  COVID  19  and  the  war  in  Ukraine,  there  have  been significant increases to many goods, and freight prices have increased dramatically.  SLR has not made any adjustments to the capital and operating cost estimates from NewPro to reflect these events, and the mining costs reflect 'normal' conditions.

All costs are in Canadian Dollars (C$) unless otherwise stated.

The mine, process, and site infrastructure capital costs are summarized in Table 1-5.

## 2.0 INTRODUCTION

SLR Consulting (Canada) Ltd. (SLR) was retained by Search Minerals Inc. (Search Minerals) to prepare an independent Technical Report on the Deep Fox and Foxtrot Rare Earth Element (REE) Project (the Project or  the  Property),  located  near  St.  Lewis,  Newfoundland  and  Labrador,  Canada.    The  purpose  of  this Technical Report is to disclose the results of a Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA) on the Project based on a new mineral processing method and updated Mineral Resource estimates for both the Deep Fox deposit (Deep Fox) and the Foxtrot deposit (Foxtrot).  This Technical Report conforms to National Instrument 43-101 (NI 43-101) Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects.  SLR visited the Property and field office on August 26, 2015, and November 9 to 12, 2021.

Search Minerals is a public company that trades on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) Venture Exchange under the symbol SMY, and on the OTCQB Venture Market under the symbol SHCMF.  Search Minerals, through its wholly-owned subsidiary Alterra Resources Inc. (Alterra), owns Deep Fox and nearby Foxtrot, as well as a number of mineral prospects on its 100% owned Critical REE District spanning approximately 64 km.  Search Minerals holds REE properties in the Red Wine Complex of Central Labrador and the Henley Harbour properties, located in southeast Labrador.

This Technical Report is considered by SLR to meet the requirements of a PEA as defined in Canadian NI 43-101 regulations.  The PEA production scenario for the Project consists of initial mining at Deep Fox followed  by  Foxtrot,  using  both  open  pit  and  underground  mining  methods,  at  a  production  rate  of 2,000 tonnes per day (tpd) or 720,000 tonnes per annum (tpa).  Mineralized material from Deep Fox and Foxtrot will be fed to a magnetic separation plant (Primary Production Plant), which is to be built adjacent to Deep Fox, where mineralized material will be concentrated from approximately 0.87% total rare earth oxides (TREO) plus Yttrium (Y) to produce a rare earth mineral concentrate (approximately 26% mass pull) grading between 4% TREO+Y to 6% TREO+Y with 90% TREO+Y recovery.

The rare earth mineral concentrate will then be shipped from an upgraded port facility in Labrador to a hydrometallurgical processing plant (Hydrometallurgical Processing Plant) to be constructed on the island of Newfoundland for processing into a refined rare earth carbonate for further down stream processing (i.e., separation by others).  The Hydrometallurgical Processing Plant utilizes a direct extraction process developed  by  Search  Minerals.    Search  Minerals  is  investigating  the  potential  to  undertake  further refinement of products using its own separation facility.

Both  the  Primary  Production  Plant  and  the  Hydrometallurgical  Processing  Plant,  with  all  supporting infrastructure,  were  designed  and  engineered  by  NewPro  Consulting  &amp;  Engineering  Services  Pty  Ltd. (NewPro).  Engineering designs and discussion is reported in NewPro's report 'Search Minerals Inc., Fox Harbour Rare Earths Project, Processing Plant Scoping Study Update' identified as Revision C and Issued on January 25, 2022 (the NewPro Report).

It is estimated  that  the  average  annual  production  of  refined  rare  earth  carbonate  will  contain 1,437 tonnes (t)  of  the  primary  rare  earth  oxides  (REO)  of  Neodymium  (Nd),  Praseodymium  (Pr), Dysprosium (Dy), and Terbium (Tb) which will account for approximately 92% of the Project's revenue. REO price forecasts were provided by Adamas Intelligence (AI), an independent research and advisory service focused on strategic metals and minerals.  SLR notes that forecasts from AI were provided in October 2021 and subsequently updated in February 2022.  There was a significant increase in REO prices, especially for Nd and Pr (approximately 90%) as a result of a long term supply shortage.  This supply shortage is directly related to the increased demand for critical metals to supply the green economy.

The economic analysis contained in this PEA is based, in part, on Inferred Resources, and is preliminary in nature.  Inferred Resources are considered too geologically speculative to have mining and economic considerations applied to them and to be categorized as Mineral Reserves.  There is no certainty that the reserves development, production, and economic forecasts on which this PEA is based will be realized.

## 5.0 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE AND PHYSIOGRAPHY

## 5.1 Accessibility

Deep Fox and Foxtrot are located approximately 10 km west northwest and two kilometres northeast of St. Lewis, Labrador, respectively, and 36 km and 47 km east-southeast of Port Hope Simpson, respectively. The majority of the Foxtrot property is accessible via Highway 513, an all-season gravel highway; areas not adjacent to the roadside are within walking distance.  The Deep Fox property is accessible via a twokilometre  private  woods  road  from  St.  Lewis.    All  parts  of  the  Deep  Fox  property  are  within  walking distance of the road and accessible from Fox Harbour Pond by boat and walking.

Travel to Port Hope Simpson and St. Lewis from Goose Bay, Labrador, is available via charter airplane, helicopter, and Highway 510, part of the fully paved (completed July, 2022) 1,149 km Trans Labrador Highway  that  stretches  from  western  Labrador  to  the  Strait  of  Belle  Isle.    Goose  Bay,  located approximately 350 km by air to the northwest of the Project, is a preferred hub as it is regularly serviced from eastern Canadian cities including Quebec City and Montreal, Quebec, and Halifax, Nova Scotia and St. John's, NL.  Flight time from the exploration site to Goose Bay by helicopter is approximately two hours, and  by  fixed  wing  aircraft  approximately  one  hour.    Road  travel  from  Goose  Bay,  a  distance  of approximately 460 km, to the site is approximately six hours.  The site is also accessible via Highway 510 from the Strait of Belle Isle and via a short ferry trip from insular Newfoundland.  The flight time to St. Anthony, Newfoundland and Labrador, is approximately half an hour.

## 5.2 Climate

The  Project  area  is  subject  to  a  maritime  climate.    During  the  six  month  field  season  (May  through October), temperatures range from an average low of 0°C in May, to an average high of 19°C in August. Over the same time period, average monthly precipitation ranges from 48 mm in May, to 91 mm in October.  Average monthly snowfall in May and June are 6 cm and 3 cm, respectively; snow is not expected in the remaining months of the field season.  Drilling activities can occur all year around due to relatively mild winters.

## 5.3 Local Resources and Infrastructure

As of 2021, the nearby communities of Port Hope Simpson, St. Lewis, and Mary's Harbour, which have populations of approximately 403, 181, and 312, respectively, have various services including grocery stores, fuel stores, hotels, heavy equipment rentals, and labour resources.  All three communities have port  access  as  well  as  airstrips  that  can  facilitate  transportation  of  goods  required  for  exploration programs.  St. Lewis has deep water dock facilities and a small gravel airstrip suitable for small aircraft. Core storage, company lodging, and office space is located within the town of St. Lewis, in the Search Minerals owned and renovated Loran C building, shown in Figure 5-1, formally occupied by the Canadian Coast Guard.

There  is  no  electricity  currently  available  on  the  Project  site.    The  closest  source  is  diesel  generated electricity  in  the  town  of  St.  Lewis,  located  10  km  and  two  kilometres  from  Deep  Fox  and  Foxtrot, respectively.

Water sources are plentiful over the Property.

## 5.4 Physiography

Elevation ranges from sea level to approximately 120 MASL.  Topography is rugged with generally eastwest striking ridges and hills with low lying areas containing rivers, ponds, and brooks that generally drain east or south into St. Lewis Inlet.  As an ecoregion, the Property can be classified as 'Coastal Barrens' with the majority of the Property being scrubland.  Vegetation consists of isolated black and white spruce stands in sheltered valleys, mosses, lichens, and Labrador tea in more barren areas, and lichen-covered bedrock in higher areas and along ridges.

## 6.0 HISTORY

## 6.1 Public Surveys and Studies

Early knowledge of the area is based mainly on a 1:500,000 scale reconnaissance mapping (Eade, 1962).

Complete  aeromagnetic  coverage  and  lake-sediment  geochemical  surveys  were  conducted  over  the region (Geological Survey of Canada (GSC), 1974a, 1974b, 1984).  A detailed lake sediment survey was released by the Newfoundland and Labrador Government in 2010 and covered the area of the claims.

Geological mapping at 1:100,000 scale was carried out from 1984 to 1987 by Charles F. Gower of the Newfoundland and Labrador Geological Survey, as part of a five year Canada-Newfoundland joint project aimed at mapping an 80 km coastal fringe of the Grenville Province in southern Labrador (Gower et al., 1987 to 2009).

Meyer and Dean visited the area in 1988 to investigate a Pb-Cd-W-Cu lake sediment anomaly.

In 2014, a master's thesis was completed to determine the geology, mineralogy, age, and origin of the rare earth minerals at the Foxtrot property (Haley, 2014).

## 6.2 Exploration and Development History

Devonian Resources Inc. (Devonian) conducted work from June 1 to June 27, 1996, on a historic license presently covered by license 022088M (assessment file 003D/05/0021).  Work conducted was prospecting follow up of a GSC lake sediment survey that indicated anomalous copper, nickel, and cobalt values. Devonian recommended that no further exploration be carried out.  They also attempted to relocate the sample location found by the Newfoundland and Labrador Geological Survey in 1988 with anomalous zirconium (Zr) values.  They did not find the rock described by the Newfoundland and Labrador Geological Survey and did not take any samples.

Greenshield Resources Inc. conducted work from May 29 to August 3, 1996, on a historic license presently covered by parts of licences 022088M and 023108M (assessment file LAB/1205).  This file describes a program of geological mapping, prospecting, lithogeochemical sampling, and diamond  drilling. Exploration focused on assessing the potential for economic magmatic copper-nickel mineralized areas within  the  Alexis  River  Anorthosite.    The  program  was  completed  with  no  significant  economic mineralization observed.

In 2008, Search Minerals began actively trading on the TSX Venture Exchange under the symbol SMY.  In 2009, it successfully acquired all outstanding shares of Alterra, now a wholly-owned subsidiary of Search Minerals.  Search Minerals, through Alterra, currently holds 472 mineral claims in southeast Labrador including  451  claims  in  the  Critical  REE  District,  where  the  Project  is  located.    Search  Minerals  began extensive exploration in the Critical REE District in 2009 after it entered into a binding letter of intent to acquire an undivided 100% interest in certain claims in southeast Labrador owned by B&amp;A Minerals Inc. (B&amp;A) known as the Port Hope Simpson property; these claims have since been transferred to Alterra as per the option agreement.  Adjacent land, including the Foxtrot, Deep Fox, Silver Fox, Awesome Fox, and Fox Meadow properties in the Fox Harbour Volcanic Belt (FHVB), and the Ocean View and Henley Harbour properties to the south, was acquired through subsequent staking.  Exploration at Foxtrot began in 2010 with  prospecting,  mapping,  channeling,  and  a  Phase  I  diamond  drill  program.    Channeling  programs continued in 2011, 2012, 2014, and 2015.  Phase II of drilling began in 2011 and Phase III in 2012.  The Deep Fox property (formally named Deepwater Fox) was acquired from the Quinlan brothers via an option

agreement signed in 2011 and completed in 2015.  At the time, the Deep Fox property consisted of three mineral licences (016480M, 016620M, and 017646M), including 48 claims (1,200 ha) located east and north of the community of St. Lewis and contiguous with Alterra claims north and west of St. Lewis.  The Quinlan licences  were  merged  with  relevant  and  adjacent  Alterra  claims  to  form  the  current  Licence 023108M.  Significant exploration at Deep Fox began in 2014 with a prospecting and mapping program; the discovery channel was completed in 2014.  Channeling programs continued in 2015, 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2021.  Drilling began with Phase I in 2017, and continued with Phase II in 2018, Phase III in 2021 and currently Phase IV in 2022.

## 7.0 GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND MINERALIZATION

Dr. Randy Miller, Vice President Exploration of Search Minerals, provided SLR with the following Section 7  geological  discussion,  including  the  regional,  local  and  property  geological  maps  and  cross-sections. Search Minerals also provided the characterization of the mineralization and the exploration geological model.

## 7.1 Regional Geology

Deep Fox and Foxtrot occur in the FHVB, part of the Fox Harbour Domain, located in the region adjacent to the boundaries of three tectonic terranes within the eastern Grenville Province, as presented in Figure 7-1.  Units of the Lake Melville Terrane occur north of the FHVB, units of the Mealy Mountain Terrane to the west and southwest, and units of the Pinware Terrane to the south.  Differing lithologies, structures, ages, and metamorphic signatures distinguish these terranes from one another; they are largely separated and defined by major fault zones (Gower et al., 1987, 1988; Gower, 2010, 2012; Hanmer and Scott, 1990).

The Lake Melville Terrane is located north of the FHVB.  This terrane is characterized by the Alexis River anorthosite, biotite-bearing granite, granodiorite, and quartz diorite-to-diorite gneiss (Gower et al., 1987, 1988; Gower 2010; Hanmer and Scott, 1990).  The Fox Harbour fault zone (Gower, 2012) separates the Lake  Melville  Terrane  from  the  FHVB  to  the  south.    Near  Deep  Fox  and  Foxtrot,  terrane  boundary interpretations  indicate  that  a  thin  sliver  (five  kilometre  to  six  kilometre  wide)  of  Mealy  Mountains Terrane occurs between the Lake Melville Terrane to the north and the Pinware Terrane to the south (Gower, 2012).  Detailed mapping indicates that the Fox Harbour Domain, including the FHVB, occurs in the northern half of this sliver and the Deer Harbour Domain in the southern half (Figure 7-1).

The Fox Harbour Domain, in the vicinity of Deep Fox and Foxtrot, is bordered to the north by the Fox Harbour fault zone and to the south by the Deer Harbour fault zone.  This domain has been traced in outcrop for 64 km; it is terminated by a fault zone at the northwest end (west of Port Hope Simpson) and by the Labrador Sea on the eastern end (near St. Lewis).  REE mineralization, peralkaline felsic volcanic rocks,  and  mafic  volcanic  rocks  of  a  bimodal  suite  (Fox  Harbour  Volcanic  Suite),  and  an  associated anorthositic gabbro/volcanic suite distinguish this domain from adjacent domains and terranes; feldspar porphyries and deformed augen gneisses are also present.  REE deposits and prospects in this domain include Foxtrot, Deep Fox, Silver Fox, Fox Meadow, Awesome Fox, Fox Run, Foxy Lady, and Fox Pond.

Regional structural data, satellite image interpretation, geology, ages and unique lithologies suggest that the Fox Harbour and Deer Harbour domains are not part of the Mealy Mountains Terrane as originally suggested by Gower (2012).  Similar data suggest that at least two additional domains occur between the Lake Melville and Mealy Mountain terranes in the western portion of the region.  The Camp #1 Domain occurs between the Lake Melville Terrane, to the north, and the Fox Harbour Domain, to the south.  The Bobby's Pond Domain occurs between the Fox Harbour and Camp #1 Domains to the north, the Deer Harbour Domain to the south and the Mealy Mountains Terrane to the west (Figure 7-1).  The map pattern in  the  west  shows  the  Mealy  Mountains  Terrane  and  the  Bobby's  Pond  Domain  as  forming  a  wedge between the Fox Harbour and Deer Harbour domains; the Bobby's Pond Domain may be a subunit of the Mealy Mountain Terrane.  In the western portion of the study area, the Deer Harbour fault zone separates the Deer Harbour Domain from the Mealy Mountain Terrane/ Bobby's Pond Domain.

The Mealy Mountain Terrane units, west and southwest of the FHVB, consist of mostly biotite granitic gneiss, potassium feldspar megacrystic granite gneiss, quartz diorite to dioritic gneisses, and pelitic to semipelitic sedimentary gneisses (Gower et al., 1987, 1988; Gower, 2010).

The  Pinware  Terrane,  in  the  St.  Lewis  Inlet  area,  consists  of  metamorphosed  felsic  to  intermediate intrusions  and  older  intercalated  quartzo-feldspathic  supracrustal  rocks.    Intrusions  consist  mainly  of granite, k-feldspar megacrystic granite, quartz monzonite, and granodiorite.  Supracrustal rocks, occurring between intrusions, consist mainly of felsic volcanic rocks and arenitic sediments (Gower, 2007, 2010). The  Long  Harbour  fault  zone  is  interpreted  to  separate  the  Deer  Harbour  Domain  from  the  Pinware Terrane to the south (Gower, 2012).

Mapping and exploration south of the Long Harbour fault  zone (south of the Deer Harbour Domain) indicate that peralkaline volcanic and intrusive rocks and related REE mineralization also occur in an area originally interpreted to be Pinware Terrane (Gower, 2012).  These rocks and spatially associated mafic volcanic and non-peralkaline (NPR) supracrustal rocks have been grouped into the HighREE Hills Domain. The  HighREE  Hills  Domain  is  characterized  by  peralkaline  volcanic  and  subvolcanic  rocks  and  related pegmatite-  and  vein-hosted  REE  mineralization.    REE  prospects  in  the  HighREE  Hills  Domain  include: HighREE Island, Pesky Hill, Toots Cove, and Southern Shore.

The Fox Harbour Domain has many characteristics of a continental rift zone: 1) elongate fault- bounded units (64 km long) with ages much younger than bounding units; 2) bimodal subaerial volcanic and related subvolcanic units; and 3) dominated by felsic peralkaline volcanic vents/flows and spatially related nonperalkaline ash-flow tuffs.  Similar peralkaline-hosted REE mineralization has been discovered throughout this domain (e.g., Deep Fox and Foxtrot).

## 7.2 Local Geology

The 64 km long FHVB ranges in width from less than 50 m in the northwest to three kilometres in the east. Units  dip  steeply  in  a  northerly  direction  and  generally  strike  westerly  to  northwesterly,  parallel  to bounding faults to the north and south.  The FHVB contains one peralkaline belt in the northwest and three  peralkaline  belts  in  the  east,  these  belts  of  bimodal  rocks  are  dominated  by  REE-bearing  felsic peralkaline  flows  and  ash-flow  tuffs  and  unmineralized  mafic  to  ultramafic  volcanic  and  related subvolcanic  units.    Feldspar  megacrystic/porphyritic  units  (non-peralkaline  volcanic  and  subvolcanic), including  crystal  tuffs  in  the  eastern  portion  of  the  FHVB,  predominantly  occur  between  the  three mineralized  belts.    Supracrustal  units  of  sedimentary  origin,  including  quartzite  and  locally  derived volcanogenic sediments formed by erosion of felsic (commonly peralkaline) and mafic units, are locally abundant.

The three bimodal peralkaline-bearing mineralized belts in the FHVB, from north to south: the Road Belt (RB), the Magnetite Belt (MTB), and South Belt (SB), have been the focus of REE exploration.  The RB, which occurs on the northern boundary of the FHVB, can be traced for 64 km throughout the FHVB.  The MT and SB have only been observed in the eastern 30 km of the FHVB, east of the Curl's Pond deep crustal fault, as presented in Figure 7-1 and Figure 7-2.  The mineralized units within the belts, predominantly pantellerite and comendite and trachytic equivalents (comenditic trachyte and pantelleritic trachyte west of Curl's Pond Fault), commonly occur in local topographic lows where ponds, bogs, and scarce outcrop predominate or on the sides of hills topped by extensive, less weathered, mafic, ultramafic or anorthositic units.    Exploration  for  REE  mineralization  in  the  region  indicates  that  the  mineralized  units  exhibit relatively high radiometric (anomalous uranium (U) and thorium (Th) values) and relatively high magnetic (anomalous concentrations of magnetite) signatures that, when combined, are excellent indicators of mineralization.    Airborne  and  ground-based  radiometric-magnetic  surveys  clearly  outline  the  three mineralized belts (Section 9); overburden and treed areas obscure bedrock exposure of the mineralized belts in some areas.

Medium to high grade REE mineralization, characterized by dysprosium (Dy) from 100 ppm to 400 ppm, is  predominantly hosted by fine-grained, layered to massive pantellerite and Zr-enriched pantellerite. Lower grade mineralization, characterized by Dy from 20 ppm to 100 ppm, is predominantly hosted by fine-grained,  mostly  massive  comendite  and  Zr-poor  pantellerite.    Mineralized  units  are  commonly interbedded with mafic to ultramafic volcanic units, quartzite, and locally derived volcanogenic sediments (Figure 7-2).

Most of the rare earth mineralization occurs in allanite and fergusonite; minor amounts of REE occur in chevkinite, monazite, bastnaesite, britholite and zircon.  The majority of the light REE (i.e., La to Sm) in the mineralization occurs in allanite, whereas the majority of the HREE (i.e., Eu to Lu) occurs in both fergusonite and allanite.

The RB commonly consists of non-peralkaline porphyritic feldspar-bearing units (mostly volcanic), mafic and  ultramafic  volcanic  rocks,  non-peralkaline  felsic  volcanic  units  (NPR  and  RHYODAC),  comendite (peralkaline), and pantellerite (peralkaline).  Anorthosite suite units, including anorthositic gabbro and ultramafic volcanic rocks, always occur north (i.e., within 25 m) of the RB felsic volcanic units, all on the southern side of the Fox Harbour fault zone.  Individual highly mineralized units commonly range from less than one to five metres in thickness.  The RB hosts the Deep Fox deposit and several significant REE prospects with high grade REE mineralization including Fox Pond, Fox Valley, Fox Meadow, and Foxy Lady. Medium to high grade mineralization at some of these prospects range from 10 m to 40 m in thickness

(e.g., Deep Fox deposit and Fox Meadow prospect).  Zones grading from low to high grade (comendite and pantellerite combined) are up to 100 m wide.

The MTB commonly consists of pantellerite, comendite, non-peralkaline rhyolite, and mafic to ultramafic volcanic and related subvolcanic units.  Individual highly mineralized units commonly range up to one metre in thickness.  This belt hosts Foxtrot and additional significant REE prospects in the area (e.g., Silver Fox and Fox Run).  Mineralization is up to 100 m in thickness (comendite plus pantellerite) at Foxtrot; medium to high grade mineralization is up to 25 m in thickness, and typically averages 10 m to 14 m in thickness.

Lower grade REE mineralization is commonly found in the SB.  The SB commonly consists of predominantly comendite,  minor  mafic  and  pantellerite  units,  feldspar-bearing  porphyry,  and  locally  abundant volcanogenic sediments and quartzite.  Low grade mineralization (comendite) commonly ranges from 10 m to 50 m in thickness.

## 7.3 Property Geology

Mapping,  prospecting,  and  litho-geochemical  sampling  throughout  the  FHVB  have  identified  the widespread occurrence of peralkaline volcanic rocks exhibiting a wide range of major and trace elements including REE, Zr, and niobium (Nb).  A litho-geochemical classification system has been developed to help codify the logging of channels and drill holes and to aid in surface mapping; this system has been used to classify all samples in the Deep Fox and Foxtrot databases.  Table 7-1 and Table 7-2 present some average concentrations of REE, Zr, and other elements for the felsic rock types observed at Deep Fox and Foxtrot, respectively.

For Deep Fox and Foxtrot, the mineralized rocks mainly classify as either comendite or pantellerite; only one of the major units at Deep Fox and Foxtrot belongs to the family of peralkaline trachytes.  The Zr value in each sample is used to subdivide samples as follows:

- · Comendite (COM): 800 ppm to 5,000 ppm Zr (Fe-poor, Al-poor)
- · Comenditic Trachyte (COMTRA): 800 ppm to 5,000 ppm Zr (Fe-enriched, higher Al)
- · Low Zr Pantellerite (LZP): 5,000 ppm to 10,000 ppm Zr
- · Pantellerite (PAN): 10,000 ppm to 15,000 ppm Zr
- · High Zr Pantellerite (HZP): 15,000 ppm to 25,000 ppm Zr
- · Ultrahigh Zr Pantellerite (UZP): &gt;25,000 ppm Zr

REE, Nb, yttrium (Y) and other incompatible elements closely mimic Zr (i.e., high Zr values generally indicate high REE values), as presented in Table 7-1 and Table 7-2.  Generally, comendite hosts lower grade REE mineralization, LZP hosts medium grade mineralization, and PAN, HZP, and UZP host higher grade mineralization.  The rhyolite-dacite (RHYO-DAC) and other non-peralkaline rocks (NPR) have much lower values.

## 7.4 Mineralization

## 7.4.1 Deep Fox Mineralization

Deep Fox is located approximately 12 km east of Foxtrot and two kilometres northeast of St. Lewis in the RB of the FHVB, as illustrated in Figure 7-1 and Figure 7-2.  As presented in Figure 7-3 through Figure 7-5, the RB near Deep Fox consists of, from north to south:

- · Northern comendite
- · Anorthositic suite rocks consisting of anorthositic gabbro and anorthosite
- · Non-peralkaline rhyolite

- · Southern comendite
- · Mafic and ultramafic volcanic rocks
- · Mineralized  pantelleritic  rocks  (mostly  LZP,  PAN,  and  HZP)  with  interbedded  non-peralkaline rhyolite and mafic volcanic rocks
- · A footwall non-peralkaline rhyolitic ash-flow tuff

Minor units of locally derived volcanogenic sediments, mafic volcanic flows, and related subvolcanic units and pegmatites occur throughout this sequence.  Most units generally dip 75° to 85° northerly and drill data indicates that the mineralized zone may overturn at depth to dip steeply towards the south, as presented in Figure 7-5.  Drilling indicates that the mineralized zone plunges towards the northeast.  The anorthositic suite and mineralized units form a prominent east-west trending ridge in the area.

Table 7-1 and Table 7-2 list average REE and other elemental data for the major geological units within Deep Fox and Foxtrot.  The mineralization at Deep Fox displays approximately 20% higher values for Zr and the REEs for each mineralized rock type versus those of Foxtrot.  Most of the mineralized samples at Deep Fox are either pantellerite or high Zr pantellerite.

The comendite mineralization, which is approximately 15 m to 30 m in thickness, consists of individual units  of  massive  to  poorly  layered  fine-grained  flows  that  are  commonly  less  than  one  metre  to  two metres in thickness.  Medium-grained to pegmatitic comendite fragments, commonly up to 10 cm, occur in localized areas.  Comendite commonly contains trace to minor magnetite, exhibits radioactivity three to five times higher than background levels, and contains lower amounts of REE (e.g., 38 ppm Dy) and other incompatible elements relative to other mineralized units (Table 7-1).

The pantellerite mineralization (low-Zr pantellerite, pantellerite, and high-Zr pantellerite) is up to 42 m in thickness and consists of individual units of fine-grained, commonly less than one metre to five metres in thickness,  poorly  to  well  layered  flows.    In  the  western  portion  of  the  deposit  the  pantellerite mineralization is up to 42 m thick but rapidly diminishes to 14 m thick to the western edge of the deposit; medium to higher grade mineralization thicknesses (pantellerite and high-Zr pantellerite) are reduced from  25  m  thick  to  six  m  thick  over  this  same  interval.    In  the  eastern  portion  of  the  deposit,  the pantellerite mineralization occurs as two to three main units separated by non-mineralized units (mafic volcanic flows, non-peralkaline rhyolite, and pegmatite) that are up to 31 m thick in aggregate.  The upper unit is up to nine metres thick but dominated by low-Zr pantellerite.  The middle and lower units are respectively up to 14 m and 11 m thick and dominated by more highly mineralized pantellerite and highZr pantellerite.

Pantellerite contains up to 10% magnetite and localized amphibole and pyroxene.  Magnetite is usually fine-grained but may occur as porphyritic grains up to 4.0 mm across.  Pantellerite exhibits radioactivity from five to 40 times background.  Layering within the pantellerite units, observed as darker and lighter bands, is commonly defined by varying contents of magnetite.  Medium grained to pegmatitic comendite and non-peralkaline rhyolite fragments, commonly up to 10 cm wide, occur in localized areas.  Pantellerite units are generally well mineralized, containing potentially economic concentrations of REE (i.e., 60 ppm to  400  ppm  Dy)  and  other  incompatible  elements.    Differences  in  average  Zr  values  subdivide  the pantellerite into three mappable units: Zr-poor pantellerite (5,000 ppm to 10,000 ppm Zr), pantellerite (10,000 ppm to 15,000 ppm Zr), and Zr-enriched pantellerite (&gt;15,000 ppm Zr).  Deep Fox comprises predominantly  pantellerite  and  high  Zr  pantellerite  units;  comendite  units  are  generally  poorly mineralized.

Mafic volcanic units and locally derived sediments, commonly less than 0.5 m in thickness, occur between some individual mineralized units.  Thicker mafic units, up to 10 m in thickness, occur within the comendite

unit and near the contact between the comendite and pantellerite units.  Mafic units commonly contain less than 300 ppm Zr and less than 10 ppm Dy.

Locally derived sediments consist of thin quartzite (&lt;20 cm) interbedded with thinly layered (&lt;30 cm) mafic and felsic bands.  Felsic bands consist of non-peralkaline rhyolite, comendite, low Zr pantellerite, or a mix of mafic and felsic volcanic units.

Ultramafic units, up to 25 m thick, occur within all non-peralkaline units and comendite at Deep Fox.  An ultramafic, mafic volcanic, and non-peralkaline rhyolite flow mixed unit is commonly found in the hanging wall of the mineralized pantellerite zone.  The ultramafic units occur as fine to very fine-grained flows with a distinctive texture.  Zr values commonly are less than 100 ppm and Dy values less than 4 ppm.

A major non-peralkaline rhyolite unit, up to 60 m thick, occurs in the hanging wall of the deposit.  Several units  of  non-peralkaline  rhyolite,  one  metre  to  five  metres  in  thickness,  occur  within  the  mineralized zones, particularly in the eastern part of the deposit where they commonly separate mineralized units (Figure 7-3 and Figure 7-4).  They are commonly associated with low Zr-pantellerite, pegmatite, mafic rocks, and locally derived sediments.  Non-peralkaline rhyolite is characterized by low Zr values (300 ppm to 600 ppm Zr), low Dy values (&lt;12 ppm Dy), and low mafic mineral concentrations (commonly less than five percent).

Faults, defined by the geology, magnetic anomaly offsets, and topographic lineaments, divide the deposit into four major blocks: Deep Fox West Block, Deep Fox Central Block, Deep Fox East Block, and Deep Fox East Extension Block.  The observed faults are northerly to north-easterly striking, steeply dipping, and display up to 20 m observed horizontal movement and 10 m to 100 m vertical movement observed in drill sections.  Additional work with oriented drill core, geotechnical logging, and surficial structural mapping are needed to better understand the structures present at Deep Fox.

The vertical movement on the faults appears to have been partly responsible for changes along strike in the thickness of units, including the mineralization and the presence or absence of specific units.  Changes in  the  thickness  of  mineralization  is  observed  across  all  block  boundaries  (Figure  7-3).    The  western boundary of the Deep Fox West Block is interpreted to be the western edge of the Deep Fox Caldera; mineralized units diminish in size and wedge out at this boundary.  The eastern edge of the Deep Fox Caldera is marked by the eastern edge of the Deep Fox East Extension Block, where the mineralization lenses out.

The peralkaline mineralized units and spatially associated mafic-ultramafic, non-peralkaline rhyolite, and locally derived Deep Fox sedimentary units are interpreted to represent a subaerial bimodal sequence of volcanic and related volcanogenic sediments and subvolcanic sills.  The probable mantle derivation of the peralkaline and mafic to ultramafic rocks, the subaerial setting, the non-orogenic age, and the occurrence of these units as a series of calderas in a narrow belt (the FHVB) over at least a 64 km strike-length suggest that these rocks occur in a continental rift setting.  Modern analogues include Pantelleria Island, in the Mediterranean Sea, and the East African Rift.

## 7.4.2 Foxtrot Mineralization

Foxtrot is located approximately 10 km west of St. Lewis and 0.5 km south of Highway 513 in the MTB of the FHVB (Figure 7-1, Figure 7-2, and Figure 7-6). Near Foxtrot, the MTB consists of, from north to south:

- · Comendite
- · Pantellerite with interbedded non-peralkaline rhyolite
- · A mafic to ultramafic unit with interbedded non-peralkaline rhyolite

Minor units of locally derived volcanogenic sediments, mafic volcanic rocks and related subvolcanic units, and pegmatites occur throughout this sequence.  Feldspar porphyry borders the mineralized units to the north and a mafic unit, forming a predominant ridge in the area, occurs to the south.  Table 7-2 lists representative REE data for the major felsic units within Foxtrot.

The comenditic mineralization, which is approximately 50 m in thickness, consists of individual units of fine-grained,  commonly  less  than  one  metre  to  two  metres  in  thickness,  massive  to  poorly  layered comendite flows.  Comendites commonly contain trace to minor magnetite, exhibit radioactivity three to five times higher than background levels, and contain lower amounts of REE (i.e., 20 ppm to 60 ppm Dy) and other incompatible elements relative to other mineralized units (Table 7-2).

The pantelleritic mineralization may be up to 30 m in thickness, consists of individual units of fine-grained, commonly  less  than  one  metre  to  five  metres  in  thickness,  poorly  to  well-layered  pantellerite. Pantellerites contain up to 10% magnetite and localized amphibole and pyroxene.  Magnetite is usually fine-grained but may occur as porphyritic grains up to 4.0 mm across.  Pantellerites exhibit radioactivity from five to 40 times background.  Layering within the pantellerite units, observed as darker and lighter bands,  is  commonly  defined  by  varying  contents  of  magnetite.    Pantellerite  units  are  generally  well mineralized, containing potentially economic concentrations of REE (i.e., 60 ppm to 300 ppm Dy) and other incompatible elements (Table 7-2).  Differences in average Zr values subdivide the pantellerites into two mappable units: Zr-poor pantellerite (5,000 ppm to 10,000 ppm Zr) and pantellerite (10,000 ppm to 15,000  ppm  Zr).    Zr-enriched  pantellerite  (&gt;15,000  ppm  Zr;  high  Zr  pantellerite  and  ultrahigh  Zr pantellerite) is also observed but is commonly less than one metre in thickness and is not depicted in Figure 7-6 or Figure 7-7.  Foxtrot comprises predominantly pantelleritic and low Zr pantelleritic units.

Mafic volcanic units and locally derived sediments, commonly less than 0.5 m in thickness, occur between many  individual  mineralized  units.    Thicker  mafic  units,  up  to  10  m  in  thickness,  occur  within  the comenditic  unit  and  near  the  contact  between  the  comenditic  and  pantelleritic  units.    Mafic  units commonly contain less than 300 ppm Zr and less than 10 ppm Dy.

Locally derived sediments consist of thin quartzite (&lt;20 cm) interbedded with thinly layered (&lt;30 cm) mafic and felsic bands.  Felsic bands consist of non-peralkaline rhyolite, comendite, low Zr pantellerite, or a mix of mafic and felsic volcanic units.

Epidote-bearing fragments and a layered appearance characterize the mafic to ultramafic unit.  Zr values commonly are less than 100 ppm and Dy values less than 4 ppm.  These units mostly occur to the south of the pantelleritic mineralization and are up to 90 m in thickness.

Several units of non-peralkaline rhyolite, one to eight metres in thickness, occur within the mineralized zones, particularly in the eastern part of the deposit (Figure 7-6 and Figure 7-7).  They are commonly associated with low Zr-pantellerite, mafic rocks, and locally derived sediments.  Non-peralkaline rhyolite is characterized by low Zr values (300 ppm to 600 ppm Zr), low Dy values (&lt;12 ppm Dy) and low mafic mineral concentrations (commonly less than five percent).

Faults, defined by the geology, magnetic survey offsets, and topographic lineaments, divide the deposit into two major blocks: the Central Block and the East Block.  The observed faults are northerly to northeasterly striking, steeply dipping faults with up to 15 m observed horizontal movement and an unknown amount of vertical movement.

The vertical movement on the faults appears to have been partly responsible for changes along strike in the thickness of units, including the mineralization, and the presence or absence of specific units.  Change in the thickness of mineralization is observed across the western boundary of the Central Block and across the eastern boundary of the East Block (Figure 7- 6).  Non-peralkaline rhyolite is prominent in the East Block, where it commonly occurs as two units, and minor in the Central Block, where it occurs as one thinner unit or is absent.  Similar changes in thicknesses and absence or presence of specific units also occurs  across  smaller  faults  within  the  East  Block  and  may  also  occur  in  the  Central  Block  but  other corroborating data is currently absent in this block.

The peralkaline mineralized units and spatially associated mafic-ultramafic, non-peralkaline rhyolite and locally derived Foxtrot sedimentary units are interpreted to represent a subaerial bimodal sequence of volcanic and related volcanogenic sediments and subvolcanic intrusions.  The probable mantle derivation of the peralkaline and mafic to ultramafic rocks, the subaerial setting, the non-orogenic age (1300 Ma; Haley, 2014), and the occurrence of these units in a narrow belt (the FHVB) over at least a 64 km strikelength suggest that these rocks occur in a continental rift setting.  Modern analogues include Pantelleria Island and the East African Rift.

## 7.5 Genetic Model

REE mineralized peralkaline volcanic rocks, mainly pantellerite (Nuiklavik Volcanic Suite; Miller, 1993), and REE mineralized peralkaline intrusive rocks, granites-syenites (Strange Lake; Miller 1996, Miller et al., 1996; Two Tom Lake syenite; Miller 1987, 1988), and undersaturated syenites (Red Wine Suite; Miller 1987 and 1988) occur elsewhere in Labrador and are of similar age (Miller et al., 1996).     U-Pb Zircon age determination at Foxtrot indicates the FHVB rocks are contemporaneous (Haley, 2014).    In all examples, peralkaline  rocks,  hosting  REE  mineralization,  represent  low  volume  late  differentiates  of  high-level (crustal) magma chambers.    For intrusions, the mineralization occurs in late pegmatites, vein systems, or small volume intrusions at or near the top of the source magma chamber.    In the volcanic settings, the mineralization occurs as vent filling or near vent magma flows and/or ash-flow tuffs that tapped the source magma chamber.

The Deep Fox and Foxtrot exploration program reveals the relationship between peralkaline volcanic rocks, vent, or near-vent locations, and significant REE mineralization.    The Foxtrot deposit, in the MTB, is being used as a model (Foxtrot-like mineralization) for further exploration throughout the FHVB.    Data and field observations at Deep Fox validate the Foxtrot model.  Preliminary data at the Fox Meadow, Awesome Fox, and Fox Pond prospects suggest that they also occur in vent or near vent settings in the RB of the FHVB, as shown in Figure 7-1.    The Fox Run prospect and Silver Fox prospect, shown in Figure 7-1, likely occupy a similar REE mineralized setting in the MTB of the FHVB.  No significant REE prospects are known in the SB.

## 8.0 DEPOSIT TYPES

REE deposits can be divided into two main classifications: primary magmatic REE deposits and secondary REE deposits.  The majority of REE deposits are primary magmatic and many of the secondary ones are proximal to REE-enriched primary magmatic sources.  Most magmatic deposits are related to mantlederived magmas and/or magmatism associated with crustal rifting.  Metamorphic equivalents of these main categories are also known but not distinguished in this classification.

## 8.1 Primary Magmatic REE Deposits

Primary magmatic deposits can be subdivided into peralkaline oversaturated, peralkaline undersaturated, and carbonatite deposits.  Peralkaline deposits, both oversaturated (quartz-bearing or quartz normative) and  undersaturated  (nepheline-bearing  or  nepheline  normative)  are  mainly  HREE-enriched,  while carbonatite deposits are commonly LREE-enriched; some carbonatite high-level vein systems are also HREE-enriched.  Peralkaline rocks and carbonatites are known to occur in similar geological settings and can be spatially related.

Primary magmatic REE deposits are formed by concentration of REE and other incompatible elements (e.g.,  Zr,  Nb,  fluorine  (F),  U,  Th,  hafnium  (Hf))  in  the  upper  portions  of  magma  chambers.    These incompatible  element-enriched  magmas  are  either  crystallized  in  place,  are  transported  to  locations proximal to the magma chamber, or are transported to surface and deposited as volcanic products.

Peralkaline oversaturated volcanic-hosted deposits are rare but known to occur (e.g., Foxtrot, Deep Fox; Brockman, Australia).  No undersaturated volcanic-hosted deposits have been recognized to date.

## 8.1.1 Peralkaline Oversaturated Deposits

Peralkaline oversaturated deposits are commonly characterized by HREE-enrichment and complex REEbearing minerals such as fergusonite, allanite, zircon, monazite, and xenotime, and unusual silicates such as  gadolinite,  kainosite,  and  gerinite.    REE-bearing  carbonates  (e.g.,  bastnaesite)  are  less  common  in peralkaline-oversaturated deposits.

Peralkaline  granites  and  syenites  are  the  most  common  host  rocks  to  REE-enriched  peralkaline oversaturated  deposits.    Mineralization  is  concentrated  in  the  top  of  magma  chambers  and  is  either crystallized in place in cupolas, or as enriched pegmatitic vein systems and related auto-metasomaticallyenriched rocks (e.g., part of Strange Lake Main Zone, Quebec/Labrador) or as proximal pegmatites/deposits  (e.g.,  Strange  Lake  B-Zone  and  part  of  Main  Zone,  Quebec/Labrador).    Volcanichosted equivalents include deposits in the FHVB (e.g., Foxtrot, Deep Fox), Brockman Volcanic rocks in Australia, and mineralization in the Nuiklavik volcanic rocks of the Flowers River Igneous Suite (Labrador). Volcanic-hosted mineralization occurs as felsic vent filling or near vent ash-flow tuffs/flows and spatially related subvolcanic pegmatitic equivalents.

## 8.1.2 Peralkaline Undersaturated Deposits

Peralkaline  undersaturated  deposits  are  commonly  characterized  by  HREE-enrichment,  eudialyte  and other complex zirconium-silicates (e.g., Norra Karr, Sweden; Ilimaussaq Complex, Greenland; Red Wine Complex, Labrador), alteration products of eudialyte (e.g., allanite, fergusonite and zircon at Nechalacho, Northwest  Territories,  Canada)  and  other  unknown  complex  Ca-Y  silicates  (e.g.,  Red  Wine  Complex, Labrador).

<!-- image -->

Nepheline- and eudialyte-bearing syenites are common host rocks for this kind of REE mineral deposit; volcanic  equivalents  have  not  been  identified.    Mineralization  occurs  as  pegmatite  vein  systems  and related rocks (e.g., Red Wine Complex; Kipawa, Quebec) and medium-grained zones within the upper portions of large layered nepheline syenite intrusions (e.g., Norra Karr, Sweden; Ilimaussaq, Greenland; Red Wine Complex).

## 8.1.3 Carbonatite Deposits

Carbonatite  hosted  deposits  contain  a  combination  of  REE-bearing  carbonates  (e.g.,  bastnaesite  at Mountain  Pass,  California,  and  Bear  Lodge,  Wyoming),  monazite,  xenotime,  apatite,  and  other  REEbearing minerals.  The high-level vein systems sometimes associated with carbonatites contain higher concentrations of HREE and mostly contain predominantly phosphates like xenotime and monazite.  Vein system  mineralization  occurs  at  Lofdal  (Namibia),  Bear  Lodge,  Steenkampskraal  (South  Africa),  and Brown's Range (Australia).

The majority of LREE, particularly lanthanum (La), cerium (Ce), praseodymium (Pr), and Nd, are mined from carbonatites in China (Bayan Obo Deposit) and Australia (Mt. Weld Deposit).  This mineralization occurs mostly disseminated in low volume magmatic phases of commonly large carbonatite plutons (e.g., Bear Lodge, Ashram).

Carbonatite high-level vein mineralization is commonly associated with large carbonatite plutons (e.g., Loftdal, Bear Lodge).  High-grade mineralization, with similar characteristics but with no known associated plutons, is found at Brown's Range and Steenkampskraal.  All represent small volume magmas probably originating from carbonatite magma chambers.

## 8.2 Secondary REE Deposits

Three types of secondary REE deposits have been recognized: 1) beach sands and related sedimentary deposits, 2) ionic clay deposits, and 3) in situ laterites.  These deposits are derived from weathering of REE mineral-bearing rocks.

## 8.2.1 Beach Sand Deposits

REE-enriched heavy minerals, commonly zircon and monazite, are often concentrated in heavy mineral beach deposits.  These minerals are separated from the sands and sold as a by-product from beach sand deposits in India and elsewhere.  Consolidated beach sands and other clastic sedimentary units such as conglomerates can also contain significant quantities of REE-bearing heavy minerals (e.g., conglomerate in the Pele Mountain deposit, Ontario).

## 8.2.2 Ionic Clay Deposits

Ionic-clay REE deposits are derived by surficial weathering of REE minerals.  Breakdown of REE minerals releases  REE-bearing  liquid  species  into  the  environment  where  clay  particles  absorb  them.    Several regions in southern China (e.g., Jiangxi Province) and Myanmar (Burma) contain HREE-enriched ionic-clay deposits.  These are mostly derived from REE-enriched, sometimes peralkaline, granites.

## 8.2.3 In Situ Laterites

Surface exposed rocks with REE-bearing mineralization can be upgraded by weathering processes.  Two carbonatite-hosted REE deposits have been upgraded by surface weathering processes.  One is the Bear Lodge Carbonatite (Wyoming) and the other the Araxa Carbonatite (Brazil).  Carbonatites weather easily in surface conditions.

## 8.3 Deep Fox and Foxtrot Deposits

Deep Fox and Foxtrot are examples of primary magmatic REE deposits whereby the mineralization is hosted in peralkaline oversaturated volcanic rocks.  Mineralization occurs mainly in zircon, allanite, and fergusonite disseminated throughout the host peralkaline volcanic units.

## 9.0 EXPLORATION

## 9.1 Summary

Search Minerals began exploration in the St. Lewis and Port Hope Simpson area in 2009, after acquiring 11 mineral licences via an option agreement with B&amp;A.  In the winter of 2009, Search Minerals conducted an  Aeroquest  airborne  radiometric  and  magnetic  survey.    Following  this  survey,  anomalous  areas  of interest were outlined, prioritized, and ground checked during the start of the 2010 field season.  An additional 47 mineral licences were staked, covering 864 km . 2

Since  the  discovery  of  Foxtrot  in  2010,  extensive  exploration  has  been  completed  in  the  Port  Hope Simpson-St. Lewis area for similar styles of mineralization ('Foxtrot-like').  Exploration between 2010 and 2021 consisted of ground and remotely piloted aerial system (RPAS) magnetometer surveys, prospecting, mapping, lithogeochemical grab sampling, clearing, hand trenching, channel sampling with a portable diamond bladed circular saw, and diamond drilling.  Exploration has been conducted across the entire FHVB, with the main area of focus being Deep Fox and Foxtrot, followed by the Fox Meadow prospect. Search Minerals has also identified and carried out exploration work on numerous other prospects within the District.  The work on Foxtrot-like mineral prospects is summarized in Table 9-1.  Figure 9-1 shows the location of the Foxtrot deposit, the Deep Fox deposit, and other exploration prospects within the District.

The detailed exploration program on the Foxtrot property began in 2010, with prospecting and channel sampling.  An extensive channel sampling program commenced in 2010 and continued through 2015, consisting of 36 channels in 2010, 36 channels in 2011, five channels in 2012, two channels in 2014, and 25 channels in 2015.

Drilling was conducted in three phases from 2010 to 2012:

- · Phase I - October 2010 to February 2011 (24 drill holes)
- · Phase II - May 2011 to July 2019 (19 drill holes)
- · Phase III - October 2011 to February 2012 (29 drill holes)

The detailed exploration program on the Deep Fox property commenced in 2014 with detailed mapping and prospecting that led to the discovery channel (FDC-14-01) late in the season.  This discovery was announced in early 2015.  An extensive channel sampling program commenced in 2015 and continued through 2021, consisting  of  16  channels  in  2015,  five  channels  in  2017,  four  channels  in  2018,  three channels in 2019, and one channel in 2021.

Drilling was conducted in three phases from 2017 to 2021:

- · Phase I - November 2017 to August 2018 (15 drill holes)
- · Phase II - October 2018 to November 2018 (eight drill holes)
- · Phase III - June 2021 to August 2021 (38 drill holes)

An RPAS detailed magnetometer survey and RPAS Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) survey was carried out over the Deep Fox property in 2019.

## 9.2 Channel Sampling

Search Minerals began surface channel sampling in the area in 2010 and continued through 2021.  Channel sampling  focused  on  mineralized  outcrops  found  using  visual  inspection  as well as hand-held spectrometers in the area of the Foxtrot deposit, the Deep Fox deposit, and several other Foxtrot-like prospects in the District.

At Deep Fox, Search Minerals collected samples from 39 surface channels, totalling 994 m, in mineralized outcrops from 2014 to 2021, as presented in Figure 9-2.  At Foxtrot, Search Minerals collected samples from 105 surface channels, totalling 1,139 m, in mineralized outcrops from 2010 to 2015, as presented in Figure 9-3.  Channel sampling procedures are discussed in Section 11.  Table 9-2 and Table 9-3 summarize several significant surface channel REE assay intervals taken from Deep Fox and Foxtrot, respectively.

## 9.3 Ground Magnetometer Surveys (2011)

To  better  understand  and  characterize  Foxtrot-like  REE  mineralization  at  surface,  two  ground-based magnetometer surveys were conducted throughout the FHVB during the 2011 field season.  A detailed 25 m line spacing survey was completed over the main mineralized zone at Foxtrot, and a less-detailed 100 m line spacing survey was completed outside of the main mineralized zone of Foxtrot to trace the location of the mineralized units beyond Foxtrot.  These surveys were used to plan diamond drilling and surface channel sampling programs.  The combined ground magnetometer surveys are shown in Figure 9-4.

## 9.4 RPAS Magnetometer and LIDAR Survey (2019)

In 2019 a RPAS magnetometer and LIDAR survey was carried out over the Deep Fox property.  The RPAS magnetometer survey was conducted to accompany the ground magnetometer survey carried out in 2011, and informed subsequent drilling and channelling programs at Deep Fox.  The results of the RPAS magnetometer survey are shown in Figure 9-5.  Concurrently with the magnetometer survey, a LIDAR survey  was  carried  out  over  the  Deep  Fox  property  to  have  a  precise  and  accurate  topographic representation of the area surrounding Deep Fox.

## 9.5 Deep Fox Bulk Sampling

In 2021, Search Minerals completed a bulk sampling program at Deep Fox, collecting 52.9 t of mineralized material  for  further  metallurgical  processing.    The  selected  mineralized  surface  interval  was  channel sampled prior to subsequent drilling and blasting, in order to fully characterize the interval.  Once blasted, mineralized  material  was  placed  in  one-tonne  polypropylene  bulk  material  bags  and  transported  to Springdale Forest Resources crushing facility in Springdale, Newfoundland and Labrador.  The material was then crushed to minus 3', and a lithogeochemical sample was collected from each bulk material bag. Once crushed, the mineralized material was transported to SGS Canada Inc. (SGS) in Lakefield, Ontario, to be used in the Phase I magnetic separation program.

## 9.6 Exploration Potential

Deep Fox currently has a Mineral Resource to 200 m below surface as reported in Section 14 of this Technical Report.  Search plans a 11,000 m program at Deep Fox in 2022 to expand the resource by additional 50 m at depth, down-plunge, and to explore to the east and west along strike.  Geological interpretations indicate that the deposit is open at depth and along strike and there is very good potential to increase the resources.

At Foxtrot, drilling and surface data also indicate that there is very good potential to expand the deposit to the east and west along strike, and at depth.  The current drilling data reaches to 400 m below surface.

Surface channel sampling throughout the FHVB indicate that there are numerous prospects with REE mineralization, thickness, and geology similar to Deep Fox and Foxtrot.  Channel programs executed at Fox Meadow and Silver Fox (Table 9-1) indicate that these prospects have good potential, both of them being considered as drill ready.  Search Minerals plans to drill a 6,000 m drill program at Fox Meadow in 2022.

## 10.0 DRILLING

## 10.1 Deep Fox Drilling

Search Minerals commenced drilling at Deep Fox in 2017.  The drilling area focused on the down dip extent of the mineralization outlined at surface by channels, with a true thickness of up to 45 m, consisting of a package of felsic and mafic bands.  The first three holes were drilled by Cabo Drilling, while Springdale Forest Resources performed the rest of the drilling.

A total of 61 drill holes were completed, with 11,927 m total drilled length.  Search Minerals also collected surface samples from 39 channels with a total length of 993.7 m.

Drill  hole  collar  positions  were  determined  by  Search  Minerals'  senior  geological  personnel  and  were located in the field by a Search Minerals geologist.  Drill holes were initially plotted using ArcGIS, and collar positions were staked using a hand-held global positioning system (GPS) unit.  All drill holes at Deep Fox were surveyed after drilling had been completed to within ±0.60 m GPS positional accuracy, and 0.2° to 1.0° azimuth accuracy.  Coordinates were recorded in UTM format according to the NAD83 datum, and elevations were recorded in metres above sea level (MASL).

All  holes  were  drilled  with  an  appropriate  inclination  to  intercept  a  steeply  dipping  target;  the  collar azimuth and dip were planned and checked by a Search Minerals geologist.  The drill hole was set with an extended foresight from the drill head, and the azimuth of this line direction was measured with a Brunton or Silva type compass.  The drill hole collar dip was set and measured with an inclinometer on the drill rods at the drill head.

Drill hole azimuth and dip measurements at varying depths in each drill hole were checked using a Reflex Gyro down-the-hole probe that uses a digital surface referenced microelectromechanical system (MEMS) gyroscope  designed  for  magnetite  bearing  rocks.    Drill  hole  collar  azimuths,  GPS  coordinates  and elevations were obtained using the Reflex Azimuth Pointing System (APS).

No significant deviation problems occurred during the drill programs at Deep Fox, most holes deviated less than five to ten degrees per 100 m from both azimuth and dip.

The QPs are of the opinion that the drilling procedures meet industry standard and there are no drilling, sampling or recovery factors that could materially impact the accuracy and reliability of the results.

Figure 10-1 displays the drill hole and channel locations at Deep Fox.

## 10.2 Foxtrot Drilling

Search Minerals started exploration drilling at the Foxtrot Project in 2010.  The drilling focused on the thicker portion of the pantelleritic mineralization, which is approximately 10 m to 25 m in true width. Three drilling phases were completed at Foxtrot.  Two drilling campaigns were awarded to Springdale Forest Resources of Springdale, Newfoundland and Labrador, and one campaign to Logan Drilling Group of Stewiacke, Nova Scotia.

A total of 72 drill holes were completed during the three drilling phases, with 18,616.6 m total drilled length.  Search Minerals also collected surface samples from 24 channels with a total length of 486 m.

Drill  hole  collar  positions  were  determined  by  Search  Minerals'  senior  geological  personnel  and  were located in the field by a Search Minerals geologist.  Drill holes were initially plotted using ArcGIS, and collar positions were staked using a hand-held global positioning system (GPS) unit.  All Foxtrot drill holes were surveyed after drilling had been completed to within ±0.60 m GPS positional accuracy, and 0.2° to 1.0° azimuth  accuracy.    Coordinates  were  recorded  in  UTM  format  according  to  the  NAD83  datum,  and elevations were recorded in metres above sea level.

All  holes  were  drilled  with  an  appropriate  inclination  to  intercept  a  steeply  dipping  target;  the  collar azimuth and dip were planned and checked by a Search Minerals geologist.  The drill hole was set with an extended foresight from the drill head, and the azimuth of this line direction was measured with a Brunton or Silva type compass.  The drill hole collar dip was set and measured with an inclinometer on the drill rods at the drill head.  No serious deviation problems have been encountered, with most holes deviating less than 5° to 10° per 100 m from both azimuth and dip.

The QPs are of the opinion that the drilling procedures meet industry standard and there are no drilling, sampling or recovery factors that could materially impact the accuracy and reliability of the results.

## 11.0 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES, AND SECURITY

## 11.1 Deep Fox Sample Preparation and Analysis

## 11.1.1 Sampling and Sample Preparation

Two sampling methods have been used at Deep Fox: diamond drilling and surface channel sampling. Drilling on the Project occurred in 2017, 2018, and 2021, whilst channel sampling was undertaken in 2014, 2015, 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2021.

All sample preparation and core logging were carried out at the Search Minerals field house, which is located in St. Lewis, approximately 10 minutes by truck from the Deep Fox field area.  Drilling, core logging, and  sampling  operations  were  supervised  by  Dr.  Randy  Miller,  P.Geo.,  VP  of  Exploration  for  Search Minerals.

The drilling,  logging,  and  sampling  procedures at Deep Fox are similar to those used at Foxtrot.  The procedures were previously reviewed by SLR and SLR's contractor Benchmark Six Inc. (Benchmark Six) during site visits to Foxtrot in 2011, and by SLR in 2015 (Ms. Masun) and 2021 (Mr. Ciuculescu).  The procedures are summarized below.  The quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) protocols, procedures for ensuring the security of drill core and channel samples, integrity of chain-of-custody for samples, and accuracy of laboratory analyses all met acceptable industry practices.

## 11.1.1.1 Diamond Drill Core

Diamond drill core was placed into standard wooden core boxes and stacked at the drill site.  Core boxes were transported by pick-up truck from the field area to the field house at least once a day where they were organized onto racks in the core storage facility.  Geologists log the core and mark assay sample intervals with wax crayon.  Intervals averaged one metre but were longer or shorter, at the discretion of the geologist, depending on the structural and lithological features present.  In 2017 and 2018, drill core was logged manually, and the logs were subsequently entered into a digital database by Search Minerals staff.  All original paper drill logs are kept on file.  In 2021 drill core was logged into MX Deposit, a digital drill logging database.

The drill core was split using the marked assay intervals; all splitting was done using a circular saw with a diamond tip blade.  One half of the core was placed in a sample bag and sent to the laboratory for chemical analysis and the other half remains in the core box for future reference.  For each interval, one sample tag was placed in the sample bag and another sample tag was stapled to the bottom of the core box, under the core.  After the core had been split and sampled, the remaining core was placed back into core boxes and kept in the core storage facility.  All stored core boxes are affixed with an aluminum plate indicating the hole ID and the Interval contained within.  A list was made of all sample numbers and their corresponding hole ID, and from-to (interval) depths.

A selected piece from each mineralized and selected non-mineralized sample interval from the Deep Fox core was tested for magnetic susceptibility and density.  The magnetic susceptibility measurements were taken with a portable instrument.  Density measurements were determined with the standard gravimetric procedure that involves measuring samples on a scale in air and immersed in water.

The drill rig used during the 2017, 2018, and 2021 sampling programs was a Dura-lite 500 mounted on a tracked carrier and was operated by Springdale Forest Resources.  All core drilled during the Deep Fox sampling programs was NQ (47.6 mm) size.

## 11.1.1.2 Channel Samples

Channel samples were taken from mineralized surface outcrop found using visual inspection as well as hand-held spectrometers.  The location of channel sampling was partly dictated by the location of surface outcrop.  A hand-held GPS unit was used for precise location control.  Channel samples, 10 cm deep and 8 cm wide, were cut by gas-powered diamond-bladed saw from cleaned outcrops, surface weathering is removed, channel cut into two pieces, and placed into channel boxes to be logged and sampled by Search Minerals personnel (Figure 11-1).  Six centimetre thick sections were sent to the assay laboratory and a two centimetre thick section was stored in channel boxes for reference (Figure 11-2).  The channels were cut perpendicular to strike, pieced together, logged, measured, and photographed to produce geological and geochemical sections.

Channel samples were logged, cut, and sampled according to the same procedure as the diamond drill core, described above.

## 11.1.2 Sample Analyses

Deep Fox sample bags were collected in large plastic bags, placed on a pallet, and wrapped with plastic film for transport by Search Minerals staff to Morneau trucking company in Goose Bay.  This trucking company transported these sample pallets to Activation Laboratories Ltd. (ActLabs) in Ancaster, Ontario, for  sample  preparation and analysis.  Samples were analyzed using a lithium metaborate/tetraborate fusion with subsequent analysis by inductively coupled plasma (ICP) and ICP mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS).

ActLabs is an independent laboratory accredited according to both the ISO 17025 standard for testing and calibration laboratories, and the CAN-P-1579 standard, specific to mineral analysis laboratories.  In 2007, ActLabs became accredited to NELAP, an American laboratory accreditation program specifically for the environmental sector.

## 11.1.3 Sample Security

Search Minerals employs strict security protocols with the handling of its samples.  Core is transported by truck only, both from the drill site to the field house and from the field house to the trucking company in Goose Bay.  The core is stored in the core storage facility, part of the Search Minerals' field office (Figure 5-1) with doors and locks, and is organized carefully, facilitating accessibility to all reference core.  During logging, cutting, and sampling, drill core is always under the supervision of full-time Search Minerals staff.

In the QPs' opinion, the sample preparation, analysis, and security procedures at Deep Fox are adequate for use in the estimation of Mineral Resources.

## 11.1.4 Quality Assurance and Quality Control 2015 to 2018

Search Minerals implemented an assay QA/QC monitoring program since the beginning of the exploration activity at Deep Fox and Foxtrot.  The QA/QC samples assay data is presented and discussed at length in the Roscoe Postle Associates Inc. (RPA) 2016 report.  A summary is presented below.

## 11.1.4.1 ActLabs Internal QA/QC

Search Minerals instructed ActLabs to introduce in the sample stream three types of samples to monitor the accuracy and precision of their results: standards, blanks, and duplicates.

The QPs reviewed the blanks and standards data and found that nearly 100% of the results were within ±10% of their certified value, which is generally accepted as a good result.  The duplicate assays returned results within the expected limits.

## 11.1.4.2 Search Minerals External QA/QC

All Search Minerals external QA/QC samples were inserted by ActLabs, using the following protocol:

- · Blanks and standards were inserted in each batch after the 15 th or 35 th sample, and every 40 th sample thereafter.
- · Coarse duplicates were taken every 20 th sample per batch.
- · Pulp duplicates were taken at a rate of approximately 10%.

Table 11-1 summarizes the insertion rate of QA/QC samples for all work completed on Deep Fox from 2015 to 2018.

Table 11-1: Insertion Rates of QA/QC Samples Search Minerals Inc. -Deep Fox and Foxtrot Project

| QA/QC Sample Type   | Insertion Rate   |
|---------------------|------------------|
| Blanks              | 2.5%1            |
| Standards           | 2.5%             |
| Coarse Duplicates   | 5%               |
| Pulp Duplicates     | 10%              |

Note:

## 11.1.4.2.1 Blanks

Blank samples comprised of crushed, pulverized, and homogenized quartz were inserted into the sample stream by ActLabs.  A total of 101 blank samples were included in 31 batches, with an insertion rate of approximately 2.5%.

## 11.1.4.2.2 Reference Standards

Search Minerals inserted two standards in each batch:  one high grade, sourced from another Search Minerals' REE project in the Fox Harbour area, and one unmineralized natural blank, sourced from an anorthosite unit found in the Port Hope Simpson area.

<!-- image -->

## 11.1.4.2.3 Duplicates

Search Minerals inserted both reject coarse duplicates (coarse duplicates), which were taken immediately after the first crushing and splitting step, and pulp duplicates, which are second splits of final prepared pulverized samples.  The coarse and pulp duplicate samples were taken by the laboratory at the request of Search Minerals at a rate of approximately 5% and 10%, respectively.

## 11.1.4.2.4 QPs Opinion

The QPs have reviewed the results of the 2015-2018 QA/QC programs and are of the opinion that the results are suitable to support the estimation of Mineral Resources.

## 11.1.5 Quality Assurance and Quality Control Summary 2021

During the 2021 campaign, Search Minerals continued monitoring the performance of the assay results by regular submission of QA/QC material to the assay laboratory.  Search Minerals utilized three internal standards,  low  grade  (419491)  equivalent  to  blank  values,  medium  grade  (419492),  and  high  grade (419493), and one CRM (REE-3), which were regularly added to the sample stream.  The QA/QC material was inserted by the laboratory, and by Search Minerals before shipping the samples to the laboratory. Table 11-2 presents the samples assayed in 2021, including field samples and QA/QC material.

Table 11-2: Assayed Samples in 2021 Campaign Search Minerals Inc. - Deep Fox and Foxtrot Project

| Sample Type                    | Count   | Percent of Total   |
|--------------------------------|---------|--------------------|
| Field samples                  | 4,635   | 85%                |
| Standard 419491 (blank grades) | 126     | 2%                 |
| Standard 419492                | 110     | 2%                 |
| Standard 419493                | 96      | 2%                 |
| REE-3                          | 38      | 1%                 |
| Pulp replicates                | 213     | 4%                 |
| Coarse reject duplicates       | 205     | 4%                 |
| Total                          | 5,423   | 100%               |

Sample 419491 was inserted as an internal blank standard and processed as a field sample for the 2021 drill  program.  SLR notes that no external coarse blanks were used in 2021.  Blank material is usually inserted in the sample stream as coarse material, with the expectation for it to be processed as a field sample,  thus  monitoring  contamination  levels  during  sample  processing,  as  well  as  tracking  labelling errors or sample switching.

SLR  notes  that  Search  Minerals  did  not  submit  pulp  replicate  samples  for  assaying  at  a  secondary laboratory.  While Search Minerals attempted to engage third party laboratories for replicate assaying due to COVID-19 and other challenges it was unable to engage a laboratory in 2021 for a small sample batch.    Pulp  replicate  samples  have  been  collected  (2022)  and  are  being  assayed  by  two  third  party laboratories.

<!-- image -->

QA/QC samples were inserted into the sample stream by both Search Minerals and ActLabs.  Search Minerals' QA/QC protocol involved the insertion of four standards per drill hole (419491, 419492, 419493, and CRM REE-3) directly into the sample stream, one of each standard per drill hole.  Search Minerals advised ActLabs to utilize the following QA/QC insertion protocol:

- · Coarse duplicates were taken approximately every 20 th sample per batch, with an average of 1 in 23.
- · Pulp duplicates were taken at a rate of approximately every 20 th sample, resulting in a 1 in 23 average.

The internal standards developed by Search Mineral have an acceptable behaviour.  Figure 11-3 shows the  overall  performance  of  the  Pr,  Nd,  Tb,  and  Dy  assay  results.    While  Pr,  Tb,  and  Dy  have  a  good behaviour, Nd values have a wide spread and may not be reliable for detecting trends or deviations from the nominal value.

The duplicate samples are well behaved, with both pulps (Figure 11-4) and coarse rejects (Figure 11-5) generally withing +/-10%.  The coarse rejects display noisier aspect at lower grades, which is normal.

Figure 11-5:

It  is  the  opinion  of  the  QPs  that  Search  Minerals'  QA/QC  data  for  the  drilling  and  channel  sampling programs  at  Deep  Fox  are  acceptable  and  demonstrate  that  the  assay  data  have  the  accuracy  and precision adequate for Mineral Resource estimation.

## The QPs recommend the following:

- 1. Use multiple CRMs (typically recommended low, medium, and high grade), with at least one at grades similar to typical REE mineralization and a second one with grades similar to the deposit high grade.  The QPs also recommends that a third standard with grades typical of mineralization at  or  near  the  cut-off  grade  be  considered.    This  would  help  identify  any  systematic  bias  or uncertainty in the laboratory results.  Due to the scarcity of reliable REE CRMs, Search Minerals should work with analytical laboratories to develop additional standards through round robin testing.  REE-3 was developed by CanMet using material from Foxtrot.

<!-- image -->

- 2. Resume  the  regular  submission  of  coarse  blank  material  with  regular  drill  core  and  surface channel samples.
- 3. Include selected half core samples (field duplicates) in a check assay sampling protocol.
- 4. Review the analytical laboratory's internal and Search Minerals' field QC results for each sample batch submitted.
- 5. Revisit the failure criteria and follow-up actions.

## 11.2 Foxtrot Sample Preparation and Analysis

## 11.2.1 Sampling and Sample Preparation

Two sampling methods have been used at Foxtrot: diamond drilling and  channel sampling.    No  new drilling, however, has occurred on the Project since 2012.

All sample preparation and core logging were carried out at the Search Minerals field house, which was located in Port Hope Simpson, approximately 45 minutes by truck from the Foxtrot field area.  Drilling, core logging, and sampling operations were supervised by Dr. Randy Miller, P.Geo., VP of Exploration for Search Minerals.

All drilling, logging, and sampling procedures were reviewed by Benchmark Six and RPA (a predecessor company to SLR) during their site visit in 2011 (RPA, 2013).  The QA/QC protocols, procedures for ensuring the security of drill core and channel samples, integrity of chain-of-custody for samples, and accuracy of laboratory analyses all met acceptable industry practices.

## 11.2.1.1 Diamond Drill Core

Diamond drill core was placed into standard wooden core boxes and stacked at the drill site.  Core boxes were transported by pick-up truck from the field area to the field house at least once a day where they were organized onto racks in the core shed.  Geologists log the core and mark assay sample intervals with wax crayon.  Intervals averaged one metre but were longer or shorter, at the discretion of the geologist, depending on the structural and lithological features present.  Drill core was logged manually and the logs were subsequently entered into a digital database by Search Minerals staff.  All original paper drill logs are kept on file.

The core was split by technicians according to the marked assay intervals; all splitting was done using a circular saw with a diamond tip blade.  One half of the core was placed in a sample bag and sent to the laboratory for chemical analyses and the other half remains in the core box for future reference.  For each interval, one sample tag was placed in the sample bag and another sample tag was stapled to the bottom of the core box, under the core.  After the core had been split and sampled, the remaining core was placed back into core boxes and kept in the core shed, currently stored in Search Minerals' core storage facility in  St.  Lewis.    All  stored  core  boxes  are  affixed  with  an  aluminum plate indicating the hole ID and the interval contained within.  A list was made of all sample numbers and their corresponding hole ID, and from-to depths.

The drill rig used during the 2010 sampling program was a Dura-lite 500 and was operated by Springdale Forest Resources.  The 2011 sampling program made use of two different drill rigs: a Longyear Super 38 that was fully enclosed and mounted on skids as well as a Longyear Fly 38 that was not enclosed, also mounted on skids and was suitable to be moved by helicopter.  These two drill rigs were operated by Logan Drilling Group.  All core drilled during the 2010 and 2011 sampling programs was NQ size.

## 11.2.1.2 Channel Samples

Channel samples were taken from mineralized surface outcrop found using visual inspection as well as hand-held spectrometers.  The location of channel sampling was partly dictated by the location of surface outcrop.  A hand-held GPS unit was used for precise location control.  Channel samples, 10 cm deep and 8 cm wide, were cut by gas-powered diamond-bladed saw from cleaned outcrops (surface weathering is removed)  and  placed  into  channel  boxes  to  be  logged  and  sampled  for  assay  by  Search  Minerals personnel.  Six centimetre sections were sent to the assay laboratory and a two centimetre section was stored in channel boxes for reference.  The channels were cut perpendicular to strike, pieced together, logged, and photographed to produce geological and geochemical sections.

Channel  samples  were  logged,  cut,  measured,  and  sampled  according  to  the  same  procedure  as  the diamond drill core, described above.

## 11.2.2 Sample Analyses

Sample bags were transported by Search Minerals staff to ActLabs in Goose Bay, Labrador, where they were crushed to a minus 10 mesh, riffle split to obtain a representative sample, pulverized to at least 95% passing minus 150 mesh, and then sent to ActLabs Ancaster, Ontario for analysis.  Samples were analyzed using a lithium metaborate/tetraborate fusion with subsequent analysis by ICP and ICP-MS.

ActLabs is an independent laboratory accredited according to both the ISO 17025 standard for testing and calibration laboratories, and the CAN-P-1579 standard, specific to mineral analysis laboratories.  In 2007, ActLabs became accredited to NELAP, an American laboratory accreditation program specifically for the environmental sector.

## 11.2.3 Sample Security

Search Minerals employs strict security protocols with the handling of its samples.  Core is transported by truck only, both from the drill site to the field house and from the field house to the laboratory in Goose Bay.  The core was stored in the core shed, currently stored in Search Minerals' core storage facility in St. Lewis, a detached structure with doors and locks, and is organized carefully, facilitating accessibility to all reference core.  During logging, cutting, and sampling, drill core is always under the supervision of fulltime Search Minerals staff.

## 11.2.4 Quality Assurance and Quality Control

## 11.2.4.1 ActLabs Internal QA/QC

The resource estimate included in this Technical Report incorporates analytical results from 69 batches that were submitted to ActLabs from November 2010 to August 2011, six batches from 2012 to 2014, and one batch in 2015.  With each batch, ActLabs used three types of samples to monitor the accuracy and precision of their results: standards, blanks, and duplicates.

The standards allow the laboratory to monitor the accuracy of their results.  There was a total of 22 different standards that were used to test the accuracy of the REE data and no one standard alone covered the complete set of potentially economic elements.  Fifteen of these standards monitored Pr, Nd, or Dy, the most important Foxtrot REEs.  RPA reviewed the results of the various certified reference materials (CRMs) subsequent to the 2013 PEA Update (RPA, 2013), and all Pr and Nd results fell within ±10% of their certified value and more than 98% of the Dy results were within ±10% of their certified value.  While this

is  generally  accepted  as  a  good  result,  the  QPs  recommend  that  Search  Minerals  review  the  internal standards of the laboratories, failure criteria, and re-assay procedure for batches that do not meet preset passing conditions.

Blank control samples allow the laboratory to monitor cross contamination between the samples.  While contamination can occur during the sample preparation and analysis stages, these blank control samples were limited to monitoring only the analysis stage.  It is normal industry practice to reject any batch whose results are more than five times the detection limit.  Of the 113 blanks tested, including nine subsequent to the 2012 PEA update, no blank control sample had more than twice the detection limit.  In the QP's opinion, cross contamination was not an issue for analyses at Foxtrot.

Duplicates allow the laboratory to monitor precision of its analytical results.  As with standards, it is normal industry practice to accept batches if 95% of duplicate samples fall within ±10% of their average.  In the 69 batches analyzed in 2010 and 2011, 98.8% of internal duplicate assays for Dy and Nd fell within the ±10% band.  Subsequent to the 2013 PEA, 33 duplicate pairs from seven batches were analyzed by the laboratory, and the internal duplicate assay results for Pr, Nd, and Dy were within acceptable limits.  All Pr and Nd duplicate assays fell within ±10% of their average, and 97% of Dy internal duplicates fell within ±10% of their average.

In the QPs' opinion, the internal QA/QC results demonstrate that the assay data have acceptable accuracy and precision.

The QPs recommend that Search Minerals review the laboratory's internal QA/QC results and that batches that do not meet pre-set protocols be re-assayed.

## 11.2.4.2 Search Minerals External QA/QC

In addition to ActLabs' internal QA/QC efforts, the reliability of the analytical data was also monitored by Search Minerals' own external QA/QC program, using reference standards and pulp duplicates.  Rather than using CRMs, Search Minerals used material sourced locally for which no certified value had been established by round-robin analyses from multiple laboratories.  In this case, the average of all available results was used as the reference value and percent error was calculated.

2010 to 2011: Phase I and II

In Phase I and II of work at Foxtrot, Search Minerals used two high grade standards and one low grade standard chosen to effectively act as a blank to monitor possible contamination.  The two high grade standards  include  one  from  a  eudialyte-rich  zone  in  one  of  Search  Minerals'  other  REE  projects  in Labrador, a peralkaline complex known as 'Red Wine' (RW), and one from a mineralized felsic volcanic gneiss  unit  found  in  Fox  Harbour  (FHG).    The  third  standard,  a  very  low  grade  standard,  is  from  an anorthosite unit also found in Port Hope Simpson area (FHA).

The material for each standard was delivered to ActLabs in bulk and ActLabs was instructed to crush, pulverize,  homogenize,  store,  and  insert  pulp  reference  standards  into  the  sample  sequence  during sample preparation.  Throughout the 2010 drilling program, laboratory staff inserted one pulp reference standard every 50 samples, however, this procedure was changed in 2011 to include at least one standard with every batch to account for smaller batches of less than 50 samples where standards were previously not being included.

The vast majority of results for the RW and FHG standards plot within the ±10% range.  The results for FHA, the very low-grade standard, were not within ±10% of the average value but rather ranged from 50% to 150%, which is an acceptable range for a blank control sample.  Due to the nature of the sample

used, the values for each of the elements were very close to detection limit.  Figure 11-6 presents the percent error of Dy and Nd for the high grade RW and FHG standards only.

Date

Search Minerals' implementation of duplicate samples as part of its QA/QC program was similar to that of the standards.  ActLabs was instructed to duplicate every 25 th sample and report the results as the original sample number appended with a 'B' in the Certificate of Analysis.

In all, there were 167 samples duplicated in the 69 batches.  Of these, only six samples, or less than 4%, did not fall within a ±10% band.  Figure 11-7 shows the percent difference of Dy and Nd of the sample duplicates.

## 11.2.4.2.1 2012: Phase III QA/QC

The Phase III drilling campaign at Foxtrot used a QA/QC program similar to the one described above for Phases I and II.  In addition to the internal QA/QC checks performed by ActLabs, Search Minerals included reference material in most batches.  Three batches of reference material were used, and all three were usually submitted together.  One essentially functioned as a blank, with very low REE concentrations (Dy&lt;1 ppm, Nd&lt;10 ppm).  The other two served as high grade reference material that enabled monitoring of the laboratory's ability to accurately assay samples with strong REE mineralization.  One of these had Dy grades of approximately 300 ppm and Nd grades of approximately 2,400 ppm; the other had Dy grades of approximately  700  ppm  and  Nd  grades  of  approximately  2,000  ppm.    Although  there  was  no  preestablished reference value for these external reference materials, they do document that the laboratory was able to stay within ±10% of the average grade.  SLR notes that the external reference material had Dy and  Nd  grades  that  are  higher  than  typical  mineralization  at  Foxtrot,  where  most  of  the  strong mineralization is 200 ppm to 250 ppm Dy and 1,000 ppm to 2,000 ppm Nd.

The QA/QC program for the Phase III samples included duplicates inserted as described for Phase I and II, that  is,  typically  one  or  two  in  each  batch  of  samples  submitted  to  the  laboratory.    These  duplicates confirm the precision of the laboratory's analytical results.  More than 90% of the duplicates produced REE assays within ±10% of the original assay.

## 11.2.4.2.2 2012 to 2014: Channel Sample QA/QC

Channel samples were collected at Foxtrot in late 2012 and 2014 and were submitted to the laboratory in six batches.

Search Minerals included two different grades of reference material that were submitted in pairs, in two of the six batches.  The very low grade reference standard served essentially as a blank sample, and the higher grade reference standard had REE values similar to the highest grades found at Foxtrot.  The low grade reference standard had Dy grades of less than 1 ppm and Nd grades of approximately 7 ppm.  The high grade reference standard had Dy grades of approximately 300 ppm and Nd grades of approximately 2,400 ppm.  These reference standards were sourced from the same material as one of the high grade reference samples used in Phase III.

As  with  Phase  III,  no  certified  value  had  been  established  by  round-robin  analyses  from  multiple laboratories for the standards and the average of all available results was used as the reference value. SLR reviewed the results, and Dy and Nd assay results for both reference standards were within acceptable limits.

ActLabs  was  instructed  to  duplicate  every  25 th sample  and  report  the  results  as  the  original  sample number appended with a 'B' in the Certificate of Analysis.  Four sets of duplicates were analyzed from four batches.  Two batches did not include duplicate sample analyses.

SLR reviewed the QC program results and noted that the reference standard assay results were within appropriate limits and that all Nd and Dy duplicate analyses fell within a ±5% band.

SLR  considers  the  reference  standards  and  duplicate  results  for  the  2012  and  2014  Foxtrot  program acceptable.

## 11.2.4.2.3 2015: Channel Sampling QA/QC

All channel samples taken in 2015 at Foxtrot were submitted to the laboratory as a single batch.  This fifth phase of work at Foxtrot used a QA/QC program similar to the one described for 2012-2014, however, no duplicate pulp samples were submitted for analysis.  Search Minerals included two different grades of reference material, but the source of the reference standards was not the same as previous phases of work.  The very low grade reference standard served essentially as a blank sample, and the higher grade reference standard included a high grade source of material, with REE values similar to the highest grades found at Foxtrot.  The low grade reference standard had Dy grades of less than 0.5 ppm and Nd grades of approximately 3 ppm.  The high grade reference standard had Dy grades of approximately 265 ppm and Nd grades of approximately 2,100 ppm, similar to high grade mineralization at Foxtrot.  SLR recommends including a reference standard that has a similar grade to typical Foxtrot mineralization.

In total, 14 reference standards were included in the 2015 batch: seven low grade and seven high grade. As with previous phases of work, no certified value had been established by round-robin analyses from multiple laboratories for the reference standards and the average of all available results was used as the reference value from which a percent error was calculated.  Figure 11-8 and Figure 11-9 illustrate the analytical results of the reference standards.  The results for the high grade reference standard are all within  ±5%  of  the  average  and  although  there  is  some  degree  of  spread  in  the  low  grade  reference standard results, the grades are near detection limit and the results are within an acceptable range.

## 11.2.5 QA/QC Summary

The QPs are of the opinion that Search Minerals' QA/QC data for drilling and channel sampling programs are acceptable and demonstrate that the assay data have the accuracy and precision for Mineral Resource estimation.

The QPs recommend that:

- 1. For future sampling programs at Foxtrot, Search Minerals work with the analytical laboratory to develop CRM through round robin testing for which the grade has been established prior to its use.    Although  three  difference  certified  reference  standards  are  recommended,  at  least  one should  have  grades  similar  to  typical  REE  mineralization  at  Foxtrot  and  another  should  have approximately  the  same  grade  as  high  grade  mineralization.    This  would  help  identify  any systematic bias or uncertainty in the laboratory results.
- 2. Certified reference standards be included with each batch, and for large batches, at a 1/20 rate of insertion.
- 3. Preparation duplicate samples be included with each batch submitted to the laboratory, and for large batches, at a 1/20 rate of insertion.
- 4. Coarse, hard 'blank' samples be incorporated prior to the analytical stream.
- 5. The analytical laboratory's internal and Search Minerals' field QC results be reviewed for each sample batch submitted.
- 6. Search  Minerals  establish  what  constitutes  a  QC  failure  and  document  appropriate  follow-up actions.

## 12.0 DATA VERIFICATION

SLR reviewed the resource database that formed the basis for the Mineral Resource estimates presented in this Technical Report.  This includes results from the QA/QC program and assay certificates for drill hole and channel samples to a cut-off date of November 30, 2021.  In the opinion of the QPs, the database is acceptable for Mineral Resource estimation.

## 12.1 Site Visits

Tudorel Ciuculescu, P.Geo., SLR Consulting Geologist, visited the Search Minerals premises in St. Lewis, Newfoundland  and  Labrador,  Deep  Fox,  and  Foxtrot  from  November  9  to  November  12,  2021. Mr. Ciuculescu toured the office space, core logging and storage area, and core cutting shack.  At the time of the visit, no logging or sampling activities were being conducted on the Foxtrot property.  The location of drilling collars and channel start and end points were checked with a handheld GPS.  Mr. Ciuculescu did not collect check samples during the site visit.

Katharine M. Masun, M.Sc., MSA, P.Geo., SLR Consulting Geologist, visited the site on August 27, 2015. The site visit consisted of a complete tour of the premises, including the field office, core logging shack, core cutting shack, and core storage facilities.  No logging, cutting, or sampling was occurring on the Project at the time, so the procedures could not be observed first hand.  The Property visit, which focused on Foxtrot, included a tour of Deep Fox.  Ms. Masun inspected surface mineralization along most of the strike length, including the location of the 2014 and 2015 channel sampling at Deep Fox.  Several old drill hole  collars  were  observed  at  Foxtrot,  which  were  well  marked  with  drill  casing  and  capped  with  an aluminum tag marked with the hole ID.

Field sampling procedures were verified by RPA and Rick Breger of Benchmark Six during a site visit to both the field house and Foxtrot site in October 2011.  Field sampling procedures have not been modified for Deep Fox.  During the visit, logging, cutting of core, and sampling procedures were observed first hand and the site visit included observations of surface mineralization, including the location of the trenching and old drill hole collars.  Both RPA and Benchmark Six concluded that Search Minerals staff conducted their exploration and drilling activities to a standard that met or exceeded normal industry practices (RPA, 2013 and 2016).

## 12.2 Database Verification

SLR received the Deep Fox and Foxtrot resource databases as csv files.  Collar, survey, lithology, assay, and density  data  were  reviewed.    Database  verification  was  performed  using  tools  provided  within  the Leapfrog Geo software and Microsoft Excel to check for potential issues including:

- · Sample length and overlap issues
- · Maximum and minimum lengths and assay grades
- · Negative assay values
- · Drill hole deviations
- · Gaps in assays/unsampled intervals
- · Assay and density outliers

<!-- image -->

SLR verified that the drill hole database matched the original assay certificates.  The resource database content  was  compared  against  independently  compiled  laboratory  certificates  of  analysis.    No inconsistencies were identified.

A  visual  check  of  the  drill  hole  collar  elevations  and  drill  hole  traces  with  respect  to  the  updated topographic surface was completed.  A similar exercise was conducted for channels, which have a less accurate location information.  Currently, channel location data does not allow draping the channels along the sloping topographical surface, hence the channels appear above or below the topography; however, this does not affect the geological interpretation and the channel data.  The drilling deviation survey was reviewed, and no sudden bends or kinks were observed.

## 12.3 Independent Assays of Drill Core

SLR did not collect samples from channels for independent assay during the 2015 or 2021 site visits.

In 2011, Rick Breger, Director of Operations for Benchmark Six, on behalf of RPA, collected 28 Foxtrot samples (22 drill core and 6 channel samples) for independent analyses at SGS in Toronto.  REE analyses were  performed  using  lithium  metaborate  fusion  and  analyzed  via  ICP-MS.    SGS  uses  a  quality management system that meets, at a minimum, the requirements for both ISO 9001 and ISO 17025. Analyses  were  performed  on  the  22  drill  core  samples  to  check  the  accuracy  of  the  REE  analyses performed by ActLabs, and all  28  samples  were  used  to  determine  density.    The  REE  check  samples included  were  chosen  according  to  the  distribution  of  Dy  seen  on  the  Project  across  the  three  main lithological units, and ranged in Dy grade from 2.3 ppm to 360 ppm.  Quality control samples were also collected on two Search Minerals' pulp reference standards.

The agreement between analyses for Dy and Nd was shown to be acceptable and confirmed the presence of significant REE mineralization in the samples.  Samples were collected from the three major lithological units on Foxtrot, and the average bulk density measurements were used for resource estimation (RPA, 2013).

As mineralization at Deep Fox is Foxtrot-like, in the opinion of the QPs, the independent sample check noted above is relevant for Deep Fox as well.

The QPs are of the opinion that database verification procedures comply with industry standards and are adequate for the purposes of Mineral Resource estimation.

## 13.0 MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING

Dr.  David  Dreisinger,  Director  &amp;  Vice  President  Metallurgy  of  Search  Minerals,  provided  SLR  with  all available  metallurgical  test  reports  and  a  summary  of  the  test  work  that  supports  the  design  of  the proposed primary and hydrometallurgical plants.  After review of the test reports and summary, the QP made  minor  modifications to  the  summary  as  provided.    The  resulting  text  forms  Section  13  of  this Technical Report.  SLR has provided a commentary at the end of this section

In addition, recent work has focused on bench and pilot plant magnetic separation along with mineralogy on Deep Fox under Project 13004-07.  The bench testing work is complete but the pilot plant separation is still in progress and a report will only be issued upon completion of the work.

## 13.2 Mineralogy Studies - Foxtrot

A metallurgical sample obtained from a Foxtrot channel sample was submitted to SGS.  The sample was stage crushed to K80 of 150 μm (80% passing 150 µm) , then screened into two size fractions: +38 μm and -38 μm for the mineralogical study, and submitted for QEMSCAN analysis.

The minerals identified in the sample are listed in Table 13-2.

## 13.2.1 Mineral  Abundance

Figure 13-1 illustrates the normalized mass % of the REE minerals (excluding zircon).  It is apparent that allanite is the primary REE phase.  The sample is dominated by quartz (35.8%) and K-feldspar (21.0%), moderate amounts of amphibole/pyroxene (13.7%), plagioclase (12.3%), minor Fe-oxides (4.4%), biotite (3.9%) and muscovite/clays (1.6%), and trace amounts of other silicates, carbonates, fluorite, other oxides, and sulphides.  REE-Zr minerals include mainly allanite (2.6%), zircon (2.5%), chevkinite (0.3%), fergusonite (0.2%), bastnaesite/synchysite (0.1%), monazite (0.1%), and rare columbite.  Most of the allanite (2.2%) occurs in the +38 μm, but most of zircon (1.5%) in the -3 8 μm fraction.

## 13.2.4 Liberation and Association

The liberation and association characteristics of allanite, fergusonite, bastnaesite/synchysite, monazite, chevkinite, and zircon were examined.

- · Free and liberated allanite account for 66.8%.  The main association of allanite is as complex particles (25.8%), and minor middlings with zircon (3.8%) and quartz/feldspars (1.6%), and trace associations (&lt;1%) with other minerals.  Free and liberated allanite increases from 59.1% to 86.0% with decreasing size, while complex particles decrease from 33.4% in t he +38 µm to 6.7% in the -38 µm   fraction.
- · Free and liberated fergusonite accounts for 31.4%.  The main association of fergusonite is as complex particles (30.8%), followed by middlings with zircon (21.4%), quartz/feldspars (11.4%), and less with allanite (1.6%) and other silicates (1.5%), while other associations are insignificant (&lt;1%). Liberation increases from 12.5% in the +38 µm fraction to 42.6% in the  38 µm fraction. -Complex particles decrease from 48.5% to 20.3%, with quartz/feldspars from 26.2% to 2.6%, but those with zircon increase from 8.9% to 28.8%.

## 13.2.5 Beneficiation of Ground Foxtrot Sample (2012)

SGS studied three beneficiation techniques during the 2012 programs in an attempt to concentrate the REE in the Foxtrot sample.

Gravity concentration of the REE minerals with magnetic separation to remove magnetite recovered 71% of the Ce, 71% of the Nd, and 71% of the Y into a concentrate amounting to 22% of the mass of feed to the test.

In an attempt to improve overall recovery, the gravity tailings were subjected to flotation processing.  As expected, the flotation process improved the overall REE recovery, however, the mass of concentrate increased  significantly.    Specifically,  the  combined  gravity-magnetic  separation-flotation  flowsheet recovered 83% of the Ce, 83% of the Nd, and 84% of the Y into a concentrate amounting to 35% of the mass of feed to the test.

Flotation testing on a head sample produced a concentrate containing 71% of the Ce, 74% of the Nd, and 82% of the Y in a concentrate with a mass of 27% of the feed mass.

## 13.2.6 Hydrometallurgical Extraction of REE from Foxtrot Concentrate

## 13.2.6.1 Leaching

The concentrates from the gravity concentration and the combined gravity/flotation tests were subjected to acid leaching (tests AL1 and AL2) or acid baking at 200°C to 250°C followed by water leaching (test WLAB1 to WL-AB9).  The results of the testing are summarized in Figure 13-3.

Source: RPA, 2013

As illustrated in Figure 13-3, direct acid leaching of the concentrate is quite successful for the magnet making elements (Nd/Pr/Dy/Tb) but becomes progressively less effective with the heavier REE.

It was observed that Zr extraction in all acid leach and acid bake tests was essentially zero.  Nb extraction varied from approximately 4% to 18% depending on detailed test conditions.  Acid additions were liberal at 250 kg/t to 1,000 kg/t of concentrate.

Early work was performed on metal recovery by direct oxalate addition after pH adjustment (to 3.0) to remove Fe/Al.  The precipitation of REEs was approaching 100% but the product still contained U and Th and would not be suitable for separation by conventional solvent extraction methods.  The losses of REEs in the beneficiation step and the low purity of the REE product (oxalate) were then addressed by the development of the Search Minerals Direct Extraction Process.

## 13.2.6.2 Direct Extraction Process

The Direct Extraction Process was developed to address the REE losses in beneficiation identified in the early work on gravity, flotation, and magnetic separation and to refine the purification processes to ensure a high quality mixed rare earth product for refining.  The evolution of the process development is covered in  Dreisinger et al. (2012), Dreisinger et al. (2014), Dreisinger et al. (2016a), Dreisinger et al. (2016b), Dreisinger and Andrews (2017), Dreisinger et al. (2018), and Dreisinger et al. (2022).

<!-- image -->

The Direct Extraction Process flow sheet is shown in Figure 13-4.  The circuit involves a primary circuit for feed preparation, mixing of acid and mineral or concentrate and baking at approximately 200 ° C to allow the acid to convert the rare earth minerals to water-soluble rare-earth sulfate salts, pH adjustment with MgCO3 to remove iron, aluminum and thorium as stable hydroxide precipitates and sodium carbonate precipitation of an impure mixed rare earth carbonate.  The secondary circuit redissolves the mixed rare earth carbonate with sulfuric acid to form a concentrated rare-earth sulfate solution.  The pH is adjusted again to remove small amounts of residual iron and aluminum and this solid is recycled back to the primary leach to ensure minimal losses of rare earth values.  Small amounts of uranium are removed as an impurity from solution using ion exchange.  The eluant is precipitated into the final dry stackable residue material for stable storage.  The latest innovation in the direct extraction development is the inclusion of a thorium removal step using solvent extraction.  The strip solution content of thorium and any minor amounts of rare  earths  is  recycled  back  to  the  primary  leach  circuit  to  permit  rare  earth  recovery  and  thorium precipitation into the dry stackable residue.  Zinc is then removed from solution using hydrogen sulfide precipitation.    The  process  then  has  the  option  of  mixed  carbonate  precipitation  as  the  final  purified mixed-rare  earth  product  or  oxalate  precipitation  and  calcination  to  make  a  mixed-rare  earth  oxide product to forward to separation.  The mixed rare earth carbonate precipitate is favoured due to the ease of redissolving in acid before solvent extraction separation.

## 13.3 Mineralogy Studies - Deep Fox

SGS Study 13004-006 MI5002-FEB21 reported on the mineralogy of a sample of Deep Fox mineralization taken from a channel sample of the exposed surface.  The mineralogy of the sample was of the same type as Foxtrot with rare earth values contained primarily in fergusonite and allanite with minor monazite.

## 13.4 Magnetic Separation Beneficiation of Deep Fox and Foxtrot Samples

Magnetic separation of a rare earth mineral concentrate from various deposits was studied at SGS and reported in Search Minerals news releases on January 12, 2021, and April 12, 2021.  The first deposit to be tested was Silver Fox.  A channel sample was selected with 4.26% ZrO2, 0.08% HfO2 and 1.02% TREO. The sample was treated by low-intensity magnetic separation (LIMS) to recover an iron oxide rich material followed by wet high-intensity magnetic separation (WHIMS) up to 15,000 Gauss to recover a rare earth concentrate.  The WHIMS nonmagnetic fraction was then tested for zircon flotation.  The results (SGS Report for Project 13004-06) are summarized in Table 13-3.

Table 13-3: Magnetic Separation Results for Silver Fox Search Minerals Inc. - Deep Fox and Foxtrot Project

The combined grade of the WHIMS concentrate was re-analyzed and reported at 8.42% TREO+Y.  The results demonstrated that the mass of the rare earth containing concentrate was only approximately 10% and the recovery of indicative elements (Ce, Nd for the LREE, and Y for HREE) was between 70% and 88%. This was a superior result compared with the earlier work (2012) and hence further work was performed on Foxtrot, Deep Fox, and the Fox Meadow deposits.  These results were reported on April 12, 2021.

The Deep Fox, Foxtrot, and Fox Meadow results for WHIMS concentration of REEs are summarized in Table 13-4.

- · A sample of Deep Fox mineralization containing 1.15% TREO/Y was treated sequentially by LIMS and WHIMS.  The WHIMS concentrate was enriched to 5.55% TREO/Y containing enriched levels of the key magnet making elements (Nd/Pr/Tb/Dy).  The overall recovery of TREO/Y to the WHIMS Concentrate was 78.3%
- · A sample of Foxtrot mineralization containing 1.13% TREO/Y enriched to 4.81% TREO/Y in the WHIMS concentrate with an overall recovery of 78.3%.
- · A sample of Fox Meadow mineralization containing 0.92% TREO/Y enriched to 3.91% TREO/Y in the WHIMS concentrate with an overall recovery of 81.8%.

Further testing was completed on the combination of LIMS and WHIMS on a sample of Foxtrot material. The results for test LIMS + SLON-2/WHIMS (LIMS followed by SLON and WHIMS testing up to 15,000 G) are  shown in  Table  13-5.    The  combination  of  the  SLON  and  WHIMS  system  increased  the  mass  pull compared  with  the  results  in  Table  13-4.    At  the  same  time,  the  overall  recovery  of  individual  light elements also increased along with LREO, HREO, and TREO values.  These results highlight the normal trade off of grade and recovery in mineral processing operations and can be extrapolated to Deep Fox and other similar deposits, such as Fox Meadow, in setting expectations for metallurgical recovery and mass pull in the magnetic separation circuit.

Two bulk samples of Deep Fox and Foxtrot material were sent to SGS for further testing.  The Foxtrot sample consisted of 19.8 t of surface material recovered in 2015 and stored at Fox Harbour House.  The Deep Fox sample consisted of 52.9 t of surface material recovered in 2021.  SGS has performed batch LIMS

and WHIMS testing of these two materials at different grind size.  The results showed over 90% TREO+Y recovery at a grade of between 4% to 6% TREO+Y.   These results, summarized in Table 13-6, showed improved recovery compared to the earlier study.

The combined results of the magnetic separation work indicate 94% recovery of rare earths and have established a new base case for use of the Direct Extraction Process.  A rare earth mineral concentrate will be produced in Labrador.  The concentrate may then be sold or optionally transhipped to a Direct Extraction Process plant for recovery of a mixed rare earth carbonate material for refining.  All the same chemistry for rare earth extraction and recovery of a mixed rare earth carbonate material for refining can be applied to the magnetic concentrate containing rare earth minerals.

## 13.5 Direct Extraction Process Optimization

The 2020 SGS program (13004-05) consisted of batch and pilot plant  testing of the Direct Extraction Process.  This work is the 'state of the art' for the Direct Extraction Process.

The sample tested was from Foxtrot.  The composition is provided in Table 13-7.

A pilot acid bake process was tested.  Pre-crushed mineral (-1.7 mm) was fed to a screw furnace to heat to  temperature  and  then  blended  with  preheated  H2SO4  (190 C)  in  a  SS  pug  mill  and  then  held  at ° temperature (190 C) for four hours.  The water leach was then conducted at 90 C for 36 hours at 10% ° ° solids.  The impurity removal was performed by addition of H2O2 to oxidize reduced iron species and then adjusted to pH 3.2 for 2 hours to precipitate iron, aluminum, and thorium.  A portion of the recovered solution  was  treated  by  ion  exchange  for  uranium  removal.    Uranium  was  removed  from  2  mg/L  to &lt;0.02 mg/L U using a lead-lag configuration of Purolite A660 strong base resin.  A total of 3000 L (1/2 of the total) was treated at 12 BV/h over a 48-hour period.  The uranium ion exchange process was highly selective.

The uranium-free and uranium-containing portions of the solution were then separately treated at 50 C ° at pH 6.5 with addition of 150 g/L Na2CO3 solution in a series of three agitated tanks discharging to a thickener.  The recovered underflow solids were filtered and washed.  The precipitation was virtually 100% for the REE+Th, U, Al, Fe, Zn, Mg, Ca.  Mn recovery was controlled to approximately 10%.  Results are provided in Table 13-9.

The rare earth carbonate precipitates were leached to pH 1 with sulfuric solution to produce a solution containing approximately 25 g/L REE content.  The pH was then adjusted to between 3.0 and 3.5 with magnesium  carbonate  slurry.    Importantly,  silica  rejection  was  99%.    Uranium  ion  exchange  was demonstrated on the portion of leach solution still containing uranium.  The removal was again excellent (from 32 mg/L U to &lt; 0.02 mg/L U).  Results are provided in Table 13-10.

- 1. Analysis before Uranium Ion Exchange

The next step in treatment was the use of thorium solvent extraction.  A solvent containing 1.0% Primene JMT  (a  primary  amine),  2.5%  isodecanol  and  96.5%  Aromatic  150ND  was  used  in  the  following configuration (5 day pilot plant operated continuously).

- · Aqueous Solution: Combined U-free releach solution adjusted to pH 1.5.
- · Extraction: 2 stages at A/O advance ratio of 5:1, 45°C, aqueous continuous
- · Scrubbing: 2 stages at A/O advance ratio of 0.5:1 and A/O mixer-settler ratio of 1:1, ambient temperature, aqueous continuous.
- · The scrub solution was 24 g/L H2SO4.  Scrub solution was added to the extraction feed.
- · Stripping: 2 stages at A/O advance ratio of 1.25:1 and A/O mixer-settler ratio of 1:1 at ambient temperature.  Aqueous Continuous.  The strip solution was 18 g/L HCl.

The results of the testing are summarized in Table 13-11.  The thorium removal was excellent (4.72 mg/L Th to &lt; 0.03 mg/L Th in the raffinate).  The circuit was stable and well-behaved through the pilot plant. The organic solution was repeatedly recycled with no indication of degradation or chemical fouling.  Rare earth deportment to the strip solution was always &lt; 1%.

Zinc precipitation was performed using H2S gas at pH 2 and 50 C.  The final solution was &lt; 1 mg/L Zn ° (starting at +2,000 mg/L Zn).  There were negligible losses of REE elements with the zinc sulfide precipitate.

The zinc free solution was treated by two methods to make a mixed oxide and a mixed carbonate product.

The first method was to add oxalic acid (125% stoichiometric addition) to form a mixed rare earth oxalate. The rare earth oxalate was filtered, washed, and calcined at 1,200 ° C.  The composition of the mixed oxide after calcination is presented in Table 13-12.  The grade of the mixed oxide was approximately 99% REO with &lt;1g/t Th and &lt;0.5 g/t U.  The low U/Th content of the final product is a further validation of the uranium ion exchange and thorium solvent extraction technology selection.

The mixed carbonate was produced in two steps.  First, the pH was adjusted to 5.0 using sodium carbonate at 50 ° C to remove aluminum (for recycle to the primary circuit to recover any rare earth values).  The pH was then adjusted to 6.5 to precipitate the rare earths.  The  high purity mixed rare earth carbonate product analyzed 58% TREO with only 1.1 g/t U and 0.7 g/t Th.  This was once again a validation of the U and Th ion exchange and solvent extraction purification technologies.  The full analysis is summarized in Table 13-13.

The foregoing description of the Direct Extraction process and the results of experimental work were generated on coarsely crushed samples of mineral from Foxtrot.  The presently proposed processing plant, as described in Section 17, includes processing Deep Fox (and later Foxtrot ore) by grinding to 80% passing 53 µm, magnetic concentration to increase the mineral grade by a factor of approximately five, followed by  application  of  the  Direct  Extraction  process.    This  is  somewhat  different  to  the  coarse  Foxtrot processing described in this section.

It is expected that the acid bake and water leach portions of the Direct Extraction process will be effective on  the  WHIMS  concentrates  from  Deep  Fox  and  Foxtrot  and  allow  91%  rare  earth  recovery  from concentrate for the following reasons:

- · The  rare  earth  minerals  (allanite  and  fergusonite)  are  reactive  toward  acid  baking  and  water leaching whether found in magnetic or flotation concentrate material.
- · The particle size of the magnetic concentrate is fine at 80% passi ng 53 µm .    Early work (2012) showed  high  extractions  (+90%)  were  achievable  on  similarly  sized  flotation  and  gravity concentrates, as presented in Figure 13-3.

Test work to confirm the suitability of the Direct Extraction process on Deep Fox and Foxtrot concentrates are in process but not yet completed.  The overall recovery data used to support the current Mineral Resource is based on available test work and is summarized in Table 13-14.

## 13.6 SLR Comments on Mineral Processing and Metallurgical Testing

SLR has reviewed the reports on metallurgical test work and the summary of the test work provided by Search Minerals.  The test work has been performed by SGS which is a highly experienced and competent laboratory.  The interpretation of the test work appears to be quite reasonable.

Consistent with Search Minerals' plans, SLR recommends that additional laboratory test work needs to be continued to confirm, or improve upon, present recovery and reagent consumption values and to examine the response of the beneficiation and hydrometallurgical processes to mineral variability.   Future test work  must  also  include  pilot-scale  operations,  the  determination  of  engineering  parameters  such  as liquid-solid-separation requirements, and the characteristics of effluents and residues to allow the design of suitable handling, storage, and disposal facilities.

Although additional test work is needed, the QP is of the opinion that the available test work is sufficient to define the design of recovery methods that are adequate for a PEA.

## 14.0 MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATE

SLR estimated Mineral Resources for the Project using all drill hole and channel sample data available as of  December  31,  2021.    Canadian  Institute  of  Mining,  Metallurgy  and  Petroleum  (CIM)  Definition Standards for Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves (CIM (2014) definitions) were used for Mineral Resource classification.  Table 14-1 summarizes the estimated Mineral Resources potentially mineable by open pit and underground methods as of December 31, 2021.  The cut-off value has been expressed as Net  Value  (value  net  of  process  recoveries,  payability  terms,  and  separation  charges).    No  Mineral Reserves have been estimated for the Project.

## 14.1.1 Resource Database

SLR was provided with a drill hole database consisting of 61 drill holes with a total length of 11,927 m and combined sampled length of 6,526.2 m, and 38 surface channels with a total length of  993.7 m and combined sampled length of 879.7 m.  Figure 14-1 shows the drill hole and channel traces in plan view.

SLR received data from Search Minerals in csv format.  Data, consisting of collar location, deviation survey, sample assays, lithology, and density measurements, were amalgamated and parsed as required, and then imported in Leapfrog Geo for modelling.

Section 12 Data Verification describes the database verification steps undertaken by SLR.  In summary, no discrepancies were identified and the QPs are of the opinion that the drill hole database is valid and suitable to estimate Mineral Resources for Deep Fox.

## 14.1.2 Geological Interpretation and 3D Solids

Resource wireframes were built to investigate geological and grade continuity and to constrain grade interpolation  within  the  block  model.    Mineralization  wireframes  were  modelled  in  Leapfrog  Geo software, at a nominal Net Value cut-off of $260/t.

Two mineralized wireframes were defined for Deep Fox: Hanging Wall (HW) Zone, and Footwall (FW) Zone as presented in Figure 14-2.  A minimum thickness of two metres was applied.  The zones of interpreted mineralization were contiguous, with rare exceptions where narrow intercepts were expanded to achieve a minimum thickness where required, and assays below the minimum Net Value modelling value were included to maintain  continuity. At model  extremities, the wireframes  were  extrapolated  to approximately 50 m beyond the last channel or drill hole intersection.  Continuity was checked using the level plans and in vertical cross sections.  The wireframes are steeply dipping (80° to 85°), at an azimuth of approximately 275°.  The strike length of the HW and FW zones are approximately 750 m and 1,000 m, and have been modelled to a depth of -200 MASL and -250 MASL, respectively.

The FW Zone is comprised predominantly of mineralized pantellerite, with an average thickness of 25 m. The width ranges from 5 m to 40 m.  The central portion of the FW Zone reaches a thickness of nearly 30 m.  The wireframe narrows to approximately 10 m or less to the east and west.  Small lenses of mainly non-peralkaline  rhyolite  (NPR),  mafic  and  ultra  mafic  rock,  and  weakly  mineralized  comendite  and pegmatite intermingle with the pantellerite.  Comendite is lower grade than pantellerite.  The FW Zone is the main zone of mineralization.

The HW Zone is narrower than and parallels the FW Zone.  The HW Zone comprises a single wireframe of predominantly mineralized pantellerite and low Zr-pantellerite.  Similar to the FW Zone, small lenses of NPR, mafic and ultramafic rock, and weakly mineralized comendite and pegmatite intermingle with the pantellerite.  Approximately two metres to 10 m of mafic and NPR rocks separate the HW Zone from the FW Zone.

## 14.1.3 Resource Assays

There are 15 elements that normally are classified as REEs:

- · All of the lanthanoids - La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, holmium (Ho), erbium (Er), thulium (Tm), ytterbium (Yb), and lutetium (Lu) -with the exception of promethium (Pm), which does not occur in nature.
- · Yttrium (Y)

HREE include Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb, Lu, and Y.  LREE include La, Ce, Pr, Nd, and Sm.  TREE is the sum of HREE and LREE.  All the REEs, along with U and Th have been estimated into the block model

The REE elements at Deep Fox present a very good correlation.  The behaviour of any of the LREE or HREE is directly reflected in the behaviour of the rest of the elements in the group.

Some of the following discussion of statistical analysis focuses on four of these elements: Nd, Pr, Dy, and Tb.  The chosen elements represent approximately 92% of the in situ REE value at Deep Fox.  Dy is the HREE with the greatest in situ value (approximately 27% of total REE value), and Nd is the LREE with the greatest in situ value (approximately 41% of total REE value).

Assay  values  located  inside  the  wireframes,  or  resource  assays,  were  tagged  with  mineralized  zone domain identifiers and exported for statistical analysis.  Results assisted in verifying the modelling process. SLR compiled and reviewed the basic statistics for all the resource elements at Deep Fox.  Table 14-3 presents a summary for Nd, Pr, Dy, and Tb.

Figure 14-3 presents histograms of Nd, Pr, Dy, and Tb for all of the assays used in the resource estimate. The distributions show three prominent modes that correspond to two main rock types.  The lowest mode belongs to samples from the mafic volcanic units.  The medium grade mode consists of low-Zr pantellerite, and pantellerite-mafic mixed intervals.  The higher grade mode is characteristic of pantellerite samples.

## 14.1.4 Treatment of High Grade Assays

SLR investigated the necessity for capping of high grade resource assays.  Based on observations from resource assay histograms, top decile analysis, and probability plots, it is the opinion of the QPs that capping  was  not  necessary.    The  low  coefficients  of  variation  (CV)  in  the  descriptive  statistics  of  the composites, summarized in Table 14-4, support this decision.

## 14.1.5 Compositing

Resource sample lengths range from 0.03 m to 1.71 m, with the majority of the samples at one metre as presented  in  Figure  14-4.    Considering  the  average  sample  length  and  the  mineralization  wireframes width, SLR decided to composite to 2.0 m long intervals.  The resource assays were composited inside the mineralized wireframes.  Orphan composites less than 1.0 m long (50% of the nominal composite length) were added to the previous composite.

Table 14-4 summarizes the Nd, Pr, Dy, and Tb statistics of the composites.  Compared to resource assays (Table 14-3) the average grades are similar, while the CV values are lower.

## 14.1.6 Variography and Interpolation Parameters

The mineralization at Deep Fox shows a strong correlation among the REEs, as presented in Table 14-5. Given the similar  behaviour  for  the  LREEs  and  the  HREEs,  variograms  modelled  for  Nd  were  used  to support LREEs estimation parameters, while Dy variogram models were used for HREEs.

REE grades were interpolated using ordinary kriging (OK).  Variography was used to determine the search ellipsoid dimensions and global plunge, and variable orientation was applied using the resource domain wireframe.

A single pass was used to interpolate LREE and HREE block grades for all resource domains.  Interpolation was restricted by the mineralized wireframe models, which were used as hard boundaries, preventing the use of composites outside of the intended estimation domain.  The single pass used 100% of the variogram ranges.  A minimum of one and a maximum of eight composites were used, with a maximum limit of two composites per drill hole.  Identical search ellipses were used for all LREEs and HREEs in both FW and HW Zone.

## 14.1.7 Net Value Cut-off Value

The depth and geometry of the interpreted mineralized domains at Deep Fox make it amenable to open pit methods near surface and to underground mining methods at deeper levels.  Net Value factors were developed by SLR for the purposes of resource reporting.  Net Value is the estimated value per tonne of mineralized material after allowance for metallurgical recovery and consideration of terms for third-party separation and refining, including payability and charges.  These assumptions are based on the current processing scenario and results from metallurgical test work.

The net revenue of payable REEs was calculated and then divided by grade to generate a Net Value factor for resource reporting.  These Net Value factors represent revenue per oxide grade unit (US$/kg Dy2O3, for example), and are independent of grade.  Key assumptions are summarized in Table 14-8 and Table 14-9.

Notes::

- 1. An exchange rate of C$1.00:US$0.80 was used to convert oxide prices.
- 2. Off-site treatment charges of US$5.00/kg for TREO plus US$20.00/kg for heavy rare earth oxides (HREO) were assumed and are included in the operating costs.
- 3. Recoveries to a mixed REO concentrate are based on test-work and a further recovery loss for separation has been assumed (2% for Neodymium and Praseodymium, and 5% for all HREO).

| Net Value Cut-Off                                | $/tonne |  258    |

Notes::

- 1. Open pit mining is reported at pit discard cut-off, which excludes mining costs.  Mining costs of $75/t were assumed for underground mining.

These Net Value factors were applied to assay grades to help interpret the mineralized zone outlines on drill sections, which were used to generate the mineralized zone wireframes.  A minimum Net Value of $260/t was used to select drill hole intercepts.  These intercepts were then interpreted on drill sections.

The Net Value factors were used to calculate a Net Value ($ per tonne) for each block in the block model, which was compared directly to unit operating costs required to mine that block.  All classified resource blocks located within the mineralized wireframe domains and above the design pit shell with Net Value greater than $260/t were included in the open pit resource estimate.  All classified resource blocks located within the underground reporting mineralized wireframe domains and below the pit shell with Net Values greater than $335/t were included in the underground resource estimate.  Both open pit and underground resource blocks exhibited good continuity.

In the opinion of the QPs, a Net Value cut-off of $260/t is suitable for an open pit mining scenario, and a Net Value of $335/t is suitable for an underground mining scenario.

## 14.1.8 Bulk Density

An updated lithological model was created in Leapfrog (Figure 14-7) to allow better control of the bulk density factors.  The fine scale density readings were averaged inside the modelled units of the lithological model.

## 14.1.9 Block Model

The Leapfrog block model comprised of 250 columns (along easting), 300 rows (along northing), and 80 levels for 6,000,000 blocks.  The model origin (lower-left corner at highest elevation) is at UTM Grid Zone 21N, NAD83 591,000 mE, 5,803,850 mN and 135 m elevation.  The block model is not rotated, and each block is 5 m (x) by 2.5 m (y) by 5 m (z).  A whole block model is used, and resource domains and other geology codes are assigned by centroid location.  The block model contains the following information:

- · Domain identifiers with mineralized zone and lithology
- · Estimated grades of seven payable REEs inside the resource domain wireframes
- · Net  Value  estimates  calculated  from  block  grades  and  related  economic  and  metallurgical assumptions
- · Tonnage factors, in t/m , specific to each rock type 3
- · The distance to the closest composite used to interpolate the block grade
- · The number of composites used to interpolate the block grade
- · The average distance to composite used to interpolate the block grade
- · The resource classification of each block

## 14.1.10 Classification

Definitions for resource categories used in this Technical Report are consistent with those defined by CIM (2014)  and  adopted  by  NI  43-101.    In  the  CIM  classification,  a  Mineral  Resource  is  defined  as  'a concentration or occurrence of solid material of economic interest in or on the Earth's crust in such form, grade or quality and quantity that there are reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction.' Mineral  Resources  are  classified  into  Measured,  Indicated,  and  Inferred  categories,  according  to  the confidence level in the estimated blocks.

SLR classified the Deep Fox Mineral Resource as Indicated and Inferred, as illustrated in Figure 14-8, based on drill hole and surface channel spacing, the reliability of data, and geological confidence in the continuity of grade.  The overall geological continuity of Deep Fox is consistent in the plane of the mineralization. The grade continuity is also consistent, with high grades confined to the pantellerite units, moderate grades in comendite and pegmatite, and low grade within mafic/ultramafic rocks.  The consistent nature of  the  mineralization,  for  both  the  grade  and  geological  continuity,  would  normally  provide  sufficient confidence to allow classification of most of the Mineral Resources as Indicated.

Composites located within the wireframes were plotted on an inclined south-looking section in the dip plane of the mineralized wireframes and reviewed for their spatial distribution and spacing.  Where SLR deemed that the spacing was insufficient to establish grade and geological continuity with confidence (generally &gt;50 m), the Mineral Resource was classified as Inferred.

## 14.1.11 Block Model Validation

SLR carried out a number of block model validation procedures including:

- · Visual comparisons of block Net Value, Pr, Nd, Tb, and Dy versus composite grades
- · Statistical comparisons of Pr, Nd, Dy, and Tb
- · Comparison of Pr, Nd, Dy, and Tb block and composite grades in blocks containing composites
- · Grade estimation by alternate methods

Block model grades were visually examined and compared with composite grades in cross sections and on plan views.  SLR found grade continuity to be reasonable and confirmed that the block grades were reasonably consistent with local drill hole and channel sample assay and composite grades.  Figure 14-9 shows a plan view with composites and estimated block values for Net Value at +25 m elevation.  Figure 14-10 shows a cross section, looking east, with composites and estimated block values for Net Value at 591,495 m E.

Grade statistics for Dy, Pr, and Nd assays, composites, and resource blocks were examined and compared for the mineralized wireframe models as shown in Table 14-11.  The comparisons of average grades of length weighted assays, composites, and blocks are reasonable in the opinion of the QPs.

Notes::

- 1. CIM (2014) definitions were followed for Mineral Resources.
- 2. Open Pit Mineral Resources were reported inside a resource shell at pit discard Net Value cut-off value of $260/t. Underground Mineral Resources were constrained with mineralization wireframes below the resource shell and validated using underground mining solids based on a Net Value cut-off value of $335/t.  Both cut-off values account for all processing, G&amp;A, refining, and transportation charges.  Mining costs were assumed at $6.50/t ore mined and $5.00/t waste mined for open pit and $75.00/t for underground.
- 3. Net Value was assigned to blocks using metal prices, metallurgical recoveries, payables (as shown in their respective sections of this Technical Report) for each individual element.
- 4. A minimum mining width two metres was used for both open pit and underground.
- 5. Bulk density varies from 2.71 t/m 3 to 2.92 t/m 3 .
- 6. Revenue attributable to Pr, Nd, Dy, and Tb represent 92% of the total revenue.
- 7. The estimate is of Mineral Resources only and because these do not constitute Mineral Reserves, they do not have demonstrated economic viability.
- 8. Totals may not add or multiply accurately due to rounding.

Section  12  Data  Verification  describes  the  verification  steps  undertaken  by  SLR.    In  summary,  no discrepancies were identified and the QPs are of the opinion that the GEMS drill hole database is valid and suitable to estimate Foxtrot Mineral Resources.

## 14.2.2 Geological Interpretation

Wireframes of the mineralized zones were built to investigate geological and grade continuity and to constrain grade interpolation within the block model.

SLR  created  northeast-southwest  vertical  sections  spaced  at  50  m  perpendicular  to  the  strike  of  the mineralization  at  an  azimuth  of  285°,  and  plan  sections  spaced  at  20  m.    Mineralized  zones  were interpreted on vertical section and snapped to drill holes to generate a set of 3D wobbly polylines on each section.    At  model  extremities,  polylines  were  extrapolated  approximately  25  m  beyond  the  last  drill section.  A minimum number of nodes were used to simplify updates.  Polylines were joined together in 3D using tie lines and the continuity was checked using the level plans.

Foxtrot  comprises  three  mineralized  wireframes:  Core,  Hanging  Wall  (HW),  and  Footwall  (FW),  as illustrated in Figure 14-13 and Figure 14-14.  Wireframes are summarized in Table 14-16.  The wireframes were interpreted in 2015 using a minimum Net Value of $140/t, and a minimum mining width of two metres.  Narrow intercepts were widened to achieve a minimum thickness where required.  All three wireframes  have  been  modelled  as  single  steeply  dipping  (70°  to  80°)  solids,  with  a  strike  length  of approximately 765 m at an azimuth of approximately 285°.  The wireframes have been extended no more than 25 m below the deepest drill hole intercept to a maximum of -395 MASL, and the upper surfaces have been clipped to the topography.  A description of each modelled wireframe follows:

Core Zone:  A steeply dipping (70° to 80°) single wireframe solid comprised predominantly of mineralized pantellerite,  with  a  strike  length  of  765  m  at  an  azimuth  of  approximately  285°.    The  unit  has  been modelled to a depth of -395 m, with an average thickness of 15 m, but ranges from 2 m to 25 m.  The central portion of the Core Zone reaches a thickness of nearly 30 m, at a depth of approximately -50 MASL. The wireframe model narrows to approximately 10 m to southeast and 5 m to the northwest.  The top of

the  Core  Zone  wireframe  solid  has  been  clipped  to  topography.    The  Core  Zone  is  the  main  zone  of mineralization.

Hanging Wall Zone:  A thin zone of mineralization located above the Core Zone, the HW Zone is a steeply dipping (70° to 80°) single wireframe solid comprised predominantly of mineralized pantellerite and low Zr-pantellerite, with a strike length of 765 m at an azimuth of approximately 285°.  Small lenses of mafic rock locally intermingle with the mineralized pantellerite within the HW Zone.  Mafic lenses are typically less than 40 cm to 50 cm in thickness.  Approximately five to seven metres of predominantly mafic rock separate the HW Zone from the Core Zone.

Footwall Zone:  A thin zone of mineralization located below the Core Zone, the FW Zone is a steeply dipping (70° to 80°) single wireframe solid comprised predominantly of mineralized pantellerite and low Zr-pantellerite, with a strike length of 765 m at an azimuth of approximately 285°.  As with the HW Zone, small  lenses  of  mafic  rock  locally  intermingle  with  the  mineralized  pantellerite  within  the  FW  Zone. Approximately five metres to nearly 15 m of mafic and non-peralkaline rhyolitic rocks separate the FW Zone from the Core Zone.

All Mineral Resources estimated at Foxtrot are located within the mineralized zone wireframes.

For the current estimate, SLR updated the Net Value values, resulting in a mineralization wireframe cutoff value of $260/t.  SLR revisited the 2015 mineralized wireframes interpretation in order to update the wireframes.  A thorough review of the interpretation led to the conclusion that using the updated Net Value, insignificant  changes  would be  made to the resource wireframes.  As such, the mineralization wireframes remained unchanged, and the block grades estimated for 2015 estimate remained current. The changes for the current model consisted in recalculating the Net Value attribute.  The updated model was then subjected to open pit and underground optimization routines to generate resource constraining surfaces or volumes.

## 14.2.3 Resource Assays

The Foxtrot resource block model includes the following elements and calculated attributes:

- · All of the lanthanoids -La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb and Lu - with the exception of promethium (Pm), which does not occur in nature
- · Yttrium (Y), which is usually classified as a REE
- · Combinations of the 15 REEs:  the TREEs, LREEs, including La, Ce, Pr, Nd, and Sm, and HREEs, including Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb, Lu, and Y
- · Net Value

The REE elements at Foxtrot exhibit very good correlation, such following the behaviour of a LREE or a HREE gives indications about the general behaviour of the rest of the elements in the group.  The three elements carrying the greatest in situ value, Pr, Dy, and Nd, were the focus of the statistical analysis.

Assay  values  located  inside  the  mineralization  wireframes,  the  resource  assays,  were  tagged  with mineralized zone domain identifiers and exported for statistical analysis.  Results assisted in verifying the modeling  process.    SLR  compiled  and  reviewed  the  basic  statistics  for  Pr,  Dy,  and  Nd,  which  are summarized in Table 14-17.

Figure 14-15, Figure 14-16, and Figure 14-17 show histograms of Pr, Dy, and Nd, respectively, for all assays used in the resource estimate.  The distributions show three prominent modes that correspond to two main rock types.  The lowest mode belongs to samples from the mafic volcanic units.  The two high grade modes belong to low-Zr pantellerite, and pantellerite-mafic mixed intervals (lower grade) and pantellerite (higher grade).

## 14.2.4 Treatment of High Grade Assays

SLR investigated the necessity for capping of high grade resource assays.  A review of the resource assay histograms, and top decile analysis performed for Nd, Pr, Eu, Dy, Er, Lu, and Tb showed that capping was not  necessary.    This  is  confirmed  by  low  coefficients  of  variations  in  the  resource  assay  values,  as summarized in Table 14-17.

## 14.2.5 Compositing

Sample lengths range from 0.04 m to 2.95 m within the wireframe models.  Approximately 83% of samples were taken at 0.5 m to 1.5 m intervals (Figure 14-18).  Less than 1% have lengths greater than 2.0 m. Given these distributions and considering the width of mineralization, SLR chose to composite to 2.0 m lengths.  The resource assays were composited starting at the first mineralized wireframe boundary from the collar and resetting at each new wireframe boundary.  Orphan composites with a length less than 0.5 m, representing 25% of the nominal composite length, were discarded.

Table 14-19 summarizes the Pr, Dy, and Nd statistics of the composite resource assay values.  When compared to Table 14-17, the average grades are nearly the same and the coefficient of variation (CV) values have been reduced.

## 14.2.6 Variography and Interpolation Parameters

Initial variography  studies  were  completed  in  2012  (RPA,  2012),  and  demonstrated  very  strong correlations among all elements, and used a single variogram model for grade interpolation.  Variography analysis was completed by SLR on the current database with the GEMS geostatistics module using all available 2.0 m composite samples, confirming the direction of maximum continuity along strike (Y) at 285°, with a range of 280 m.  In the down-dip direction (X), the range is 140 m, and perpendicular to the strike direction (Z) the range is approximately 10 m.

Variography parameters were used for interpolation of all REE 2.0 m composites by ID  for all mineralized 3 zones.  The interpolation and search parameters are summarized in Table 14-20.

Note:

A  two-pass  approach  was  used  to  interpolate  REE  block  grades  for  all  domains.    Interpolation  was restricted by the mineralized wireframe models, which were used as hard boundaries to prevent the use of composite samples outside of the zones to interpolate block grades.  The first pass used an X search distance of 70 m, a Y search distance of 140 m, and a Z search distance of 5 m, and was limited to a minimum of two and a maximum of five composites per block, with a limit of two composites used per drill hole.  The second pass used an X search distance of 140 m, a Y search distance of 280 m, and a Z search distance of 10 m (i.e., the search distances were doubled), and was limited to a minimum of one and a maximum of six composites per block with no limit to the number of composites used per drill hole. Identical search ellipses were used for all REEs in all three mineralized zones.

## 14.2.7 Net Value Cut-off Value

The depth and geometry of the interpreted Foxtrot mineralized domains make it amenable to open pit methods near surface and to underground mining methods at deeper levels.  Net Value factors were developed by SLR for the purposes of resource reporting.  Net Value is the estimated value per tonne of mineralized material after allowance for metallurgical recovery and consideration of terms for third-party

separation and refining, including payability and charges.  These assumptions are based on the current processing scenario and results from metallurgical test work.

The net revenue of seven payable REEs was calculated and then divided by grade to generate a Net Value factor for resource reporting.  These Net Value factors represent revenue per oxide grade unit (US$/kg Dy2O3, for example), and are independent of grade.  Key assumptions are summarized in Table 14-21 and Table 14-22.

Notes::

- 1. An exchange rate of C$1.00:US$0.80 was used to convert oxide prices.
- 2. Off-site treatment charges of US$5.00/kg for TREO plus US$20.00/kg for HREO were assumed and are included in the operating costs.
- 3. Recoveries to a mixed REO concentrate are based on test-work and a further recovery loss for separation has been assumed (2% for Neodymium and Praseodymium, and 5% for all HREO).

Notes::

- 1. Open pit mining is reported at pit discard cut-off, which excludes mining costs.  Mining costs of $75/t were assumed for underground mining.

These Net Value factors were applied to assay grades to help interpret the mineralized zone outlines on drill sections, which were used to generate the mineralized zone wireframes.  A minimum Net Value of $260/t was used to select drill hole intercepts.  These intercepts were then interpreted on drill sections.

<!-- image -->

The Net Value factors were used to calculate a Net Value ($ per tonne) for each block in the block model, which  was  compared  directly  to  unit  operating  costs  required  to  mine  that  block  (Table  14-22).    All classified resource blocks located within the mineralized wireframe domains and above the design pit shell with Net Values greater than $260/t were included in the open pit resource estimate.  All classified resource blocks located within the underground reporting mineralized wireframe domains and below the pit shell with Net Values greater than $335/t were included in the underground resource estimate.  Both open pit and underground resource blocks exhibited good continuity.

## 14.2.8 Bulk Density

To convert volumes to tonnes, a bulk density factor of 2.71 t/m3 was assigned to all blocks within the mineralization wireframes.  The factor is based on 28 samples collected from the three major Foxtrot rock types by SLR and Benchmark Six during the 2011 site visit.  Five augen gneiss samples had an average dry bulk density of 2.53 t/m3, 12 felsic extrusive rock samples had an average dry bulk density of 2.71 t/m3, and 11 mafic extrusive rock samples had an average dry bulk density of 2.88 t/m3.  Because there is insufficient density test work completed for Foxtrot, SLR applied the average dry bulk density of the three rock types, 2.71 t/m3, which is also the average bulk density of the felsic extrusive rock samples, until more data are generated.  This value is slightly lower than the average bulk density of 2.77 t/m  used in 3 the 2012 PEA block model.  In the opinion of the QPs, this is reasonable given that the new mineralized wireframe models incorporated significantly less mafic rock.

## 14.2.9 Block Model

The GEMS block model is made up of 260 columns, 305 rows, and 130 levels for 10,309,000 blocks.  The model origin (lower-left corner at highest elevation) is at UTM Grid Zone 21N, NAD83 579,809.22 mE, 5,805,971.66 mN and 125 m elevation.  The block model is oriented N75°W and each block is 5 m (x) by 2.5 m (y) by 5 m (z).  A percent block model is used to manage blocks partially filled by mineralized rock types,  including  blocks  along  the  edges  of  the  deposit.    A  percent  model  uses  the  percentage  of  a mineralized zone contained within each block.  The block model contains the following information:

- · Domain identifiers with mineralized zone
- · Estimated grades of all REEs, LREE, HREE, and TREE inside the wireframe models
- · Net  Value  estimates  calculated  from  block  grades  and  related  economic  and  metallurgical assumptions
- · Percentage volume of each block within the mineralization wireframes
- · Tonnage factors, in tonnes per cubic metre, specific to each rock type
- · Number of samples within the search ellipse
- · Distance to the closest composite used to interpolate the block grade
- · Number of composites used to interpolate the block grade
- · Number of drill holes used to interpolate the block grade
- · Resource classification of each block

## 14.2.10 Classification

Definitions for resource categories used in this Technical Report are consistent with those defined by CIM (2014)  and  adopted  by  NI  43-101.    In  the  CIM  classification,  a  Mineral  Resource  is  defined  as  'a concentration or occurrence of solid material of economic interest in or on the Earth's crust in such form, grade or quality and quantity that there are reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction.' Mineral  Resources  are  classified  into  Measured,  Indicated,  and  Inferred  categories,  according  to  the confidence level in the estimated blocks.

SLR classified  the  Foxtrot  Resource  as  Indicated  and  Inferred  based  on  drill  hole  and  surface  channel spacing, the reliability of data, and geological confidence in the continuity of grade (Figure 14-19).  The overall  geological  continuity  of  Foxtrot  is  consistent  in  the  plane  of  the  mineralization.    The  grade continuity is also quite consistent, with moderate to high grades confined to pantellerite units versus low REE values within the mafic rocks.  The consistent nature of the mineralization, for both the grade and geological  continuity,  provides  sufficient  confidence  to  allow  classification  of  most  of  the  Mineral Resources as Indicated.  Composites located within the wireframes were plotted on an inclined southlooking section in the dip plane of the mineralized wireframes and reviewed for their spatial distribution and  spacing.    Where  SLR  deemed  that  the  spacing  was  insufficient  to  establish  grade  and  geological continuity with confidence (generally &gt;50 m), the Mineral Resource was classified as Inferred.

## 14.2.11 Block Model Validation

SLR carried out a number of block model validation procedures including:

- · Visual comparisons of block Net Value, Pr, Nd, Eu, Tb, Dy, Er, and Lu versus composite grades
- · Statistical comparisons of Dy, Pr, and Nd
- · Comparison of Dy, Pr, and Nd block and composite grades in blocks containing composites

Block model grades were visually examined and compared with composite grades in cross section and in elevation plans.  SLR found grade continuity to be reasonable and confirmed that the block grades were reasonably consistent with local drill hole and channel sample assay and composite grades.  Figure 14-20 shows a plan view with composites and estimated block values for Net Value at -35 m elevation.  Figure 14-21 shows a cross section, looking west, with composites and estimated block values for Net Value at 580,500 m E.

Grade statistics for Dy, Pr, and Nd assays, composites, and resource blocks were examined and compared for the mineralized wireframe models, as shown in Table 14-23.  The comparisons of average grades of length weighted assays, composites, and blocks are reasonable in SLR's opinion.

Notes::

- 1. CIM (2014) definitions were followed for Mineral Resources.
- 2. Open Pit Mineral Resources were reported inside a resource shell at pit discard Net Value cut-off value of $260/t. Underground Mineral Resources were constrained with mineralization wireframes below the resource shell and validated using underground mining solids based on a Net Value cut-off value of $335/t.  Both cut-off values account for all processing, G&amp;A, refining, and transportation charges.  Mining costs were assumed at $6.50/t ore mined and $5.00/t waste mined for open pit and $75.00/t for underground
- 3. Net Value values were assigned to blocks using metal prices, metallurgical recoveries, payables (as shown in their respective sections of this Technical Report) for each individual element.
- 4. A minimum mining width of two metres was used for both open pit and underground.
- 5. A bulk density of 2.71 t/m 3 was used.
- 6. Revenue attributable to Pr, Nd, Dy, and Tb represent 92% of the total revenue.
- 7. Mineral Resources that are not Mineral Reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability.
- 8. Totals may not add or multiply accurately due to rounding.

## 16.0 MINING METHODS

Mining  is  proposed  to  be  carried  out  at  Deep  Fox  and  Foxtrot  using  a  combination  of  open  pit  and underground methods.  Mining will first take place at Deep Fox using open pit and underground methods over a period of approximately 11 years.  Open pit operations at Foxtrot will commence in the last two years  of  the  Deep  Fox  underground  operation.    Once  mining  is  completed  at  Deep  Fox,  mining  will transition completely to Foxtrot to extend the mine life an additional 15 years (six years open pit and nine years underground) for an overall mine life of approximately 26 years.

## 16.1 Open Pit Mining

## 16.1.1 Mining Method

The open pit mining production rate is assumed to be 720,000 tpa, or 2,000 tpd, of REE bearing material. For the purposes of this Technical Report, it is assumed that mining would be carried out year-round, however, given the relatively low production rate, there is the possibility of carrying out mining over a condensed period (six months) to avoid harsher conditions during the winter season.

Run of mine (ROM) mineralized material will be placed in a stockpile adjacent to the Primary Production Plant located near Deep Fox.  ROM material will be fed to the concentrator using a front-end loader (FEL).

Mining will be carried out by a contractor using conventional truck and shovel open pit methods consisting of the following activities:

- · Drilling performed by conventional production drills
- · Blasting using ammonium nitrate fuel oil (ANFO) and a down-hole delay initiation system
- · Loading and hauling operations performed with hydraulic shovel, FEL, and rigid frame haulage trucks

The production equipment will be supported by bulldozers, graders, and water trucks.  Search Minerals will supervise the overall mining operation with its own employees including mining engineers, geologists, surveyors, and support staff.

## 16.1.2 Mine Design

## 16.1.2.1 Whittle Optimization

Open pit optimization analyses were run on the Mineral Resources at Deep Fox and Foxtrot to determine the economics of extraction by open pit methods.  All categories of resource (Measured, Indicated, and Inferred) were considered in the evaluation.  In order to simplify the optimization, a Net Value attribute was built into the model, which accounts for the metal prices and recoveries of each of the REE.  The metal price forecasts were estimated by AI and expressed in terms of metal oxides.  Other pit optimization economic parameters include costs for mining (waste and mineralized material), processing (beneficiation and hydrometallurgy), G&amp;A, transportation, and REE separation.  Input parameters for pit optimization are presented in Table 16-1.  The same parameters were applied to both Deep Fox and Foxtrot.

Notes::

- 1. Pit slope angle was estimated by SLR using the benchmark standard of similar hard rock operations.
- 2. Mining unit cost was estimated by SLR at $5.00/t waste and $6.50/t mineralized, based on a quote from local contractor, escalated to 2022.  The mineralized cost is higher to cover mining overheads (geology, engineering, etc.).
- 3. Processing cost is estimated by NewPro and includes labour, maintenance, consumable costs, power, and tailings disposal.
- 4. G&amp;A cost is estimated by NewPro.
- 5. Separation Plant costs are based on an assumption of US$5.00/kg (applied to TREO) and US$20.00/kg (applied to HREO).  The numbers in the above table are based on the average resource grades.
- 6. Dilution and mining loss estimates were taken from the April 2016 NI 43-101 Technical Report on the Foxtrot Project, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada (RPA, 2016).
- 7. Exchange rate was estimated by SLR at C$1.00:US$0.80 using long term financial projections.
- 8. Value was applied to Measured, Indicated, and Inferred Mineral Resources in the optimization process.  Revenue is generated from REE mineralization.
- 9. The REE price forecast was provided by AI (October 2021).  Their forecast from 2022 to 2030 was used to reflect a long term price outlook.  An average price from 2025 to 2030 for each element established value for the Net Value calculation.
- 10. Recovery is estimated by NewPro.
- 11. Process throughput assumed 2,000 tpd or 720,000 tpa at the Primary Production Plant.
- 12. Costs used in the final cashflow vary slightly from costs used in Whittle parameters as more information was made available at the time of the cash flow evaluation.

A cut-off value of $258/t, based on the operating costs in Table 16-1, was used to determine the cut off between mineral and waste.

A simple underground trade-off study was carried out using Whittle to determine the optimal pit size in conjunction with the transition to underground mining.  As the pits deepen, the incremental stripping ratio increases.  As this strip ratio increases, Whittle compares the increased stripping costs against the cost of underground mining.   SLR assumed an underground mining cost of $75/t based on similar projects and includes consideration for some capital costs for development.

The resource model contains blocks with dimensions of 5 m x 2.5 m x 5 m.  This block size was considered reasonable to achieve an adequate selective mining unit (SMU) and was not reblocked for mine design.

A secondary constraint was applied to maintain minimum open pit mining distance of 150 m from the waterline west of Deep Fox.  Applying this constraint excluded economic material from the trade-off pit for Deep Fox which was then captured in the UG optimization analysis.  No constraints were applied at Foxtrot.

## 16.1.2.2 Pit Design

## 16.1.2.2.1 Deep Fox

A mine design for Deep Fox was carried out with the objective of minimizing strip ratios early in the mine life to achieve a short payback period. The mine design takes advantage of the shape of the deposit and utilizes 'trench' shaped pushbacks to quickly gain access to the orebody. A total of three pushbacks are used to access the Deep Fox REE bearing material.

Each phase was analyzed in relation to its strip ratio results during Whittle optimization within Deep Fox. Pit phases were selected based on the minimum amount of material needed to accrue value.  Significant changes  between  pit  shells  were  investigated  to  determine  if  the  succeeding  pit  shell  satisfies  the minimum mining width of 75 m from the preceding pit shell.  Keeping to the minimum mining width for each phase optimized the Project's NPV while avoiding congestion and safety concerns.  In general, the objective of pit phasing is to improve economics by feeding the highest grade mineral during the earlier years and deferring waste stripping towards the latter years.

A cross section view of the open pit pushbacks for Deep Fox is presented in Figure 16-1.

## 16.1.2.2.2 Foxtrot

The same pit design parameters were used for the Foxtrot Whittle optimization as were used for Deep Fox.  The ultimate pit design for Foxtrot followed the revenue factor (RF) 1 pit shell outline from the Whittle  optimization  results  based  on  the  underground  trade-off  study  using  the  $75/t  underground mining cost.  Foxtrot open pit pre-stripping of approximately 5.0 Mt will commence in the final year of operations at Deep Fox, with regular mining operations scheduled once both open pit and underground mining has been completed at Deep Fox.  The Foxtrot open pit uses a simple bench-by-bench sequence.

A cross section view of the open pit ultimate pit design for Foxtrot is presented in Figure 16-2.

Each pit ramp design for both Deep Fox and Foxtrot exit near the waste storage facility (WSF) and mine stockpile locations to minimize haul distance.  Deep Fox was designed to provide access to all pit phases at all times, which satisfies the need for concurrent phase pit mining.  Both pits utilize single-lane traffic at the bottom four benches to maintain access to high-grade material.

Pit design characteristics for both Deep Fox and Foxtrot along with WSF design characteristics are presented in Table 16-2.

## 16.1.3 Geotechnical

Pit  slope  angles  were  selected  based  on  comparable  projects  with  similar  rock  characteristics.    Pit optimizations were carried out using inter-ramp and overall pit slopes of 52° and 47°, respectively.

Design parameters for the WSFs and the overburden pile were also selected based on industry averages.

## 16.1.4 Life of Mine Plan

The life of mine (LOM) plan envisages mining Deep Fox open pit, Deep Fox underground, Foxtrot open pit, and  Foxtrot  underground  sequentially.    The  production  transition  from  open  pit  to  underground  is scheduled for Year 7 and Year 18 for Deep Fox and Foxtrot, respectively.

The schedule assumes mining in stages within Deep Fox and to the full pit outline line bench by bench in Foxtrot.  Mining in the succeeding stage within Deep Fox is scheduled only after over 90% of material in the preceding stage has been depleted.  Access to succeeding stages is accommodated through the ramp access design where pre-schedule stripping is required.  The minimum mining distance of 75 m for each pushback is designed to maintain productivity with two 374F L production excavators and seven 745 haul trucks.

Approximately 5.0 Mt of waste is planned to be stripped in the Foxtrot open pit during year 10 while Deep Fox underground production concludes.  This brings down the strip ratio for year 11 by approximately 40% as the concentrator feed shifts to Foxtrot open pit reliance.

Construction on the portal and decline to access the Deep Fox underground mine will start mid Year 7 and mineral production is planned to start by Q2 of Year 8.  The portal will be located on bench -50 m of the Deep Fox open pit mine.  The Foxtrot underground mine portal and development will be constructed starting in Q3 of Year 17 and mineral production will begin in Q3 of Year 18.  The portal will be located on Bench -60 m of the open pit mine.

The LOM open pit production schedules for Deep Fox and Foxtrot are presented in Table 16-3 and Table 16-4, respectively.

## 16.1.6 Open Pit Mining Personnel

It is envisaged that the Project will use a mine contractor for operations and supervision.  Search Minerals will provide management, engineering, geology, and grade control.  SLR assumes an additional $1.50/t for mineralized material to cover the costs for the owner's engineering and grade control.  It is assumed that mining will take place during day shifts only.

It is estimated that a small owner's team of approximately 10 to 15 people will be required for the open pit mining operations including a mine manager, production supervisor, mining engineer, geologist, and grade control personnel.  All other personnel (operators and supervisors) will be provided by the mining contractor and the estimated workforce of 62 people is based on a preliminary estimate of equipment requirements.  The estimated personnel for both contractors and owners' team are shown in Table 16-6.

## 16.1.7 Mine Infrastructure

## 16.1.7.1 Access Roads

Mineralized material will be hauled out of Deep Fox and Foxtrot using off-highway equipment.  Material deemed as waste rock will be hauled to the appropriate WSF, located either east of the Deep Fox pit or west of the Foxtrot pit.  Mineralized material will be hauled to stockpile locations south-west of the Deep Fox  pit  or  north-west  of  the  Foxtrot  pit.    The  mineralized  material  from  the  mine  stockpiles  will  be delivered to the ROM stockpile that is adjacent to the plant within the Deep Fox site layout.

Access road construction will be 7.2 km in length, providing access to highway 513 for both deposits and direct access to the port from Deep Fox.  The road width is designed to 15 m, providing operating space for both haul trucks and transport trucks.  The access roads are shown in Section 18 of this Technical Report (Figure 18-3).

## 16.1.7.2 Waste Storage Facilities and Stockpiles

Material below the Net Value cut-off of $258/t is sent  to the  WSF.    The  WSF  design  parameters  are provided in Table 16-2.  Deep Fox's waste storage capacity is approximately 27 Mt, leaving additional capacity for contingencies in the schedule, and reaches a maximum height of 90 m.  The waste storage capacity  for  Foxtrot  is  approximately  25  Mt  with  a  similar  accounting  for  contingency  and  reaches  a maximum height of 155 m.

A stockpile at each mine site is used for storage of mineralized material when mining of mineral exceeds the 720 ktpa processing capacity.  The ROM stockpile capacity is between 375 kt and 400 kt, excluding harbour storage capacity.

## 16.1.7.3 Dewatering

For each open pit, a pumping network will be installed to pump run-off water from the open pits.  Pumped water will be directed through water treatment systems, comprising settling/polishing ponds, prior to release into the environment.

## 16.1.7.4 Explosives and Detonators

Explosives product will consist of ANFO and emulsion explosives coupled with a downhole delay initiation system.  It  will  be  the  contractor's  responsibility  to  store  explosives  a  safe  distance  away  from  the operation and provide appropriate facilities for containment.

All applications for permits required for the transportation, storage, and use of explosives are submitted directly  by  the  designated  explosives  contractor  for  the  Project  directly  to  Natural  Resources  Canada (NRCAN).

## 16.2 Underground Mining

## 16.2.1 Mining Method

Transverse longhole stopes will be mined using primary and secondary stopes and mining will progress from the lowest level of each mining panel and progress in a bottom-up fashion.  Each mining panel consists of three to four stoping levels.  Primary stopes will be mined first, starting from the bottom level and progressing vertically to  the top.    Once  a  vertical  column  of  primary  stopes  has  been  mined  the secondary stopes on either side will be mined.  Transverse longhole mining allows for greater flexibility with the number of stopes that can be mined at any given time.

Longitudinal longhole stopes will be mined using a drive on each sublevel driven along the strike of the orebody.  Mining will progress in a bottom-up sequence where stopes on the first level of each mining panel will be mined first before progressing to the next level.

A crown pillar of 25 m in height will be left under the bottom of the pit, which can be recovered by drilling upward from the first level of mining at the end of the LOM.

Cemented rock fill (CRF) and unconsolidated rock fill (URF) will be used to satisfy backfill requirements at Deep Fox and Foxtrot.  CRF with a binder content of 6% will be used in all stopes on the first level of each mining panel so as to provide a competent back for stopes on the level below.  CRF will be placed in transverse  primary  stopes  and  every  20  m  for  longitudinal  stopes.    The  remaining  secondary  and longitudinal stopes will be filled with URF.  The rock fill will come from both underground development waste and open pit waste material.

Ramp and lateral development will be undertaken using twin boom hydraulic jumbos and mechanical bolters  for  installation  of  ground  support.    Vertical  development  such  as  ventilation  raises  will  be developed with Alimaks.

Stope production drilling will be carried out using longhole top hammer drills and slot raises will be drilled using V-30 ITH drills.  Loading and hauling operations will be performed with load-haul-dump (LHD) units and underground trucks for waste and mineral material up to surface.  Stopes will be backfilled using waste material from both underground and open pit operations and will be trucked to the appropriate locations.

## 16.2.2 Mine Design

Underground mining operations have been envisaged for mineralization not captured by open pit mining for both Deep Fox and Foxtrot.  The production rate for the underground mines is assumed to be 720,000 tpa, or 2,000 tpd, of REE bearing material and will operate year-round.  The underground mines will be owner operated.

Longitudinal and isometric views of the Deep Fox and Foxtrot underground mines are illustrated in Figure 16-3 to Figure 16-6.

## 16.2.2.1 Stope Design

Deep Fox has a general dip of 75° to the south while Foxtrot generally dips at 70° the north.  The deposits consist of a main core zone flanked by two smaller hanging and footwall zones.  The core zone average widths for Deep Fox and Foxtrot are 13 m and 15 m, respectively, while the hanging wall and footwall zones average five metres.

Search Minerals Inc. | Deep Fox and Foxtrot Project, SLR Project No:  233.03512.R0000

NI 43-101 Technical Report -  July 18, 2022 16-13

Considering the geometry, continuity, and average width of the mineralized zones, both deposits are amenable to longhole mining methods.  Sublevel stoping using transverse accesses will be used for areas where stope widths exceed ten metres while narrower stopes will be accessed using a longitudinal access.

Stope design was completed using Deswik Stope Optimizer (DSO).  DSO uses parameters such as minimum stope dimensions, cut-off grade, and dip and strike ranges to determine the optimum stope size.  Table 16-7 shows the parameters used to create the stopes.

## 16.2.2.2 Dilution

Dilution  assumptions  of  0.75  m  were  added  to  the  hanging  wall  and  footwall  individually  during  the optimization process.  The HW and FW dilution will be at grade depending on how the resulting shapes intersect the block model.  An additional 5% dilution factor at zero grade was added to stopes that are planned to be mined adjacent to mined out and backfilled stopes to account for backfill dilution.

## 16.2.2.3 Extraction

An extraction factor of 95% was assumed for all stopes.

## 16.2.2.4 Development Design

The underground access portals for both mines will be located within the open pits.  Ramps will be driven at a gradient of 15%.  Level accesses will be driven from the ramps, approximately in the middle of the level, and will accommodate truck loading stations and ventilation drifts.  Footwall drifts will be driven on

<!-- image -->

either side of the level access and extend to the ends of the mineralized zone.  Drawpoints will be driven from the footwall drifts to the stopes for mucking.  Where mining progresses below a mined out level, once the stopes are completely mined out and backfilled, transverse accesses will be driven from the same footwall drifts downwards for drilling off stopes on the lower level.

## 16.2.2.5 Backfill

CRF and URF will be used for backfill requirements at Deep Fox and Foxtrot.  CRF with a binder content of 6% will be used in all stopes on the first level of each mining panel so as to provide a competent back for stopes on the level below.  CRF will be placed in transverse primary stopes and every 20 m for longitudinal stopes.  The remaining secondary and longitudinal stopes will be filled with URF.  The rock fill will come from both underground development waste and open pit waste.

## 16.2.3 Geomechanics

No geomechanical information was available for review for Deep Fox and Foxtrot.

Industry  average  geotechnical  conditions  for  the  underground  mine  were  assumed  relative  to  stope dimensions, minimum distance of drifts to the stope hanging wall, and ground support.

## 16.2.4 Life of Mine Plan

The LOM envisages mining Deep Fox open pit, Deep Fox underground, Foxtrot open pit, and Foxtrot underground sequentially.  The production transition from open pit to underground is scheduled for Year 7 and Year 18 for Deep Fox and Foxtrot, respectively.

Construction on the portal and decline to access the Deep Fox underground mine will start mid Year 7 and mineral production is planned to start by Q2 of Year 8.  The portal will be located on bench -50 m of the Deep Fox open pit mine.  The Foxtrot underground mine portal and development will be constructed starting in Q3 of Year 17 and mineral production will begin in Q3 of Year 18.  The portal will be located on Bench -60 m of the open pit mine.

Pre-production development for both Deep Fox and Foxtrot will be undertaken using contractor services. Once development has reached production levels, underground mining will be owner operated.  Mining operations will be carried out in two 12 hour shifts, seven days a week.   The LOM underground production schedule for Deep Fox and Foxtrot are presented in Table 16-8 and Table 16-9, respectively.

## 16.2.7 Mine Infrastructure

## 16.2.7.1 Material Handling

The mucking, loading, and hauling operations out of the underground mine, for both mineral material and waste, will be done with the underground mobile equipment.  From stopes or development faces, mineral and waste will be loaded with LHDs into underground trucks at dedicated loading set-ups and will be hauled to surface via the main ramp into the process feed stockpile or on the WSF.

<!-- image -->

## 16.2.7.2 Ventilation

The  main  ventilation  system  will  be  located  at  surface  beside  the  ventilation  raise.    The  ventilation network will be in positive pressure.  A variable drive motor will be used to adjust the rate of the air flow to suit the ventilation needs during the various phases of the Project.  A heating system using propane will be installed as part of the ventilation system.

A 2.8 m x 2.8 m Alimak raise will connect at each production level down to the bottom of the underground mine.  This ventilation raise, equipped with a manway, will be required to start production work, because it will also serve as a second emergency egress.

Fresh  air  intake  will  circulate  via  the  main  raise  and  supply  the  active  levels  with  fresh  air  through secondary ventilation ducting and booster fans.  Air will exhaust via a ventilation raise to surface and the main ramp.

Prior to the main ventilation system being ready, an appropriate temporary ventilation system will be installed at the entrance of the ramp to meet the development work requirements.

## 16.2.7.3 Power Distribution

The underground main power will be at 4.16 kV, 3 phases, 60 Hz.  Primary electric power will be distributed underground via the main ramp and from boreholes.  This approach is advisable because of the long distances to cover.

As required, portable substations on skids will be used to transform the 4,160 V to 600 V for local use before permanent substations will be strategically located within the underground mine.  From there, the reticulation network to end-uses will be resistor-grounded for more safety.

## 16.2.7.4 Dewatering

Main water pumping stations will be installed underground at every five to six levels to keep the mine dry. The pumping stations will be fitted with identical pumps resulting in a flexible network and be made of portable modules on skids equipped with enough pumps to meet pressure and flow rate requirements.

Sumps will be located in the level accesses and linked by drainage holes with one another.  The pumped water will be directed through the water treatment system at surface via borehole raises prior its release into the environment.

## 16.2.7.5 Compressed Air

A compressor for the underground operations will be located in a dedicated building annexed to the processing  plant.    Compressed  air  will  be  brought  underground  through  pipes  via  the  main  ramp. Underground levels will be serviced by smaller compressed air pipes.

## 16.2.7.6 Explosives and Detonators

During the underground pre-production period, the open pit mine explosives magazines located at surface will be used for underground mining operations.  Once the underground mine has been appropriately developed, permanent storage magazines will be built underground.

Suppliers  will  deliver  explosives  and  detonators  to  the  mine  portal  where  they  will  be  immediately transferred into the underground mine service truck.  Explosives and detonators will then be immediately hauled underground for storage until use.

## 16.2.7.7 Communications

The main communication system will combine the use of data networking (Ethernet for computer and automation network), voice (portable radio), and video (IP camera).  For emergency phone service, a separate cable will be installed from the foreman's office at surface to the refuge stations underground.

## 16.2.7.8 Refuge Station

The  refuge  stations  will  be  located  on  level  accesses  to  ensure  the  safety  of  the  personnel  and  to accommodate lunch breaks.  Two portable refuge stations will be used throughout the mine and will be moved accordingly as mining progresses.

## 16.3 Life of Mine Plan

The LOM production plan considers a ramp-up in Year 1 at 75% of capacity (540,000 tpa) and reaching full production of 720,000 tpa in Year 2.  Total REE-bearing material mined in the open pit and underground is 10.0 Mt and 8.1 Mt, respectively, for a total of 18.1 Mt over the 26-year mine life.  The average Net Value over this period is $756/t.

## 17.0 RECOVERY METHODS

NewPro Consulting &amp; Engineering Services Pty Ltd. (NewPro) provided Search Minerals with a report entitled 'Search Minerals Inc., Fox Harbour Rare Earths Project, Processing Plant Scoping Study Update' identified as Revision C and Issued on January 25, 2022 (NewPro Report).  The NewPro Report has formed the basis for this Section with only minor edits or summarizing of the NewPro Report.  SLR has provided a commentary at the end of this section.

The NewPro Report discusses two processing facilities.  The first facility is a physical separation plant that is located in Labrador, which NewPro refers to as the 'Port Marnham Concentrator Facility' in its report. Search Minerals is currently undertaking an assessment of port alternatives in Labrador, and SLR has been asked to assume that the existing dock in Fox Harbour (St. Lewis) would be upgraded to meet the needs of the Project.  This processing facility will be referred throughout this Technical Report as the 'Primary Production Plant'.

The second process plant in the NewPro Report was based on a location at Argentia, Newfoundland. Search Minerals is currently reviewing alternative brownfield locations on the island of Newfoundland and SLR will refer to this plant as the 'Hydrometallurgical Processing Plant'.

## 17.1 Key Process Design Criteria

Mineralized material from Deep Fox and Foxtrot will be processed through a beneficiation system using physical means followed by hydrometallurgical processing to form a marketable precipitate of mixed REE carbonate.  The beneficiation operation will take place in a plant constructed near the deposits in Labrador - the Primary Production Plant.  Mineral concentrates will be transported to a plant at a brownfield site on the island of Newfoundland located close to a source of reagents and power for hydrometallurgical processing.  As previously mentioned, the exact location of the Hydrometallurgical Processing Plant has not yet been selected.

The key process design criteria are presented in Table 17-1.

## 17.2.1 Comminution

The objective of the Primary Crushing Area will be to reduce ROM mineral in one stage of crushing to a size suitable for further size reduction in the milling circuit.  Operating approximately 19.4 h/d, the Primary Crushing circuit will deliver crushed mineral at 80% passing (P80) of 210 mm directly to the subsequent milling  circuit.    The  primary  crusher  has  been  designed  to  process  the  plant  capacity  with  a  design availability of 95% and a utilisation of 97% for an overall utilisation of 92.2%.

Open pit mineral will be loaded at the mine onto trucks and hauled to a ROM mineral pad situated close to the crushing facility.  Mineral will then be loaded into the ROM bin by a FEL.  The primary crusher will be in building and serviced by an overhead traversing service crane of 10 t capacity.

Loading of mineral to the ROM bin will be controlled by the crusher operator who will activate tipping light indicators from the crusher control room.  Live capacity of the ROM bin will be approximately 100 t, providing a maximum of 66 minutes of surge capacity at normal crusher throughput.

Ore in the ROM bin will be fed to a 1060 mm x 700 mm Jaw Crusher via a vibrating grizzly feeder.  Grizzly undersize will pass directly to the Primary Crushed mineral Conveyer.  Grizzly oversize will roll into the primary jaw crusher.  The crusher is to be capable of crushing mineral at a maximum design rate of 110 t/h with an average feed rate of 90 t/h.  The Primary Crusher will discharge onto the Primary Crushed mineral Conveyer which will then discharge to the Semi-Autogenous Grinding (SAG) Mill Feed Conveyer. The SAG Mill Feed Conveyor will feature a belt magnet to remove tramp metal that may be potentially damaging to downstream equipment.

The SAG mill will be five metres in diameter, have an effective grinding length of 3.7 m and be equipped with an 1,120 kW motor.  SAG mill discharge will be further ground in a ball mill that will be 4.2 m diameter with an effective grinding length of 6.2 m and equipped with a 1,700 kW motor.  Ball mill discharge will be classified to 80% passing 53 µm in  hydrocyclones with the underflow returned to the mill and the overflow sent to magnetic separation.

Dust emission control in the crushing and mill feed area will be provided by a fan forced dust extraction system consisting of a single dry bag house.  Captured dust will be fed onto the SAG mill feed conveyor.

Sump pumps will be provided in the basement level of the crushing building and milling building to remove dust collected by washdown of the respective areas and any spillage.

## 17.2.2 Wet Magnetic Separation

REE concentrate will be produced by a two-stage magnetic separation process.  A Low Intensity Magnetic Separation (LIMS) rougher-cleaner circuit will first remove magnetite and maghemite from the mineral to produce  an  intermediate  ferromagnetic  concentrate  which  may  have  the  potential  for  resale  (not currently considered in this PEA).  LIMS tailings containing the REE minerals will then be fed to a Wet High Intensity Magnetic Separation (WHIMS) system to produce a concentrate containing the bulk of the REE's.

## 17.2.3 WHIMS Concentrate Solid/Liquid Separation

WHIMS concentrate will be thickened and filtered.  The filter cake will be stockpiled in a concentrate storage shed with a capacity of 100,000 t (sufficient for 202 days of production).  During the springsummer-fall months (8-month window), the concentrate will be loaded into up to 15,000 t capacity bulk carriers  for  ocean  transport  to  the  site  of  the  Hydrometallurgical  Processing  Plant  on  the  island  of Newfoundland.

Ship loading will be done by loading concentrate in the storage shed into 'bulking-in bins' which in turn discharge onto a conveying system connected to a ship-loader.  The ship-loader will sit on a fixed barge and discharge into ships holds as directed by the captain.

## 17.2.4 Tailings Separation

Tailings will be thickened and filtered.  The filter cake will be transported by truck and placed in a Tailings Storage Facility (TSF).

<!-- image -->

## 17.2.5 Tailings Disposal

Tailings will be thickened and filtered.  The filter cake will be transported by truck and placed in a TSF located adjacent to the process plant.  The process concept is to stockpile plant tailings on the ROM pad for back-loading removal by truck to a tailings disposal area.  A suitable FEL will be provided in process plant mobile equipment list to load tailings.  No detailed designs were carried out at this level of study. Further design work will be required to determine the geotechnical parameters for the TSF as well as any other design criteria.

SLR has made an allowance in the capital and operating costs to manage tailings at the Primary Production Plant.

## 17.2.6 Reagents

Flocculant will be mixed and stored in a flocculant mixing system.  Flocculant will be pumped to the various addition points in the circuit by dedicated flocculant dosing pumps.  Duty and standby pumps are provided for each duty point.  Further work is required to test different flocculant types, particularly for low pH duties compared with more neutral pH duties.

## 17.2.7 Labour

The estimated labour force for the Primary Production Plant is based on a combination of shift work (12hour shifts) and a regular 5x2 schedule for certain positions as indicated by 'Shift (D/N)' and 'Day' in Table 17-2.  A total of 53 people is expected to be employed for the Primary Production Plant.

## 17.3 Hydrometallurgical Processing Plant

A  block  diagram  illustrating  the  proposed  flowsheet  for  the  Hydrometallurgical  Processing  Plant  is provided as Figure 17-2.

Figure 17-2:

<!-- image -->

## 17.3.1 Concentrate Handling

WHIMS concentrate will be delivered to a port proximate to the Hydrometallurgical Processing Plant in bulk carriers with capacity up to 15,000 t.  The concentrate will be unloaded and stored in a shed with a capacity of 100,000 t.

## 17.3.2 Acid Bake

The WHIMS concentrate will be conveyed to the inlet feed of the duty Paddle Mixer (pug mill) where it will be mixed with 256 kg/t of sulphuric acid.  Because of the high wear characteristics of the ore, a standby pug mill will be provided.

The  discharge  of  the  duty  pug  mill  will  gravitate  to  the  feed  chute  of  the  acid  bake  kiln,  where  the concentrate mineral will be heated to 215°C for a period of 150 minutes.  The kiln will be indirectly fired with diesel to minimize dusting from the kiln.  The cooled kiln off-gas will be treated in a wet scrubber where the gas is to be scrubbed with magnesium carbonate slurry (which is then to be recirculated to the impurity removal step).

<!-- image -->

The kiln will discharge to an agitated repulp tank where the kiln product is quenched and slurried in water. The slurried feed will be pumped to the water leach circuit.  Test work has indicated that key REE-bearings minerals will be sulphated such that 93% of the Pr and Nd and other LREE, as well as Tb and Dy, will be rendered water soluble.  Solubilization of the HREE will be progressively rather lower with Lu sulphation at approximately 65%.

The repulped solids will then be pumped to Water Leach Tank 1 by the duty Water Leach Feed Pump.

## 17.3.3 Water Leach &amp; Impurity Removal

## 17.3.3.1 Water Leach

The repulped acid bake discharge will be leached in a single train of cascaded agitated leach reactors, consisting of six tanks that operate at approximately 20% w/w solids and 90°C with a leach residence time of 24 hr.  Rare earth extractions will be as noted above in the acid bake area reaction extents.

The concentration of the remaining sulphuric acid in the water leach discharge will be controlled to 8 g/L with  the  objective  of  minimising  the  magnesium  carbonate  consumption  in  the  subsequent  impurity removal stage.

## 17.3.3.2 Impurity Removal

The water leach discharge will be further treated in a single train of cascaded agitated reactors for the purpose of impurity removal consisting of four tanks that operate at approximately 20% w/w solids and 90°C, these will provide a reactor residence time of two hours.  The recycle stream from a downstream aluminium  precipitation  step  will  consume  part  of  the  sulphuric  acid  to  re-leach  aluminium  and coprecipitated REOs.  The remaining sulphuric acid will be consumed by magnesium carbonate that is to be added to the impurity removal tanks to raise the pH to 3.9.

It is expected that the impurity removal circuit will precipitate 100% of the Fe, 92% of the Th, 60% of the Al, 16% of the U, along with approximately 2% of the key REE such as Nd.

## 17.3.3.3 Leach Residue Solid/Liquid Separation

Leach  residue  slurry  from  the  final  Impurity  Removal  Tank  will  gravitate  to  the  Impurity  Removal Thickener.  The contained solids will then settle with the aid of flocculant and the thickener will produce an underflow of approximately 65% w/w solids.

The underflow will then be pumped to the Impurity Removal Filter Surge Tank, which will have a retention time of 8 hr to allow for filter maintenance.  The Impurity Removal Filter proposed is a horizontal belt filter which will separate the residue solids from the process liquor containing the REE metal values of economic interest.  Residual entrained (dissolved) metal values will be recovered by washing the solids residue with wash water in three countercurrent stages.

A solids residue filter cake at 20 % w/w moisture is targeted from the belt filter.  The solids residue will fall onto the Filter Cake Transfer Conveyor, and the cake is transported to the Tailings Treatment System.

The  Impurity  Removal  Thickener  overflow,  which  will  contain  the  leached  REEs,  will  gravitate  to  the Thickener Overflow Tank, from where it will be pumped at a controlled rate to the first REE Precipitation circuit.

<!-- image -->

## 17.3.4 First REE Precipitation

The impurity removal thickener overflow will be further treated in a single train of cascaded agitated reactors, consisting of six tanks that will operate at approximately 1% w/w solids and 50 ºC, and provide a reactor residence time of 1.5 hr.  The rare earths will be precipitated by the addition of sodium carbonate into the REE precipitation tanks where the pH will be raised to 6.5.

The first REE Precipitation circuit will result in very close to 100% of the REE, Al, and Fe being precipitated into a high-grade REE precipitate.

Slurry  from  the  final  REE  Precipitation  Tank  will  gravitate  to  the  REE  Precipitation  Thickener.    The contained solids will then settle with the aid of flocculant; and the thickener will produce an underflow containing approximately 7.5% w/w solids.

The thickener underflow will then be pumped to the REE Precipitation Filter Surge Tank, which will have a retention time of 8 hr.  The REE Precipitation Filter will separate the precipitated solids from the process liquor; with the solids containing the REE metal values of interest.  Entrained gangue metal values will be removed by washing the REE Precipitate with wash water.  The filtered solids will be washed to limit transfer of soluble gangue components to downstream processing.

An REE Filter Cake at 78% w/w moisture is targeted from a plate and frame filter.  The filter cake will be periodically discharged and then fed at a controlled rate into a repulp tank where the filter cake will be repulped with demineralised water and pumped to the REE re-leach feed box.  Wash liquor and primary filtrate from the REE Precipitate Filter will be recycled back to the REE Precipitate Thickener.  The REE Precipitate Thickener overflow, that will contain minor amounts of REEs, will gravitate to the Thickener Overflow Tank from where it will be pumped at a controlled rate to the Demineralised water circuit.  In this circuit the process water will be treated and the majority of the water recycled to the water leach.

## 17.3.5 REE Releaching

In the next process step, the washed REE Precipitate will be leached in a single train of cascaded agitated reactors, consisting of four tanks that operate at approximately 1% w/w solids, 50 ºC and provide a leach residence time of 1.6 hr.  The rare earths will be releached using sulphuric acid.  The objective of this circuit  is  to  dissolve  the  REE  in  a  high-grade  solution  to  allow  further  purification.    Some  silica (approximately 90%) will report to the leach residue solids.  The releach circuit will operate at a target pH of 1.0.

Following  REE  re-leach,  the  slurry  pH  will  be  raised  to  3.5  with  magnesium  carbonate  to  precipitate residual silica, iron and to a minor extent aluminium.

Slurry from the final REE Releach Tank will gravitate to the REE Releach Thickener.  The contained solids will then settle with the aid of flocculant to produce an underflow containing approximately 30% w/w solids.

The underflow will then be pumped to the REE Releach Filter Surge Tank, which will have a retention time of 8 hr.  The REE Releach Filter will separate the unreacted solids from the process liquor; the solid will contain a range of unleached gangue elements.  Residual entrained REE metal values are recovered by washing the REE releach residue with acidic wash water to remove entrained soluble REE from the primary precipitate.

NI 43-101 Technical Report -  July 18, 2022 17-8

<!-- image -->

A REE releach residue filter cake at 50% w/w moisture will be targeted from the plate and frame filter. The filter cake will be repulped and transferred back to the Water Leach Circuit.  Wash liquor and primary filtrate from the REE Releach Filter will be recycled back to the REE Releach Thickener.

The REE releach thickener overflow, comprising a concentrated stream of partially purified REEs, will gravitate  to  the  Thickener  Overflow  Tank,  from  where  it  will  be  pumped  at  a  controlled  rate  to  the purification circuit where uranium, thorium and zinc contaminants are to be removed.

## 17.3.6 Solution Purification

## 17.3.6.1 Uranium CCIX

A Continuous Counter-current Ion Exchange (CCIX) system will be used for the removal of uranium from the releach solution.  The CCIX system will be supplied with polystyrene divinylbenzene co-polymerised crosslinked  resin  beads  functionalized  with  amine-based  chemistry  to  impart  an  anion  exchange capability.  The resin will extract uranium and (depending upon resin selection) zirconium, thorium, and molybdenum.   Resin  loading  and  uptake  efficiency  is  pH  dependent.    Regeneration  of  the  resin  and removal of the uranium, thorium and zirconium will be achieved through passing strong sulphuric acid through the resin.  After elution the resin will be rinsed with water prior to being returned to service.

The uranium strip liquor flowrate is low at less than 0.3 m3/h and is directed to the tailings neutralization system where the uranium is precipitated in a stable form.  Additional test work is needed to define exact conditions.

## 17.3.6.2 Thorium Removal

A solvent extraction (SX) circuit, including extraction, washing, and stripping stages, for removal of residual thorium has been designed.  Test work data has been used to set SX circuit performance and reagent concentrations.  A pulsed column circuit comprising one extraction one wash and one strip column has been selected for the duty.

The test work indicated that a 1% concentration of Primene JMT is required to recover 99.7% of the thorium from the PLS in the extract circuit.  Coextraction of some REE will also occur.  The extraction circuit will comprise three theoretical stages of extraction and will operate at an organic to aqueous ratio of 0.2:1. Raffinate will be sent forward to the next stage of purification - zinc precipitation.

The  organic  will  be  transferred  to  a  two-stage  wash  column,  which  will  be  adequate  for  removal  of coextracted REE at the wash ratio nominated.  Two stages of washing are proposed to maximize REE removal.  A wash ratio of 0.67:1 for a wash liquor of 25 g/L sulphuric acid is to be used to remove REE contained in the organic; bleed from the wash will join the raffinate.

Two theoretical stages of stripping in the strip column will remove the thorium from the loaded organic. An advance concentration of 0.186 g/L thorium will result from the operating conditions proposed.  The strip liquor will contain 9.13 g/L hydrochloric acid.

The thorium strip liquor will be pumped to the tailings neutralization system where it is precipitated in a stable form.  Additional test work is needed to define exact conditions.

## 17.3.6.3 Zinc Precipitation

The thorium raffinate will be pumped to the zinc precipitation circuit, which will consist of a single bank of four cascaded agitated reactors operating at 45 ºC.  The first tank, with 1 h residence time will be used

NI 43-101 Technical Report -  July 18, 2022 17-9

<!-- image -->

to deaerate the incoming solution in order to facilitate zinc precipitation using hydrogen sulphide.  The thorium raffinate will be adjusted to a pH of 3 using sodium carbonate.

Slurry  from  the  final  Zinc  Precipitation  Tank  will  gravitate  to  the  Zinc  Precipitation  Thickener.    The contained solids will then settle with the aid of flocculant to an underflow containing approximately 50 % w/w solids.

The underflow will then be pumped to the Zinc Precipitation Filter Surge Tank, which will have a retention time of 8 hr.  The Zinc Precipitation Filter will separate the precipitated solids from the process liquor; the solids  containing  precipitated  zinc,  lead  and  minor  REE.    Some  entrained  REE  metal  values  will  be recovered by washing the zinc precipitate with wash solution.

Zinc Filter Cake at 20% w/w moisture is targeted from the plate and frame filter.  The filter cake will be combined with the impurity removal tailings.  Wash liquor and primary filtrate from the Zinc Precipitation Filter will be recycled back to the Zinc Precipitation Thickener.

The zinc precipitation thickener overflow, containing the REEs, will gravitate to the Thickener Overflow Tank from which it will be pumped at a controlled rate to the aluminium precipitation circuit, where the remaining aluminium will be removed.

## 17.3.6.4 Final Purification and REE Recovery

In order to reduce the level of aluminium in the final REE product, the pH of the pregnant liquor solution (PLS) will be raised to 5.0 to 5.2 using sodium carbonate, which will effectively precipitate the majority of the aluminium.  Coprecipitation of REE will, however, be significant and the precipitate will need to be recycled to redissolve the coprecipitated REE.  Further work is required to:

- · Minimize  aluminium  extraction  in  the  first instance (control of temperature,  Eh,  ferric concentration)
- · Consider alternative aluminium precipitants such as phosphate
- · Minimize coprecipitation of REE

The precipitation step will occur in a bank of four cascaded agitated reactors operating at 35°C and 1.5 hr residence time.

Slurry  from  the  final  Aluminium  Precipitation  Tanks  will  gravitate  to  the  Aluminium  Precipitation Thickener.    The  contained  solids  will  then  settle  with  the  aid  of  flocculant  to  realise  an  underflow containing approximately 30% w/w solids (assumed).  The thickener underflow will then be pumped to the Aluminium Precipitation Filter Surge Tank, which will have a retention time of 8 hours.  The Aluminium Precipitation  Filter  will  separate  the  precipitated  solids  from  the  process  liquor;  the  solids  containing significant coprecipitated REE.

A Filter Cake of 50% w/w moisture is targeted from the plate and frame filter.  The filter cake will be repulped and transferred back to the Water Leach Circuit to recover the coprecipitated REE.  Wash liquor and  primary  filtrate  from  the  Aluminium  Precipitation  Filter  will  be  recycled  back  to  the  Aluminium Precipitation Thickener.  The Aluminium Precipitation Thickener overflow, containing the bulk of the REEs, will gravitate to the Thickener Overflow Tank from where it will be pumped at a controlled rate to the REE Carbonate Precipitation circuit.

The purified REE solution is then to be treated with sodium carbonate to raise the pH to 6.0 to precipitate the REE as a hydrated REE carbonate.  The precipitation will occur in a bank of four cascaded agitated reactors operating at 30°C and 1.5 hr residence time.

Search Minerals Inc. | Deep Fox and Foxtrot Project, SLR Project No:  233.03512.R0000

NI 43-101 Technical Report -  July 18, 2022 17-10

<!-- image -->

Slurry from the final REE Carbonate Precipitation Tank will gravitate to the REE Carbonate Precipitation Thickener.  The contained solids will then settle with the aid of flocculant to an underflow containing approximately 40% w/w solids (assumed).

The underflow will then be pumped to the REE Carbonate Filter Surge Tank, which will have a retention time of 8 hr.  The REE Carbonate Filter will then separate the precipitated solids from the process liquor.

An REE Carbonate Filter Cake at 50% w/w moisture is targeted from the plate and frame filter.  This will then be fed into a drier before being bagged, containerised, and shipped to a refiner.  Wash liquor and primary filtrate from the REE Carbonate Filter will be recycled back to the REE Carbonate Thickener.  The REE Carbonate Thickener overflow will be pumped at a controlled rate back to the water leach.

## 17.3.6.5 Tailings treatment

The slurry following the acid-bake, water leach, impurity removal process is directed to a thickener which separates the REE-bearing pregnant solution from the tailings solids.   The thickener underflow is filtered with the solution returned to the thickener and the solids directed to a series of tailings neutralization tanks.  The thickener overflow containing the dissolved REE is directed to the First REE Precipitation step. Waste solutions from the uranium and thorium removal systems are combined with the filter cake and reagents such as phosphate and lime are added to precipitate and stabilize dissolved species.  The slurry is then filtered with solids taken to a dry-stack tailings system and the filtrate re-used in the plant.

## 17.3.7 Reagents

## 17.3.7.1 Flocculant

Flocculant will be mixed and stored in a flocculant mixing system.  The mixed flocculant will be stored in the flocculant storage tank.  Flocculant will be pumped to the various addition points in the circuit by dedicated flocculant dosing pumps.

## 17.3.7.2 Magnesium Carbonate

Magnesium Carbonate will be supplied in bulk and shipped to site.  It will be unloaded into a bulk reagent storage shed via a common ship unloader to be located on the wharf and a system of conveyors.  A long reagent shed will be provided for bulk reagent storage with three main compartments and two annexes. Magnesium carbonate will be reclaimed from the stockpile using a FEL and discharged into a hopper. Magnesium carbonate will then be withdrawn from the hopper at a controlled rate (screw conveyor) and fed into a mixing tank where the magnesium carbonate will be mixed to 25% w/w.  Once a batch is mixed, the slurried magnesium carbonate will be transferred to a storage tank.  Dedicated dosing pumps that supply usage points within the process plant will then distribute this reagent.  A ring main may also be considered in the next phase.

In SLR's opinion, it may be more cost-effective to use magnesium oxide, and this should be considered at the next stage of study.

## 17.3.7.3 Sulphuric Acid

Sulphur will be supplied in bulk and shipped to site.  It will be unloaded into a bulk reagent storage shed via a common pneumatic ship unloader to be located on the wharf and a system of conveyors.  Sulphur will  then  be  reclaimed  from  a  stockpile  using  a  FEL  and  discharged  into  a  hopper.    Sulphur  will  be

<!-- image -->

withdrawn from the hopper at a controlled rate and fed into a sulphur melting and filtration train of steam heated tanks.

The molten filtered sulphur will then be fed to the molten sulphur storage tank.  From here the sulphur will be pumped to the sulphur burner of a standard sulphuric acid plant.

The acid plant boiler will have the capacity to produce up to 2.5 MW of electrical power from steam generated in the process from heat reclaim of which a net 2 MW will be available to the process plant. While this links the availability of the process plant to the acid plant, it is expected that there will be grid power available at the Hydrometallurgical Processing Plant site as backup and for start-up requirements. There are also opportunities to export excess power to the grid.

The key parameters of the acid plant design for a nominal 500 t/d of WHIMS concentrate throughput are presented in Table 17-3.

Table 17-3: Modular Sulphuric Acid Plant Key Parameters Search Minerals Inc. -Deep Fox and Foxtrot Project

| Item           | Item           | Unit   | Value     |
|----------------|----------------|--------|-----------|
| Plant Capacity | Sulphuric Acid | tpd    | 180 to200 |
| Storage        | H2SO4          | m 3    | 300       |
| Gross Power    |                | MW     | 2.5       |

| Sulphur        |                | tpd    | 59        |

Liquid effluent from the cooling tower and boiler blowdown, spillage and wash-down will be collected in a sump in the acid circulation area, from where it will be pumped to the process water tank.  A separate sump will collect effluent within the acid storage tank bunded area from where it will also be pumped to appropriate wash water tanks or the water leach.

Diesel oil and plant air will be supplied to the start-up burner in the sulphur burner to pre-heat the plant during start-up.

Filter cake from the sulphur filter will be dumped into a container underneath the filter for disposal.  For start-up of the absorption section, a first fill of 300 m  of 98 % H2SO4 must be available. 3

## 17.3.7.4 Sodium Carbonate

Sodium Carbonate will be supplied in bulk, shipped to site, and then unloaded into the bulk reagent storage shed as described above.  Sodium carbonate will be reclaimed from a stockpile using a FEL and discharged into a hopper.  Sodium carbonate will then be withdrawn from the hopper at a controlled rate and fed into a mixing tank where the sodium carbonate is dissolved at a concentration of 15 % w/w.  The sodium carbonate solution will then be transferred to a storage tank.  From here dedicated dosing pumps will supply usage points within the process plant.

## 17.3.7.5 Hydrogen Peroxide

Hydrogen peroxide will be supplied to site in bulk boxes.  A full bulk box will be held as backup to the duty bulk box.  A dosing pump will provide hydrogen peroxide to the uranium precipitation circuit.

## 17.3.7.6 Hydrogen Sulphide

Bottled (compressed) hydrogen sulphide gas (H2S) will be delivered to site.  The bottles will be connected to a gas manifold and rotated as required.  Gas will be dosed via rotameters at the appropriate dosing points.

## 17.3.7.7 Phosphoric Acid

Phosphoric Acid will be supplied to site in bulk boxes.  A full bulk box will be held as backup to the duty bulk box.  Phosphoric acid will be dosed to the REE releach circuit via a dosing pump.

## 17.3.7.8 Diluent

A 60-day inventory of diluent will be stored on site in bulk boxes to meet the make-up requirements of the Th SX circuit.

## 17.3.7.9 Thorium Extractant

First fill of extractant will be supplied in bulk boxes.  On site storage for a 100-day supply of extractant is proposed.  Subsequent storage on site will be in 200 L drums.  An air operated diaphragm pump will be provided to add extractant to the loaded organic storage tank.

## 17.3.7.10 Uranium Resin

Resin will be lost from the uranium ion exchange (IX) circuit by attrition and breakdown.  Make-up resin will be added on a routine basis to the UIX columns.  An inventory of resin equivalent to 4 months supply will be held on site.

## 17.3.7.11 Coagulant

Coagulant will be mixed by the Coagulant Mixing System and the mixed coagulant will be stored in the Coagulant Storage Tank.    Coagulant  will  be  pumped  from  the  Coagulant  Storage  Tank  to  the  various addition points in the circuit by dedicated Coagulant Dosing Pumps.

## 17.3.7.12 Hydrochloric Acid

Hydrochloric acid is supplied in 1.0 m  bulk boxes and dedicated dosing pumps deliver acid to the Th SX 3 Strip makeup tank.

## 17.3.8 Tailings Disposal

Further characterization of the tailings from the Hydrometallurgical Processing Plant is required to assess geotechnical  as  well  as  chemical  stability.    Geotechnical  compressibility  and  shear  load  requires assessment for dry stacking options.  Containment embankment and even liner may also be required.  The climate is such that the tailings are unlikely to freeze, but seasonal issues and precipitation also need to be considered.

Like  that  for  the  Primary  Production  Plant,  NewPro  have  not  made  an  allowance  for  the  TSF  at  the Hydrometallurgical Processing Plant, but have made allowance for trucking filtered tailings to a suitable TSF location.  Further design work will be required to determine the geotechnical parameters for the TSF as well as any other design criteria.

## 17.4 Comments on the Recovery Methods Proposed by NewPro

SLR has reviewed the proposals for the Primary Production Plant and the Hydrometallurgical Processing Plant.

The proposed beneficiation plant includes a simple comminution circuit which, given adequate test work on a range of samples and competent design based on such test work, should be a trouble-free operation. Similarly, the proposed magnetic separation circuits are quite standard in other industries and should operate as projected provided that test work confirms the preliminary test results forming the basis for the present NewPro design.

The proposed hydrometallurgical process starts with an acid bake process.  This is a widely practised method of decomposing REE minerals and presently used to produce most of the world's REE supply.  The proposed Search Minerals plant would dissolve the REE from the acid bake product and remove impurities through hydrolysis in a fairly standard process.  The balance of the process includes REE precipitation and releach followed by multiple stages of purification ahead of REE carbonate precipitation.  As noted by NewPro, additional test work is needed to confirm process details.  SLR is of the opinion that there is potential to simplify the process.

Although additional test work, including pilot plant operations, are needed, the QP is of the opinion that the design and resulting equipment requirements and reagent demand are adequate for a PEA.

## 18.0 PROJECT INFRASTRUCTURE

Project infrastructure has been addressed in the NewPro Report, and this has been summarized in this section.  SLR has included additional infrastructure descriptions to complement the NewPro Report.

## 18.1 Primary Production Plant

## 18.1.1 Water Services

## 18.1.1.1 Raw Water

Raw water for the Primary Production Plant will be supplied using raw water taken from an authorized water source.  The ability to drawdown on the nominated lake and the rate of replenishment is yet to be established.  Raw water will be stored on site in the Raw Water Tank and distributed to usage points within the plant.  Filtered Raw Water will be utilised for the gland water service.

Raw water requirements are estimated at 134 million litres per annum.

## 18.1.1.2 Process Water

The process water tank will have sufficient storage to meet process plant operating requirement for 24 hr. Two Process Water Pumps will distribute process water to the various usage points around the process plant.

## 18.1.1.3 Gland Water

Gland water will be used for a limited number of pumps within the process plant.  A gland water tank and pumps will supply duty points within the process plant.

## 18.1.1.4 Potable Water

Potable water will be supplied from the demineralised water plant, then chlorinated and re-mineralised for potable water use.  Potable water will be distributed via a ring main to various usage points within the plant and buildings.

Safety showers will be supplied by potable water maintained at approximately 23°C. Suitably located lagged and heat traced header tanks will be installed to provide the head necessary to operate the safety showers.

## 18.1.1.5 Fire Water

A firewater storage and reticulation system will be provided for firefighting duties.  All substations will be equipped  with  dedicated  fire  suppression  equipment  to  protect  the  motor  control  panels  and  plant control systems.

## 18.1.1.6 Sewage

Sewage Treatment Plants (STP) will be used to treat domestic effluent from toilets, showers, sinks and from camp facilities.  Sewage will be collected by gravity at a local raw sewerage lift station and will be pumped to the STP which is a membrane bioreactor (MBR).  The membrane portion of the MBR process

<!-- image -->

is  used to separate Mixed Liquor Suspended Solids (MLSS) from the treated effluent.  The Membrane filtration process itself is an effective bacteria barrier and MBR permeate (effluent) is free of Suspended Solids.  During normal operation, the MBR permeate is also free of fecal coliforms.  The treated effluent is therefore acceptable for recycle to the process water tank for re-use in the process plant.  Like any biological treatment process, excess sludge from wastewater treatment plants needs to be removed and disposed of to leach drain or landfill.  However, a MBR treatment system has lower sludge yields as well as more stabilized sludge than most other wastewater treatment systems due to its much higher Solids Retention Time.  In addition, the excess activated sludge diverted directly from the MBR process typically has higher concentration (thus lower volume) than sludge from other treatment processes.  All these features are beneficial for sludge handling and final sludge disposal.

The STP process flow diagram is as follows:

Raw Sewage Lift Station (by others) → Fine Screen → Equalization Tank → Anoxic Tank →MBR Tank → Effluent (discharge)

The sludge dewatering system (optional) process flow includes:

Sludge from MBR Tank → Sludge Tank → Disc Sludge Press → Sludge Cake (to landfill)

## 18.1.2 Air Services

Plant  air  will  be  supplied  by  a  duty  standby  arrangement  of  rotary  screw  type  compressors.    The compressors will provide air at a pressure of 700 kiloPascal gauge (kPaG) to plant services.  The larger plate and frame filters have dedicated air compressors.  Instrument air will be withdrawn from the plant air receiver to an instrument air accumulator and then dried in a duty standby arrangement of driers and air filters.

## 18.1.3 Power Supply

A power station comprising a number of diesel reciprocating engines and generators will be provided to power the concentrator.  Electric power requirements for the Primary Process Plant are estimated at 4.855 MW of installed power with an estimated draw of 3.956 MW.  The fuel requirements for the diesel generators are estimated at 7.7 million litres per annum.

## 18.1.4 Steam (Building Heating)

Steam will be produced by heat recovery boilers on the power station exhaust, which are sized to meet building heating requirements.  A backup boiler is provided with sufficient capacity to replace the steam supplied from the power station if the station is not operational for any reason.

The duty points will be supplied with steam at 185°C and 10 Bar pressure.

A heating fluid is required to transfer heat derived from the steam boiler.  The solution will comprise a 50/50 mix of glycol/water.  The steam boiler will typically be operated on low fire.  The heating system will be a closed service, which will use softened water from the steam boiler supply system to prevent scale build-up in the heat exchangers.  Hot water radiators are to be used within each building to heat incoming air to meet the required building air turnovers.

<!-- image -->

## 18.1.5 Fuel Services

Fuel will be stored on site in fuel storage facilities for distribution to vehicles and to the steam boiler day tank for backup steam generation.  Steam generation is typically produced by waste heat boilers on the power station.  As diesel will be supplied in bulk, it will be pumped to 3 x 1,375 m  tanks located adjacent 3 to  the  port.    The  fuel  tank  capacity  is  calculated  based  on  the  process  plant  requirements  plus  one additional tank as an allowance for mine fleet fuel storage.

Adjacent to this will be a re-fuelling area, connected to the ROM pad via a road such that heavy vehicles can refuel on their rotations.  Machines based at the mine pits will be refuelled by an intermediary fuel truck.  At the refuelling area there will also be a separated light vehicle refuelling bowser.

Fuel will be bought into the Primary Production Plant via ship (either backload on concentrate ship or via the Costal Shipping Services fuel distribution system) and offloaded via a pumping system on the wharf.

## 18.1.6 Mobile Equipment

Mobile  equipment  fleet  has  been  specified  based  on  the  expected  requirements  of  the  plant.    This includes various maintenance and operating personnel vehicles.  Two FELs (CAT 980 or equivalent) will be required on the ROM pad.  A 25 t yard crane, flatbed truck, container forklift, store AT forklift (Manitou style),  small  skid  steer  loader,  backhoe,  and  mobile  welding  machine  will  be  required  to  support maintenance  activities.    As  the  plant  is  quite  compact,  only  four  light  vehicles,  plus  a  bus  to  move personnel to and from the accommodation camp and airport in Happy Valley-Goose Bay, will be required.

## 18.1.7 Buildings

The following buildings are the major buildings located near the processing sites, with the exception of the accommodation camp which will be located in St. Lewis.  All buildings will be steel frame metal clad construction-type with a concrete slab base.  It is assumed that the foundations will be built on the bed rock with a minimum amount of filling material needed.

- · Administration, community relations, and services office
- · Truck Shop and Warehouse
- · Main security gate house

## 18.1.7.2 Administration and Services Office

The administration and services office building will  accommodate  mine management, administration, engineering/geology department, first aid room, training, and meeting rooms, and a mine dry room.  The building will be two levels and completed in modules.  Costs include the complete supply and installation of building foundations, mechanical equipment, and electrical equipment.

## 18.1.7.3 Truck Shop and Warehouse

The garage will include a wash bay, three mechanical bays, and a welding shop.  One other shop adjacent to  the  garage  and  the  main  warehouse  will  be  added  for  welders,  carpenters,  pump  and  accessories maintenance, and for electrical and instrumentation workers.  There will be two levels in the warehouse with maintenance on the lower floor and parts storage and a dining room on the upper floor.  In the electrical equipment maintenance area, a second floor will be occupied by maintenance foreman offices.

## 18.1.7.4 Accommodation Camp - Operations

An accommodation camp will be constructed in St. Lewis to house the permanent mining and process workforce  and  open  pit  contractors.    It  is  expected  that  this  camp  will  have  a  total  capacity  of approximately 80 people.  There will be sleeping rooms, a kitchen/dining facility, clinic, laundry, and basic recreation facilities.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

The Project will seek local employment to the extent possible.  Search Minerals intends to investigate accommodation alternatives to an on-site mining camp, to the benefit of the local communities.

## 18.1.7.5 Accommodation Camp - Construction

Temporary accommodation for the construction phase will be located adjacent to the permanent camp site.  The temporary camp will be removed upon completion of construction.

## 18.1.8 Laboratory Services

An  allowance  cost  has  been  made  for  a  typical  x-ray  fluorescence  (XRF)  laboratory  at  the  Primary Production Plant.  The purpose will be to provide a grade control and metallurgical assay laboratory.  The laboratory is to be equipped with sample preparation, screening, and a XRF button making machine.  The primary means of analysis will be by XRF analysis including the use of hand-held XRF machines for field grade control.  Hand-held XRF analysers such as the Niton® XLp 522K isotope-based unit from Thermo Scientific can quickly analyze elements from titanium (Ti) to U.  These analyzers cover a broader range of REEs than the equivalent tube-based analyzers, and offer direct analysis of the elements: La, Ce, Pr, and Nd, samarium (Sm), europium (Eu), gadolinium (Gd), terbium (Tb), and Dy, as well as Y, U, and Th.

## 18.1.9 Port Facility

NewPro provided designs and estimates for a new port facility located at Port Marnham.  Search Minerals is currently reviewing port site alternatives and has requested that SLR assume that the existing maritime infrastructure located in Fox Harbour could be used as a primary alternative.  SLR has made an allowance of $8 million to account for upgrades to the existing maritime infrastructure to be able to receive ships for outgoing (concentrate) and incoming (diesel, supplies, etc.).  This allowance is a preliminary estimate based on assuming approximately 30% of the costs of the brand new port facility estimated by NewPro at approximately $25 million.

SLR understands that Fox Harbour has limited draft of approximately nine metres which will allow for vessels of up to 15,000 dwt.  The Fox Harbour will also have a limited shipping season (approximately eight months) and consideration for scheduling allowance will need to be considered.

SLR recommends that further investigation into port locations be carried out.

## 18.1.10 Access Roads

Access roads have been considered for both Deep Fox and Foxtrot.  Preliminary routing is shown in Figure 18-3 and described below.  Further study, analysis, and community consultation will be required prior to finalization of access roads.

## 18.1.10.1 Deep Fox

Site access roads will need to be constructed to connect Deep Fox to the port at Fox Harbour.  There are some smaller existing roads that will need to be upgraded to allow for the transport of concentrate and supplies.  SLR estimates approximately 6.3 km of upgraded roads will be required.

## 18.1.10.2 Foxtrot

The Foxtrot site is located approximately 13 km from the Primary Production Plant.  A small section of road (approximately 900 m) will be required to connect the mine to the existing Highway 513.  Prior to

<!-- image -->

entering St. Lewis, a road detour will need to be built that runs past the old radar station (currently Search Minerals' core storage facility) and to the Primary Production Plant.  This detour ensures that all truck traffic will avoid the town of St. Lewis.  The detour road is approximately four kilometers.

## 18.1.11 Air Strip

An existing air strip is located adjacent to the town of St. Lewis and Deep Fox, is approximately 700 m in length, and can be used for small aircraft.

## 18.1.12 Tailings

Tailings will be generated from the Primary Production Plant and are assumed to be filtered dry-stack tailings.  No detailed designs have been carried out for this Technical Report, however, SLR has estimated the volume requirements and has estimated costs to construct a tailings storage pad.  SLR recommends that further design work be carried out for the dry stack tailings design.

## 18.1.13 Site Infrastructure Layout

Figure 18-1 shows the Deep Fox Mine and Primary Production Plant, Figure 18-2 shows the infrastructure at Foxtrot, and Figure 18-3 shows the overall infrastructure on the Property.  The site layout is preliminary. Further study, analysis, and community consultation will be required prior to finalization of infrastructure layout.

## 18.2 Hydrometallurgical Processing Plant

## 18.2.1 Water Services

## 18.2.1.1 Raw Water

Raw water for the Hydrometallurgical Processing Plant will be supplied by the nearby sources.  Raw water will be stored on site in the Raw Water Tank and distributed to usage points within the plant.  Filtered Raw Water will be utilised for the gland water service and the reverse osmosis (RO) Plants.

Raw water requirements are estimated at 621 million litres per annum.

## 18.2.1.2 Process Water

The process water tank will have sufficient storage to meet process plant operating requirement for 24 hr. Two Process Water Pumps will distribute process water to the various usage points around the process plant.  Process water will also be used to supply the Acid plant cooling system.

## 18.2.1.3 Gland Water

Gland water will be used for a limited number of pumps within the process plant.  The majority of pumps will be specified with mechanical seals or as hose pumps to avoid having to use water for sealing duties. A gland water tank and pumps will supply duty points within the process plant.

## 18.2.1.4 Potable Water

Potable water will be supplied by the Hydrometallurgical Processing Plant Port Authority.  Potable water will be distributed via a ring main to various usage points within the plant and buildings.

Safety showers will be supplied by potable water maintained at approximately 23°C. Suitably located lagged and heat traced header tanks will be installed to provide the head necessary to operate the safety showers.

## 18.2.1.5 Demineralized Water

Demineralised water will be required for the process plant and the steam boilers.  This will be supplied by a demineralised water plant.  Demineralised water will also be used in the process plant to minimize contamination of the REE product.

## 18.2.1.6 Fire Water

A firewater storage and reticulation system will be provided for firefighting duties.  All substations will be equipped  with  dedicated  fire  suppression  equipment  to  protect  the  motor  control  panels  and  plant control systems.

## 18.2.1.7 Sewage

Domestic effluent from toilets, showers, sinks and from camp facilities will be collected by gravity and connect to the Hydrometallurgical Processing Plant Port Authority Sewage System at an agreed tie-in point specified in the lease agreement.

## 18.2.2 Air Services

Plant  air  will  be  supplied  by  a  duty  standby  arrangement  of  rotary  screw  type  compressors.    The compressors will provide air at a pressure of 700 kiloPascal gauge (kPaG) to plant services.  The larger plate and frame filters have dedicated air compressors.  Instrument air will be withdrawn from the plant air receiver to an instrument air accumulator and then dried in a duty standby arrangement of driers and air filters.

## 18.2.3 Power Supply

Power for the processing plant will be generated predominantly from waste heat supplied by the acid plant; a small excess power requirement will be met from the grid.  It is assumed that the provincial power utility  will  also  provide  start-up  power  and  auxiliary  power  in  the  event  that  the  acid  plant  is  nonoperational.

Additional  electric  power  requirements  for  the  Hydrometallurgical  Processing  Plant  are  estimated  at 1.347 MW of installed power with an estimated draw of 1.158 MW.

## 18.2.4 Steam (Acid Plant, Power &amp; Building Heating)

Steam will be produced primarily using waste heat boilers in the acid plant with backup from a steam boiler sized to replace the acid plant steam capacity.  The majority of the steam will be condensed for reuse, with boiler water makeup being provided by demineralised water.

The duty points will be supplied with steam at 185°C and 10 Bar pressure.

## 18.2.5 Building Heating

A  heating  fluid  is  required  to  recover  waste  heat  from  the  cogeneration  plant  and  supplemented  as required by the plant steam boilers.  The solution will comprise a 50/50 mix of glycol/water.

Sufficient waste heat will be available from the cogeneration plant to maintain temperature in process buildings.  In the event that there is a shortfall, or the acid plant is unavailable, a steam boiler will be required to operate to supplement the heat recovery.  The heating system will be a closed service, which will  use  softened  water  from  the  steam  boiler  supply  system  to  prevent  scale  build-up  in  the  heat exchangers.    Hot  water  radiators  will  be  used  within  each  building  to  heat  incoming  air  to  meet  the required building air turnovers.

## 18.2.6 Fuel Services

Fuel will be stored on site in day tanks for distribution to the backup steam boiler for steam generation when the acid plant is not operational.  Diesel will be supplied in bulk tanker trucks from a local diesel fuel distributor on an as required basis.  Process plant machines will be refuelled at a site bowser, and light vehicles will utilise local (retail) refuelling stations.

## 18.2.7 Mobile Equipment

Mobile  equipment  fleet  has  been  specified  based  on  the  expected  requirements  of  the  plant.    This includes various maintenance and operating personnel vehicles.  One FEL will be required in the reagent shed, which will be an IT62 (or equivalent) such that separate buckets can be used for each bulk reagent.

<!-- image -->

A 25 t yard crane, flatbed truck, container forklift, store AT forklift (Manitou style), small skid steer loader, backhoe, and mobile welding machine will be required to support the maintenance activities.

## 18.2.8 Buildings

NewPro  has  included  the  buildings  listed  in  Table  18-2  in  its  estimate  for  the  Hydrometallurgical Processing Plant.

## 18.2.9 Laboratory Services

An allowance has been made for a typical ICP laboratory.  The purpose here will be to provide a higher level of control on the concentrate feed grade and hydrometallurgical process through the higher level of detection  limit  achievable  by  ICP  analytical  methods.    The  laboratory  is  to  be  equipped  with  sample preparation, screening, mineral digestion, and analysis facilities.  The primary means of analysis will be by inductively couple plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) and mass spectrometry (ICP-MS).

For more detailed analysis, laboratory calibration, and specific programs, there is an ISO 17025 accredited external analytical service provider, Eastern Analytical Ltd., located in the city of Springdale, Newfoundland and Labrador.

## 18.2.10 Harbour Unloading System

Unloading facilities will be provided for the WHIMS concentrate and bulk reagents that will be transported to storage sheds for the Hydrometallurgical Processing Plant.

SLR recommends that further investigation into port locations be carried out once a Hydrometallurgical Processing  Plant  site  has  been  located.    NewPro  has  made  allowances  in  its  estimate  for  unloading equipment to be used at an existing port facility

## 18.2.11 Tailings

The residue will be stored as a moist, neutralized, filter cake of -3.3 mm material in a dry stack residue pad (DSRP).  The DSRP concept is based on the transport of residue filter cake to a lined, dry stack residue pad by dump truck.  Residue would be periodically levelled by bulldozer.

SLR recommends that further design work be carried out for the dry stack tailings design.

## 19.0 MARKET STUDIES AND CONTRACTS

The following is summarized from the Q2 2022 AI Report.

## 19.1 Markets

The supply side portion of the REE market is primarily driven by a select few countries: China, Australia, Malaysia, and the US.  If supply chain issues continue, demand will outpace supply and price appreciation is anticipated to sustain.

Prices are currently substantially higher than 2020 and although there may be a scenario where supply is unobstructed in the short term, price depreciation is not expected to return to 2020 levels.

Looking forward, AI forecasts that the global rare earth market will consistently underproduce NdPr oxide from 2022, resulting in shortages by as early as 2023 if production does not increase beyond what is currently projected.  Looking forward, from 2022 through 2035 AI forecasts that global TREO demand will rise at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.0%, from 190,476 t to 407,621 t, driven primarily by the  permanent  magnet  sector.    TREO  demand  relating  to  permanent  magnets  (NdFeB  magnets)  is expected to rise at a CAGR of 8.3%, from 87,000 t to 246,000 t, boosted by strong demand growth from electric vehicle, wind power, general automotive, and other applications of NdFeB magnets.  AI expects that electric vehicles will be responsible for over 40% of global magnet earth oxide demand by 2035.

Similarly, AI forecast that the global rare earth market will consistently underproduce Dy oxide resulting in shortages by as early as 2023 should production not increase beyond what is currently anticipated.

AI forecasts that the global rare earth market will consistently underproduce Tb oxide, resulting in ongoing and increasing shortages should production not increase beyond what is currently expected.

SLR notes that Nd, Pr, Dy, and Tb make up approximately 92% of the Project value.

## 19.2 Contracts

On October 20, 2021, Search Minerals Inc. and USA Rare Earth, LLC signed a non-binding Memorandum of Understanding ('MOU') for an offtake of 500 tonnes/year of Neodymium (Nd) / Praseodymium (Pr) from future production at the Deep Fox or Foxtrot deposits.

## 19.3 REE Pricing

Market prices are summarized using price forecast reports from AI.

SLR references two price scenarios for this project.  The first was generated by AI in October of 2021 which was used to generate a Net Value as the basis of SLR's resource estimation, mine optimization, and mine design.  The second price scenario was generated by AI in February of 2022 which was used in SLR's cashflow analysis.  Both forecasts represent the average price between years 2025 and 2030.

The 2025 to 2030 price average for both October 2021 and February 2022 forecasts are presented in Table 19-1.

| Terbium      | US$/kg | Tb2O3 | 1,535.00        | 2,493.00        |

The prices listed in Table 19-1 are for separated REOs.  Search Minerals plans to produce a refined rare earth carbonate that will require further downstream processing to separate into individual REOs.  SLR has assumed separation charges of US$10.00/kg applied to TREO and an additional US$20.00/kg applied to HREO.  These are preliminary estimate based on our experience, having reviewed other projects, and will need to be estimated based on actual agreements in the future.

SLR notes that the significant change in REE price forecasts between October 2021 and February 2022 indicates the volatility of the REE market.  This price increase leads to an increase in unit Net Value from $467/t to $756/t, or an increase of approximately 62%.

A range of sensitivities is shown in Section 22 of this Technical Report to cover a wide range of price fluctuations.

SLR has assumed the following payability percentages for the REE's as shown in Table 19-2.  These are estimates based on our industry experience and will need to be estimated based on actual agreements in the future.

## 20.0 ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES, PERMITTING, AND SOCIAL OR COMMUNITY IMPACT

This chapter has been informed by the previous technical reports and information provided by Search Minerals and their consultant, GEMTEC.  In particular, discussions were held with the following personnel:

- · Mr. Todd Burlingame, Chief Operating Officer, Search Minerals
- · Mr. Darrol Rice, GEMTEC

The Chief Operating Officer (COO) is responsible for managing environmental and social aspects, and for establishing corporate policies regarding environmental  and  social management,  human  rights, Indigenous relationships, and health and safety.  Search Minerals has a Code of Business Conduct policy which includes health, safety and environment aspects, as well as an Integrated Policy on Health, Safety, Environment  and  Community  Relations.    This  policy  states  that  Search  Minerals'  core  values  and objectives include compliance with laws and regulations, integrity, respect, accountability, and continuous performance improvement related to the management of the potential social and environmental impacts associated with their activities, and to safeguard the health and safety of their workforce, visitors, and business partners.  Additional policies include Insider Trading Policy, Whistleblower Policy, and Disclosure Policy.  SLR understands that Search Minerals is planning to develop additional environmental and social policies.

## 20.1 Environmental Studies

Deep Fox is located 12 km east of Foxtrot; baseline studies have been initiated covering both deposit areas.  GEMTEC, a consultant contracted to Search Minerals, has provided a list of environmental studies completed to date, and those planned for the Project.  This work plan has been based on preliminary Project footprint information, however, this is still subject to change.  The list of studies is provided in Table 20-1.

The 2012 NI 43-101 Technical Report for Foxtrot noted that the following baseline studies would be required:

- · Sound monitoring
- · Air quality
- · Historic and heritage sites
- · Fish and fish habitat
- · Rare plant analysis
- · Ecological land classifications (ELC) including wildlife assemblages and wetlands
- · Songbird surveys
- · Determination of Harmful Alteration, Disruption, or Destruction of Fish Habitat (HADD)
- · Socio-economic baseline studies

Some of these studies have been initiated, as described in Table 20-1.

Additional  baseline  studies  typically  conducted  for  mining  projects,  which  should  also  be  considered, include soil and land use, and aquatic sediment.  Geochemical characterisation of waste rock, tailings, and mineral  will  also  be  required  at  a  later  stage  to  support  environmental  approval  applications.

<!-- image -->

Furthermore, as the Project includes utilization of an existing harbour and some infrastructure will be established off-shore, various fore-shore and marine studies will likely be required.

Traditional Knowledge studies may be requested by Indigenous communities as the Project progresses.

Baseline studies and monitoring programmes may require some adjustment once the site layout is further developed to ensure that all proposed Project infrastructure and activities are covered.  This must include linear infrastructure components.

SLR enquired whether any environmental or social risks have been identified for the Project in the current phase and going forward.  Search Minerals replied that current exploration at Deep Fox occurs within the town of St. Lewis protected water supply catchment area.  All permits to operate within this area are in place and required mitigation measures are strictly adhered to.  SLR understands that Search Minerals continues  to  work  directly  with  the  St.  Lewis  Town  Council  to  ensure  that  residents  are  informed  of activities and that concerns are addressed in a timely manner.  This is a key risk to manage as the Project progresses.

Search Minerals shared an article with SLR discussing the potential environmental risks associated with the  development  of  REE  production  in  Canada  published  by  Canadian  Science  (2021).    The  article examined environmental behaviours and fates of REEs and their toxicity on ecological and human health. The following are some key conclusions presented in the article:

- · More  baseline  work  is  required  to  understand  REE  concentrations  in  soil,  water,  vegetation, animals, and humans.
- · Toxicity studies are needed on target species for food sources.
- · Additional studies are required to understand the environmental behaviour of REEs.
- · REEs transfer and accumulate as a group of contaminants.
- · Cleaner technology to exploit REE is the most effective way to limit potential environmental risks.

The surface water baseline work planned for 2022 plans to include REE parameters to establish baseline concentrations.  Search Minerals should consider:

- · Expanding baseline and future environmental studies to include other receptor pathways that could affect human health, e.g., soil, water, vegetation, animals; toxicity testing on target species
- · Expanding geochemical studies
- · Technology options to limit potential environmental and social risks.

## 20.2 Project Approvals

Search  Minerals  has  confirmed  that  the  required  approvals  and  permits  are  in  place  for  current exploration activities for Deep Fox and Foxtrot.  As the Project progresses, provincial and federal approvals will be required.

Mining projects in the Province of Newfoundland and Labrador are subject to Environmental Assessment (EA) under the Newfoundland and Labrador Environmental Protection Act .  A formal registration must be submitted  to  the  Newfoundland  and  Labrador  Department  of  Environment  and  Conservation.    The Minister  may request an Environmental Preview Report or an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). Once the Project is released from the EA process, the proponent can proceed to obtain the necessary permits and authorizations for construction and operation.  A release from the provincial process is valid for three years.  Additional approvals and permits may be required for the Project development; however, this can only be determined at a later stage once the Project is defined in more detail.  The 2012 NI 43101 Technical Report for Foxtrot provided a list of provincial authorizations which may be required for the Foxtrot Project; however, this list requires revision and inclusion of Deep Fox.  It is worth noting that the discharge of excess water is expected and will require approval under the provincial Water Resources Act , and the Environmental Protection Act .  Dewatering activities, if required, will also require approval under the Water Resources Act. The Primary Production Plant will require authorisation in terms of Section 5 of the  Mining  Act,  and  a  Certificate  of  Approval  for  a  fuel  storage  system  must  be  obtained  from  the Department of Government Services and Lands.

In  November 2017 Search Minerals submitted a Project Description Summary for the Foxtrot Project, compiled by Allnorth, to the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency (CEAA) and the Newfoundland and  Labrador  Department  of  Environment.    Guidelines  were  issued  for  the  preparation  of  an  EIS  for Foxtrot  on  March  2,  2018.    Since  the  initial  registration  of  the  project,  the  scope  of  the  Project  has undergone significant change.  Due to these changes and delays in providing supporting documentation, the Provincial assessment process has lapsed and is no longer active.  The 2018 guidelines no longer reflect the current project proposal and therefore the CEAA application will not be progressed.  Engineering and baseline  studies  are  ongoing  and  will  be  used  to  produce  a  new  project  description  which  will  be submitted to the appropriate regulatory authorities.

The revised project scope as currently configured does not include any physical activities that are listed in the Physical Activities Regulations (commonly known as the federal Project List), which means that it is not a 'designated project', as defined by the Impact Assessment Agency of Canada, and does not require a federal impact assessment under the Impact Assessment Act.  Project activities, such as the disruption or destruction of fish habitat, will require authorisation from the Department of Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO).  Fish habitat compensation may also be required by DFO if the impacts on fish habitat are deemed to warrant this.   Any effluent discharge from the Project site will be required to comply with the Metal and Diamond Mining Effluent Regulations (MDMER) enforced by Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC).  As part of these regulations, Search Minerals will be required to design and implement an  Environmental  Effects  Monitoring  (EEM)  program  during  operations  which  will  monitor  its  final discharge locations.

As the Project becomes better defined, SLR recommends that Search Minerals develop an approval and permitting plan for the Project covering federal and provincial requirements.  This plan should identify any risks to the approval processes and mitigation measures, if applicable.  The same Project Description and EIS could be used to seek approval from both the provincial and federal regulators, if required.  The environmental assessment processes take approximately two years, depending on the studies needed,

stakeholder  and  Indigenous  community  engagement  processes  and  outcomes,  and  if  the  process progresses  as  planned.    Permitting  will  need  to  be  managed  to  ensure  that  permits  are  obtained  in advance of constructing relevant Project infrastructure.  For example, a DFO authorisation will be required in advance of constructing watercourse crossings.

## 20.3 Social or Community Requirements

Search Minerals has indicated that socio-economic studies are being designed and will be based on the projected effects of the Project scope as defined by this PEA and subsequent refinement of Project design as the Project moves into the impact assessment regulatory process.  These socio-economic studies are planned for later in 2022.

Search Minerals has also indicated that community engagement focused on exploration activities has been undertaken annually since 2011.  A detailed community engagement strategy and plan has been developed and will be initiated later in 2022, subject to budgetary approval.  SLR has not reviewed this engagement strategy, however, it will be important to include all relevant stakeholders and Indigenous communities.

Search  Minerals  holds  a  Mining  Exploration  Activities  Agreement  with  the  NunatuKavut  Community Council (NCC) which was signed on August 27, 2012. This remains valid and is reported to be in good standing.  Additional community agreements may be required as the Project progresses.

Search  Minerals  has  initiated  social  initiatives.    Search  Minerals  reports  to  have  provided  limited scholarships  to  the  local  community  and  continues  to  work  with  the  NCC  on  annual  employment initiatives.  Search Minerals have also indicated that they have been working with government agencies to seek opportunities to provide renewable energy alternatives to adjacent communities.

Search Minerals has not identified any need to resettle people in the future for the development of the Project.

As mentioned previously, Deep Fox lies within the town of St. Lewis protected water supply catchment area.  All permits to operate within this area are in place and required mitigation measures are strictly adhered to.  SLR understands that Search Minerals continues to work directly with the St. Lewis Town Council to ensure that residents are informed of activities and that concerns are addressed in a timely manner.  This is a key risk to manage as the Project progresses.

## 20.4 Mine Closure Requirements

A Rehabilitation and Closure Plan (RCP) is required by the Newfoundland and Labrador Mining Act.  The RCP must describe the work to be done, detailed scheduling, and financial assurance which must include ongoing monitoring and site maintenance, amongst other requirements.

As described in the 2016 NI 43-101 Technical Report for Foxtrot, the RCP must be regularly updated and address closure objectives, progressive rehabilitation, closure and rehabilitation of infrastructure areas, post closure activities, and be aimed at achieving long term physical and chemical stability to support the final end land use.

SLR understands that an RCP will be developed for the Project as part of the planned permitting activities and will ensure all legal requirements are addressed, in addition to the financial provision for closure and rehabilitation.

## 21.0 CAPITAL AND OPERATING COSTS

The  capital  and  operating  costs  for  the  processing,  transport,  and  infrastructure  were  estimated  by NewPro  and  reviewed  by  SLR.    SLR  estimated  costs  related  to  mining,  tailings,  and  some  additional infrastructure not covered in the NewPro estimate.

SLR  notes  that,  due  to  global  events  relating  to  COVID  19  and  the  war  in  Ukraine,  there  have  been significant increases to many goods, and freight prices have increased dramatically.  SLR has not made any adjustments to the capital and operating cost estimates from NewPro to reflect these events, and the mining costs reflect 'normal' conditions.

All costs are in Canadian Dollars (C$) unless otherwise stated.

## 21.1 Capital Costs

The mine, process, and site infrastructure costs are summarized in Table 21-1.

| Total Initial Capital                                            | 421,828                   |
| Sustaining Capital                                               | 267,316                   |
| UG Sustaining development                                        | 44,294                    |

The initial and sustaining capital costs are estimated at $421.8 million and $267.3 million, respectively, for the  Project.    Underground  sustaining  capital  and  reclamation  and  closure  costs  are  estimated  at $44.3 million  and  $20.0  million,  respectively.    Total  capital  costs  over  the  LOM  are  estimated  at $753.4 million.

Capital costs for the process facility design and a large portion of the infrastructure were estimated by NewPro.    SLR  has  reviewed  the  costs  and  has  added  additional  costs  to  cover  tailings  management, additional infrastructure, and mining costs.

<!-- image -->

Indirect capital costs total approximately 47% of direct costs and contingency is estimated at 25% of direct costs.

An  RCP  has  not  been  developed  and  therefore  no  cost  information  is  available.    SLR  has  estimated $20 million at the end of the mine life based on similar sized operations and has not included any bonds or progressive reclamation costs.

It is expected that the initial capital costs will be spent over a 24 month period to develop the project.

## 21.1.1 Process and Infrastructure Capital Costs

As previously discussed, the NewPro Report covers two processing facilities.  The first facility is a physical separation plant that is located in Labrador, which NewPro refers to as the 'Port Marnham Concentrator Facility'  in  its  report.    Search  Minerals  is  currently  undertaking  an  assessment  of  port  alternatives  in Labrador, and SLR has been asked to assume that the existing dock infrastructure in Fox Harbour (St. Lewis)  would  be  upgraded  to  meet  the  needs  of  the  Project.    This  processing  facility  is  referred  to throughout this Technical Report as the 'Primary Production Plant'.

The second process plant in the NewPro Report was based on a location at Argentia, Newfoundland. Search Minerals is currently reviewing alternative brownfield site locations on the island of Newfoundland and SLR refers to this plant as the 'Hydrometallurgical Processing Plant'.

Process  and  Infrastructure  costs  for  both  the  Primary  Production  Plant  and  the  Hydrometallurgical Processing Plant were estimated by NewPro and are listed in Table 21-2.  Capital costs were estimated in US Dollars and have been converted to Canadian Dollars using an exchange rate of C$1.00:US$0.80.

## 21.1.3 Capital Estimate Accuracy

The capital estimate for the Primary Production Plant and Hydrometallurgical Processing Plant has been developed to meet the recommended practices outlined in AACE No.47R-11 Cost Estimate Classification System - As Applied in the Mining and Mineral Processing Industries.

The capital cost estimate has been developed in accordance with the requirements of a Class 4 estimate, targeting an accuracy of ±35%.  Table 21-8 lists the requirements of the various estimate classes as defined by AACE No.47R-11.

Similarly, the mining costs have been estimated to an accuracy of ±35% and are based on a combination of cost estimation guides (InfoMine), first principles, and allowances where insufficient information was available.

## 21.2.1 Processing

Processing, G&amp;A, and transport operating costs were estimated by NewPro and are shown in Table 21-11. The operating costs cover both the Primary Production Plant (magnetic separator) and the Hydrometallurgical  Processing  Plant  and  the  transportation  of  concentrate  to  the  Hydrometallurgical Processing Plant.  Operating costs were estimated in US Dollars and have been converted to Canadian Dollars  using  an  exchange  rate  of  C$1.00:US$0.80.    An  additional  tailings  placement  costs  of  $2.50/t mineral has been added by SLR to account for placement of the dry stack tailings.

SLR  has  carried  out  a  thorough  review  of  reagent  costs  and  notes  that  there  have  been  significant increases recently due to supply chain issues related to the COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine.

SLR has not made any adjustments to the NewPro estimates since these increases are likely temporary in nature and may return to 'normal' levels over the next couple of years.

As part of the SLR review of the project operating costs provided by NewPro, the QP has investigated the costs for diesel fuel and the three main reagents.  Consumables comprise approximately 36% of all costs at the proposed Hydrometallurgical Processing Plant on the island of Newfoundland.  Annual consumable costs are estimated at US$36.6 million per year and comprise four items accounting for 98% of the total. These are as follows:

- · Diesel US$4.4 million per year (12% of total)
- · MgCO3 US$17.3 million per year a (47%)
- · H2SO4 US$4.3 million per year (12%) made from elemental sulphur
- · Na2CO3 US$9.8 million per year (27%)

A large component of reagent costs is related to freight which has increased as much as five-fold over typical values.  NewPro has assumed US$60/t for all reagent transport when in fact recent shipping quotes are over US$300/t from Montreal to Newfoundland.

MgCO3 costs have increased approximately 30% to 40%, elemental sulphur prices have increased two to three times, and Na2CO3 has increased approximately 20% to 30%.

SLR has provided a range of sensitivities in Section 22 of this Technical Report.

## 21.2.2 Open Pit Mining

The open pit operating costs are based on an estimate of contractor costs of $5.00/t for waste and $6.50/t for mineral.  These costs are based on 2016 estimates from a local contractor and have been escalated to 2022 Dollars.  The mineral costs cover a small geology and engineering team, overall supervision of the contractor, and other miscellaneous costs (i.e., dewatering, etc.).

An additional $2.00/t mineral is applied to mineral from Foxtrot to cover transportation for additional haulage (approximately 12 km).

## 21.2.3 Underground Mining

The underground mine operating costs were estimated using cost models, unit prices, preliminary designs, and other information from recent similar projects.   The  underground  mine is assumed to  be owner operated.  Mine operating costs consider labour costs, consumables, underground power requirements, maintenance costs, and operating development.

Underground mining costs total $516.5 million over the LOM and average $63.69/t mined as shown in Table 21-12.

## 22.0 ECONOMIC ANALYSIS

An economic analysis was performed using the assumptions presented in this Technical Report.  The QP notes  that,  the  economic  analysis  contained  in  this  Technical  Report  is  based,  in  part,  on  Inferred Resources, and is preliminary in nature.  Inferred Resources are considered too geologically speculative to  have  the  economic  considerations  applied  to  them  that  would  enable  them  to  be  categorized  as Mineral  Reserves.    Unlike  Mineral  Reserves,  Mineral  Resources  do  not  have  demonstrated  economic viability.  There is no certainty that economic forecasts on which this PEA is based will be realized.  Table 22-1 presents the after-tax cash flow summary for the Project.

## 22.1 Economic Criteria

## 22.1.1 Revenue

- · 2,000 tpd mining from both open pit and underground (720,000 tpa).
- · Mill recovery varies by element, as indicated by NewPro based on test work, averaging 78%.
- · Exchange rate C$1.00 = US$0.80.
- · REE price varies, as detailed in Section 19.3.
- · Net Value includes recovery, oxide conversion, and royalties.
- · Revenue is recognized at the time of production.

## 22.1.2 Costs

- · Pre-production period: 24 months.
- · Mine life: 26 years.
- · Life of Mine production plan as summarized in Section 16.
- · Mine life capital totals $753.4 million.
- · Average operating cost over the mine life is $344.59/t processed.

## 22.1.3 Taxation and Royalties

The Project is subject to the following encumbrances:

- · 0.5% NSR royalty for both Deep Fox and Foxtrot.
- · SLR has used a simple 'effective' tax rate of 38%, based on previous tax modelling for the Foxtrot Project,  including  Newfoundland  mining  tax  and  provincial  and  federal  corporate  income  tax, including depreciation and tax credits.

## 22.2 Cash Flow Analysis

Considering the Project on a stand-alone basis, the undiscounted pre-tax cash flow totals $6,716 million over the mine life, and simple payback occurs 1.5 years from start of production.

## 22.3 Sensitivity Analysis

Project  risks  can  be  identified  in  both  economic  and  non-economic  terms.    Key  economic  risks  were examined by running cash flow sensitivities:

- · TREE Head Grade
- · Net Value ($/t) (reflects REE price and recovery variations)
- · Exchange Rate
- · Operating Cost
- · Capital Cost

Pre-tax IRR sensitivity over the base case has been calculated for a range of variations for each of the key parameters.  The sensitivities are presented in Figure 22-1 and Table 22-2.

The sensitivities for REO prices range from 0.6 to 1.3 to capture the volatility in the REE market.  This lower end of the range (0.6) was selected to overlap the October 2021 price forecasts by AI and the upper range (1.3) is to capture future upside.

The sensitivities for operating and capital costs range from 0.8 to 1.5.  The higher sensitivity of 1.5 reflects the risk of sustained increased costs relating to supply chain issues.

All other sensitivities were carried out in the typical +/- 20% ranges.

## 24.0 OTHER RELEVANT DATA AND INFORMATION

## 24.1 Project Implementation and Execution Plan

The overall  scope  of  the  Project,  as  defined  in  this  Technical  Report,  is  comprised  of  facilities  in  two separate locations:

- · The mine site, Primary Production Plant, and port facility in Labrador, and
- · The Hydrometallurgical Processing Plant and port at a brownfield site yet to be determined on the Island of Newfoundland.

As indicated in Chapter 21 and Chapter 22 of this Technical Report, the base case assumption for this PEA is that the facilities will be developed simultaneously and in parallel.  Revenues modelled in this Technical Report are based on the sale of the product from the hydrometallurgical process that will be further refined by a third party into individual REOs with separation charges as discussed in Section 19 and 21.

Value  chain  studies  are  ongoing  to  determine  the  cost/benefit  of  including  additional  downstream processing capacity in the Project scope to optimize overall value for the Project and this information will be included in a Feasibility Study (FS).  Search Minerals has confirmed it will undertake an independent engineering study to determine the feasibility of building its own separation facility (to be located adjacent to the hydrometallurgical facility) as opposed to paying toll charges to third parties for separation services.

The preliminary project execution schedule presented in Figure 24-1, assumes a base case development strategy.  Upon completion of this Technical Report, Search Minerals intends to proceed immediately to the FS phase for both the mine, Primary Production Plant, and Hydrometallurgical Processing Plant.  The development schedule will be updated as more detailed information becomes available.

During the development of the FS, the following major activities will need to be undertaken:

- · A site location study will be conducted to determine the site of the Hydrometallurgical Processing Plant and port facility on the Island of Newfoundland.
- · Trade-off studies.
- · Market studies.
- · Infill  drilling  to  upgrade  the  classification  of  Inferred  resources  to  Indicated  and  Indicated  to Measured.
- · Metallurgical test work for mineral and hydrometallurgical processing.
- · Environmental studies (concurrently) for all project sites.
- · Continuation of stakeholder engagement activities.
- · Project registration and start of environmental permitting for construction.

The preliminary, base case project execution schedule presented in Figure 24-1 covers the period from the start of the FS to the end of commissioning of the Hydrometallurgical Processing Plant.

The major assumptions driving key milestones in the preliminary project execution schedule are:

- · There are two separate undertakings, the mines and Primary Production Plant in Labrador and the  Hydrometallurgical  Processing  Plant  to  be  located  on  a  brownfield  site  on  the  Island  of Newfoundland.
- · Each undertaking has the potential to operate independently, however, the combination of the two provide significant and robust economics.
- · Activities for each site will proceed concurrently.  For simplicity, one consolidated schedule is presented.
- · The Province of Newfoundland and Labrador will require secondary processing in the province in addition to mining and primary production in Labrador.
- · Facilities  construction  and  environmental  permitting  milestones  are  presented  individually  to better understand the project execution critical path.
- · Specific  early  works  construction  activities  can  be  initiated  in  advance  of  final  approvals  on existing Search Minerals owned properties in Labrador and on an existing brownfield location on the Island of Newfoundland.
- · The  environmental  permitting  timeline  and  milestones  are  based  on  typical,  and  where applicable, minimum regulatory durations of key activities.
- · Existing port infrastructure is available and suitable for upgrading and use for production.
- · Towards  the  end  of  the  FS,  Search  Minerals  would  designate  its  EPCM  contractor  and  begin detailed engineering required for procurement of long lead items.

Simplified Preliminary Project Execution Schedule for Base-Case

<!-- image -->

As stated, the base case project execution plan is based on concurrent development of the project areas. There is a risk that the Hydrometallurgical Processing Plant, being more complex in nature, will require a longer development schedule and will be on the critical path for overall Project development.  There is also a risk of loss of opportunity associated with a delay in commencing with the overall development of the Project.

Should the commissioning of the Hydrometallurgical Processing Plant be delayed there is an option to sell an intermediate concentrate product, albeit at a lower overall profit, for a limited period of time up until the Hydrometallurgical Processing Plant is operating.  It is anticipated that an agreement with the Province of Newfoundland and Labrador supporting the development of the Hydrometallurgical Processing Plant will be negotiated.

To mitigate these risks Search Minerals is proceeding with the concurrent and parallel development of the mine and Primary Production Plant in Labrador and the Hydrometallurgical Processing Plant located on a brownfield site on the Island of Newfoundland.  The key elements which support the success for this strategy are as follows:

- · Additional market studies which further confirm the value of the concentrate from the mine site. These additional studies will include an estimate for the net selling price, including prospective payability associated with downstream processing that will be critical for evaluating the economic feasibility.
- · Identification of domestic and non-domestic potential off-takers for the interim sale or tolling of the primary concentrate.
- · Identification of further downstream processing to capture the full value of the product within the province.

The development approach of implementing the Project in two concurrent phases significantly de-risks the Project from both a technical and project financing point of view.  It also allows for the Project to proceed in the near term to ensure the opportunity to secure the Province of Newfoundland and Labrador and Canada a position in the global REE supply chain.

## 25.0 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS

Robust economic results indicate that the Project has good potential to become a long-life producer of critical REEs, providing an independent Canadian source of materials which are key to the green economy. Further conclusions by area are as follows:

## 25.1 Geology and Mineral Resources

- · Significant REE deposits have been delineated at Deep Fox and Foxtrot by the Search Minerals exploration  team.    Deep  Fox  is  located  approximately  two  kilometres  northeast  of  St.  Lewis, Labrador.  Foxtrot is located approximately 10 km west of St. Lewis, Labrador.  Both deposits are located in the Fox Harbour Volcanic Belt (FHVB), which also hosts other REE prospects and targets owned by Search Minerals.
- · Deep Fox mineralization is steeply dipping (approximately 80°) at an azimuth of 275°, with a strike length of approximately one kilometre.  The majority of Deep Fox high grade mineralization occurs within steeply dipping packages of pantellerite.  Two mineralized wireframes were modelled, a higher  grade  and  more  extensive  footwall  zone,  and  a  thinner  hanging  wall  zone.    Deep  Fox remains open at depth with potential to extend Mineral Resources to the east and west.
- · Foxtrot mineralization consists of three steeply dipping mineralized zones, a thicker, predominantly pantellerite core, and a hanging wall and footwall zone consisting of pantellerite and low zirconium (Zr)-pantellerite bands.  Foxtrot mineralization is steeply dipping (70° to 80°), with a strike length of approximately 765 m at an azimuth of 285°.  Foxtrot remains open at depth and there is potential to extend Mineral Resources west and east of the current footprint.
- · For both Deep Fox and Foxtrot, Search Minerals collected core and channel samples, assayed samples  with  a  quality  assurance  and  quality  control  (QA/QC)  program,  conducted  surface exploration, and produced drill hole databases.  SLR verified the content of the assay databases, reviewed the QA/QC programs and logging and sampling procedures, and performed location spot checks.  The assay database, logging and sampling procedures, and QA/QC programs are acceptable for Mineral Resource estimation.
- · SLR  estimated  Mineral  Resources  for  the  Project  using  all  drill  hole  and  channel  sample  data available as of December 31, 2021.  Mineralization wireframes were modelled at Deep Fox and Foxtrot, using a nominal cut-off of $260/t Net Value.  Open pit resource shells were generated for both deposits to constrain open pit Mineral Resources.  Material with Net Value of $335/t and higher was used to report underground Mineral Resources remaining below the resource shells assuming an underground scenario.  The underground Mineral Resources were reported at a block cut-off and validated using underground reporting shapes to ensure Reasonable Prospects of Eventual Economic Extraction (RPEEE).
- · Deep Fox Mineral Resources include 5.1 million tonnes (Mt) classified as Indicated at average grades  of  394 ppm Pr,  1,469  ppm  Nd,  202  ppm  Dy,  and  34  ppm  Tb,  and  3.3  Mt  classified  as Inferred at average grades of 366 ppm Pr, 1,381 ppm Nd, 198 ppm Dy, and 33 ppm Tb.
- · Foxtrot  Mineral  Resources  include  10.0  Mt  classified  as  Indicated  at  average  grades  of 366 ppm Pr, 1,368 ppm Nd, 176 ppm Dy, and 30 ppm Tb, and 3.0 Mt classified as Inferred at average grades of 371 ppm Pr, 1,384 ppm Nd, and 177 ppm Dy, and 30 ppm Tb.

## 25.2 Mining and Mineral Reserves

- · Mining on the Property will be carried out using open pit and underground methods at a rate of 2,000 tpd starting at Deep Fox and followed by Foxtrot.  Deep Fox will be mined over an 11 year period (seven years open pit and four years underground) and Foxtrot will be mined over a 16 year period (seven years open pit and nine years underground) for a total mine life of 26 years (the Foxtrot open pit and Deep Fox underground will both be mined in Year 11).
- · A total of 18.137 Mt of mineralized material will be mined at grades of 1,416 ppm Nd, 379 ppm Pr,  188 ppm Dy,  and  32  ppm  Tb  with  an  estimated  average  value  of  $756/t  (net  of  process recoveries and payability terms).
- · The PEA mineable quantities are based on 86% Indicated Mineral Resources and 14% Inferred Mineral Resources.
- · The Deep Fox and Foxtrot open pits are planned to be mined using conventional truck and shovel operations using a contractor.
- · The Deep Fox and Foxtrot underground mines are planned to be trackless mechanized operations accessed from the open pits by a single main ramp each and will be owner operated.  Deep Fox and Foxtrot are generally steeply dipping with average widths of 15 m.  The deposit configurations are suitable for mining using longhole mining methods with transverse and longitudinal accesses.
- · The  Deep  Fox  and  Foxtrot  underground  mines  will  be  a  continuation  of  the  open  pit  mining operations and will be mined at a production rate of 2,000 tpd.
- · Mineral Reserves have not yet been estimated for the Project.

## 25.3 Mineral Processing

- · SLR has reviewed the metallurgical test work reports and summaries provided by Search Minerals. The test work has been performed by SGS Canada Inc. (SGS), which is a highly experienced and competent laboratory.  The interpretation of the test work appears to be reasonable.
- · Although additional test work is required, the qualified person (QP) is of the opinion that the available test work is sufficient to define the design of recovery methods at a PEA level.
- · The  proposed  Primary  Production  Plant  includes  a  simple  comminution  circuit  which,  given adequate test work on a range of samples and competent design based on such test work, should be easily implemented.  Similarly, the proposed magnetic separation circuits are standard in other industries and should operate as projected provided that test work confirms the preliminary test results forming the basis for the present design.
- · The  proposed  hydrometallurgical  process  starts  with  an  acid  bake  process.    This  is  a  widely practised method of decomposing REE minerals and is presently used to produce most of the world's REEs.  The proposed Hydrometallurgical Processing Plant would dissolve the REE from the acid bake product in water and remove impurities through hydrolysis using a standard process. The balance of the process includes REE precipitation and releach followed by multiple stages of purification ahead of REE carbonate precipitation.  As noted by NewPro, additional test work is required to confirm process details.  SLR is of the opinion that the process might be simplified.
- · Although additional test work, including pilot plant operations, are required, SLR is of the opinion that the design and resulting equipment requirements and reagent demand are adequate for a PEA level of study.

## 25.4 Environment

- · Search  Minerals  has  a  Code  of  Business  Conduct  policy,  Integrated  Policy  on  Health,  Safety, Environment  and  Community  Relations,  Insider  Trading  Policy,  Whistleblower  Policy,  and Disclosure Policy.  Additional policies are under development.
- · Search  Minerals  has  corporate  environmental  and  social  policies,  although  these  are  being expanded and further developed.
- · Baseline studies have been initiated based on preliminary Project information.
- · The Project will require provincial approvals and permits.  The revised project scope as currently configured does not trigger a federal Impact Assessment under the Impact Assessment Act (IAA).
- · Search Minerals conducts community engagement in relation to exploration activities and plans to conduct further engagement activities in 2022.  It has initiated some social initiatives such as offering limited scholarships to people in the local community.
- · Search Minerals signed an agreement with the NunatuKavut Community Council (NCC) on August 27, 2012, to address exploration activities and this remains valid.
- · Deep  Fox  lies  within  the  St.  Lewis  protected  water  supply  catchment  area.    Search  Minerals continues to work directly with the St. Lewis Town Council to ensure that residents are informed of activities and that concerns are addressed in a timely manner.  This is a key risk to manage as the Project progresses.  Surface water studies are required to understand any potential quality and quantity impacts on the water resource.    Surface water studies were initiated in 2020, have been  ongoing  since  then  and  will  continue  throughout  the  exploration  and  development activities.
- · A Rehabilitation and Closure Plan (RCP) and financial assurance for rehabilitation and closure costs will be required to obtain environmental approvals.

## 26.0 RECOMMENDATIONS

Advanced engineering studies (Pre-Feasibility, Feasibility) on the Project are merited, through further data collection, testing, and analysis.

SLR offers the following specific recommendations by area:

## 26.1 Geology and Mineral Resources

- 1. Expand the master drilling database content to include all QA/QC data.
- 2. Review and update the QA/QA protocols to address potential improvements regarding usage of coarse blank samples, type and number of certified reference materials (CRMs), nominal values of internal standards, and batch failing criteria and re-assay procedures.
- 3. Collect wider channel samples to generate field sample duplicates.
- 4. Conduct infill drilling on portions of Deep Fox and Foxtrot to a spacing of 15 m to 30 m.  This is expected  to  suffice  for  Measured  Resources  (although  this  is  subject  to  confirmation  via variography).  SLR understands that Search is currently undertaking a 11,000m infill exploration program.
- 5. Continue exploration for the expansion of Deep Fox and Foxtrot, with mineralization down-plunge and lateral extent targeted drilling.
- 6. Continue exploration of high grade REE prospects in the area.

## 26.2 Mining and Mineral Reserves

- 1. Develop  a  better  understanding  of  the  geotechnical  conditions  in  order  to  optimize  stope dimensions and potentially reduce the amount of development.  SLR understands that Search Minerals is currently undertaking a 3,000 m geotechnical drilling program.
- 2. Continue drilling campaigns focusing on areas where Inferred Mineral Resources can be upgraded to the Indicated category.
- 3. Complete a study which assesses the required cemented rock fill (CRF) strength to confirm the stability of the exposed stope walls.
- o Additionally, assess the optimum backfill granulometry and cement content.  This will provide information on cement content required and can provide opportunity for reduced operating costs.
- 4. Investigate using tailings in paste fill applications for backfill in primary transverse stopes.

## 26.3 Mineral Processing

- 1. Consistent with Search Minerals' plans, continue additional laboratory test work to confirm, or improve upon, present recovery and reagent consumption values and to examine the response of the beneficiation and hydrometallurgical processes to mineral variability.
- o Future test work must also include pilot-scale operations, the determination of engineering parameters  such  as  liquid-solid-separation  requirements,  and  the  characterization  of effluents and residues to allow the design of suitable handling, storage, and disposal facilities.

- o Waste solids and solutions from the beneficiation and hydrometallurgical processing plants need to be tested to allow for the design of suitable handling systems and ensure compliance with all applicable regulations.

## 26.4 Infrastructure

- 1. Complete  a  detailed  environmental  assessment  and  detailed  engineering  for  the  tailings  site adjacent to the Primary Production Plant, identified by SLR, to confirm its viability.  Identify and complete investigations for a tailings site for the Hydrometallurgical Processing Plant.
- 2. Continue investigating port locations.  SLR understands that the Port of Fox Harbour has a limited draft of approximately nine metres which could allow for up to 15,000 deadweight tonnage (dwt) vessels.  Fox Harbour will also have a limited shipping season and consideration for scheduling allowance will need to be accounted for.
- 3. Investigate the viability of the route proposed by SLR has, which utilizes an access road connecting Highway 513 to Deep Fox in order to avoid traffic in St. Lewis.  These investigations should include environmental and engineering assessments.

## 26.5 Environment

- 1. Develop the corporate environmental and social policies and publish these on Search Minerals website.
- o Develop plans to implement and audit the requirements of these policies
- 2. Plan, progress, and expand on ongoing environmental and social baseline studies to ensure that all  Project  infrastructure  and  activities  are  covered.    Ensure  that  all  environmental  and  social aspects are fully addressed to provide a comprehensive baseline record for the Project, and to meet regulatory requirements for provincial and federal applications for approval and permitting.
- o These studies should include other receptor pathways that could affect human health e.g., soil, water, vegetation, animals, toxicity testing on target species, geochemical studies, and technological options to limit potential environmental and social risks.
- 3. Develop and implement a plan to obtain all the required federal and provincial approvals and permits  and  ensure  that  these  are  in  place  in  advance  of  construction.    This  plan  should  be developed in consultation with the regulators, fully integrate with environmental study planning and engineering studies, and identify any risks to the approval processes and mitigation measures, if applicable.
- 4. Implement the community engagement plan and ensure that all stakeholders are included.  The engagement plan should detail the process for engaging Indigenous communities interested in the Project.
- 5. Continue to honour the Mining Exploration Activities Agreement with the NCC which was signed on  August  27,  2012.    Determine  the  need  for  additional  community  agreements  through engagement processes.
- 6. Continue to implement social initiatives and expand on these as appropriate and as needs are identified through stakeholder and Indigenous community engagement.
- 7. Continue surface water studies to understand any potential quality and quantity impacts on the St. Lewis protected water supply catchment area, and develop management and mitigation plans. Continue stakeholder engagement on this issue.

<!-- image -->

- 8. Conduct additional test work on the beneficiation and hydrometallurgical residues and effluents. As part of regulatory approval processes, compile an RCP in accordance with legal requirements and applicable guidelines, considering best practice where possible and ensuring that the financial assurance is in place as required by law.

A budget for carrying out the recommendations is as provided in Table 26-1.
