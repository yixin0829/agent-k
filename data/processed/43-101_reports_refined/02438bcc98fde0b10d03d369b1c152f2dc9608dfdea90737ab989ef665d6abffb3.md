## 1.0 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

## 1.1 General

The Nemaska Lithium's Whabouchi Lithium Deposit and Hydromet Plant project (the ' Project ') is composed of two (2) specific operations, the first one at the Whabouchi property  that  will  house  the  mining  and  concentrating  operations  and  the  other  at Salabery-de-Valleyfield, QC that will the site of the hydrometallurgical plant.

The  Whabouchi  property  is  located  in  the  Eeyou  Istchee  /  James  Bay  area  of  the Province of Quebec, approximately 30 km east of the Nemaska community and 300 km north-northwest of the town of Chibougamau. The Property is accessible by the Route du  Nord , the  main  all-season  gravel  road  linking  Chibougamau  to  Nemaska,  and crossing the Property near its center. The Nemiscau airport is located 18 km west of the Property.

The  Property  is  composed  of  one  (1)  block  containing  33  map-designated  claims covering  a  total  of  1,716  ha.  The  claims  are  100 %  owned  by  Nemaska  and  were acquired via a purchase agreement with Victor Cantore Group (16 claims), a purchase agreement  with  Golden  Goose  Resources  Inc.  (10  claims)  and  directly  by  map designation (7 claims). The claims acquired from Golden Goose are subject to a 2 % NSR royalty, 50 % of this 2 % NSR can be purchased by Nemaska for $ 1,000,000. The claims acquired from Victor Cantore and four (4) of the seven (7) claims acquired by map designation are subject to a 3 % NSR royalty in favour of Victor Cantore Group and 33.3 % of this 3 % NSR can be purchased by Nemaska for $ 1,000,000.

## 1.2 Geology

The Whabouchi property is located in the northeast part of the Superior Province of the Canadian  Shield  craton,  in  the Lac  des  Montagnes volcano-sedimentary  formation which is principally composed of metasediments and mafic and ultramafic amphibolites.  A  spodumene-bearing  pegmatite  intrusive  dyke  swarm  occurs  on  the Property and is composed of a series of sub-parallel and general sub-vertical pegmatite bodies  up  to  90 m  total  composite  width.  The  mineralized  pegmatite  swarm  has  a general NE-SW orientation, extends 1.3 km along strike and reaches a depth of more than 500 m below surface. The lithium mineralization occurs mainly in medium to large spodumene crystals (up to 30 cm in size) but petalite also occurs, averaging less than 2 % in the deposit.

Nemaska completed exploration programs in 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013 on the Property.  A  total  of  143  surface  channels  for  944  samples  and  129  drill  holes  for 23,900 m were completed by Nemaska. In addition to drilling,  14  line-km  of  ground magnetic  surveying  covering  the  main  mineralized  occurrence  and  670  line-km  of helicopter-borne magnetic surveying covering the Property were completed.

## 1.3 Mineral Resource Estimate

SGS  Canada  Inc.  (' SGS ')  completed  the  Mineral  Resource  update  using  the  digital database supplied by Nemaska (as of December 20 th , 2013) which included channel data

<!-- image -->

from trenches and drill holes data completed by Nemaska since 2009. The database used to produce the Mineral Resource estimate was derived from a total of 272 channels and diamond drill holes.

The Mineral Resource was estimated from a resource block model interpolated using ordinary  kriging.  The  2011  geological  model  was  updated  with  the  new  exploration information from 2013; the analytical data contained within the wireframe solids was then normalized, to 2 m length composites. The composite data was used to interpolate the Li O grade of blocks by ordinary kriging on a regularly spaced defined grid that fills 2 the  3-D  wireframe  solids.  An  optimized  pit  shell  model  provided  by  Met-Chem  was used to limit the block model to its potential for economic extraction, hence limiting the depth of the reported resources. The interpolated blocks located below the bedrock/overburden interface, within the optimized pit shell and above the 0.43 % Li O 2 established cut-off grade comprise the Mineral Resources.

Table 1.1 shows a summary of the estimated Mineral Resource for a cut-off grade of 0.43 % Li2O.

Table 1.1 - Estimated Mineral Resources (0.43 % Li2O Cut-off Grade)

|   Cut-off Grade  Li2 O (%) | Category               |   Tonnage*  (Mt) |   Li2 O Grade  (%) |
|----------------------------|------------------------|------------------|--------------------|
|                       0.43 | Measured               |           12.998 |               1.6  |
|                       0.43 | Indicated              |           14.993 |               1.54 |
|                       0.43 | Measured and Indicated |           27.991 |               1.57 |

Note:  The  Mineral  Resource  estimate  has  been  estimated  using  the  Canadian  Institute  of  Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (CIM) Definitions Standards for Mineral Resources in accordance with National Instrument  43-101  -  Standards  of  Disclosure  for  Mineral  Projects.  Mineral  resources  which  are  not Mineral Reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. Inferred Mineral Resources are exclusive of the Measured and Indicated Resources.

## 1.4 Mineral Processing and Testing

## 1.4.1 Concentrator Process Testing

Mine  representatives  samples  from  both  drill  core  and  a  50-tonne  bulk  sample  were used at different stages to define the mineral processing parameters.

Bench scale testing was carried out on core from four (4) NQ holes drilled by Nemaska through the central portion of the main pegmatite in order to obtain approximately one (1) tonne of mineralized core exclusively for metallurgical test work. The core was sent by truck to the SGS in Lakefield in July of 2010. The head grade of the sample was reported as 1.72 % Li O. The material collected from the pegmatite was 5.5 % higher in 2 Li2 O  than  the  average  grade  determined  by  Geostat  and  used  in  their  resource estimation. This was considered to be within acceptable limits and appropriate for the metallurgical work for the PEA Study. The following tests were carried out:

- · Mineralogy;
- · Crushing and Grinding Tests;
- · Dense Medium Test Work, and
- · Bench Scale Flotation Tests.

Dense  Media  Separation  (' DMS ')  pilot  testing  was  carried  out  on  two  (2)  separate samples from the Whabouchi deposit. The first being a 25-tonne blasted outcrop sample and  the  second  was  a  5-tonne  mine  representative  sample  consisting  of  a  blend  of outcrop and drill core materials. Testing was carried out in several stages consisting of crushing, scrubbing, screening, DMS, magnetic separation, and dewatering.

Subsequent  DMS  work  was  done  in  2013  and  2014  during  the  preparation  of  the feasibility  study.  This  equipment has the advantage of producing three (3) products concentrate, middling and tailing in one machine.

Crushed feed to less than 9.5 mm entering the plant will be screened at -0.5 mm, with the  fines  going  to  flotation.  The  9.5  x  0.5 mm  DMS  feed  constitutes  80 %  of  feed distribution based on feed entering plant.

Pilot scale flotation tests were carried out on the as-received blasted outcrop and mine representative  samples,  as  well  as  the  DMS  middling  product.  Using  the  alternative DMS  technology  and  flotation  pilot  testing  at  a  head  grade  of  1.61 %  Li O,  the 2 following was concluded:

- · 54 %  of  the  total  lithium  was  recovered  in  the  DMS  concentrate  at  a  grade  of 5.83 % Li2O after magnetic separation, while 36 % of the lithium reported to the flotation circuit. This latter included 20 % of the plant feed mass in screened fines at  less  than  0.5 mm  and  15.2 %  of  plant  feed  mass  as  DMS  middlings  grading 1.92 %  Li O.  Middlings  were  ground  to  a  P 2 80 of  0.174 mm  in  a  ball  mill  and mixed with earlier screened fines.
- · The flotation pilot plant Li recovery was about 80 %.
- · Combined recovery was 83.8 % with 6.0 % Li2O in spodumene concentrate.

Sedimentation and filtration tests were carried out at SGS. Based on the filtration tests, it was concluded that a pressure filter would be required. The flotation tailings will be combined with the DMS tailings and dry stacked.

## 1.4.2 Pyrometallurgical Testing

Prior to the hydrometallurgical test work at SGS, the Whabouchi  spodumene concentrate  was  roasted  at  an  equipment  manufacturer's  pilot  plant  facility  in  U.S.A. Fine  (flotation)  and  coarse  (DMS)  concentrates  from  the  original  concentration  flow sheet were shipped from SGS to the facility laboratory. Two (2) blends of concentrates were prepared using the as-received coarse material and the dried fine material. A first blend  was  prepared,  containing  75 %  fines  and  25 %  coarse.  The  second  blend contained 50 % fines and 50 % coarse.

A second round of spodumene conversion and acid roasting test work was performed by SGS  in  the  winter  of  2013  to  validate  and  optimize  previous  results.  Testing  was performed on DMS and flotation concentrates separately.

Roasting  converts  the  spodumene's  crystalline  structure  from  alpha  to  beta.  The conversion temperature will be about 1,025 ºC. The beta phase is reactive with sulfuric acid and produces lithium sulfate, which is amenable to leaching. A paddle mixer was used to blend the beta-spodumene with 93 % sulfuric acid.

## 1.4.3 Hydrometallurgical Testing

The  hydrometallurgical  testing  was  done  in  three  (3)  phases  at  SGS.  Additional  test work was completed by Electrosynthesis.

## a) Hydrometallurgical Testing - Phase 1

The Phase 1 consisted of concentrate leach and all purification steps (primary and secondary impurity removal and ion exchange). The test program was carried out in November 2011 by SGS. The two (2) blends tested during the pyrometallurgy test work were provided to feed the pilot plant (75/25 and 50/50).

The  objectives  of  the  concentrate  leach  and  the  Primary  Impurity  Removal (' PIR ') were to dissolve lithium sulfate and remove the major impurities (Fe, Al, Si, Mn and Mg).

The objectives  of  the  Secondary  Impurity  Removal  (' SIR ')  were  to  precipitate Ca, Mg and Mn impurities from the PIR filtrate.

The  objective  of  the  Ion  Exchange  (' IX ')  circuit  was  to  further  reduce  the calcium and magnesium tenors from the SIR discharge. The IX circuit consisted of  three  (3)  columns  packed  with  a  cationic  resin  which  is  selective  towards divalent and trivalent metal ions. The process consisted in a lead/lag/regeneration operation.

## b) Hydrometallurgical Testing - Phase 2 and Phase 3

The hydrometallurgical (Phase 2) test program was carried out in December 2011 by  SGS.  Phase  2  consisted  of  Membrane  Electrolysis  (' ME ')  test  work  and subsequent crystallization to produce lithium hydroxide monohydrate. The objective  of  the  electrolysis  process  will  be  to  produce  a  lithium  hydroxide (LiOH)  solution  from  a  high  purity  lithium  sulfate  (Li SO )  solution.  The 2 4 objective  of  the  crystallization  process  will  be  to  produce  high  quality  solid lithium hydroxide monohydrate (LiOH-H2O) from the lithium hydroxide (LiOH) solution generated through membrane electrolysis.

The hydrometallurgical (Phase 3) test program was carried out in March 2012 by SGS. Phase 3 consisted of the production of lithium carbonate. The objective of the test work was to prove that lithium hydroxide conversion to lithium carbonate can  be  an  effective  method  of  producing  high  purity  lithium  carbonate.  The lithium carbonate (Li CO3) production process consists of two (2) stages, the first 2 is referred to as Lithium hydroxide (LiOH) Carbonization (' LC ') and the second is  called lithium bicarbonate decomposition (' DC ').  During carbonization (LC),

carbon dioxide gas will be reacted with lithium hydroxide at room temperature to form lithium carbonate. Once all lithium hydroxide will be carbonized, an excess of  carbon  dioxide  converts  lithium  carbonate  to  lithium  bicarbonate.  During decomposition  (DC),  the  solution  will  be  heated  to near boiling. Lithium bicarbonate  formed  in  the  first  stage  will  be  decomposed  to  insoluble  lithium carbonate and carbon dioxide.

## 1.4.4 Membrane Electrolysis Test Work

Various phases of membrane electrolysis test work were performed by the Electrosynthesis  Company  between  the  autumn  of  2012  and  the  winter  of  2014.  The objectives  were  to  determine  optimal  operating  parameters  (concentration,  current efficiency, current density, configuration etc.) and to estimate membrane and anode life cycle.  Long  term  stability  of  the  process  was  demonstrated  by  a  serie  of  tests  on  a continuous basis totaling about 1,000 hours and referred to as ' 1,000-hour test '.

## 1.5 Mining Operation

## 1.5.1 Mineral Reserves

## a) Open Pit Mineral Reserves

The  Mineral  Reserves  for  the  Whabouchi  deposit  were  estimated  using  the updated  resource  model  that  was  prepared  by  Jean-Philippe  Paiement,  M.Sc. P.Geo., of SGS on January 28 th , 2014. The Mineral Reserves are the portion of the Measured  and  Indicated  Mineral  Resources  that  have  been  identified  as  being economically extractable and which incorporate mining loses and the addition of waste dilution.

The first step in the Mineral Reserve estimate was to carry out a pit optimization analysis.  The  pit  optimization  analysis  used  economic  criteria  to  determine  the cut-off  grade  and  to  what  extent  the  deposit  can  be  mined  profitably.  The  pit optimization  analysis  was  done  using  the  MS-Economic  Planner  module  of MineSight ® Version 8.5. The optimizer uses the 3D Lerchs-Grossmann algorithm to  determine  the  economic  pit  limits  based  on  input  of  mining  and  processing costs and revenue per block.

The  pit  optimization  analysis  identified  the  pit  shell  that  should  be  used  as  the basis  for  the  open  pit  design.  The  additional  Measured  and  Indicated  Mineral Resources  that  are  outside  the  limits  of  this  optimized  pit  shell  were  then evaluated as an underground mining operation. The cut-off grade for the open pit mine was calculated to be 0.43 % Li O. 2

An open pit was designed with an overall pit slope of 56° which was based on a geotechnical study that was completed by Journeaux Assoc. The pit has 10 m high benches and the ramp will be 20 m wide with a maximum grade of 10 %. The pit will be approximately 1,300 m long and 300 m wide at surface with a maximum pit depth from surface of 190 m. The open pit design includes 11.7 Mt of Proven Mineral Reserves and 8.3 Mt of Probable Mineral Reserves for a total of 20.0 Mt at a grade of 1.53 % Li O. In order to access these reserves, 2.4 Mt of overburden, 2

40.7 Mt of waste rock and 0.3 Mt of Inferred Mineral Resources must be mined. This  total  waste  quantity  of  43.4 Mt  results  in  a  stripping  ratio  of  2.2  to  1. Table 1.2 presents the open pit Mineral Reserves for the Whabouchi deposit. The Mineral Reserves account for mining dilution.

Table 1.2 - Whabouchi Open Pit Mineral Reserves

| Category            |   Tonnage (Mt) |   Li2O Grade  (%) |
|---------------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Proven              |           11.7 |              1.58 |
| Probable            |            8.3 |              1.46 |
| Proven and Probable |           20   |              1.53 |

## b) Underground Mineral Reserves

The underground mine will be developped at the end of the open pit life and will take over the production once the open pit reserves will be depleted in Year 20.

The underground mine will be accessed via a mine portal located at elevation 188 m and a main ramp that will connect to the six (6) underground sub-levels located on  the  footwall  side  of  the  orebody.  The  sub-levels  will  be  spaced  at  every  30 metres in elevation located at levels 187 m, 157 m, 127 m, 97 m, 67 m and 37 m.

The deposit will be mined using conventional long-hole open stoping method at a rate  between  3,500  and  4,000  tonnes  per  day.  Stope  and  crown  pillars  will  be recovered at the end of the mine life.

All  development  and  production  will  be  made  by  contractors  due  to  the  short underground mine life.

The underground Mine Reserves were estimated at 7.3 Mt grading 1.28% Li2O of Proven  and  Probable  Category.  The  reserves  include  dilution  and  recovery  and were estimated using a 0.8 % cut-off. Table 1.3 presents the underground Mineral Reserves for  the  Whabouchi  deposit.  The  Mineral  Reserves  account  for  mining dilution.

Table 1.3 - Whabouchi Underground Mineral Reserves

| Category            |   Tonnage (Mt) |   Li2O Grade  (%) |

| Proven and Probable |            7.3 |              1.28 |

## c) Combined Open Pit and Underground Reserves

The  combined  open  pit  and  underground  Mineral  Reserves  for  Waboushi  were estimated  at  27.3 Mt  of  ore  grading  1.46 %  Li O  as  shown  in  Table  1.4  below. 2 Proven Reserves account for 49 % of the reserves.

## 1.5.2 Mining Methods

## a) Open Pit Mining

The mining method selected for the Project will be a conventional open pit, truck and shovel, drill and blast operation. Vegetation, topsoil and overburden will be stripped and stockpiled for future reclamation use. The ore and waste rock will be mined with 10 m high benches, drilled, blasted and loaded into rigid frame haul trucks with hydraulic excavators.

A topsoil and overburden stockpile has been designed 100 m to the east of the pit ramp exit,  to  the  south  of  the  concentrator.  Material  that  will  be  placed  in  this stockpile will be used for future reclamation.

The Project has selected to use a co-disposal method for the tailings produced at the concentrator and the waste rock from the mine. Co-disposal is the mixing of fine tailings and coarse mine waste rock to produce a single waste stream. Mixing the fine and coarse waste reduces the empty void space primarily associated with coarse  waste  streams,  while  simultaneously  increasing  the  strength  of  the  fines. Tailings  produced  at  the  concentrator  will  have  a  moisture  content  of  around 14 %. The tailings will be transported from the concentrator to the waste rock pile with the same 46-tonne truck fleet that will be used in the open pit.

Two (2) waste rock piles have been designed and located on the north side of the Route du Nord .  The  first  waste  pile  will  be  built  from  the  start  of  the  operation until Year 15, while the second pile which will be located on the north side of the Hydro-Québec 735 kV high voltage power line will be built from Year 16 until the end of the operation. During the first six (6) years, the dumping of waste rock and  tailings  will  concentrate  on  the  east  side  of  the  waste  pile  so  that  the  final design can be reached and progressive reclamation can begin.

Mining operations for the Project will be 50 weeks per year, operating around the clock on two (2), twelve (12) hour shifts. The two (2) weeks shutdown in the mine will occur during the goose hunting season. During this period, the concentrator will  be  either  fed  from  the  run  of  mine  ore  stockpile  and  /  or  going  through scheduled maintenance.

The mine plan is based on an annual production of 216,485 tonnes of concentrate (resulting  in  214,320 tonnes  of  concentrate  after  one  percent  (1 %)  in  handling and transportation losses were accounted for). An initial starter pit was designed which will supply the majority of the run of mine ore for the first five (5) years of

<!-- image -->

the  operation.  The  purpose  of  the  starter  pit  is  to  maximize  the  feed  grade  and minimize the strip ratio during the early years of the operation. The total material mined per year during the 20-year life of the open pit mine ranges from 1.0 Mt in pre-production to a maximum of 5.3 Mt in Year 10. The average annual grade of Li2 O varies 1.44 % to 1.60 % during the 20-year period.

The mine equipment fleet for the open pit includes seven (7) 46-tonne haul trucks, two (2) hydraulic excavators with 6 m  buckets, two (2) diesel powered down the 3 hole track drills that will drill 114 mm (4.5") holes as well as a fleet of support and service equipment. Blasting will be carried out using bulk emulsion with an average powder factor of 0.37 kg/t. The mine workforce has been estimated to be approximately 101 employees.

## b) Underground Mining

The ore extraction will switch form an open pit operation to an underground mine located underneath the final pit floor in Year 21 of the operation. The duration of the underground mining is six (6) years and is scheduled to be in operation from the beginning of Year 21 to the end of Year 26. An underground mine production ramp-up period of 4 months is planned during the last months of Year 20 to reach the cruising production rate of 1.2 Mt of ROM at the beginning of Year 21. The duration  period  of  the  development  of  the  underground  mine  is  planned  for  20 months starting at the beginning of Year 19.

The  underground  mine  development  and  operation  will  be  given  to  a  mining contractor that will excavate and haul the ore and waste from underground to a stockpile located at the bottom of the open pit. The Owner will keep management and  engineering  activities  to  supervise  and  provide  engineering  services  to  the contractor to ensure work efficiency and safety. Hauling of the ore and waste from the  bottom  of  the  pit  to  the  crusher  and  the  waste  disposal  area  along  with  the mine  tailings  operation  will  continue  to  be  managed  directly  by  the  Owner's personnel using the existing mobile equipment fleet from the open pit operation. The underground mine will be operated on two (2) shifts of 10 hours, seven (7) days per week.

The mining methodology selected is 30-metre high long-hole type stopes. Based on the favorable geotechnical and hydrogeological conditions, backfilling of the excavated stopes will not be required. However, in order to ensure the rock mass stability and work safety within the underground excavation zone, four (4) central stope pillars will be maintained until the last stages of the operation. The very last excavation  phase  consists  of  mining  the  30-metre  thick  remaining  crown  pillar from the open pit floor.

The mine design will be purposely kept as simple as possible in order to minimize the development capital expenditure due to the short period of six (6) years of the remaining life of mine of the Project. Halfway down in the western area of the open  pit,  an  underground  entry  portal  to  a  main  ramp  driven  downward  will provide  access  to  the  six  (6)  horizontal  haulage  drifts  which  in  turn  provides access to the draw points of the various stopes.

<!-- image -->

The annual production requirement will be the same as during the open pit period with yearly lithium concentrate production ranging from 188 to 240 kt (1.2 to 1.4 Mt/y  of  ore).  An  overlapping  underground  mine  ramp  up  production  period  of four (4) months with a target ROM production of 300 kt is planned with the open pit ore extraction finishing at the end of Year 20. This will ensure an uninterrupted ROM feed to the concentrator.

The  underground  mine  work  schedule  will  be  similar  to  the  open  pit  operation with two (2) shifts per day, seven (7) days per week and 51 weeks per year. The shifts will be ten (10) hours with two (2) hours between shifts for clearing of the blasting fumes.

The contractor will supply and operate the underground mining fleet consisting of development jumbos (2), production drills (2), LHDs (3) and haulage trucks (4). The underground haulage trucks will haul the ore and waste up to the mine portal where it will be dumped into stockpiles to be reclaimed by the Owner and hauled out of the pit to the crusher or waste dump.

The  underground  mine  will  require  70  employees  for  the  development  phase while  44  will  be  required  during  the  production  phase,  excluding  Owner's management and engineering team and waste and tailings personnel.

## 1.6 Spodumene, Lithium Hydroxide-Monohydrate and Lithium Carbonate Recovery

## 1.6.1 Concentrator

The Whabouchi concentrator will be located near the open pit mine. The concentrator will  be  designed  to  produce  a  nominal  216,485  tonnes  of  spodumene  concentrate  per year.  The  Run-of-Mine  (' ROM ')  mineralized  material  will  be  transported  to  the primary jaw crusher and then conveyed to the secondary and tertiary cone crushers. The crushed mineralized material will be screened and the screen oversize will be upgraded in  a  dense  media  circuit  to  produce  a  coarse  spodumene  concentrate  and  a  middlings product  that will be  further ground  and  treated  by  flotation. The  DMS  coarse spodumene concentrate will then be dried in a rotary dryer before being fed to the dry magnetic  separation  system.  The  magnetic  particulates  will  be  discarded  with  the tailings  to  produce  a  non-ferrous  concentrate.  The  DMS  middlings  product  will  be combined with screen undersize, less than 0.5 mm material (fine), and will be further ground in a ball mill to a P 80 of 174 microns. This ground product forms the feed for the flotation circuit. The flotation circuit consists of de-sliming and mica flotation followed by  attrition  magnetic  separation  and  then  followed  by  more  de-sliming  and  finaly spodumene flotation.

Mica concentrate, de-slimed and magnetic materials and spodumene rougher flotation tailings will be combined, thickened and filtered in a filter press to a moisture content of about 6 % and subsequently combined with DMS tailings and transported by haul truck to  the  mine  waste  dump.  The  spodumene  flotation  concentrate  will  be  thickened  and filtered  by  a  pressure  filter  to  about  8 %  moisture  and  combined  with  the  dry  DMS concentrate for transport by road trucks to Chibougamau. The shipped concentrate will have  moisture  of  less  than  five  percent  (5 %)  to  prevent  freexing  during  the  winter

months. Here it will be transferred into railcars (93 net tonnes each) for transport to the Salaberry-de-Valleyfield hydrometallurgical plant for further processing.

## 1.6.2 Hydrometallurgical Plant

The plant availability has been estimated at 93 %. The hydromet plant will be designed to produce a nominal 28,206 tonnes of lithium hydroxide monohydrate crystals per year and a nominal 3,277 tonnes of lithium carbonate powder per year. The overall lithium recovery  of  the  hydromet  circuit  will  be  88.4 %.  The  concentrate  will  be  discharged from  the  railcar  into  a  receiving  hopper.  A  reclaim  conveyor  will  transport  the concentrate to the hydrometallurgical plant where it will feed the spodumene conversion kiln. The kiln will heat the spodumene to approximately 1,050 °C. The high temperature converts  the  spodumene  concentrate  from  the  alpha  crystalline  structure  to  the  beta crystalline structure. A  flash  cooler  will  use  ambient  air  to  cool  the  converted spodumene to approximately 200 °C.

The beta-spodumene will be fed to the acid roaster. Sulphuric acid will be sprayed onto the  beta-spodumene  in  the  roaster  and  the  resulting  reaction  produces  solid  lithium sulfate and aluminum silicates. The temperature in the roaster must be maintained above 175 °C.

Lithium sulfate, being soluble in water at these conditions, will dissolve. The discharge of  the  concentrate  leach  tank  will  be  pumped  to  a  downstream  belt  filter.  The  cake, which consists mainly of aluminum silicate, will be conveyed outside the plant building and stockpiled before being dispatched to potential end users.

The  lithium  sulfate  solution  will be  pumped  to  the  PIR  tanks  for  purification. Precipitated impurities such as iron and aluminum are will be separated from the liquor using a thickener and three (3) filter presses. The residue will be sent to the tailings and the purified liquor will be pumped the second purification stage.

In  the  SIR  tanks,  the  pH  will  be  further  increased  to  precipitate  even  more  dissolved metals as solid hydroxides and carbonates. The discharge slurry will be pumped to the candle filters to remove the solid impurities from the lithium solution. The solid residue will be directed to the tailings. The solution will be stored in the IX feed tank before being pumped to the next cleaning process.

The  final  lithium  sulfate  solution  cleaning  step  will  be  performed  by  three  (3)  ion exchange  columns  in  a  round-robin  configuration.  Solution  will  be  fed  to  two  (2) columns  in  series  (the  lead  column  and  the  lag  column)  while  the  third  is  being cleaned/stripped/regenerated. Clean lithium sulfate solution discharging from  the columns will be stored in the lithium sulfate feed tank. Waste solutions from the acid strip and wash steps will be collected in the IX residue tank and pumped to the tailings tank for disposal.

An electromembrane process will be used to convert lithium sulfate (Li SO ) to lithium 2 4 hydroxide (LiOH).

The  LiOH-H2O  crystallization  circuit  consists  of  a  single-stage  mechanical  vapor recompression falling film evaporator followed by a series of two (2) forced circulation crystallizers,  the  crude  crystallizer  and  the  pure  crystallizer.  The  crystals  will  be

<!-- image -->

separated from the mother liquor in a centrifuge where they reach a moisture content of about five (5) percent by weight (' % w/w '). The dewatered crystals will discharge to a rotary tray dryer before the final packaging step. The dried crystals will be stored in a bin  located  above  the  packaging  system  where  crystals  will  be  packaged  in  1-tonne bags.

Lithium hydroxide remaining in the crystallization purge solution will be recovered in the  lithium  carbonate  precipitation  process.  The  Li CO   production  process  will  be 2 3 carried out in two (2) steps. The first step is called the lithium hydroxide carbonization (LC). The second step is called the lithium bicarbonate decomposition step (DC). In the LC step carbon dioxide will be injected at the bottom of the tank to react with lithium hydroxide and then with the precipitated lithium carbonate.

In the DC step, the lithium bicarbonate solution will be heated to 95ºC. The tanks will be jacketed and heated with steam. The DC decanter underflow joins the LC decanter underflow in the belt filter feed tank.

A vacuum belt filter will be used to dewater the lithium carbonate slurry to 70 % (w/w) solids. The belt filter cake will fall by gravity to the fluid bed dryer. The dried product will be transferred to the pulverization system. The jet mill will use high pressure air to pulverize  the  lithium  carbonate  to  a  P 80 of  about  five  (5)  microns.  The  pulverized product  will  be  transferred  to  a  bin  located  above  the  packaging  system.  A  robot operated system will be used to package the Li CO  into 25-kg bags. 2 3

## 1.8 Market Studies

Two (2) market study reports were previously prepared for Nemaska, one (1) by Roskill Consulting Group Limited (September 2012) and one (1) by signumBOX Inteligencia de  Mercados  (March  2012),  as  part  of  the  NI 43-101  Technical  Report,  Preliminary Economic  Assessment  of  the  Whabouchi  Lithium  Deposit  and  Hydromet  Plant, Effective  Date  of  October  2 nd ,  2012,  filed  on  November  16 th ,  2012  and  revised  on February 27 th , 2013. To complement these, an updated Lithium Carbonate and Lithium Hydroxide  Market  Study  was  prepared  by  signumBOX  Inteligencia  de  Mercados  in April 2014. Nemaska also took into consideration the Roskill Consulting Group Limited Lithium publication: Market outlook to 2017, twelfth edition, 2013 in its assessment of the potential markets.

Batteries  are  the  main  application  for  lithium  with  38 %  of  the  total  consumption. Ceramics and glasses is the second largest application with 25 % of the total. Greases and lubricants account for about 12 % of total consumption.

Given the estimates presented regarding the use of lithium in its different applications, it is estimated that this year total lithium consumption would reach 156,700 tonnes, 6.0 % more than in 2013. This growth will be driven by the battery industry, which globally is expected  to  grow  11.2 %  this  year.  Considering  inventory  variations,  total  demand would  range  between  165,000  -  170,000  tonnes  as  Lithium  Carbonate  Equivalent (' LCE ').

Lithium carbonate is the most widely used chemical compound with 48 % of the total lithium  consumption.  Due  to  the  increased  use  of  lithium  hydroxide  in  batteries,  its demand has increased from 19 % in 2011 to 21 % in 2014 of the total demand.

<!-- image -->

It  is  forecasted  that  lithium  demand  in  the  next  five  (5)  years  will  grow  on  a  base scenario  at  a  rate  of  about  5.8 %  annually,  and  then  will  start  to  grow  faster  as  the development of hybrid and electric vehicles would allow them to be more affordable.

In the short run the main driver of the lithium demand will be batteries for electronic devices  such  that  by  the  end  of  the  decade  lithium  in  batteries  for  electric  cars  will almost reach the use of lithium in batteries for electronic devices. This would mean that by  2025  the  main  application  of  lithium  would  be,  by  far,  batteries  with  63 %  of participation  (nowadays  represents  38 %).  The  rest  of  the  applications  will  vary according to the global economy, especially those related to construction and housing activities. Consequently, in the base scenario it is estimated that by 2025 total demand of lithium chemicals, including inventories, will reach about 380,000 tonnes as LCE.

In  terms  of  lithium  chemical  compounds,  as  the  battery  industry  for  hybrid  electrical vehicles and electrical vehicles grows faster than the rest of the industries, the relative use of lithium hydroxide will also increase. It is then forecasted that the use of lithium hydroxide in rechargeable batteries would grow from the current 15.4 % to 36.3 % in 2025.

Sensitivity  analysis  of  three  (3)  pricing  scenarios  has  been  done  over  the  same projection  periods.  Lithium  hydroxide  is  the  most  sensitive  compound  to  market conditions,  because  of  its  use  as  cathode  material  in  batteries  for  hybrid  and  electric cars. The current price of lithium carbonate is in the range of US$ 5,500 - US$ 5,700 per tonne and for lithium hydroxide, in the range of US$ 7,100 - US$ 7,400 per tonne. Prices forecasted at the time the mill will enter into commercial production in 2017 are in the range of US$ 4,800 to US$ 5,300 for the carbonate and US$ 7,900 to US$ 8,200 for the hydroxide depending on the growth scenario selected.

An additional market study was also produced by Roskill Consulting Group Limited, Gypsum and Anhydrite: Global Industry Markets and Outlook, Eleventh Edition, 2014 to provide an independent opinion on the potential of the gypsum by-product generated by the hydromet plant. This study provides good indications that there is a large market for this type of product. On that basis, a neutral approach was taken for this Feasibility Study.  No  disposition  costs  have  been  added  and  no  additional  revenues  have  been accounted for. Furthermore, discussions with cement industry representatives have lead Met-Chem  to  conclude  that  since  the  by-product  is  of  high  quality,  very  stable  in composition  and  available  reliably,  it  would  be  at  an  advantage  over  existing  supply chain providers.

## 1.9 Environmental Permits

For the Whabouchi mine Project, a first version of the Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (' ESIA ') document was submitted to both federal (Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency) and provincial (Review Committee of the James Bay and Northern Quebec Agreement, or ' COMEX ')  authorities  for  review  in  April 2013. Questions and comments on that first version were sent by those authorities to Nemaska  Lithium  late  in  2013.  Nemaska  Lithium  completed  its  responses  to  all questions in early May 2014. These are the final steps before the Quebec's ministry of Sustainable Development,  Environment,  and The  Fight against Climate Change (' MDDELCC ') can grant a general certificate of authorization for the mine Project. As well, these are the final steps before the Canadian Minister of Environment can approve the mine Project.

For the Salaberrry-de-Valleyfield plant, MDDELCC has indicated that this part of the Project will need only an Certificate of Authorization (' CA ') and not a complete ESIA. To that effect a request for a CA for the hydromet plant in Sallabery-de-Valleyfield has been submitted to the MDDELCC on April 9 th , 2013.

## 1.10 Capital and Operating Costs

## 1.10.1 Capital Cost Estimate

The capital cost estimate consists of the direct capital costs for the Whabouchi mine and concentrator  site,  the  Chibougamau  transloading  facility  (included  in  the  Whabouchi site  estimate) and for the Salaberry-de-Valleyfield plant site and the indirect costs for the two (2) sites. Each of the estimates will have a contingency added which is larger (12.5 %) for the Salaberry-de-Valleyfield site compared with the Whabouchi site (10 %) mainly because the hydromet plant is considered to be more complex and is using new processes.  The  estimated  Owner's  costs  were  also  included.  Table  1.5  shows  the summary of the capital costs. A Working Capital, equal to three (3) months operating costs, has been included as well.

The totals may not add up due to rounding errors.

## 1.10.2 Operating Costs Estimate

The operating costs have been estimated for the Whabouchi operations that include the open  pit,  the  underground  mine,  the  concentrator  operations,  the  tailings  and  waste disposal.  They  were  estimated  based  on  the  average  over  the  life  of  the  Project.  The mine operating costs include the costs for leasing the major mine equipment. The truck transport  of  the  concentrate  from  the  site  to  Chibougamau  will  be  handled  by  a contractor and the transport by train to Sallabery-de-Valleyfield will be carried out by the  CN.  The  total  operating  costs  at  the  hydromet  plant  by  product  have  also  been estimated and are shown in Table 1.6.

Table 1.6 - Total Operating Costs Estimate by Product

| Operating Cost   (CAD/t LiOH-H2O)   | Operating Cost   (CAD/t Li2CO3)   |
|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| 3,450                               | 4,190                             |

## 1.11 Economic Analysis

An economic analysis based on the production and cost parameters of the Project has been carried out and the results are shown in Table 1.7. In the analysis, average selling prices of US$ 8,000 for LiOH-H2O and US$ 5,000 for Li2CO3 have been assumed.

## 1.12 Conclusions and Recommendations

The parameters used in this Feasibility Study include developing a 1,015 Mt/y open-pit mine using a small fleet of mining equipment for the first 20 years followed by 6 years of contract underground mining at 1,200 Mt/y capacity, the construction of a concentrator  at  the  mine  site  (crushing,  dense  media  separation,  grinding,  flotation circuits  and  magnetic  separation)  with  a  nominal  capacity  of  3,016 t/d  of  mineralized material at 92 %  availability in Whabouchi,  QC  and  construction  of  a  lithium compounds complex production plant in Salaberry-de-Valleyfield, QC.

Met-Chem has examined the technical and economic aspects of the Whabouchi mine project  and  the  Salaberry-de-Valleyfield  hydrometallurgical  plant  within  the  level  of precision  of  a  feasibility  study.  The  current  Report  is  a  full  fledge  Feasibility  Study (' FS ') in conformance with the standards required by NI 43-101 and Form 43-101F1.

A  computed  cash  flow  analysis  was  developed  based  on  the  technical  aspects  and product  price  projections  made  for  lithium  hydroxide  and  lithium  carbonate  derived from  a  recent  market  study.  As  it  stands,  the  Whabouchi  deposit  contains  a  Mineral Reserve.

Consequently,  Met-Chem  concludes  that  the  Whabouchi  Project,  as  a  whole,  is technically feasible as well as economically viable. The authors of this Technical Report consider  the  Whabouchi  Project  to  be  sufficiently  robust  to  warrant  moving  it  to  the construction stage.

## 3.0 RELIANCE ON OTHER EXPERTS

̶

Met-Chem prepared this Report using reports and documents as noted in Section 27.0 REFERENCES. The authors wish to make clear that they are qualified persons only in respect to the areas in this Report identified in their 'Certificates of Qualified Persons', submitted with this Report to the Canadian Securities Administrators.

The authors wish to state that an independent verification of land title and tenure was not performed, nor has Met-Chem verified the legality of any underlying agreement(s) that may exist concerning the licenses or other agreement (s) between third parties, but has relied on Nemaska to have conducted the proper legal due diligence.

A  draft  copy  of  the  report  has  been  reviewed  for  factual  errors  by  Nemaska.  Any changes  made  as  a  result  of  these  reviews  did  not  involve  any  alteration  to  the conclusions made. Hence, the statement and opinions expressed in this document are given in good faith and in the belief that such statements and opinions are neither false nor misleading at the date of this Report.

A market  study  was  prepared  by  SignumBOX,  independent  consultants.  Section 19.0 summarizes the  key  information  from  this  study  about  lithium  markets.  SignumBOX was  mandated  to  perform  a  market  study  to  evaluate  potential  target  markets  for  the battery  grade  lithium  hydroxide  and  lithium  carbonate.  Met-Chem  has  reviewed  the content of the market study report and believes that it provides a reasonable overview of the past and current lithium minerals market as well as projections according to various recognized sources.

Drill core samples collected and prepared by Nemaska were submitted by Nemaska to SGS  Canada  (' SGS ')  (Lakefield,  ON)  and  ALS  Canada  Inc.  -  Chemex  Laboratory (' ALS Chemex ')  in  North  Vancouver,  BC  and  Val  d'Or,  QC,  which  are  accredited laboratories. Although Met-Chem has reviewed the test work results generated by these laboratories and believes that they are generally accurate, Met-Chem is relying on SGS and ALS Chemex as independent experts.

The  process  used  for  the  production  of  Lithim  Hydroxide  relying  on  an  electrolysis system being highly specialized, Nemaska and Met-Chem have elected to subcontract this part to an expert in that field. Dr. Peter Symons,  Manager  R&amp;D,  from Electrosysthesis Company Inc. has been responsible for the testing and the layout of the design criteria around this process.

It  was also decided to rely on Noram Engineering &amp; Constructors Ltd. for the design and estimation of the electrolysis system has this equipment will have to be custom built for this application.

At the effective date of this Technical Report (May 13 th ,  2014), Nemaska has paid for the 16 Cantore claims. Nemaska paid a total amount of $ 1,010,000 in cash and issued 4,000,000 common shares for a deemed value of $ 958,000 for a total consideration of $ 1,968,000.  Nemaska  still  has  to  issue  an  additional  500,000  common  shares  upon delivery of an independent feasibility study confirming the feasibility of production of the property. No value was assigned specifically to the ten (10) claims acquired from Golden Goose, since they were part of the Lac Levac and Lac des Montagnes purchase agreement relating to the purchase of 594 claims.

## 4.3 Property in Salaberry-de-Valleyfield

Nemaska Lithium Inc. has also concluded an agreement to purchase a 150,000 m² land at  a  price  of  $ 3.80/m   from  the  city  of  Salaberry-de-Valleyfield,  QC.  A  deposit  of 2 $ 57,000  has  been  made  in  order  to  secure  this  acquisition.  Located  in  the  industrial park area, it is close to hyway, railway and port access. The property is also close to Hydro-Quebec power grid network and major chemical supplyers. Additional adjacent land is also available should it be needed at a later stage.

## 4.4 Royalty Obligations

According to Nemaska, the Property will be subject to two (2) separate agreements. The first concerns the ten (10) claims acquired from Golden Goose, where a 2 % NSR will be  retained  by  Golden  Goose;  of  which,  50 %  can  be  repurchased  by  Nemaska  for $ 1million. The second relates to the 20 other acquired claims; of which, 16 claims were acquired  from  Cantore  Group  plus  four  (4)  of  the  seven  (7)  claims  acquired  by  map designation.  Cantore  retains  a  3 %  NSR  on  these  20  claims,  of  which  33.3 %  can  be repurchased  by  Nemaska  for  $ 1  million.  The  Whabouchi  deposit  is  located  on  the Cantore claims.

## 4.5 Permits and Environmental Liabilities

For the Whabouchi mine Project, a first version of the Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (' ESIA ') document was submitted to both federal (Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency) and provincial (Review Committee Committee of the James Bay and Northern Quebec Agreement, or ' COMEX ') authorities for review in  April  2013.  Questions  and  comments  on  that  first  version  were  sent  by  those authorities to Nemaska Lithium late in 2013. Nemaska Lithium completed its responses to  all  questions  in  early  May  2014.  These  are  the  final  steps  before  the  Quebec's ministry  of  Sustainable  Development,  Environment,  and  The  Fight  against  Climate Change (' MDDELCC ')  can  grant  a  general  certificate  of  authorization  for  the  mine Project. As well, these are the final steps before the Canadian Minister of Environment can approve the mine project

To the knowledge of the author, there are no environmental liabilities pertaining to the Property.  Section 20.0  will  provide  further  information  on  environmental  impact  and impacts.

## 5.0 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE AND PHYSIOGRAPHY

## 5.1 Whabouchi Site

## 5.1.1 Accessibility

The Property is easily accessible via the Route du Nord road that crosses the Property near  its  center.  This  road  links  the  town  of  Chibougamau,  located  approximately 300 km to the SSE, and leads to the community of Nemaska and the Route de la BaieJames road. From the road turn off, the deposit is accessible via a forestry road that is well maintained during the summer months.

## 5.1.2 Physiography

The Property is characterized by a relatively flat topography with the exception of the local ridge where the more competent pegmatites occur, forming the surface expression of the deposit. The elevation above sea level ranges from 275 m, at the lowest point on the Property, to 325 m at the top of the pegmatite ridge, with an average elevation of 300 m. Lakes and rivers cover approximately 15 % of the Property area. The flora in the area  is  typical  of  the  taiga  environment  observed  in  the  region  with  a  mix  of  black spruce forest and peat moss-covered swamps. A portion of the Property was devastated by  forest  fires  several  years  ago.  There  is  no  permafrost  at  this  latitude  and  the overburden cover ranges in depth from 0 m near the ridge to 25 m in the south part of the Property.

## 5.1.3 Climate

The climate in the region is sub-arctic. This climate zone is characterized by long, cold winters  and  short,  cool  summers.  Daily  average  temperature  ranges  from  -20°C  in January to +17°C in July. Break-up usually occurs in early June, and freeze-up in early November. The annual precipitation averages 640 mm of rain from March to November and 350 cm of snow from September to May.

## 5.1.4 Local Resources and Infrastructures

The nearest infrastructure with general services is the Relais Routier Nemiscau Camp, located 12 km west of the Property. The community of Nemaska, where Nemaska has an office, is located 30 km west and has also accommodation and general services. The area is  serviced  by  the  Nemiscau airport, serviced by regular Air Creebec flights and charter  flights,  and  by  mobile  phone  network  from  the  principal  Canadian  service providers. There is no mining infrastructure on the Property.

Hydro-Québec owns several infrastructures and facilities in the area including the Poste Albanel and Poste de la Nemiscau electrical stations located approximately 20 km east and 12 km west from the Property, respectively. Electrical transmission lines connecting both  stations  run  alongside  the Route  du  Nord road  and  cross  the  Property  near  its center.

## 5.1.5 Surface Rights

All claims comprising the Property are located on Crown Lands. There is no reason to believe  that  Nemaska  will  not  be  able  to  secure  the  surface  rights  to  construct  the infrastructures  related  to  a  potential  mining  operation.  All  of  the  proposed  mining infrastructures  are  located  on  category  III  land  as  defined  in  the  James  Bay  and Northern Quebec Agreement (' JBNQA ').

## 5.2 Salaberry-de-Valleyfield Site

The Salaberry-de-Valleyfield site is located in the city industrial park. As a transformation  plant  will  be  built,  the  permitting  requirements  will  be  different  from those in Whabouchi.

## 5.2.1 Accessibility

The site is easily accessible via the newly commissioned Autoroute 30 and located some 30 minutes west of Montreal, QC which is a major hub for eastern Canada.

## 5.2.2 Physiography

The site is characterized by a relatively accidented topography with elevation varying from 47 m to 53 m above sea level with an average elevation of 51 m.

## 5.2.3 Climate

The  climate  in  Salaberry-de-Valleyfield  is  cold  and  temperate.  There  is  significant rainfall throughout the year in Salaberry-de-Valleyfield. Even the driest month still has a  lot  of  rainfall.  According  to  Köppen  and  Geiger  climate  is  classified  as  Dfb.  The average  annual  temperature  in  Salaberry-de-Valleyfield  is  6.4  °C.  About  920 mm  of precipitation falls annually. Daily average temperature ranges from -9.8°C in January to +21°C in July.

## 5.2.4 Local Resources and Infrastructures

The port of Salaberry-de-Valleyfield, located literally only minutes away from the plant site,  is  the  only  Canadian  port  to  have  direct  access  to  the  CSX  rail  network.  This network  has  34,000 km  of  rails  and  covers  southern  Ontario  and  the  eastern  United States to Florida.

For international oversea shipments, the port of Montreal, open year round, is only 50 minutes from the plant and is connected to the Montreal highway network.

The site is desserved by a high pressure natural gas line, city water and effluent system.

A Hydro-Quebec power line at 120 kV runs along the north site boundary following the main CN railway line leading to the port of Salaberry-de-Valleyfield.

## 6.0 HISTORY

## 6.1 Regional Government Surveys

Numerous  geological  surveys  and  geoscientific  studies  have  been  conducted  by  the Quebec Government in the Eeyou Istchee / James Bay area. Geological surveys in the 1960s  (Valiquette  1964,  1965  and  1975)  cover  the  entire  property  area.  In  1998,  the MRNF released  the  results  of  a  regional  lake  bottom  sediment  survey  completed  in 1997.

## 6.2 Mineral Exploration Work

The  first  exploration  work  reported  in  the  area,  dates  back  to  1962  by  Canico  and included the discovery of a lithium-bearing pegmatite by the geologists of the Québec Bureau of Mines .  That  same  year,  Canico  drilled  two  (2)  packsack  drill  holes  on  the pegmatite,  followed  by  three  (3)  diamond  drill  holes  on  the  same  pegmatite  ridge  in 1963. A total of 463.11 m were drilled. The best result obtained was 1.44 % Li O over 2 83.2 m (Elgring 1962).

No exploration  was  reported  for  the  next  ten  (10)  years.  In  1973,  James  Bay  Nickel Ventures (Canex Placer) performed a large-scale geological reconnaissance that covered the Property (Burns 1973). From 1974 to 1982, the exploration work was exclusively reported by the Société de Développement de la Baie James (' SDBJ '),  which mainly executed large scale geochemical surveys, followed by geological reconnaissance of the anomalies (Pride 1974, Gleeson 1975 and 1976). Two (2) exploration programs, one in 1978 and the other in 1980 were aimed at lithium exploration, with the evaluation of the Whabouchi spodumene-bearing pegmatite (Goyer et al. 1978, Bertrand 1978, Otis 1980, Fortin 1981, and Charbonneau 1982). No channel sampling or drill holes are reported. No work was conducted from 1982 to 1987.

In 1987, Westmin Resources completed an airborne Dighem III survey. A part of this survey was located immediately east of the Property (McConnell 1987). In 1987-1988, Muscocho Exploration also completed ground magnetic and VLF surveys that covered a major  part  of  the  Property.  The  spodumene-bearing  pegmatite  gave  a  weak  magnetic and VLF response. The Muscocho Exploration efforts were oriented toward the search for massive sulphides. A program of 14 holes, 11 of them located on the southern part of the Whabouchi Property, was completed. Several arsenic anomalies were obtained, with a maximum of 3,750 ppm, as in Hole ML-88-8 (Brunelle 1987, Gilliatt 1987 and Zuiderveen 1988).

In 2002, while exploring for tantalum, Inco re-sampled  the spodumene-bearing pegmatite,  taking  11  channel  samples  and  seven  (7)  grab  samples.  The  best  value obtained  by  Inco  was  0.026 %  Ta,  and  Li O  values  ranging  from  0.3 %  to  3.72 % 2 (Babineau 2002).

In 2008, Golden Goose Resources visited and sampled the Valiquette (Ni) and chromite showings south of the Whabouchi Property (Beaupre 2008).

<!-- image -->

Nemaska, as part of the Qualifying NI 43-101 Technical Report, initiated its exploration work on the Property during the fall of 2009. During the site visit, several outcrops of spodumene-bearing pegmatite were observed and nine (9) samples were collected and analysed for Li O. The highest and lowest results obtained during the site visit are the 2 grab sample # 946511, with a value of 6.3 % Li O, and grab sample # 946508 at 1.18 % 2 Li2 O (Théberge 2009). During the fall of 2009, a mechanical stripping and trenching program was conducted to expose and sample the main spodumene-bearing pegmatite along with a small drilling program designed to validate the historical results.

During  2010  and  2011,  exploration  work  completed  by  Nemaska  on  the  Property included  three  (3)  drilling  campaigns,  mechanical  stripping,  ground  and  airborne geophysics,  a  50-tonne  bulk  sample  and  metallurgical  testing.  An  initial  Mineral Resource  was  estimated  in  May  2010  by  SGS  and  was  followed  by  an  initial preliminary economic assessment of the Project completed in March 2011 by Equapolar in  collaboration  with  BBA.  The  initial  Mineral  Resource  estimate  of  the  Whabouchi Property,  effective  May  28 th , 2010,  totaled  9.78 Mt  grading  1.63 %  Li O  in  the 2 Measured  and  Indicated  Resources  categories,  with  an  additional  15.40 Mt  grading 1.57 % Li2O in the Inferred Resources category.

Following  further  drilling  in  2011,  SGS  provided  Nemaska  with  an  updated  Mineral Resource  (effective  June  6 th , 2011)  to  be  included  in  the  Preliminary  Economic Assessment  (prepared  by  Met-Chem  and  dated  October  2 nd , 2012).  This  updated Mineral Resources comprised 11.294 Mt of Measured resources with an average grade of 1.58 % Li2 O, 13.785 Mt of Indicated resources with an average grade of 1.50 % Li O 2 and 4.401 Mt of Inferred Resources with an average grade of 1.54 % Li O. The Mineral 2 Resources  were  reported  within  an  optimized  pit  shell  and  a  cut-off  grade  of  0.43 % Li2 O.

From  2012  to  2013,  Nemaska  conducted  further  drilling  in  order  to  measure  the geotechnical  properties  of  the  rocks,  condemn  certain  sector  of  the  Property  for construction and increase the level of confidence on the 2011 in-pit resources. Nemaska drilled 14 holes for a total of 1,815 m in 2013.

## 7.0 GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND MINERALIZATION

## 7.1 Regional Geology

The Whabouchi Property is located in the northeast part of the Superior Province of the Canadian Shield craton. The Superior Province extends from Manitoba to Quebec, and is mainly composed of Archean-age rocks. The general metamorphism is of greenschist facies,  except  in  the  vicinity  of  intrusive  bodies,  where  it  reaches  the  amphibolite-togranulite  facies.  In  Quebec,  the  eastern  extremity  of  the  Superior  Province  has  been classified  into  nine  (9)  sub-provinces,  from  south  to  north:  1)  Pontiac,  2)  Abitibi,  3) Opatica,  4)  Nemiscau,  5)  Opinaca,  6)  La  Grande,  7)  Ashuanipi,  8)  Bienville  and  9) Minto (Hocq 1994). According to Card and Ciesielski (1986), the area covered by the Property  is  located  in  the  Opinaca  or  Nemiscau  sub-  province.  Figure  7.1  shows  the position of the Property in the Superior Province.

## 7.2 Property Geology

The  Whabouchi  Property  is  located  in  the Lac  des  Montagnes volcano-sedimentary formation  and  sits  between  the  Champion  Lake  granotoïds  and  orthogneiss  and  the Opatica Northeast, which comprises orthogneiss and undifferentiated granitoïds. From the  northwest  to  the  southeast,  the  Property  is  underlain  by  the  Champion  Lake granitoïds, a grey oligoclase gneiss and then by the Lac des Montagnes formation. The Lac des Montagnes belt is approximately 7 km wide in the area, oriented northeast, and is  principally  composed  of  metasediments  (quartz-rich  paragneiss,  biotite-sillimanitestaurolite  schist  and  garnet-bearing  schist)  and  amphibolites  (mafic  and  ultramafic metavolcanics). These rocks are strongly deformed and cut by late granitoïds (leucogranites  and  biotite-bearing  white  pegmatites)  (Valiquette  1975).  Figure  7.2 shows the location  of  the  Property  relative  to  the Lac des Montagnes ,  the  Champion Lake  and  Opatica  NE  formations.  Table  7.1  summarizes  the  different  lithologies occurring in the area. Figure 7.3 shows the drill holes location on the property.

## 7.3 Mineralization

The regional prospecting done in the region over the years highlighted a potential for precious and base metal deposits. Cu, Zn, and Au lithogeochemical anomalies are found in the region, which is consistent with the volcano-sedimentary setting of this particular region.

The mineralization of economic interest at the Whabouchi site is found in spodumenebearing rare metal bearing pegmatite dyke complexes. Spodumene is a lithium-bearing mineral, which contains 8 % Li2 O when pure. Spodumene also contains minor amounts of  niobium  and  tantalum.  Assays  for  spodumene  normally  range  between  7.6 %  and 8.0 % Li2 O depending on the degree of replacement by Na2O. Typically, the Whabouchi pegmatite sampled from drill core averages 1.62 % Li O with values up to 4.24 % Li O. 2 2

Rare  metal  bearing  pegmatites  are  normally  found  in  moderately  metamorphosed terranes  near  vast  granitic  plutons:  a  possible  parental  source  for  the  pegmatitic magmas.  Pegmatites  are  associated  with  granitic  intrusions  and  are  generally  zoned around these intrusive centers. Pegmatites tend to be more enriched in volatile elements further  away  from  the  intrusive  centers.  Pegmatites  are  thought  to  be  derived  from primary crystallization of highly differentiated volatile enriched granitic magmas. The host rocks of the intrusion also play a significant role in the final composition of the pegmatites  due  to  the  incorporation  of  host  rock  in  the  magma  during  the  intrusive process.

Pegmatite complexes can vary from a few metres to a hundred metres in length with the same  variation  in  widths.  Typically,  pegmatite  intrusions  are  zoned  and  show  the following  structures  from  the  exterior  to  the  interior:  1)  the  rim  zone  is  usually  very narrow and fine-grained; 2) the wall zone is normally composed of quartz, feldspar and muscovite and marks the development of larger crystals typical of pegmatites; 3) the intermediate zone, when present, comprises a more complex mineralogy with varying amounts of economic minerals such as micas, beryl (Be), spodumene (Li), amblygonite (Li), lepidolite (Li-Rb), colombite-tantalite (Nb-Ta) and cassiterite (Sn). Crystals in this zone can extend up to metric lengths  and  4) the  central  zone  is  mainly  composed  of quartz in pods or automorph crystals.

Two  (2)  distinct  phases  are  observed  in  the  Whabouchi  pegmatites:  a  spodumenebearing  phase  comprising  most  of  the  pegmatite  material  and  a  lesser,  white  to  pink barren quartz-feldspar pegmatite. The lithium mineralization occurs mainly in medium to large spodumene crystals (up to 30 cm in size) but petalite also occurs, averaging less than 2 % in the deposit. Muscovite also contains minor lithium but is not recoverable by the treatment method discussed in the present Report.

## 8.0 DEPOSIT TYPES

This Section is an extract of the 2011 Technical Report.

## 8.1 Origin and Features of Rare Metal Pegmatites

The  interpretation  of  the  pegmatite  model  is,  in  a  major  way  that  of  the  author, Gary H. K.  Pearse,  based  on  geological  mapping,  evaluation  work,  and  development work on a number of major pegmatite deposits over many years.

The Whabouchi deposit is a lithium-bearing rare metal pegmatite. Emplacement of rare metal pegmatites is the last phase of the crystallization of a parent granite pluton. Highpressure residual fluids, with abundant water, silica, alumina, alkalis, and rich in rare elements  and  other  volatiles  from  the  crystallization  of  a  pluton  at  modest  depth, concentrate in the cupola or upper domed contact of the granite as it crystallizes. Under increasing pressure, this fluid dilates fractures in overlying rocks in a manner analogous to  that  of  hydraulics  in  mechanical  equipment,  thereby  providing  feeder  channels  for emplacement of pegmatites at shallower depth. Progressive crystallization of the main rock-forming minerals out of this fluid enriches the final fluids in rare metals and the process culminates in the formation of rare metal pegmatites still under fluid pressure. A variety of types occur depending on the abundance and type of rare metals associated with the pluton and the physico-chemical  conditions affecting the sequence  of emplacement events.

Pegmatite petrologists classify the variety of types and subtypes by combinations of the following criteria:

- · Mineralogical-geochemical signatures;
- · Internal structure/zonation;
- · Pressure-temperature conditions of crystallization.

The criteria are related through degree of fractionation, which arises from the chemical, temperature and pressure evolution of the pegmatite fluids over time and distance from the parent granite. The complex rare element pegmatites generally evolve as follows: at depth  under  high-pressure  and  temperature  conditions,  simple  granite  pegmatites  of quartz, feldspar and mica crystallize in fractures above and within the solidified granite pluton. Above this level, columbo-tantalite minerals appear starting with high niobium compositions  and  progress  to  higher  tantalum/niobium  ratios  where  the  complex pegmatites appear with lithium, cesium, and rubidium bearing minerals. Variations may appear,  in  which  petalite  is  the  dominant  lithium  mineral,  often  along  with  pollucite, lepidolite, etc. Alternatively, spodumene dominates in a classification known as albitespodumene pegmatite. Tantalum may occur in a variety of minerals and cassiterite may be  present.  A  final,  mariolitic  or  greisen  phase  at  low  pressure-temperature,  may  be present with lepidolite, quartz, tantalum-rich minerals, tin, topaz, etc. Where beryllium is relatively abundant, beryl (most commonly) or other beryllium minerals, these often occur throughout the sequence from the parent granite through all phases to the final mariolitic mineralization.

Three (3) characteristics of the geological setting for rare metal pegmatites are common:

- · Emplacement in concordant stacked sills;
- · Presence of a compressed, near-vertical, syntectonic mobile zone that is the locus of pegmatite intrusion;
- · Host rocks most commonly are dominantly mafic volcanics often with intercalated metasediments and gabbroic rocks.

## 8.2 Stacked Sill Structure

Although a field of rare metal pegmatites is commonly termed a dyke swarm, the major economic ones are most commonly emplaced in concordant, shallow to medium dipping sills with one or more steeply dipping feeder dykes. The mechanism for emplacement of the rare metal pegmatite sills is as follows: stratification in volcanic-metasedimentarygabbroic piles provides planes of weakness along contacts that facilitate entry of, and hydraulic dilation by late-stage pressurized rare metal bearing fluid. The layering also provides a barrier or cap to the escape of the volatile fluids from which the final rare metal  pegmatites  crystallize.  Zoning  in  the  pegmatite  results  from  a  continuation  of crystallization  of  the  rock  forming  minerals  from  the  cooler  contacts  inward  in  the dilated  space-albite  at  the  contact,  dominantly  K-feldspar  with  quartz-mica  next, spodumene quartz with some feldpars and mica, and finally,  a  core  of  quartz  (in  the albite-spodumene type). This simple zoning is often made more complex by two (2) or more pulses of intrusion, albitization and other replacement reactions.

## 8.3 Syntectonic Mobile Zone Feeder Dykes

The feeder dykes are near vertical and represent the conduit from depth connecting the pluton to the final rare metal pegmatite bodies. In most cases, shearing at the contacts of the dyke  and  mylonitization  and/or  plastic  deformation  of  the  feeder  pegmatite identifies  this  as  a  deeper,  syntectonic  mobile  zone.  In  extreme  cases,  the  feeder pegmatite may be stretched and result in the formation of boudinage structure (as occurs at the Moblan Lake 'Southwest Dyke' in northern Quebec). The feeder dykes tend to be intermediate in composition in the fractionation chain.

## 8.4 Mafic Host Rocks

Virtually all pegmatite researchers make only passing reference or none at all to the host rocks of rare metal pegmatites. Their interest has been limited to contact geochemistry and mineralogy and to some extent, the structural setting. The fact that most often the host rocks are volcanic-metasedimentary-gabbroic piles indicates that these rocks are an important part of the genesis of rare metal pegmatite fields. Gary H. K. Pearse submits indeed  that  the  presence  of  these  host  rocks  may  be  the  most  important  factor  after parent  granite  composition  in  the  genesis  of  rare  metal  pegmatites.  The  layering  and ductility, particularly of mafic volcanics and gabbros, causes the pile to flex and stretch without  fracturing, thereby  confining  the  high  pressure  volatiles to permit  final crystallization of the rare metal pegmatite. This mechanical behaviour is also conducive to  selective  emplacement  along  contact  zones  between  units  of  the  host  rock,  which

accounts for the preponderance of sill-controlled pegmatite deposits. Were the host to be brittle  and  isotropic,  the  rocks  would  tend  to  fracture,  the  confinement  required  to permit coarse crystallization would be absent or greatly reduced, the volatiles would be essentially lost and the final product may be a more uniform feldspar-mica-spodumene rock  with  more  subtle  zoning  or  little  zonation  at  all  (examples  are:  the  Thompson Brothers  deposit  at  Wekusko  Lake,  Manitoba  and  the  Quebec  Lithium  deposit  near Amos,  Quebec).  In  cases  where  the  active  feeder  dyke  propagates  through  brittle fractures quickly to the surface, the final phase would be an extrusive rhyolite.

## 8.5 The Whabouchi Pegmatite

The Whabouchi pegmatite is a highly fractionated, spodumene-rich pegmatite swarm, individual bodies of which display typical zoning to varying degrees - a comparatively thin  albite  wall  zone  at  the  contacts  followed  by  a  K-feldspar  rich  zone  with  lesser albite, quartz, mica, and little or no spodumene, followed by a spodumene-quartz-rich core zone (with variable feldspars and mica) making up more than 90 % of the crosssection. The Whabouchi deposit lacks a quartz core which is one of the classic zoned pegmatite features. Insufficient stratigraphic work has been done on the host rocks to establish that the bodies are dominantly sills as in the classic case. The concordance of the  bodies  with  the  greenstone  belt  and  the  persistence  of  even  thin  pegmatite  bodies over a 100 m or more on strike and at depth support this structural control. The drilled sections at 700E and 800E on the grid do appear to show this, in that the hanging wall of the main pegmatite zone is basalt and the footwall gabbro.

## 9.0 EXPLORATION

This Section is updated from the 2011 Technical Report.

Nemaska began working on the Property in October of 2009 with a first exploration program  that  lasted  25  days.  During  the  fall  2009  exploration  program,  mechanical stripping successfully exposed the spodumene-bearing pegmatites in 16 trenches spaced between 50 and 100 m apart and covering 1,000 m in strike length. From these trenches, 35 channels were cut and a total of 295 samples were collected for analysis. In addition to the trenching work, seven (7) diamond drill holes were completed including one (1) hole  abandoned  for  technical  reasons.  All  successful  drill  holes  have  intersected pegmatites zones.

A second exploration program was conducted from January to April, 2010. During that program,  59  drill  holes  totalling  11,600 m  were  completed.  In  addition  to  drilling, 14 line-km of ground magnetic surveying covering the main mineralized occurrence and 670  line-km  of  helicopter-borne  magnetic  surveying  covering  the  Property  were completed. Later in May 2010, Nemaska completed 2,780 m of mechanical stripping of the south contact of the main mineralized zone with (16 trenches and seven (7) contact zones) and collected 649 channel samples. The stripping also allowed the mapping of the  surface  geology.  A  1.2 km  access  road  from  the Route  du  Nord main  road  was constructed in 2010.

In late 2010, 23 drill holes were completed, with an additional 26 holes in early 2011 for a total of 9,500 m. In May 2011, a 50-tonne bulk sample was collected at surface for metallurgical testing purposes.

In  2013,  14  drill  holes  were  added  to  better  define  the  mineralization  towards  the Eastern boundary and also to increase the level of confidence of the 2011 in-pit Mineral Resources. A total of 1,815 m of drilling was completed and 351 samples were sent for Li2 O assay.

## 10.0 DRILLING

This Section is updated from the 2011 Technical Report.

A total of 129 drill holes were completed by Nemaska to define the mineral deposit. In addition  to  the  drilling, extensive  mechanical  stripping  on  surface  permitted  the completion  of  more  than  140  channels.  Table  10.1  and  Table  10.2  summarize  the drilling and  channel  sampling  completed  by  Nemaska  to  define  the  mineralized pegmatite intrusion.

All the drilling done by Nemaska used NQ and HQ coring size. HQ size was used to collect  material  for  metallurgical  testing.  The  samples  collected  for  analysis  represent approximately 36 % of the drill core material. The drill holes are generally spaced 25 m to  50 m  apart  with  azimuth  ranging  between  N312°  and  N340°  with  an  average  of N330°.  The  dips  range  from  43°  to  75°  and  average  50°.  The  deepest  hole  reaches 500 m below surface. The mineralized drill intersection ranges from near true thickness to 70 % true thickness.

The geometry of spodumene-bearing pegmatites is defined as a series of stacked dykeshaped intrusions which include a thicker principal intrusion. Some pegmatite contains local rafts or xenoliths of the host rock which can be a few metres thick and hundreds of metres in length. The mineralization is closed at its western end by chemical zoning and at its eastern edge by closure of the dyke system.

Based  on  the  information  gathered  from  the  drilling,  the  pegmatite  intrusion  is  more than  1,300  metres  in  length  and  can  be  up  to  90 metres  thick.  The  intrusions  are generally oriented N030° with dips to the south at an angle ranging between 80° and 85° and are reaching depths of up the 520 metres below surface.

The  author  completed  verification  programs  of  the  Project's  analytical  data  and considers  that  there  is  no  known  drilling,  sampling  or  recovery  factors  that  could materially  impact  the  accuracy  and  reliability  of  the  results.  The  data  from  the  few historical  drill  holes  reported  on  the  Project  could  not  be  validated  and  were  not considered as part of the current Mineral Resource estimate.

## 11.0 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSIS AND SECURITY

This Section is updated from the 2011 Technical Report.

This  Section  is  based  on  information  supplied  by  Nemaska  and  observations  made during the independent verification programs conducted at the Project site by SGS on November 27 th , 2013.

## 11.1 Sample Procedure and Sample Security

The  Whabouchi  Project  is  located  less  than  12 km  east  of  the  Nemiscau  Camp.  The evaluation  of  the  geological  setting  and  mineralization  on  the  Property  is  based  on observations and sampling from surface (through geological mapping, grab and channel samples) and diamond drilling. The channel and drill core logging and sampling was conducted  at  the  Property  or  at  the  nearby  Project  facilities  (Nemiscau  Camp).  All samples  collected  by  Nemaska  during  the  course  of  the  2009,  2010,  2011  and  2013 exploration  programs  were  sent  to  the Table  Jamésienne  de  Concertation  Minière (' TJCM ') preparation laboratory located in Chibougamau, Quebec. The 2009 and 2010 sample pulps were shipped to SGS laboratory in Don Mills, Ontario, for analysis. The 2011  and  2013  sample  pulps  were  sent  to  ALS  Canada  Inc.  -  Chemex  Laboratory (' ALS  Chemex ')  in  North  Vancouver,  BC  and  Val  d'Or,  QC,  for  analysis.  The remaining drill core is stored at the Property site in covered metal core racks.

All channel samples and drill core handling was done on site with logging and sampling processes  conducted  by  employees  and  contractors  of  Nemaska.  The  observations  on lithology,  structure,  mineralization,  sample  number,  and  location  were  noted  by  the geologists and technicians on hardcopy and then recorded in a Microsoft Access digital database. Copies of the database are stored on external hard drive for security.

Channel samples were collected from two (2) diamond saw cuts (typically four (4) cm in width and four (4) cm in depth). Each sample is generally one (1) m long and broken directly  from  the  outcrop,  identified  and  numbered  then  placed  in  a  new  plastic  bag. Drill  core  of  NQ  and  HQ  size  was  placed  in  wooden  core  boxes  and  delivered  twice daily by the drill contractor to the Project core logging facilities at the Nemiscau Camp. The drill  core  was  first  aligned  and  measured  by  a  technician  for  core  recovery.  The core  recovery  measurements  were  followed  by  the  RQD  measurements.  After  a summary review of the core, it was logged and sampling intervals were defined by a geologist. Before sampling, the core was photographed using a digital camera and the core boxes were identified with Box Number, Hole ID, and by using 'From' and 'To' aluminum tags. Due to the hardness of the pegmatite units, the recovery of the channel material and the drill core was generally very good, averaging more than 95 %.

Sampling  intervals  were  determined  by  the  geologist,  marked  and  tagged  based  on observations  of  the  lithology  and  mineralization.  The  typical  sampling  length  is  one (1) m but can vary according to lithological contacts between the mineralized pegmatite and the host rock. In general, one (1) host rock sample was collected from each side that contacts the pegmatite. The NQ drill core samples were split into two (2) halves with one (1) half placed in a new plastic bag along with the sample tag; the other half was replaced in the core box with the second sample tag for reference. The third sample tag

<!-- image -->

was archived on site. The HQ size drill core was collected for a portion of the 2011 program for metallurgical purposes. The first half of the HQ drill core was selected for metallurgical  testing.  The  second  half  was  split  in  two  (2)  quarters,  one  (1)  quarter placed in a new plastic bag along with the sample tag and the remaining quarter was replaced in the core box with the second sample tag for reference. The samples were then  catalogued  and  placed  in  rice  bags  or  pails,  for  shipping.  The  sample  shipment forms were prepared on site with one (1) copy inserted with the shipment, one (1) copy sent  by  email  to  TJCM,  and  one  (1)  copy  kept  for  reference.  The  samples  were transported on a regular basis by Nemaska's employees or contractors by pick-up truck directly  to  the  TJCM  facilities  in  Chibougamau.  At  the  TJCM  laboratory,  the  sample shipment  was  verified  and  a  confirmation  of  shipment  reception  and  content  was emailed to Nemaska's project manager.

SGS validated the exploration processes and core sampling procedures (2011) used by Nemaska as part of an independent verification program. The author concluded that the drill core  handling,  logging  and  sampling  protocols  are  at  conventional  industry standard and conform to generally accept best practices. The author considers that the samples quality is good and that the samples are generally representative. Finally, the author is confident that the system is appropriate for the collection of data suitable for the estimation of a NI 43-101 compliant Mineral Resource estimate.

## 11.2 Sample Preparation and Analysis

Channel  and  drill  core  samples  collected  during  the  2009,  2010,  2011  and  2013 exploration  programs  were  transported  directly  by  Nemaska  representatives  to  the TJCM  laboratory  facilities  in  Chibougamau,  Quebec  for  sample  preparation.  The submitted samples were pulverized at the TJCM laboratory to respect the specifications of the analytical protocol and then shipped to SGS or ALS Chemex for analysis. The author of the 2011 Technical Report visited the TJCM facilities on March 10 th , 2010.

All samples received at TJCM were inventoried and weighted prior to being processed. Drying was done to samples having excess humidity. Sample material was crushed to 80-85 % passing two (2) mm using jaw crushers. Ground material was split using a split riffle to obtain a 275-300 g sub-sample. Sub-samples were then pulverized using a twocomponent ring mill (ring and puck mill) or a single component ring mill (flying disk mill) to 85-90 % passing 200 mesh (75 µm). The balance of the crushed sample (reject) was placed  into  the  original  plastic  bag.  The  pulverized  samples  were  finally  sent  to SGS or ALS Chemex using Canada Post secured delivery services.

The  majority  of  the  2009  and  2010  analyses  were  conducted  at  the  SGS  laboratory located in Don Mills, Ontario, which is an ISO/IEC 17025 laboratory accredited by the Standards  Council  of  Canada.  There  are  two  (2)  analytical  methods  used  for  the pulverized  samples  from  the  Whabouchi  Project.  The  first  analytical  method  used  by SGS  is  the  55-element  analysis  using  sodium  peroxide  fusion  followed  by  both Inductively Coupled  Plasma  Optical Emission  Spectrometry (' ICP-  OES ') and Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass  Spectrometry (' ICP-MS ') finish (SGS  code ICM90A).  This  method  uses  ten  (10) g  of  the  pulp  material  and  returns  different detection limits for each element and includes 10 ppm lower limit detection for Li. The

<!-- image -->

ICM90A  analytical method  was  conducted  at the beginning of the 2009-2010 exploration program to verify the content of other elements in the mineralization. The second  method  processed  20 g  of  pulp  material  and  used  the  mineralization  grade sodium peroxide fusion with ICP-OES finish methodology with a lower detection limit of  0.01 %  Li  (SGS  code  ICP90Q).  The  ICP90Q  analytical  method  was  used  at  the beginning of the exploration program on samples analysed by ICM90A returning values greater than 0.3 % Li. The ICP90Q method for Li was later used on a more systematic basis. Analytical results were sent electronically to Nemaska and results were compiled in an MS Excel spreadsheet by the project manager.

The  2010  pulp  reanalysis  and  the  2011  and  2013  analyses  were  conducted  at  ALS Chemex  using  the  mineralization  grade  lithium  four-acid  digestion  with  Inductively Coupled Plasma - Atomic Emission Spectrometry (' ICP-AES ') (ALS code Li-OG63). The Li-OG63 analytical method used four (4) g of pulp material and returned a lower detection limit of 0.01 % Li.

## 11.3 Quality Assurance and Quality Control Procedure

Above the laboratory quality assurance quality control (' QA/QC ') routinely implemented  by  SGS  and  ALS  Chemex  using  pulp  duplicate  analysis,  Nemaska developed  an  internal QA/QC  protocol  consisting  in  the  insertion of analytical standards, blanks and core duplicates on a systematic basis with the samples shipped to the analytical laboratories. In 2010, Nemaska also sent pulps from selected mineralized intersection  to  ALS  Chemex  for  reanalysis.  No  pulp  reanalysis  was  performed  by Nemaska in 2011 and 2013. The author did not visit the SGS or ALS Chemex facilities or conduct an audit of the laboratories.

## 11.4 Analytical Standards

Two (2) different standards were used by Nemaska for the internal QA/QC program: one  (1)  low  grade  lithium  (' Li-LG ')  and  one  (1)  high  grade  lithium  (' Li-HG ') standards. Both standards were custom made reference materials coming from historical drill core from the Whabouchi deposit itself. The preparation for the standards material has been conducted by TJCM using the same sample preparation protocol used for the regular Whabouchi samples. Each standard inserted weight between 90 and 120 g. In order to evaluate their expected values, Li-HG and Li-LG standards have been analysed six (6) times, each at the SGS laboratory, and five (5) times each at the ALS Chemex laboratory.  Both  facilities  are  accredited  ISO/IEC  17025  laboratories.  The  analytical protocol used at SGS is the mineralization grade sodium peroxide fusion with ICP-OES finish  (SGS  code  ICP90Q).  The  analytical  protocol  used  at  ALS  Chemex  is  the mineralization  grade  lithium  four-acid  digestion  with  ICP-AES  finish  (ALS  code  LiOG63).

For the Li-LG standard, the analytical results returned from SGS for the six (6) samples averaged 0.46 % Li versus an average of 0.45 % Li for the five (5) samples submitted to ALS  Chemex.  For  the  Li-HG  standard,  the  average  of  the  six  (6)  samples  returned 0.72 % Li versus an average of 0.71 % Li for the five (5) samples processed at ALS Chemex. Each laboratory showed relatively consistent analytical  results from  one  (1)

<!-- image -->

sample  to  another  for  each  standard  analysed.  The  averages  for  each  standard  also showed a good correlation between SGS and ALS Chemex. The amount of data is not statistically significant to calculate standard deviation (' Std. Dev. ') parameters which can be used to determine the success/failure of standards. Table 11.1 shows the results for each standard using both analytical protocols.

The insertion of the analytical standards Li-LG and Li-HG did not begin until drill hole WHA 10-15. After that, one (1) standard was inserted in the sample series at a rate of one (1) every 25 regular samples, alternating between the Li-LG and Li-HG standards. A total of 185 Li-HG and 169 Li-LG standards were analysed during the 2010, 2011 and 2013 exploration campaigns, representing 3.8 % of the samples analysed. In order to determine the QC warning (±2x Std. Dev.) and QC failure (±3x Std. Dev.) intervals for the Li-LG and Li-HG standards, the Std. Dev. parameters returned from the 185 LiHG and 169 Li-LG analytical results were considered.

From  the  185  Li-HG  standards  analysed,  15  standards  fall  outside  the  QC  warning interval and five (5) standards fall outside the QC failure interval. After reviewing the five (5) failures, they were considered acceptable as the value falls within 12-15 % of the  expected  value  for  Li-HG.  From  the  169  Li-LG  standards  analysed,  six  (6)  falls outside the QC warning interval and one (1) is considered a failure as it falls outside the QC failure interval.  After  reviewing  the  only  failure,  it  is  considered  acceptable  as  it returned 13 % of the expected value for Li-LG. Figure 11.1 shows plots of the variation of both standards with time. Table 11.2 reports the statistics of the Li-LG and Li-HG standards.

## 11.5 Analytical Blanks

Nemaska implemented the insertion of analytical blanks in the sample series as part of their  internal  QA/QC  protocol.  The  blank  samples,  which  were  made  of  coarse  silica lumps, were inserted at every 20 samples in the sample series, at the beginning of the sample preparation procedure by TJCM before shipping to ALS Chemex. The analytical blanks used in 2010 were made of pre-pulverized silica instead of coarse lumps. The 2010 procedure was not considered adequate since the analytical blanks were inserted by TJCM after the sample preparation procedure. The QA/QC procedure was updated by Nemaska from 2011 and is now considered adequate.

A total of 495 analytical blanks were analysed during the 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2013 exploration programs. From the 495 blanks analysed, 100 % of them returned less than 0.05 % Li, which is five (5) times the methods detection limit. Figure 11.2 shows a plot of the variation of the analytical blanks with time.

## 11.6 Core Duplicates

Sample  duplicates  were  inserted  at  every  20  samples  in  the  sample  series  as  part  of Nemaska's internal QA/QC protocol. The sample duplicates correspond to a quarter NQ or  HQ  core  from  the  sample  left  behind  for  reference,  or  a  representative  channel sample from the secondary channel cut parallel to the main channel. Figure 11.3 shows correlation plots for the core duplicates.

From 2010, a total of 478 duplicates results analysed by SGS and ALS Chemex were available. From the 478 core duplicates analysed only 17 or 3.6 % of the samples fall outside the ±20 % range. The sign test for the duplicates does not show any bias (35 % original &lt; duplicate, 40 % original &gt; duplicate, and 25 % original = duplicate).

## 11.7 Nemaska Pulp Re-Analysis

As part of Nemaska's 2010 and 2011 QA/QC protocol, pulps from 610 mineralized core samples were sent for re-analysis to ALS Chemex. Figure 11.4 shows a correlation plot of the re-analysed pulps for original pulp values vs. duplicate pulp values. The pulp reanalysis  returned  higher  Li  values  for  duplicates  for  183  samples  (or  30 %  of  the samples reanalysed) compared to 166 samples (or 27 %) returning lower Li values. All other pulp duplicates (261 or 43 %) returned value equal for the original and duplicate samples.

## 11.8 Specific Gravity

As part of the 2010 and 2011 independent data verification programs, SGS conducted specific  gravity  (' SG ')  measurements  on  the  74  mineralized  core  samples  collected from drill holes WHA-09-07,  WHA-10-25,  WHA-10-79,  and  WHA-11-96.  The measurements  were  performed  by  the  water  displacement  method  using  a  graduated cylinder (SG = weight in air in kg/volume of water displaced in litre) on representative half NQ core and quarter HQ core pieces weighting between 0.42 kg and 2.28 kg with an  average  of  0.53  kg.  The  resulting  measurements  reported  an  average  SG  value  of 2.70 t/m  (Table 11.3). 3

In 2011, Nemaska also conducted SG measurements of mineralized core samples. The measurements  were  conducted  at  TJCM  laboratory  in  Chibougamau,  by  the  water displacement method (using weight in air and weight in water). The SG measurements were  done  on  samples  from  24  different  drill  holes  from  2009,  2010  and  2011.  The resulting measurements reported an average SG value of 2.72 t/m  (Table 11.4). Based 3 on the available SG measurement datasets, an SG value of 2.70 t/m  was selected as the 3 average SG for the mineralization for the Whabouchi deposit.

## 11.9 Conclusion

Nemaska  implemented  an  internal  QA/QC  protocol  by  regularly  inserting  reference materials  (standards  and  blank)  and  core  duplicates  in  the  samples  stream.  Nemaska also  conducted  in  the  2010  and  2011  re-analysis  of  selected  pulps  in  a  second laboratory, as part of their QA/QC protocol.

SGS completed a review of the sample preparation and analysis including the QA/QC analytical  protocol  implemented  by  Nemaska  for  the  Project.  The  author  visited  the Whabouchi Property on November 27 th ,  2013 to review Nemaska' sample preparation procedures,  local  infrastructure  and  in  order  to  conduct  an  independent  sampling program.

A review of the QA/QC analytical results for the standards, blanks and core duplicates did not highlight any analytical issues. SG measurements were completed in 2010 and 2011  on  mineralized  core  samples  to  estimate  an  average  bulk  density  value  for  the Whabouchi deposit and were considered acceptable for the present Report.

The author is of the opinion that the sample preparation, analysis and QA/QC protocol used  by  Nemaska  for  the  Whabouchi  Project  follow  generally  accepted  industry standards and that the Project data is of a sufficient quality.

## 12.0 DATA VERIFICATION

As part of the 2013 data verification programs, SGS completed independent analytical checks  of  drill  core  duplicate  samples  taken  from  Nemaska  2011  and  2013  diamond drilling programs.  SGS  also  conducted  verification  of  the  laboratories  analytical certificates and validation of the Project digital database supplied by Nemaska for errors or discrepancies.

## 12.1 Independent Control Sampling

During a site visit conducted on November 27 th ,  2013,  a  total  of  39  mineralized  core duplicates were collected from holes WHA-11-105, WHA-11-90, WHA-13-144, WHA13-132, WHA-13-143 and WHA-11-96 by the author and submitted for Li analysis at the SGS laboratory in Lakefield, Ontario. The core duplicates were processed using the same analytical protocol used by Nemaska during the 2009 and 2010 drilling programs (code ICP90Q) except that the sample preparation has been done directly at the SGS and not at the TJCM laboratory.

The  comparative  results  for  the  individual  control  samples  are  displayed  in  the correlation  graph  in  Figure  12.1.  Table  12.1  shows  the  comparative  statistics  for  the control samples. Table 12.2 reports the control sampling weighted average results for continuous mineralized intervals sampled for each drill hole.

The  average  relative  grade  differences  between  the  original  and  the  control  samples range between 1 % and 12 %, which can be considered acceptable for core duplicates, considering  the  coarse  nature  of  the  spodumene  mineralization  generally  observed  at Whabouchi. The weighted average grades between the original and the control samples outline similar results.

## 12.2 Database Validation

The  digital  drill  holes  database  supplied  by  Nemaska  has  been  validated  for  the following  data  field:  collar  location,  azimuth,  dip,  hole  length,  survey  data,  lithology and  analytical  values.  The  validation  returned  only  minor  discrepancies  located  in lithology and assay data, which were communicated to Nemaska and corrected in the final drill holes database.

As part of the data verification of the Project, the analytical data from the database has been  validated  with  the  values  from  the  laboratories  analytical  certificates.  No  errors were noted during the validation.

<!-- image -->

The  final  database  includes  the  channel  samples  collected  in  2009  and  2010  from surface  trenches  and  the  drilling  data  from  the  2009,  2010,  2011  and  2013  drilling programs. The final drill hole with reported analytical results included in the database is WHA-13-144.  The  few  historical  drill  holes  and  channel  analytical  data  were  not considered  for  the  current  Mineral  Resource  estimate,  but  were  kept  for  modeling purposes. Table 12.3 lists the data contained in the final drill holes database. The author is  in  the  opinion  that  the  final  drill  holes  database  is  adequate  to  support  a  Mineral Resource estimate.

## 13.0 MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING

Mineral processing and metallurgical testing were performed to evaluate the potential of spodumene  concentrate  production  and  lithium  hydroxide  (Li O-H O)  and  lithium 2 2 carbonate (Li CO3) production separately. The spodumene concentrate production test 2 work is presented in Section 13.1. The hydrometallurgical production of Li O-H O and 2 2 Li2 CO3 test work is presented in Section 13.2.

## 13.1 Spodumene Concentrate

Preliminary metallurgical investigation of the Whabouchi deposit was first carried out in 2010 and 2011 by SGS at Lakefield, Ontario. Some of the bench scale and pilot plant test work results were reported in the July 12 th , 2011 NI43-101 Technical Report of the Updated  Mineral  Resources  Estimate  -  Whabouchi  Lithium  Deposit,  and  in  the November 16 th , 2012 NI 43-101 Technical Report Preliminary Economic Assessment of the Whabouchi Lithium Deposit and Hydromet Plant as revised on February 27 th , 2013. This report Section provides a summary on SGS dense media separation (' DMS ') and flotation  pilot  plant  conducted  in  2011  as  part  of  a  second  phase  of  the  Whabouchi metallurgical  testing  Project.  An  update  on  DMS  pilot  plant  tests  carried  out  at  MetSolve  laboratories  in  2013.  This  Section  also  includes  summaries  from  SGS  settling, filtration and freezing tests performed in 2012 and 2014.

## 13.1.1 SGS Test Work Program - Dense Media Separation and Flotation

## a) Pilot Plant Composites

Four (4) composites were prepared as pilot plant feed. Two (2) composites were prepared for the flotation pilot plant and were labelled as ''Outcrop Sample for flotation''  and  ''  Mine  Representative  Sample  for  Flotation''.  Two  (2)  more composites  were  prepared  for  DMS  pilot  plant  test  work  and  were  labelled  as ''DMS Outcrop Composite'' and ''DMS-Mine Representative Composite''. The mine  representative  sample  was  composed  of  outcrop  material  and  drill  core rejects.  A  detailed  description  of  these  composite  are  given  in  the  SGS  report titled:  'A  pilot  plant  investigation  into  THE  RECOVERY  OF  SPODUMENE FROM  THE  WHABOUCHI  PROPERTY,  Project  12486-003  -  Final  Report, April 2 nd , 2012'. The chemical analyses of these composites are presented inTable 13.1.

## b) SGS Dense Media Separation Pilot Plant Test Work

Dense media separation pilot plant test work was carried out on two (2) samples, the  blasted  sample  and  the  mine  representative  sample,  from  the  Whabouchi deposit by SGS at Lakefield in 2011. The flow sheet used during the pilot plant, consisting  of  several  unit  operations,  includes  crushing,  scrubbing,  screening, several dense media separation stages, magnetic separation and dewatering. The DMS test plant was equipped with a 150-mm dense media cyclone. Up to eight (8)  DMS stages were used for the blasted sample, whereas only four (4) stages were used in test  work  on  the  mine  representative  sample.  Magnetic  separation was  conducted  by  using  a  high  intensity  rare  earth  roll  magnetic  separator  to upgrade DMS sinks on previously dried feed.

The  results  of  the  DMS  pilot  plant  were  reported  in  an  addendum  by  SGS (12486-004) entitled 'An Investigation into DMS Plant Testing on Material from the Whabouchi Lithium Deposit' issued November 11 th , 2011 and incorporated in the  November  16 th , 2012  NI 43-101  Technical  Report  Preliminary  Economic Assessment.

The main findings from these results were that for mine representative sample, the 4-stage DMS flow sheet rejects 40 % of the feed mass as tailings at a top size of 9.5 mm, at a loss of 10 % Li. At a top size of 9.5 mm, approximately 11 % of the feed mass is recovered as spodumene concentrate grading 6.4 % Li O and 45 % Li 2 distribution.  The  combined  middlings,  49 %  of  the  feed  mass,  represent  the remaining 45 % Li distribution.

## c) SGS Flotation Pilot Plant Test Work

In January 2011, Nemaska Lithium contracted SGS to carry out a pilot plant and bench scale testing program as part of a second phase of the Whabouchi lithium Project. The objectives of the second phase were:

- · To  produce  two  (2)  tonnes  of  spodumene  concentrate  with  a  grade  of  six percent (6 %) or higher for hydrometallurgical test work;

<!-- image -->

- · To confirm and optimize previous bench test work;
- · To generate engineering data for plant design.

Findings from the pilot plant program were reported by SGS in the report 'Project 12486-003', April 2 nd , 2012, and are summarized in the following Sections.

Pilot  plant  flotation  tests  were  performed  on  four  (4)  composites,  the  flotation outcrop  (blasted  composite),  flotation  mine  representative  composite,  combined DMS middlings and undersize fractions from outcrop and finally combined DMS middlings  and  undersize  fractions  from  mine  representative  composite.  Mine representative composite was composited of outcrop material and drill core assay reject  samples.  The  detailed  description  of  these  composite  are  given  in  the previously mentioned SGS report.

Material from the four (4) composites were processed through the flotation pilot plant in a sequential manner, 21 pilot plant tests were performed.

Various flow sheet configurations were tested in the pilot plant campaigns. The objectives were to find the best and optimal operating conditions for spodumene separation and recovery.

In  total  more  than  40  tonnes  of  material  was  processed  through  this  pilot  plant. The final flow sheet of the last run of the pilot plant PP21 is shown in Figure 13.1. Pilot plant test PP21, yielded the most efficient processing results.

The final flow sheet consists of the following circuits:

- · Grinding and screening;
- · Primary de-sliming and mica flotation;
- · Dewatering, scrubbing and secondary desliming;
- · Spodumene flotation;
- · Magnetic separation circuit.

The crushed composite feed was ground using a rod mill and screened at 300 µm. The  screen  oversize  (+300  µm),  was  sent  back  to  rod  mill,  while  the  screen undersize (-300 µm) was subjected to primary de-sliming in a cyclone where the overflow  exited  as  slimes.  The  primary  de-sliming  cyclone  underflow  was conditioned  with  AERO  3030C  or  Armac  collector  prior  to  subjecting  to  mica rougher flotation stage followed by scavenger stage. The rougher and scavenger concentrates  were  combined  and  transferred  to  a  cleaner  stage.  Mica  cleaner concentrate was collected in 200 L plastic drums, while mica cleaner tailings were dewatered  in  2-stage  cycloning  and  then  underwent  a  scrubbing  stage  where dispersant D618 and NaOH were added. The scrubbed slurry was then subjected to a secondary de-sliming stage before pH  adjustment and high density conditioning with spodumene collector (LR19). The spodumene rougher flotation concentrate was subjected to 2-stage cleaning while spodumene rougher tailings were sent to final tailings.

The first and second cleaner tailings were recycled back and combined with mica flotation  tailings.  The  final  spodumene  concentrate  was  conditioned  with  acid before  magnetic  separation  to  remove  iron  impurities.  Pilot  Plant  test  PP21 yielded the most significant results. These metallurgical results for test PP21 are summarized and presented in Table 13.3.

The  conclusions  from  these  pilot  plant  results  were  that  using  flotation  a spodumene final concentrate grade of 6.0 % Li2 O or higher with more than 77 % lithium recovery representing 22.1 % weight could be obtained consistently.

These results show also that the lithium losses depend on the nature of the feed composite.  For  the  DMS-Mine  representative  middling  composite  (PP21),  the majority of lithium losses occurs in the spodumene tailings (13.7 %), followed by slime  removal  (5.0 %),  mica  concentrate  (3.6 %)  and  spodumene  magnetics (0.05 %) for a total of 22.4 %. According to the results, the majority of the losses in  the  rougher  tailings  occur  in  the  100  mesh  fraction.  Coarse  grain  spodumene can be difficult to float thus the grinding size should be controlled to keep the K 80 of the flotation feed to about 200  m.

These results highlight the importance of mica flotation circuit ahead of spodumene flotation; by eliminating the mica flotation step, significant increase in muscovite  grade  was  observed.  The  lithium  oxide  concentration  in  spodumene concentrate increased from 5.6 % in PP19 as compared to 6.5 % in PP21, which confirmed that  removing  mica  ahead  of  spodumene  flotation  helped  to  increase final spodume concentrate grade.

About  three  (3)  tonnes  of  concentrate  grading  6.0 %  Li O  was  generated  by 2 combining concentrates from pilot plant campaigns PP12 to PP21.

Low magnetic intensity separation (about 800 Gauss) was used to separate iron contaminant particles from the flotation concentrate. The iron grade of the lithium concentrate was about 2.11 % Fe2 O3.

## d) Met-Solve Laboratories Test Program, 2013

In 2013, Nemaska Lithium contracted Met-Solve Laboratories to carry out DMS pilot plant test work.

Dense  media  separation  testing  was  investigated  as  the  costs  of  this  form  of processing will be considerately lower as compared to flotation.

Dense media separation pilot plant testing was carried out using a single 250 mm separator  to  simulate  multi-stage  separations.  The  primary  objective  of  this  test program was to determine the overall grade and recovery of lithium using a dense media separation system.

The multi-stage separator has been shown to offer better performance compared to single  stage,  two  (2)  products  and  other  conventional  dense  medium  cyclone separators.

The  following  Section  is  a  summary  of  the  report  issued  by  Met  Solve  titled: 'Nemaska Lithium Inc., Dense Media Separation, MS 1467 issued August 13 th , 2013'.

Four (4) drums of pre-crushed sample (-9.5 mm +0.5 mm) weighing approximately 900 kg were sent from SGS at Lakefield to Met-Solve laboratories in  Langley,  BC.  Only  half  of  the  sample  (approximately  450  kg)  was  used  for these DMS tests.

A total of seven (7) dense media separation tests (FT201 to FT207) were carried out on these pre-crushed samples. Approximately 65 kg of representative sample was used for each test.

The initial five (5) DMS tests (FT201 to FT205) were aimed to simulate a 4-stage DMS concentrator with a re-circulated test on the crushed middlings, Figure 13.2. Each run consisted of passing the floats through the single media separator twice to simulate a 2-stage concentrator. The total sinks (combined Sinks 1, Sinks 3 and Sinks 4) can be considered final concentrate, while Floats 2 is final tailings. Floats 4  and  the  -0.5 mm  rejects  could  be  send  to  the  flotation  circuit  to  improve  the lithium recovery.

Table  13.4  lists  the  results  of  the  five  (5)  tests.  In  each  test  propensity  of  the spodumene ore to dense media separation was confirmed.

Two  (2)  additional  tests,  FT206  without  and  FT207  with  crushing  middlings, were carried out to simulate a dynamic 3-stage DMS circuit, in order to assess the effectiveness  of  adding  more  separation  stages.  Test  FT206  yielded  a  higher recovery  of  66.8 %,  but  with  a  lower  concentrate  grade  of  5.17 %  Li O.  The 2 tailings  grade  was  0.74 %  Li O,  which  is  comparable  to  the  initial  tests.  The 2 results of test FT206 are listed in Table 13.5, below.

The flow sheet of test F207 with the crushing step is shown below in Figure 13.3. Test  FT207  yielded  the  best  results,  based  on  recovery  and  final  concentrate grade. This indicates that lower density settings with less coarse feed may yield even improved results.

The results of test FT207 indicate that using the 3-stage DMS the Floats 1 lithium content can be reduced with a lower dense media pulp specific gravity. The sinks grade  can  be  improved  by  using  some  sinks  as  middlings.  In  conclusion,  test

<!-- image -->

FT207  had  the  lowest  loss  of  lithium;  the  latter  is  of  prime  importance  as  the lower  grade  sinks  can  be  reprocessed  as  middlings  in  the  flotation  circuit.  The results from FT207 are listed in Table 13.6 below.

- e) SGS Test Work Program - Settling, Filtration and Freezing Tests

Nemaska Lithium contracted SGS to carry out settling, filtration and freezing test work, which can be used for the sizing of concentrate and tailings thickeners and filters.  These  tests  were  performed  by  a  different  group  within  SGS  and  were reported separately.

## f) Settling Test Work

SGS started with static testing to determine the optimal feed densities and type of flocculant. Thereafter SGS performed dynamic thickening testing. The results for thickening tests are listed in Table 13.7, below. The most important tests involved spodumene concentrate and final tailings. The thickening hydraulic test data was used by suppliers for  thickener  sizing.  The  dynamic  thickening  obtained  results with  a  spodumene  concentrate  thickener  underflow  between  61  and  63  weight percent  solids.  This  was  as  expected.  The  final  tailings  underflow  density  was 61 %, gain as expected. Both test samples had low turbidity overflows with total suspended solids (' TSS ') of 10 ppm.

## g) Filtration Test Work

SGS performed filtration  test  work  on  both  the  spodumene  concentrate  and  the final tailings.

The  vacuum  filtration  test  had  good  results  for  the  spodumene  concentrate producing a cake of 8.3 % moisture by weight for at minus 0.4 bar vacuum, while the lower vacuum of minus 0.7 yielded a higher cake moisture content of 12.2 %. The  final  tailings  did  not  have  similar  results  and  ended  up  with  wet  cakes  of 13.9 %  and  12.8 %  for  at  minus  0.4  bar  and  minus  0.7  bar  vacuum  levels respectively.

The pressure filtration test produced good results for the spodumene concentrate with a cake of 7.7 % moisture by weight at a pressure of 4.1 bar, while the higher pressure 6.9 bar yielded a higher cake moisture content of 9.1 %. The final tailings had similar results and ended up with dry cakes of 6.2 % and 6.6 % at 4.1 bar and 6.9 bar respectively as shown in Table 13.8.

SGS reports that the spodumene concentrate filtration test results were as expected and were considered normal behaviour for fast settling coarse material.

## h) Freeze Test Work

SGS performed two (2) freezing tests on spodumene concentrates containing 3 % and  5 %  moisture.  SGS  placed  750  grams  samples  on  trays  and  exposed  those -18 °C temperature for 24 hours.

<!-- image -->

Neither of the two (2) samples indicated major freezing problems as none of the samples  froze  as  one  solid  block.  The  frozen  3 %  moisture  sample  contained many very small fragile lumps. The frozen 5 % moisture sample had larger lumps, but these were also fragile crumbling on slight contact.

- i) SGS Test Work Program - SAG Mill Grinding Tests

In 2014, as finer DMS feed indicated improved results SGS had been requested to look into SAG Mill grinding tests.

SGS used SMC test results to design a single stage SAG mill circuit, closed with a 5.0 mm screen. The SAG mill yielded a product that was 67 % less than 0.5 mm and producing 20 % less than 38 microns.

The SAG mill would thus produce a product too fine for the efficient processing of spodumene ore.

## 13.2 Hydrometallurgical Process

This  Section  of  the  Report  summarizes  the  pyrometallurgical  and  hydrometallurgical testing  conducted  on  the  Nemaska  Lithium  Whabouchi  spodumene  concentrate.  This summary  is  based  on  reports  provided  by  Feeco  International  (' Feeco '),  SGS,  BHS Filtration Inc. (' BHS ') and Electrosynthesis Company (' Electrosynthesis ').

Test work objectives were to develop a process flow sheet for the production of marketgrade  lithium  hydroxide  and  lithium  carbonate  and  provide  engineering  data  of equipment selection and sizing.

## 13.2.1 Introduction

SGS  was  mandated  by  Nemaska  Lithium  to  conduct  a  laboratory  program  for  the development of the hydrometallurgical flow sheet. The flow sheet was piloted in three (3) phases:

- · Phase  1:  Concentrate  leach  and  all  purification  steps  (primary  and  secondary impurity removal and ion exchange);
- · Phase 2: Lithium hydroxide membrane electrolysis and crystallization;
- · Phase 3: Lithium carbonate precipitation.

Prior to the hydrometallurgical test work at SGS, the Whabouchi  spodumene concentrate was roasted at Feeco's pilot plant facility in Green Bay, Wisconsin, U.S.A.

In  addition  to  SGS  electrolysis  test  work  performed  in  Phase  2,  additional  membrane electrolysis test work was performed by the Electrosynthesis Company at their facility in Lancaster, New York, U.S.A.

## 13.2.2 Pyrometallurgical Test Work

- a) Roasting and Acid Roasting Test Work - Fall 2011

The spodumene roasting and acid roasting test work was conducted by Feeco in the fall of 2011.

<!-- image -->

## i) Sample Preparation

Fine and coarse concentrates from the original concentration flow sheet were shipped from SGS to Feeco in Green Bay. The coarse material was generated in  the  dense  media separation process while the fine material was produced through flotation.

Two (2)  blends  of  concentrates  were  prepared  using  the  as-received  coarse material  and  the  dried  fine  material.  About  1.7  tonnes  of  a  first  blend  was prepared, containing 75 % fines and 25 % coarse. A second blend (1.5 tonnes) was prepared, containing 50 % fines and 50 % coarse.

## ii) Spodumene Conversion (Roasting)

Roasting converts the spodumene's crystalline structure from alpha to beta. The conversion occurs at a temperature of about 1,025 ºC. The beta phase is reactive with sulfuric acid and produces lithium sulfate, which is amenable to leaching while the alpha crystalline structure remains unreactive.

The  test  work  was  carried  out  over  a  three  (3)  days  using  a  760 mm  (30") diameter by 6 m (20') long parallel flow gas-fired rotary kiln. The feed rate was maintained at 50 kg/h and a thermocouple was inserted in the discharge end hood to monitor the product temperature.

## iii) Acid Roasting

A  paddle  mixer  was  used  to  blend  the  beta-spodumene  with  93 %  sulfuric acid. The acidified material was returned to the kiln after the kiln had cooled to  about  200  ºC.  The  kiln  feed  rate  was  between  135  and  180  kg/h.  The retention time for the acid roasting was 32 minutes.

## iv) Pyrometallurgical Test Work Additional Information

The following observations were made by Nemaska while attending the test work program. This information was not published by Feeco.

- -Sulfuric acid was added in with approximately 30 % stoichiometric excess.
- -The roasting kiln temperature of 200 ºC was thought to be sufficient for the  acid  roasting  step  as  it  was  expected  that  the  exothermic  reaction would raise the material temperature to 250 ºC.
- -Coarse alpha-spodumene concentrate was easily converted to betaspodumene but required a longer residence time in the kiln.
- -Acid roasting was not affected by the material size.
- -The presence of iron in the concentrate affected the conversion temperature.  A  higher  temperature  could  be  reached  without  causing  the formation of glass beads when the iron was removed from the concentrate before conversion.

## b) Roasting and Acid Roasting Test Work - Winter 2013

A  second  round  of  spodumene  conversion  and  acid  roasting  test  work  was performed by SGS in the winter of 2013. The objectives of these tests were to produce  a  water  leach  residue  from  the  two  (2)  types  of  concentrate  (DMS concentrate and flotation concentrate) and to perform batch roasting optimization tests.

## i) Sample Preparation

DMS (coarse) and flotation (fine) concentrates were used to perform the test work. The DMS concentrate had a greenish color and the flotation concentrate had  a  yellowish  color.  The  different  concentrates  were  tested  separately  to assess the impact of particle size on conversion and acid roasting.

## ii) Spodumene Conversion

Twenty-nine (29) samples varying in weight from one to two kilograms (1 to 2 kg) were tested in a muffle furnace at 1,050 °C. Average sample SG was 3.15. The first 14 samples were flotation concentrate and the subsequent 15 samples  were  DMS  concentrate.  Retention  times  were  varied  between  20 minutes and 165 minutes. Full conversion was deemed to have been achieved when the sample specific gravity dropped below 2.50.

Ten  (10)  additional  optimisation  tests  were  performed  using  a  15.2  cm diameter  by  193.5  cm  long  parallel  flow  rotary  kiln  with  thermocouples inserted  in  the  sample  bed.  Seven  (7)  tests  were  performed  on  flotation concentrate and three (3) on the DMS concentrate. Sample size for each test was three (3) kg. Retention times were varied between 30 minutes and 120 minutes and reaction temperatures were varied between 950 °C and 1,050 °C.

## iii) Acid Roasting

The same muffle furnace was used to perform the acid roasting step. Samples of  one  to  two  kilograms  (1  to  2  kg)  were  placed  in  the  furnace  along  with 30 %  excess  sulfuric  acid  for  30  minutes  after  the  temperature  reached 250 °C. Temperature was monitored by a thermocouple placed in the centre of the feed.

Further, newly transformed beta-spodumene concentrate from ten (10) additional  conversion  optimization  tests  were  roasted  using  30 %  excess sulfuric acid for 30 minutes at a temperature of 250 °C.

## iv) Concentrate Leaching

Two (2) water leaching tests were performed. One (1) on the DMS roasted concentrate  (a  total  of  32.31  kg)  and  one  (1)  on  the  flotation  roasted concentrate  (a  total  of  21.50  kg).  Assays  results  of  the  concentrate  leach residues  determined  that  a  lithium  extraction  of  98 %  was  achieved  for  the DMS roasted concentrate and a lithium extraction of 95 % was achieved for the flotation roasted concentrate.

<!-- image -->

## v) Pyrometallurgical Test Work Additional Information

The following observations were made following the described test work:

- -Using  a  rotary  kiln  at  an  operating  temperature  of  1,050  °C  with  a retention time of 30 minutes will be sufficient to achieve complete phase conversion.
- -Extractions of 98.6 % lithium were achieved on the DMS concentrate and 95.0 % on the flotation concentrate.
- -A  conversion  temperature  of  950  °C  is  too  low  as  only  69.4 %  lithium extraction wash achieved.
- -Both fine and coarse particles become very friable during conversion, with coarser particles becoming much finer.
- -Reprocessing unconverted material after it has undergone the concentrate leach step can improve lithium recovery.

## 13.2.3 Hydrometallurgical Test Work - Phase 1

The Phase 1 test program was carried out in November 2011 by SGS. Phase 1 consisted of  concentrate  leaching,  primary  impurity  removal,  secondary  impurity  removal  and final purification by ion exchange.

## a) Sample Preparation

Approximately  2,600  kg  of  acid  roasted  beta-spodumene  (solid  lithium  sulfate) were processed during the first phase of the pilot plant.

The two (2) blends tested during the pyrometallurgy test work were used to feed the pilot plant (75/25 and 50/50). Table 13.9 shows the chemical analysis of the samples.

Table: 13.9 - Phase 1 Pilot Plant Feed Analysis

| Sample   |   Li  (%) |   Si  (%) |   Al  (%) |   Fe  (%) |   Na  (%) |   S  (%) |   Cr  (g/t) |   Zn  (g/t) |   Mn  (g/t) |   Mg  (g/t) |   Ca  (g/t) |   K  (g/t) |
|----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|----------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|------------|

## b) Concentrate Leach and Primary Impurity Removal

The  objectives  of  the  concentrate  leach  and  the  Primary  Impurity  Removal (' PIR ') were to dissolve the lithium sulfate from the acid roasted beta-spodumene and remove the major impurities. Approximately 1,200 kg of 75/25 and 1,400 kg of 50/50 were processed in 85 hours.

In the concentrate leach step, solids were mixed with site water at 50 % solids by weight  and  agitated.  Lithium  and  contaminants  (Fe,  Al,  Si,  Mn  and  Mg)  were leached  and  the  final  pH  of  the  slurry  was  around  1.7.  The  lithium  sulfate contained in the acid roasted beta-spodumene was 100 % leached.

<!-- image -->

In the PIR step, the pH of the slurry was elevated by adding hydrated lime. The major impurities (Fe, Al and Si) were precipitated as insoluble metal hydroxides. Air  was  sparged  into  the  PIR  tanks  to  maintain  the  oxidative  potential  of  the slurry.

The  slurry  coming  from  PIR  step  was  filtered  on  pan  filters  and  the  filtrate proceeded to Secondary Impurity Removal (' SIR ').

Vacuum filtration testing was carried out on direct PIR discharge and thickened underflow.  At  0.7  bar  vacuum  level  the  direct  discharge  sample  filter  cake moisture was 26.7 %.

## c) Secondary Impurity Removal

The objective of the secondary impurity removal was to precipitate Ca, Mg and Mn impurities from the PIR filtrate.

The pH of the solution was increased by adding sodium hydroxide (NaOH) in the first  two  (2)  tanks.  Sodium  carbonate  (Na CO )  was  added  in  the  third  tank  to 2 3 convert all the remaining divalent impurities to insoluble carbonates.

Impurity levels at the discharge averaged one (1) mg/L Mn, 14 mg/L Mg and 241 mg/L Ca in the pilot plant runs. Concentrations as low as two (2) mg/L Mg and 200 mg/L Ca were attained by optimizing key parameters such as retention time and reagent addition. The overall lithium recovery was 99.1 %.

## d) Ion Exchange

The objective of the Ion Exchange (' IX ') circuit is to further reduce the calcium and magnesium tenors from the SIR discharge to ten (10) mg/L each.

The IX circuit consisted of three (3) columns packed with a cationic resin, which is selective towards divalent and trivalent ions.

The process consisted in a lead/lag/regeneration operation. At any time, two (2) columns would be removing Ca and Mg while the third column would be resin regeneration mode.

One (1) cycle consists of the following steps: loading, feed wash, acid strip, acid wash, regeneration and regeneration wash.

The  magnesium  tenors  varied  between  0.07  and  0.2  mg/L  and  99.0 %  removal efficiency was achieved. The calcium tenors varied between 2.4 and 5.7 mg/L and 97.6 %  removal  efficiency  was  achieved.  Lithium  losses  in  the  IX  circuit  were minimal at 2.7 %.

## 13.2.4 Hydrometallurgical Test Work - Phase 2

Phase  2  of  the  test  program  was  carried  out  in  December  2011  by  SGS.  Phase  2 consisted of membrane electrolysis and crystallisation test work.

<!-- image -->

## a) LiOH Membrane Electrolysis

The  objective  of  the  electrolysis  process  is  to  produce  a  lithium  hydroxide solution from a high purity lithium sulfate solution. The pilot plant was carried out in a 3-compartment membrane electrolysis cell.

The  central  compartment  was  separated  from  the  cathodic  compartment  by  a cationic membrane and from the anodic compartment by an anionic membrane.

Under the influence of an electric field, lithium ions from the central compartment were transported through the cationic membrane. In parallel, the sulfate ions were moved  to  the  anodic  compartment.  The  anodic  reaction  generates  protons  and sulfuric acid is produced.

The  pilot  plant  was  run  for  two  (2)  5-day  campaigns  and  samples  were  taken every four to  six  (4  to  6)  hours.  The  3-compartment  cell  successfully  produced lithium  hydroxide  at  a  14.6  g/L  Li  concentration  and  a  20-30  g/L  sulfuric  acid solution. Overall, the pilot plant operated for a total of 228 hours.

## b) LiOH-H2O Crystallization

The objective of the crystallization process is to produce high quality solid lithium hydroxide  monohydrate  from  the  lithium  hydroxide  solution  generated  through membrane electrolysis. Atmospheric and vacuum evaporation were tested in three (3) steps.

The  water  evaporation  rate  was  between  6.0  and  6.8  mL/min  during  the atmospheric evaporation tests and the product concentration ranged between 18.2 and 19.9 % Li. The crystals were filtered, washed with distilled water and dried in an inert gas environment.

Vacuum  evaporation  was  tested  at  two  (2)  different  conditions:  at  78-82  kPa (vacuum)  and  62-70  ºC  and  also  at  62-70  kPa  (vacuum)  and  79-81  ºC.  The evaporation rate was approximately 7.7 mL/min for both conditions and the final purity of the product  was  similar  to the one  that underwent  atmospheric evaporation (17.9 % Li).

## 13.2.5 Hydrometallurgical Test Work - Phase 3

Phase 3 of test program was carried out in March 2012 by SGS and consisted of the production of lithium carbonate.

The objective of the test work was to prove that lithium hydroxide conversion to lithium carbonate can be an effective method of producing high purity lithium carbonate.

Lithium  hydroxide  solution  produced  from  the  membrane  electrolysis  pilot  plant campaign  was  used  as  a  feed  for  the  lithium  carbonate  production.  The  feed  had  an average lithium grade of 14.7 g/L with calcium and magnesium concentrations of 3.5 mg/L and &lt; 0.07 mg/L respectively.

The lithium carbonate production process consists of two (2) stages, the first is referred to as  Lithium  hydroxide  Carbonization  (' LC ') and  the  second  is  called  lithium bicarbonate decomposition (' DC ').

<!-- image -->

During  carbonisation,  carbon  dioxide  gas  reacts  with  lithium  hydroxide  at  room temperature  to  form  lithium  carbonate.  Once  all  lithium  hydroxide  is  carbonised,  an excess of carbon dioxide converts lithium carbonate to lithium bicarbonate.

During  decomposition,  the  solution  is  heated  to  near  boiling.  Lithium  bicarbonate formed  in  the  first  stage  is  decomposed  to  insoluble  lithium  carbonate  and  carbon dioxide.

The lithium carbonate production pilot plant was run for three (3) days, 24 hours per day.  At  the  end  of  the  three  (3)  day  pilot  plant,  12.5  kg  of  lithium  carbonate  were produced.

## 13.2.6 Membrane Electrolysis Test Work

Various  phases  of  membrane  electrolysis  test  work  on  different  configurations  were performed  by  the  Electrosynthesis  Company  to  improve  upon  the  results  obtained during the SGS test work.

The  objectives were  to determine  optimal  flow  sheet  and  operating parameters (concentration,  current  efficiency,  current  density,  configuration  etc.)  and  to  estimate membrane life cycle.

## a) Membrane Electrolysis Test Work - Autumn 2012

An initial series of test work was performed in the autumn of 2012. The objectives of the tests were to:

- · Increase the concentration of the lithium hydroxide and sulfuric acid streams produced;
- · Improve current efficiency;
- · Test different cationic and anionic membranes to increase operating temperature, reducing cooling water requirements.

The experiments were performed in an Electrocell MP (100 cm ) using three (3) 2 distinct compartments: one compartment for the salt stream (Li SO ), one for the 2 4 base recovery (LiOH) and one for the acid recovery (H2SO4). When an electric field is applied, the cations migrate from the salt, through the cationic membrane and into the base loop. Anions migrate through the anionic membrane and into the acid loop. Water molecules are split at the electrodes located in the base and acid compartments, allowing the formation of the acidic and basic solutions.

A single cationic membrane and two (2) anionic membranes were tested during a total of eight trials.

Based  on  the  results,  it was  concluded  that  the  3-compartment  membrane electrolysis successfully produced lithium hydroxide at high temperature (60 °C). The  tests  determined  optimal  base  and  acid  concentrations,  current  density, current efficiency, cell voltage, water transport and feed operating pH.

## b) Membrane Electrolysis Test Work - Summer 2013

A  subsequent  series  of  test  work  was  performed  in  the  summer  of  2013.  The objectives of the tests were to determine if a 2-compartment cell could be used to generate lithium hydroxide  and  if so, determine  operating parameters  and subsequent impact on 3-compartment cell operation.

The  experiments  on  the  2-compartment  cells  were  performed  in  an  ICI  FM-01 electrolysis cell (64 cm ) using two (2) distinct compartments: one compartment 2 for  the  salt  stream  (Li SO )  and  one  for  the  base  recovery  (LiOH).  When  an 2 4 electric  field  is  applied,  the  cations  migrate  from  the  salt,  through  the  cationic membrane and into the base loop. Anions remain in the salt compartment, being acidified by protons being generated at the anode. Water molecules are split at the electrodes located in the base and salt compartments.

A single cationic membrane was tested during multiple trials.

Based on the results, it was concluded that 2-compartment membrane electrolysis successfully converted a significant portion of the lithium in the feed stream with a high current efficiency. The tests determined optimal base concentration, current density, current efficiency, cell voltage, water transport and feed operating pH and extend of conversion.

Additional test work was performed on the salt recovered from the 2-compartment test work to determine if further lithium hydroxide production could be achieved by processing the waste stream in a 3-compartment cell. The experiments were performed  in  the  same  Electrocell  MP  (100 cm )  used  for  the  initial  trials 2 (Autumn 2012) and successfully demonstrated that complete conversion could be achieved.

## c) Membrane Electrolysis Test Work - Winter 2014

In the winter of 2014, long term stability testing on the 2-compartment cells and 3-compartment  cells  were  undertaken  at the Electrosynthesis laboratory to determine  membrane  and  electrode  lifespan.  Test  work  was  conducted  over  a period of 1,000 hours and results were used to determine expected replacement frequency  for  the  membranes  and  electrodes  allowing  for  calculation  of  the operating costs.

## 14.0 MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATES

An initial Mineral Resource estimate has been previously reported on the Whabouchi Property  by  Nemaska  in  October  2012  (SGS  Canada  Inc.,  2012).  Please  refer  to Section 6.0 for the previous Mineral Resource estimate on the Project.

This  Section  reports  the  results  of  an  updated  Mineral  Resource  estimate  for  the Whabouchi  Project.  SGS  completed  the  Mineral  Resource  update  using  the  digital database supplied by Nemaska (as of December 20 th , 2013) which includes channel data from  trenches  and  drill  holes  data  completed  by  Nemaska  since  2009.  The  historical data of the Project was not used in the present Mineral Resource estimate as the drill core is no longer available, which makes the analytical data impossible to validate.

The database used to produce the Mineral Resource estimate is derived from a total of 272 channels  and  diamond  drill  holes  and  contains  the  collar,  survey,  lithology,  and analytical results information. A significant amount of channels does not have analytical data but includes lithological information which was considered during the modeling of the  mineralized  envelopes.  Refer  to  Table  12.3  for  a  summary  of  the  records  in  the database used for the updated Mineral Resources estimate.

The Mineral Resource estimate is derived from a computerized resource block model. The construction of the block model starts with the modeling of 3-D wireframe solids of the mineralization using channels  and  drill holes Li2 O %  analytical  results and lithological data. The solids from the past Mineral Resources estimation were updated to  fit  the  new  data.  The  analytical  data  contained  within  the  wireframe  solids  was normalized to generate fixed length analytical composites. The composite data was used to interpolate the grade of blocks regularly spaced on a defined grid that fills the 3-D wireframe  solids.  An  optimized  pit  shell  was  produced  by  Met-Chem  using  the completed block model. The interpolated blocks located below the bedrock/overburden interface, within the optimized pit shell and above a determined cut-off grade comprise the Mineral Resources. The blocks were then classified based on confidence level using proximity  to  composites,  composite  grade  variance  and  mineralized  solids  geometry. The  3-D  wireframe  modeling,  block  model,  and  Mineral  Resource  estimate  were completed by SGS based on information provided by Nemaska.

## 14.1 Exploratory Data Analysis

Exploratory  data  analysis  for lithium (Li O %)  was  completed  on  both  original 2 analytical  data  and  composite  data  contained  within  the  modeled  mineralized  solids. The coordinates of the drill holes were measured in the field in UTM coordinates and then transferred into the local grid for resources estimation purposes.

## 14.1.1 Analytical Data

There are a total of 9,333 assay intervals in the database used for the current Mineral Resource estimate and 6,118 of them are contained inside the mineralized solids. Most of the drill holes intervals defining the mineralized solids have been sampled continuously. Table 14.1 shows the range of Li O values from the analytical data. 2

<!-- image -->

Table 14.1 - Range of Analytical Data Inside Mineralized Solids

|           | Li2O  (%)   |
|-----------|-------------|
| Count     | 6,118       |
| Mean      | 1.57        |
| Std. Dev. | 0.76        |
| Minimum   | 0.02        |
| Median    | 1.59        |
| Maximum   | 4.59        |

The  channel  samples  collected  at  Whabouchi  were  mostly  located  at  the  highest topographic  area  of  the  Property  where  the  outcrop  exposure  is  best.  The  channel's azimuth  ranges  from  N060°  to  N210°  with  an  average  of  N149°  which  is  generally perpendicular  to  the  orientation  of  the  pegmatite  intrusions.  The  channels  average 19.78 m in length and the sampling interval is typically one (1) metre.

The core holes drilled on the Project were generally oriented N330°, perpendicular to the  general  orientation  of  the  pegmatite  intrusions,  and  have  a  weak  to  moderate deviation  toward  the  east  (Figure  14.1).  Their  spacing  is  typically  25 m  with  larger spacing of 50 m spacing between sections 0,050 mE and 1,425 mE. The drill holes dips range from 43° to 75° with an average of 50° and the drill holes intercepts range from approximately 70 % of true width to near true width of the mineralization.

## 14.1.2 Composite Data

Block  model  grade  interpolation  is  conducted  on  composited  analytical  data.  A  2-m composite length has been selected based on the N-S thickness of the 5 m x 3 m x 5 m block size defined for the resource block model. The minimum length of composite kept for  the  interpolation  process  is  1 m.  Compositing  is  conducted  at  the  start  of  the bedrock-overburden contact in the case of drill holes. No capping was applied on the analytical composite data.

Table 14.2 shows the statistics of the analytical composites used for the interpolation of the resource block model and Figure 14.2 shows the related histogram for Li O. Figure 2 14.3  and  Figure  14.4  display  the  spatial  distribution  of  the  composites  in  plan  and longitudinal  view  respectively  (hole  collars  are  shown  as  blue  circles  and  sample composites are shown as colored diamonds).

## 14.1.3 Specific Gravity

Section 11.8  summarizes  the  SG  determination  in  details.  The  results  of  the  SG measurements  conducted  by  SGS  and  Nemaska  in  2010  and  2011  on  selected mineralized core samples returned an average SG value of 2.70/m  for the mineralized 3 pegmatite. This value was used for the calculation of the tonnages from the volumetric estimates of the resource block model.

## 14.2 Geological Interpretation

SGS conducted the interpretation and update of the prior (2011, SGS Canada Inc.) 3-D wireframe solids of the mineralization, based on the channels and drill holes data. For the  purpose  of  modeling,  sections  (looking  east)  where  generated  every  25 m,  with intermediate  section  where  necessary  to  tie  in  the  solids.  The  modeling  was  first completed on sections to define mineralized prisms using the lithologies and analytical data for lithium. A minimum grade of 0.5 % Li2O over a minimum drill hole interval length of 2 m was generally used as guideline to define the width of mineralized prisms (Figure 14.5). The final 3-D wireframe model was constructed by meshing the defined mineralized prisms based on the geological interpretation. Local smaller 3-D wireframe solids  of  significant  size  xenolith  material  (waste)  located  inside  the  large  envelopes were also modeled. The volume of the mineralized solids is 14,600,000 m . 2

Figure 14.5- Typical Section (Looking West) Interpretation of the Mineralized Solids

<!-- image -->

A  bedrock-overburden  interface  3-D  surface  has  been  generated  by  triangulating  the lower  intercept  of  the  overburden-coded  lithology  from  the  drill  holes  dataset.  The surface was then re-interpreted to ensure sufficient coverage and smoothness.

Figure  14.6  show  the  final  3-D  wireframe  solids  in  plan  and  longitudinal  view respectively.  The  different  colors  of  the  envelopes  do  not  represent  any  specific parameters and were used to help the visual differentiation.

## 14.3 Resource Block Modeling

A block size of 5 m (E-W) x 3 m (N-S) x 5 m (vertical) was selected for the resource block model of the Project based on drill holes spacing, width and general geometry of mineralization.  The  5 m  vertical  dimension  corresponds  to  the  bench  height  of  a potential  small  open  pit  mining  operation.  The  5 m  E-W  dimension  corresponds  to about a quarter to a fifth of the minimum spacing between the drill holes and accounts for  the  variable  geometry  of  the  mineralization  in  that  direction.  The  3 m  N-S  block dimension accounts for the average minimum width of the mineralization modeled at Whabouchi.  The  resource  block  model  contains  206,398  blocks  located  inside  the mineralized  solids,  for  a  total  volume  of  15,480,000 m .  Blocks  located  above  the 2 interface  with  the  bedrock/overburden surface have been estimated and then removed from  the model  with  corresponding  block  fraction. Table  14.3 summarizes  the parameters of the block model limits.

| Direction       | Block size   | Number of  blocks   | Coordinates (Local Grid)   | Coordinates (Local Grid)   |
|-----------------|--------------|---------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|
|                 | (m)          |                     | Min (m)                    | Max (m)                    |
| East-West (x)   | 5            | 301                 | 0                          | 1,500                      |
| North-South (y) | 3            | 151                 | -350                       | 100                        |
| Elevation (z)   | 5            | 121                 | 350                        | -250                       |

## 14.4 Grade Interpolation Methodology

## 14.4.1 Geostatistical Study

In  order  to  determine  the  continuity  and  distribution  of  the  Li2O  grades,  the  2 m composites  were  submitted  to  a  variographic  study.  The  variographic  study  helped determine the search ellipses criterias and define the kriging parameters for the block interpolation process.

The composites show a normal distribution (Figure 14.2) with a relatively low variation percentage  of  38 %.  The  resulting  correlogram  can  be  modelled  with  the  following function (Figure 14.7):

Gamma = N(0.05) + S(0.8, 40/30/4, 180/-80/0) + S(0.15, 50/40/15, 180/-80/0)

Where N represents a nugget effect of 5 % and maximum continuity of 50 m is found along the NS axis at a -80° dip. Intermediate range is 40 m along strike (E-W axis at 0°) which is slightly larger than the drilling grid spacing of 25 m. Shortest range is found across  the  mineralization  with  a  range  of  15 m  towards  360°  and  -45°  of  dip  (Figure 14.7).

## 14.4.1 Block Model Interpolation

The grade interpolation for the Whabouchi resource block model was completed using the  Ordinary  Kriging  (' OK ')  methodology.  The  interpolation  process  was  conducted using  three  (3)  successive  passes  with  more  inclusive  search  conditions  from  one  (1) pass to the next until all blocks were interpolated.

Variable search ellipse orientations were used to interpolate the blocks. The general dip of the mineralized pegmatite was modeled on each section and then interpolated in each blocks (Figure 14.8). During the interpolation process, the search ellipse was orientated following the interpolation direction of each block, hence better representing the dip and orientation of the mineralization.

The first pass was interpolated using a search ellipsoid distance of 75 m (long axis) by 75 m (intermediate axis) and 25 m (short axis) with an orientation of 0° azimuth (local grid), -75° dip and 0° spin which represents the general geometry of the pegmatites in the deposit. Using search conditions defined by a minimum of seven (7) composites, a maximum of 30 composites and a minimum of three (3) holes, 66 % of the blocks were estimated. For the second pass, the search distance was twice the search distance of the first  pass and composites selection criteria were kept the same as for the first pass. A total  of  93 %  of  the  blocks  were  interpolated  following  the  second  pass.  Finally,  the search  distance  of  the  third  pass  was  increased  to  500 m  (long  axis)  by  500 m (intermediate  axis)  by  100 m  (short  axis)  and  again  the  same  composites  selection criteria were applied. The purpose of the last interpolation pass was to interpolate the remaining  unestimated  blocks  mostly  located  at  the  edges  of  the  block  model, representing 7 % of the blocks.

Figure 14.8 illustrates the three (3) search ellipsoids used for the different interpolation passes. Figure 14.9 shows the results of the block model interpolation longitudinal view.

<!-- image -->

In order to validate the interpolation process, the block model  was  compared statistically,  to  the  assays  and  composites.  The  distribution  of  the  assays,  composites and  blocks  are  normal  and  show  a  similar  average  value  with  decreasing  levels  of variance (Figure 14.10). The assays and composites have respective averages of 1.57 % Li2 O and 1.59 % Li2O with variances of 0.58 and 0.37. The resulting interpolated blocks have and average value of 1.54 % Li O with a variance of 0.06. 2

Furthermore, the block values were compared to the composites values located inside the interpolated blocks. This enables to test for possible over or under evaluation of the grade by the search parameters by testing the local correlation. A correlation ratio of 0.682 (R ) was established between the blocks and the composites (Figure 14.11) which 2 is typical and considered acceptable.

## 14.5 Mineral Resource Classification

The  Mineral  Resources  at  Whabouchi  were  classified  into  Measured,  Indicated  and Inferred categories. The Mineral Resource classification follows the CIM requirements and  guidelines  and  is  based  on  the  density  of  analytical  information,  the  grade variability and  spatial  continuity  of  mineralization.  The  Mineral  Resources  were classified  in  two  (2)  successive  stages:  automated  classification  followed  by  manual editing of final classification results.

The  first  classification  stage  is  conducted  by  applying  an  automated  classification process  which  selects  around  each  block  a  minimum  number  of  composite  from  a minimum  number  of  holes  located  within  a  search  ellipsoid  of  a  given  size  and orientation. For the Measured Resource category, the search ellipsoid was 35 m (strike) x  35 m  (dip)  x  5 m  with  a  minimum  of  seven  (7)  composites  in  at  least  three  (3) different drill holes. For the Indicated category, the search ellipsoid was twice the size of  the  Measured  category  ellipsoid  using  the  same  composites  selection  criteria.  All remaining blocks were considered to be in the Inferred category.

The  second  classification  stage  involves  the  delineation  of  coherent  zones  for  the Measured and Indicated categories based on the results of the automated classification. The  objective  is  to  homogenize  or  'smooth'  the  results  of  the  automated  process  by removing the 'Swiss cheese' or 'spotted dog' patterns typical of the automated process results. The second stage is conducted by defining 3-D solids on a bench by bench basis for the Measured and Indicated categories.

Figure 14.12 and Figure 14 13 show the block model classification process in plan view . and  the  final  classification  of  the  blocks  in  plan  and  isometric  views  with  respective categories (categories: Measured - red, Indicated - blue, and Inferred - green).

## 14.6 Mineral Resource Estimation

Due to the significant depth extent of the resource block model, an economic analysis must  be  done  to  check  if  all  of  the  interpolated  blocks  meet  the  requirement  of reasonable prospect of economic extraction stated in the CIM guidelines for resources estimation.  In  order  to  define  the  Mineral  Resources  of  Whabouchi,  SGS  used  an optimized  pit  shell  provided  by  Met-Chem  that  was  based  on  the  economic  criteria presented in Table 15.1 of this Report. The optimized pit shell that is used to constrain the  Mineral  Resources  is  larger  than  the  one  used  for  the  Mineral  Reserves  since  it includes Inferred Resources and does not account for discounting of the cash flows. The final  Mineral  Resources  include  the  resource  blocks  located  within  this  optimized  pit shell,  below  the  overburden/bedrock  interface  and  above  the  cut-off  grade  of  0.43 % Li2 O which was established by Met Chem and discussed in Section 15.0.

The  final  Mineral  Resource  estimate  at  a  base  case  cut-off  of  0.43 %  Li O  totals 2 12,998,000  tonnes,  with  an  average  grade  of  1.60 %  Li O  in  the  Measured  category, 2 14,993,000  tonnes,  with  an  average  grade  of  1.54 %  Li O  in  the  Indicated  category, 2 with  an  additional  4,686,000  tonnes,  with  an  average  grade  of  1.51 %  Li O  in  the 2 Inferred category as shows in Table 14.4. The updated Mineral Resource estimation for Whabouchi deposit is tabulated in for the base case cut-off of 0.43 % Li O. Figure 14.14 2 is a longitudinal section showing the optimized pit outline with the final in-pit resource block model.

Table: 14.4 - Whabouchi Deposit Mineral Resource Estimate

|   Cut-off Grade  Li2O (%) | Category   |   Tonnage**   (Mt) |   Li2O Grade   (%) |
|---------------------------|------------|--------------------|--------------------|
|                      0.43 | Measured   |             12.998 |               1.6  |
|                      0.43 | Indicated  |             14.993 |               1.54 |

*Note: The Mineral Resource estimate has been calculated using the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (CIM) Definitions Standards for Mineral Resources in concordance with National Instrument 43-101 - Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects. Mineral resources which are not Mineral Reserves do not  have  demonstrated  economic  viability.  Inferred  Mineral  Resources  are  exclusive  of  the  Measured  and Indicated resources.

## 15.0 MINERAL RESERVE ESTIMATES

Both the open pit and underground Mineral Reserves have been developed using best practices in accordance with CIM guidelines and National Instrument 43-101 reporting.

The effective date of the Mineral Reserve estimate is May 13 th , 2014.

The Mineral Reserves were derived from the Mineral Resource block model that was presented  in  Section 14.0.  The  Mineral  Reserves  are  the  Measured  and  Indicated Mineral  Resources  that  have  been  identified  as  being  economically  extractable  and which  incorporate  mining  loses  and  the  addition  of  waste  dilution.  The  Mineral Reserves form the basis for the mine plan presented in Section 16.0.

## 15.1 Initial Open Pit Followed by Underground Operation

The Waboushi deposit will be mined using conventional open pit mining for the first 20 years  of  operation  followed  by  six  (6)  years  of  underground  mining.  The  Mineral Reserves are estimated with the two (2) methods and presented below. Details of the selection method for open pit and underground operations are given in Section 16.0 of the Report.

## 15.2 General Parameters Common to the Open Pit and Underground Mineral Reserves

The following Section discusses the geological information that was used for the open pit, underground mine plans and Mineral Reserve estimates. This information includes the topographic surface, the geological block model and the material properties for ore, waste and overburden.

The  mine  planning  work  carried  out  for  the  Feasibility  Study  was  done  using MineSight ® Version  8.50.  MineSight ® is a  commercially  available  mine  planning software that has been used by Met-Chem for over 25 years.

## 15.2.1 Topographic Surface

The mine design for the Feasibility Study was carried out using a topographic surface based on one metre (1 m) contour intervals. The contours were supplied by Nemaska Lithium and derived from a LiDAR survey that took place on July 11 th , 2011.

## 15.2.2 Resource Block Model

The  mine  design  for  the  Feasibility  Study  is  based  on  the  3-dimensional  geological block  model  that  was  prepared  by  Roche  Ltd.,  and  presented  in  Section 14.0.  Each block  in  the  model  is  five  (5) m  wide,  three  (3) m  long  and  five  (5) m  high  and  the model  is  rotated  330°.  Only  blocks  that  contain  mineralization  were  included  in  the 3-dimensional geological block model.

Each block in the model contains the Li O grade and resource classification (Measured, 2 Indicated  and  Inferred). Using  the  overburden  surface  provided  by  Roche  Ltd., Met-Chem was able to differentiate the non-mineralized material as either overburden or waste rock.

<!-- image -->

## 15.2.3 Material Properties

The material properties for the different rock types are outlined below. These properties are important in estimating the Mineral Reserves, the equipment fleet requirements as well as the dump and stockpile design capacities.

## a) Density

As  was  discussed  in  Section 14.0  of  this  Report,  the  in-situ  dry  density  of  the mineralized material was estimated to be 2.7 t/m . Met-Chem assumed a density 3 of 3.06 t/m  for the waste rock and a density of 2.1 t/m  for the overburden. 3 3

## b) Swell Factor

The swell factor reflects the increase in volume of material from its in-situ state to after it is blasted and loaded into the haul trucks. A swell factor of 45 % was used for  the  Feasibility  Study,  which  is  a  typical  value  used  for  open  pit  hard  rock mines. Once the rock is placed in the waste dumps and stockpiles, the swell factor is reduced to 30 % due to compaction.

## c) Moisture Content

The moisture content reflects the amount of water that is present within the rock formation.  It  affects  the  estimation  of  haul  truck  requirements  and  must  be considered  during  the  payload  calculations.  The  moisture  content  is  also  an important factor for the process water balance.

Since the Mineral Reserves were estimated using the dry density, they were not affected by the moisture content value. A moisture content of 5 % was used for the Feasibility Study. This value is typical for similar projects in the region.

## 15.3 Open Pit Mineral Reserves

## 15.3.1 Open Pit Optimization

The first step in the Mineral Reserve estimate is to carry out a pit optimization analysis. The pit optimization analysis uses economic criteria to determine the cut-off grade and to what extent the deposit can be mined profitably.

The  pit  optimization  analysis  was  done  using  the  MS-Economic  Planner  module  of MineSight ® Version  8.5.  The  optimizer  uses  the  3D  Lerchs-Grossmann  algorithm  to determine the economic pit limits based on input of mining and processing costs and revenue  per  block.  In  order  to  comply  with  NI  43-101  guidelines  regarding  the Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects, only blocks classified in the Measured and Indicated categories were allowed to drive the pit optimizer. Inferred resource blocks were treated as waste, bearing no economic value.

Table 15.1 presents the parameters that were used for the pit optimization analysis. The cost and operating parameters that were used were preliminary estimates for developing the  economic  pit  and  should  not  be  confused  with  the  operating  costs  subsequently developed for the Feasibility Study and presented in Section 21.0.

- 1 The mining cost was increased by $ 0.01 /t for each 5 m increment in pit depth. The $ 3.00 /t represents the average mining cost.
- 2 A pit slope of 40° was used on the south side of the deposit to account for the eventual ramp design. A pit slope of 56° was used on the north side of the deposit where there will be no ramp.

The  pit  optimization  analysis  considered  the  Li O  grades  after  mining  dilution  was 2 accounted for. Mining dilution is discussed in the next Section of this Report.

Using  the  cost  and  operating  parameters,  a  series  of  12  pit  shells  was  generated  by varying the selling price (revenue factor) from US$ 200 to US$ 1,000 /t. Figure 15.1 shows a typical section through the deposit with several of the pit shells.

The  tonnages  and  grades  associated  with  each  of  the  pit  shells  are  presented  in Table 15.2. The Net Present Value (' NPV ')  of  each  shell  was  calculated  assuming  a selling  price  of  US$  425 /t  of  concentrate  (FOB  Salaberry-de-Valleyfield),  a  discount rate  of  8 %  and  an  annual  production  of  214,320  tonnes  of  concentrate.

The pit optimization analysis shows that the open pit design should be based on PIT17 (Revenue  Factor  -  0.82).  This  pit  shell  contains  22 Mt  of  Measured  and  Indicated Mineral Resources at a strip ratio of 2.4 to 1. Mining additional resources with an open pit beyond the limits of this pit shell increases the strip ratio but does not increase the NPV of the Project. The economics of mining these additional resources was evaluated as an underground operation as is discussed subsequently in this Report.

Upon completion of the Feasibility Study, Met-Chem confirmed that the pit optimization exercise was still valid using the updated cost estimate developed in the Study.

Figure  15.3  presents  a  histogram  of  the  grades  and  tonnage  of  the  Measured  and Indicated Mineral Resources. The histogram shows that the Whabouchi deposit contains very little tonnage below the cut-off grade.

## 15.3.2 Open Pit Design

The next step in the Mineral Reserve estimation process was to design an operational pit that  will  form  the  basis  of  the  production  plan.  This  pit  design  uses  the  pit  shell  as  a guideline and includes smoothing the pit wall, adding ramps to access the pit bottom and  ensuring  that  the  pit  can  be  mined  using  the  initially  selected  equipment.  The following Section provides the parameters that were used for the open pit design and presents the results.

<!-- image -->

## a) Geotechnical Pit Slope Parameters

The  geotechnical  pit  slope  parameters  were  provided  by  Journeaux  Assoc.  in  a report titled 'Whabouchi Project Report on Pit Slope Design, March 23 rd , 2012'.

For all of the final pit walls, the report recommends an overall pit slope of 56°. This slope will be achieved with 10 m bench heights, a bench face angle of 75° and a 4 m wide catch bench per bench.

According to the report, the slopes are considered stable due to very competent bedrock  and  the  fact  that  the  joint  systems  are  steeply  dipping.  However,  preshearing blasting techniques should be used to minimize rock falls.

## b) Haul Road Design

The  ramps  and  haul  roads  were  designed  with  an  overall  width  of  20 m.  For double lane traffic, industry practice indicates the running surface width to be a minimum of three (3) times the width of the largest truck. The overall width of a 46-tonne  rigid  frame  haul  truck  is  4.8 m  which  results  in  a  running  surface  of 14 m. The allowance for berms and ditches increases the overall haul road width to 20 m.

A  maximum  ramp  grade  of  10 %  was  used.  This  grade  is  acceptable  for  a 46-tonne rigid frame haul truck. Figure 15.4 presents a typical section of the in-pit ramp design.

Figure 15.4 - Ramp Design

## c) Mine Dilution and Ore Loss

In every mining operation, it is impossible to perfectly separate the ore and waste as a result of the large scale of the mining equipment and the use of drilling and blasting. In order to account for mining dilution, Met-Chem assign a diluted Li O 2 grade value for each block of ore that neighbours a waste block.

The mining dilution was estimated at 10 %, meaning that for each 5 m wide block of ore, 0.5 m of the neighbouring waste block was included as dilution. A Li O 2 grade of 0 % was used for the waste. The addition of mining dilution resulted in lowering the Li O grade of the Mineral Reserves from 1.58 % to 1.53 %. 2

The gain in tonnage that results from including the 0.5 m wide slice of waste was not  included  in  the  Mineral  Reserves  in  order  to  remain  conservative  with  the methodology of applying mining dilution and ore losses.

## d) Minimum Mining Width

A minimum mining width of 15 m was considered for the open pit design. This is based on a 10 m turning radius for a 46-tonne haul truck plus several metres on each side for safety.

## 15.3.3 Open Pit Design Results

The  pit  that  has  been  designed  for  the  Whabouchi  deposit  is  approximately  1,300 m long and 300 m wide at surface with a maximum pit depth from surface of 190 m. The total surface area of the pit is roughly 300,000 m . The overburden thickness averages 2 4 m and ranges from 0 to 9 m.

The pit ramp enters the pit on the east side at the 310 m elevation. The ramp follows the south side of the pit down to the 180 m elevation where the first switch back occurs. The second switch back will be at the 150 m elevation. The deepest part of the open pit will be at the 120 m elevation.

The open pit encroaches into the wetland by 50 m in the south east corner which was unavoidable. Figure 15.5 presents the open pit design for the Whabouchi deposit.

## 15.3.4 Open pit Cut-off Grade

Using the economic parameters presented in Table 15.1, the open pit cut-off grade was initially calculated to be 0.43 % Li O. This cut-off was also re-confirmed using the final 2 economic  and  production  costs  values  presented  in  Section 21.0  of  the  Report.  The cut-off  grade  is  used  to  determine  whether  the  material  being  mined  will  generate  a profit after paying for the processing, transportation and G&amp;A costs. Material that will be mined below the cut-off grade will be sent to the waste dump.

## 15.3.5 Open Pit Mineral Reserves Estimate

The  open  pit  design  includes  11.7 Mt  of  Proven  Mineral  Reserves  and  8.3 Mt  of Probable Mineral Reserves for a total of 20.0 Mt at a grade of 1.53 % Li O. In order to 2 access  these  reserves,  2.4 Mt  of  overburden,  40.7 Mt  of  waste  rock  and  0.3 Mt  of Inferred Mineral Resources must be mined. This total waste quantity of 43.4 Mt results in a stripping ratio of 2.2 to 1. Table 15.3 presents the open pit Mineral Reserves for the Whabouchi deposit using a cut-off of 0.43 % Li O. 2

Table 15.3 - Whabouchi Open Pit Mineral Reserves

| Category            |   Tonnage (Mt) |   Li2O Grade  (%) |

## 15.4 Underground Mineral Reserves

## 15.4.1 Economic, Design and Operating Parameters

The underground mine will be developped at the end of the open pit life and will take over the production once the open pit reserves will be depleted in Year 20.

The underground mine will be accessed via a mine portal located at elevation 188 m and a  main  ramp  that  will  connect  to  the  six  (6)  underground  sub-levels  located  on  the footwall  side  of  the  orebody.  The  sub-levels  will  be  spaced  at  every  30  metres  in elevation located at levels 187 m, 157 m, 127 m, 97 m, 67 m and 37 m.

The deposit will be mined using conventional long-hole open stoping method at a rate between 3,500 and 4,000 tonnes per day. Stope and crown pillars will be recovered at the end of the mine life.

All development  and  production  will  be  made  by  contractors  due  to  the  short underground mine life.

Figure  15.6  and  Figure  15.7  illustrate  the  3-D  and  the  longitudinal  section  of  the underground mine design respectively.

<!-- image -->

## 15.4.2 Cut-off Grade

Using  an  underground  mining  cost  of  $ 21.30/t  ore  and  the  economic  parameters presented in Section 21.0 of the Report, the underground cut-off grade was calculated at 0.80 % Li2O. The cut-off grade is used to determine at what point material being mined will generate a profit after paying for the mining, processing, transportation and G&amp;A costs.

## 15.4.3 Mine Dilution and Ore Loss

The inherent nature of the underground operation and the known level of precision of the drilling and the blasting is such that the ore will be diluted with some of the host rock along the edges of the mineralization zone. The ore dilution factor estimation was calculated by extending the width dimension of the stope by 0.6 metres outside of the mineralized  envelope  on  each  side  of  the  stope.  This  results  in  an  average  additional

<!-- image -->

volume of 10 % of material having a grade of 0.8 % Li2O diluting the ore. Figure 15.8 illustrates  an  example  of  the  extended  width  dimension  of  the  stope  outside  of  the mineralized envelope for the dilution factor calculation.

Figure 15.8 - Stope Dilution Calculation

<!-- image -->

The rock recovery factors used for the stope and the crown pillar have been 90 % and 80 % respectively and are based on the reported factors for similar mining operations.

## 15.4.4 Underground Mineral Reserves Estimate

Table  15.4  presents  the  underground  Proven  and  Probable  Mineral  Reserves  for  the Whabouchi deposit at a cut-off grade of Li O 2 ≥ 0.80 %.

## 15.5 Combined Open Pit and Underground Reserves for Whaboushi Project

The  combined  open  pit  and  underground  Mineral  Reserves  for  Waboushi  have  been estimated at 27.3 Mt of ore grading 1.46 % Li O as shown in Table 15.5 below. Proven 2 Reserves account for 49 % of the reserves.

The  deposit  is  open  at  depth  and  there  is  a  potential  for  increasing  reserves  for  the underground portion  of  the  mine  by  drilling  the  Inferred  portions  of  the  resources  to upgrade them to Indicated category.

## 16.0 MINING METHODS

## 16.1 Selection of Open Pit Followed by Underground Mining

## 16.1.1 Open Pit Mining (Original Case)

In  the  PEA study, the Wabouchi deposit was evaluated as an open pit operation only providing for 19 years of Mineral Resources.

At  the  start  of  the  Feasibility  Study,  Met-Chem  re-evaluated  the  economic  pit  limits based on the new resource model with updated production costs and sales prices. The economic pit, limited only to Measured and Indicated Resources, provided for enough ore for 28 years of production (as shown in Table 15.2 - PIT22), however, the footprint of the new pit expanded in wetlands areas and required a much larger waste stockpile.

Met-Chem  reviewed  the  incremental  costs  for  each  pit  shell  and  identified  a  phase where going from 20 to 28 years required the removal of almost twice as much waste tonnage  in  the  last  8  years  as  compared  to  the  first  22.  With  this  increase  in  waste removal, the incremental cost would have been $ 72 /t of ore, an increment judged much higher than a typical underground mining cost. It was therefore decided to look at the possibility of mining the lower portion of the ore using underground mining methods to lower costs and reduce the environmental footprint of the mine.

## 16.1.2 Underground Mining Opportunity

To  assess  the  viability  of  an  underground  operation  below  the  20-year  open  pit,  the underlaying  resources  were  looked  at  with  an  underground  operation  in  mind.  The massive  portions  of  the  deposit  were  modelled  into  stope  shapes  and  development designed around such. Underground access was to be connected to the open pit main ramp  to  reduce  development  costs.  Overall  capex  and  opex  were  then  estimated  and compared to the open pit costs.

## 16.1.3 Selected Option of Open Pit Followed by Underground Operation

The initial economic analysis comparing an open pit only operation versus and open pit followed  by  underground  mining  showed  the  latter  to  be  more  advantageous.  The Feasibility  Study  was  then  steered  in  that  direction.  Details  of  the  open  pit  and underground operations are given below.

Other factors that influenced that decision are social and environmental impacts and the fact that the deposit is open at depth.

In general, open pit mining is commonly associated with more significant environmental and social impacts than underground mining, essentially because of the associated larger surface footprint. However, as outlined in the previous Sections, the Whabouchi deposit characteristics make open pit mining mining more favourable from an economic and technical standpoint because of its proximity to surface than operating using only underground mining methods. Open pit mining will therefore be favoured for the upper portions of the deposit. In order to mitigate environmental and social effects of  the  projected  mine,  where  geological  characteristics  and  economic  factors  make  it feasible  to  switch  to  underground  mining,  the  latter  was  favored.  Consequently,  from

<!-- image -->

Year  20,  the  mine  will  be  operating  from  underground,  thus  not  only  limiting  the surface footprint of the ultimate open pit, but also minimizing the amount of waste rock to  be  managed and stockpiled at the surface. Such an approach also enables a longer mine life without significantly increasing the surface area impacted by mining activities, something  which  extends  the  duration  and  cumulative  importance  of  the  Project's economic spin-offs for local, regional and provincial stakeholders.

## 16.2 Open Pit Mining

## 16.2.1 Open Pit Mining Method

The mining method selected for the Project will be a conventional open pit, truck and shovel, drill and blast operation. Vegetation, topsoil and overburden will be stripped and stockpiled for future reclamation use. The ore and waste rock will be mined with 10 m high  benches,  drilled,  blasted  and  loaded  into  rigid  frame  haul  trucks  with  hydraulic excavators.

## 16.2.2 Geotechnical Pit Slope Parameters

The geotechnical pit slope parameters were presented in Section 15.0.

## 16.2.3 Hydrogeology and Hydrology Parameters

The four (4) sources of water that affect the mining operation will be surface run-off, rainfall, snowmelt and groundwater. The quantity for each of these sources of water was estimated  for  each  period  of  the  mine  plan  in  order  to  calculate  the  mine  dewatering requirements.

## a) Surface Run-off

In order to limit the surface run-off from entering the pit, a perimeter ditch will be established around the limits of the pit to capture the surface water before it enters into the mining area. Water collected in the ditch system will be directed to the sedimentation pond that will be located on the west side of the pit, where it will be treated  and  sampled  prior  to  discharge  into  the  environment.  Perimeter  ditches will also be established around the waste piles and overburden stockpile to capture water run-off.

## b) Rainfall and Snowmelt

The amount of rainfall and snowmelt was estimated using historical meteorological data that was presented in Nemaska Lithium's report titled ' Étude des impacts sur l'environnement et le milieu social, Mars 2013 '. Using this data, Met-Chem estimated that an average of 772 mm of precipitation can be expected each year. Evaporation has been estimated to account for the removal of 335 mm of this water per year. Using the surface area of the open pit for each period of the mine plan, Met-Chem estimated that the amount of precipitation that is expected to be collected in the open pit will range from 72 m /d at the start of the operation 3 to 359 m /d in Year 20. These figures are averages and do not represent years of 3 extreme  precipitation.  The  mine  may  have  to  shut  down  temporarily  during periods of extreme rainfall.

<!-- image -->

## c) Groundwater

Met-Chem prepared a conceptual hydrogeological model in order to estimate the quantity of groundwater that is expected to infiltrate into the open pit. The data that  was  used  for  this  model  was  obtained  from  the  report  prepared  by  Wesa Envir-Eau, titled ' Étude Hydrogéologique Projet Whabouchi, Février 2012 '. The report  presented  the  results  from  the  2011  hydrogeological  field  investigations which included pumping tests and the installations of piezometers.

Met-Chem estimated the hydraulic conductivity for the Whabouchi deposit to be 6.2 x 10 -7 m/s.  Using  the  equation  for  Darcy's  Flow  and  the  surface  area  of  the exposed pit wall for each period of the mine plan, Met-Chem estimated that the amount of groundwater that is expected to be collected in the open pit will range from 247 m /d at the start of the operation to 1,920 m /d in Year 20. 3 3

Therefore, the total amount of water that will be required to be evacuated out of the  open  pit  is  expected  to  range  from  319 m /d  at  the  start  of  the  operation  to 3 2,279 m /d in Year 20. This amount of water will be collected in a sump that will 3 be established on the lowest point of the pit floor. The water will be pumped from the sump to the surface and directed to the sedimentation basin.

The pump that has been selected for the mine dewatering is a Godwin HL130 with a  220 kW diesel powered motor. Based on the flow rate, pumping distance and head,  one  (1)  pump  will  be  required  at  the  start  of  the  operation  and  a  second pump will be added in Year 10. The cost to purchase and operate the pumps as well  as  piping  and  other  accessories  has  been  included  in  the  mine  capital  and operating cost estimate presented in Section 21.0.

## 16.2.4 Phase Design

An initial starter pit was designed which will supply the majority of the run of mine ore for the first five (5) years of the operation. The purpose of the starter pit is to maximize the feed grade and minimize the strip ratio during the early years of the operation. The starter  pit,  which  is  presented  in  Figure  16.1,  contains  4.2 Mt  of  ore  with  an  average grade of 1.56 % Li O at strip ratio of 1.5.1. 2

## 16.2.5 Waste Rock, Overburden and Tailings Management

A topsoil and overburden stockpile has been designed 100 m to the east of the pit ramp exit, to the south of the concentrator. The stockpile was designed with an overall slope of  26.6°  (2H:1V),  has  a  capacity  of  1.5  Mm3,  a  footprint  area  of  90,000  m2,  a  top elevation  of  310  m  and  a  maximum  height  of  25  m.  Material  that  is  placed  in  this stockpile will be used for future reclamation.

The Project has selected to use a co-disposal methodology for the tailings produced at the concentrator and the waste rock from the mine. Co-disposal is the mixing of fine tailings and coarse mine waste rock to produce a single waste stream. Mixing the fine and coarse waste reduces the empty void space primarily associated with coarse waste streams, while simultaneously increasing the strength of the fines. Tailings produced at the concentrator will have a moisture content around 14 %.

The deposition strategy to blend the coarse and fine waste feeds will be based on mixing at the edge of the waste rock pile by placing both tailings and waste rock near the crest of the active dump, then pushing both over the face with a dozer. The design parameters used for the waste/tailings pile do not require that a fixed ratio be maintained. Waste and  tailings  trucks  can  arrive  randomly.  Compaction  will  be  achieved  by  traffic  of equipment on the pile and self-weight.

The tailings will be transported from the concentrator to the waste rock pile with the same 46-tonne truck fleet that will be used in the open pit. Loading of the tailings will be  done  by  a  suspended  conveyor  with  a  single  discharge  point  and  with  a  design capacity to load the truck in ten (10) minutes. Between two (2) and three (3) truckloads of tailings are expected every hour.

During the 20-year life of the open pit, a total of 17.4 Mm  of waste rock and 7.0 Mm 3 3 of tailings will be generated for a total of 24.4 Mm . The quantity of tailings has been 3 estimated using a factor of 0.35 m  of tailings per tonne of ore. 3

Two (2) waste rock piles have been designed and located on the north side of the Route du Nord. The waste rock piles have been designed with the following parameters that were  provided  by  Journeaux  Assoc.  in  a  report  titled  ' Whabouchi  Project  Plan  de Restoration, Août 2012 ';

-  Swell Factor - 30 % ;
-  Overall Slope - 26.6° ;
-  Lift Slope - 30° ;
-  Lift Height - 10 m ;
-  Maximum Dump Height - 70 m ;

The waste rock piles were designed to be a minimum distance of 50 m from the Route du Nord , lakes and creeks and the Hydro-Québec 735 kV high voltage power line. The waste piles as well as the topsoil and overburden stockpile will have a perimeter ditch around their toes to capture water run-off.

<!-- image -->

The first waste pile, which will be built from the start of the operation until Year 15, has a capacity of 21 Mm . This pile has a footprint area of 600,000 m , a top elevation of 3 2 350 m and a maximum height of 60 m.

During the first six (6) years, the dumping of waste rock and tailings will concentrate on the east side of the waste pile so that the final design can be reached and progressive reclamation can begin.

The second pile, which will be built once the first pile has reached its final designed capacity, has a capacity of 6 Mm . This capacity accounts for the remaining waste rock 3 and tailings volumes from the open pit as well as those from the underground operation. The second pile will be located to the north of the Hydro-Quebec 735 kV high voltage power line. This pile has a footprint area of 250,000 m , a top elevation of 340 m and a 2 maximum height of 40 m.

Met-Chem evaluated the opportunity to carry-out in-pit dumping on the east side of the pit  to  replace  the  need  for  the  second  waste  pile.  In-pit  dumping  would  lower  the operating costs by reducing the haul distances for waste rock and tailings and minimize the  environmental  footprint  of  the  Project.  Since  the  mine  will  continue  with  an underground operation, an in-pit waste dump would hinder the recovery of the crown pillar.

Figure 16.2 presents a layout of the waste piles and overburden stockpile.

## 16.2.6 Open Pit Mine Planning

The following Section discusses the mine plan that was prepared for the open pit for the Feasibility Study. This mine plan forms the basis of the mine capital and operating cost estimate presented in Section 21.0. The mine plan was established annually for the first ten (10) years of production, followed by two (2), three (3) year periods and one (1) four (4) year period for the remaining10 years.

## a) Mine Planning Parameters

- i) Work Schedule

Mining operations for the Project will be 50 weeks per year, operating around the clock on two (2), 12 hour shifts. The two (2) week shutdown in the mine will occur during the goose hunting season. During this period, the concentrator  will  be  fed  from  the  run  of  mine  ore  stockpile.  The  fleet requirements and manpower were based on this work schedule.

## ii) Annual Production Requirements

The  mine  plan  is  based  on  an  annual  production  of  216,485 tonnes  of concentrate (resulting in 214,320 tonnes of concentrate after 1 % losses were accounted  for).  The  production  in  Year 1  was  limited  to  162,364  tonnes  of concentrate (75 % of full production), to account for start-up and commissioning.

## iii) Mill Recovery and Concentrate Grade

The following calculation was used to determine the amount of concentrate that will be produced from the run of mine ore. The mill recovery is 83.83 % and the concentrate grade is 6 %.

Concentrate Tonnage =

Run of Mine Ore ሺ ሻ t x Li O Grade  % 2 ሺ ሻ x Mill Recovery (%)

Concentate Grade (%)

## b) Mine Production Schedule

Table  16.1  presents  the  mine  production  schedule  that  was  developed  for  the 20-year life of the open pit mine. This schedule includes a pre-production phase of three (3) months which will be required for pit development. During this period, 700,000 tonnes of overburden and 300,000 tonnes of waste rock will be mined. A total of 15,000 tonnes of ore will also be stockpiled during pre-production. This ore stockpile will be maintained during the life of the mine.

The total material mined per year during the 20-year period ranges from 1.0 Mt in pre-production to a maximum of 5.3 Mt in Year 10. Figure 16.3 presents a chart showing the tonnages mined each year. The tonnages shown are annualized for the three (3) and four (4) year periods. The average annual grade of Li O varies 2 1.44 % to 1.60 % during the 20-year period.

Figure  16.4  and  Figure  16.5  show  the  pit,  waste  pile  and  overburden  stockpile advances as of Year 3 and 10 respectively.

## 16.2.7 Mine Equipment Fleet

The following Section discusses equipment selection and fleet requirements in order to carry out the mine plan for the open pit. The mine will be operated with an Owner fleet which is presented in Table 16.2. The table identifies the Caterpillar equivalent to give the reader an appreciation for the size of each machine although the specific equipment selection will be done during the procurement phase of the Project.

The  majority  of  the  support  equipment  fleet  will  remain  during  the  underground operation as well as one (1) of the haul trucks to transport the tailings and the waste rock that will be mined underground.

## a) Haul Trucks

The haul truck selected for the Project will be a rigid frame mining truck with a payload of  46 tonnes.  This  size  truck  was  selected  since  it  matches  well  will  the production  requirements  and  results  in  a  manageable  fleet  size.  The  following parameters were used to calculate  the  number  of  trucks  required  to  carry  out  the mine plan. These parameters result in 5,244 working hours per year for each truck as is presented in Table 16.3.

<!-- image -->

- · Mechanical Availability - 85 %;
- · Utilization  -  90 %  (non-utilized  time  is  accrued  when  the  truck  is  not operating due to poor weather, blasting, excavator relocation and no operator available);
- · Nominal Payload - 46 tonnes (31 m  heaped); 3
- · Shift Schedule - Two (2), 12 hour shifts per day, seven (7) days per week;
- · Operational Delays - 80 min/shift (this includes 15 minutes for shift change, 15 minutes for equipment inspection, 40 minutes for lunch and coffee breaks and 10 minutes for fuelling). Fuelling will be carried out once every two (2) shifts for 20 minutes;
- · Job Efficiency - 90 % (54 min/h; this represents lost time due to queuing at the shovel and dump as well as interference on the haul road);
- · Rolling Resistance - 3 %.

Table: 16.3 - Truck Hours (h/y)

| Description         | Hours   | Details                                                |

| Operating           | 6,555   | Available hours minus standby hours                    |
| Operating Delays    | 728     | 80 min/shift                                           |
| Net Operating Hours | 5,826   | Operating hours minus operating delays                 |
| Working Hours       | 5,244   | 90 % of net operating hours (reflects job efficiency)  |

Haul routes were generated for each period of the mine plan to calculate the truck requirements.  These  haul  routes  were  imported  in  Talpac©,  a  commercially available  truck  simulation  software  package  that  Met-Chem  has  validated  with mining operations. Talpac© calculated the travel time required for a 46-tonne haul truck to complete each route.

Table 16.4 shows the various components of a truck's cycle time. The load time is calculated  using  a  hydraulic  excavator  with  a  6 m3  (13-tonne)  bucket  as  the loading unit. This size excavator which will be discussed in the following Section loads ore and waste rock in a 46-tonne haul truck in four (4) passes, five (5) for overburden.

1. Four (4) Passes @ 30 sec/pass.

Haul  productivities  (tonnes  per  work  hour)  were  calculated  for  each  haul  route using  the  truck  payload  and  cycle  time.  Table  16.5  shows  the  cycle  time  and productivity for the mineralization and waste haul routes in Year 4 as an example.

| Tailings   | 7.00                | 0.50                | 9.50                | 1.00                | 19.00               | 3.33           | 57             |

Truck hour requirements were calculated by applying the tonnages hauled to the productivity for each haul route.

A  fleet  of  three  (3)  trucks  is  required  during  pre-production  and  Year 1.  This number increases to four (4) in Year 2, five (5) in Year 5 and reaches a peak of seven (7) in Year 8.

## b) Excavators

The main loading machine selected for the Project will be a hydraulic excavator (backhoe) with a 6 m  bucket. To maximize loading productivity, the excavators 3 will be placed on top of the muck pile and the haul trucks will be at the bottom of the loading face.

Even though one (1) excavator can handle the amount of tonnages in the mine plan, a second machine will be included in the fleet to assist with ore blending and as a backup when the primary machine will be unavailable.

A  wheel  loader  has  been  included  in  the  fleet  to  for  re-handling  from  the  ore stockpile to the crusher. This machine will also be equipped with a tire handler attachment for truck maintenance.

## c) Drilling and Blasting

Production drilling will be carried out with diesel powered track mounted down the  hole  (' DTH ')  drills. Using  the  following  parameters;  85 %  mechanical availability, 70 %  utilization and a penetration rate of 35 m/h, Met-Chem calculated that one (1) drill will be sufficient to complete the drilling requirements for  the  mine  plan.  However,  a  second  drill  has  been  added  to  the  fleet  to  offer more flexibility and to account for when the primary machine will be unavailable. Table 16.6 presents the drilling and blasting parameters for both production and pre-shear  holes  that  have  been  designed  for  the  Feasibility  Study.  Pre-shear drilling and blasting techniques will be used for the development of the final pit walls and will be completed with the same DTH drills. The table shows one (1) value  for  both  ore  and  waste  rock  since  the  two  (2)  rock  types  have  relatively similar densities.

Table 16.6 - Open Pit Drilling and Blasting Parameters

| Parameter          | Units    | Production   | Pre- Shearing   |
|--------------------|----------|--------------|-----------------|
| Bench Height       | m        | 10           | 10              |
| Blasthole Diameter | mm       | 114          | 75              |
| Burden             | m        | 3.1          | n/a             |
| Spacing            | m        | 3.2          | 1.8             |
| Subdrilling        | m        | 1.0          | 0.6             |
| Stemming           | m        | 2.1          | 0.6             |
| Explosives Density | g/cm   3 | 1.20         | 1.18            |
| Powder Factor      | kg/t     | 0.37         | n/a             |
| Shear Factor       | kg/m   2 | n/a          | 0.61            |

The blasting will be carried out with bulk emulsion and non-electric detonators. Met-Chem evaluated the use of either ANFO or bulk emulsion and even though bulk emulsion was 10 % more costly, it was selected for the following reasons:

- · Performs better under wet loading conditions;
- · Produces less residual ammonia;
- · Overall better fragmentation.

The bulk emulsion will be transported to site in 20,000 kg tankers and offloaded and  stored  at  the  transfer  site.  The  Feasibility  Study  includes  the  supply  of electricity to the transfer site to account for heating in the winter months. Two (2) additional  sites  have  been  allocated  for  the  storage  of  the  explosive  caps  and detonators as well as for packaged explosive products. The three (3) facilities will be located on the northwest side of the open pit, to the south of Stream C. They are  shown  on  Figure  16.2.  The  site  selection  meets  the  minimum  distance requirements  as  specified  by  Natural  Resources  Canada  Explosives  Regulatory

<!-- image -->

Division. These same three (3) facilities will be used for the underground mining operation.

In order to carry out the blasting operation for the open pit, the mine equipment fleet includes a bulk truck and a powder truck. The mine workforce also includes two (2)  blasting  crews  which  will  work  on  the  day  shift.  Each  crew  includes  a blaster, a blaster's helper and a bulk truck operator.

All  of  the  costs  associated  with  the  purchase,  storage  and  loading  of  the explosives were included in the mine capital and operating cost estimate presented in Section 21.0.

## 16.2.8 Mine Manpower Requirements

The  manpower  requirements  for  the  mine  have  been  divided  into  Engineering  / Supervision and Mine Operations. The Engineering / Supervision staff will work on the day shift only, while the Mine Operations staff will work on the day and night shift to provide 24 h/d coverage (except for the blasting crew as was discussed above). All of the  mine  employees  will  work  on  a  2 weeks  on,  2 weeks  off  rotation.  Several  of  the operators will remain during the underground mining operation to operate the fleet of support equipment.

The total mine manpower requirements during peak production is expected to reach 101 employees. Table 16.7 shows the mine manpower requirement during peak production.

## 16.3 Underground Mining

## 16.3.1 Underground Mining Method

The  ore  extraction  will  switch  form  an  open  pit  operation  to  an  underground  mine located underneath the final pit floor. The duration of the underground mining will be six (6) years and is scheduled to be in operation from the beginning of Year 21 to the end  of  Year  26.  An  underground  mine  production  ramp  up  period  of  4  months  is planned during the last months of Year 20 to reach the cruising production rate of 1.2 M tonnes of ROM at the beginning of Year 21. The duration period of the development of the underground mine is planned for 20 months starting at the beginning of Year 19.

The underground mine development and operation will be given to a mining contractor that will excavate and haul the ore and waste from underground to a stockpile located at the bottom of the open pit. The Owner will keep management and engineering activities to supervise  and  provide  engineering  services  to  the  contractor  to  ensure  work efficiency and safety. Hauling of the ore and waste from the bottom of the pit to the crusher and the waste disposal area along with the mine tailings operation will continue to be managed directly by the Owner's personnel using the existing mobile equipment fleet  from  the  open  pit  operation.  The  underground mine will be operated on two (2) shifts of ten (10) hours, seven (7) days per week.

The mining methodology selected is 30-metre high long-hole type stopes. Based on the favorable  geotechnical  and  hydrogeological  conditions,  backfilling  of  the  excavated stopes  will  not  be  required.  However,  in  order  to  ensure  the  rock  mass  stability  and work safety within the underground excavation zone, four (4) central stope pillars will be  maintained  until  the  last  stages  of  the  operation.  The  very  last  excavation  phase consists of mining the 30-metre thick remaining crown pillar from the open pit floor.

The  mine  design  is  purposely  kept  as  simple  as  possible  in  order  to  minimize  the development capital expenditure due to the short period of six (6) years of the remaining life  of  mine  of  the  Project.  Halfway  down  in  the  western  area  of  the  open  pit,  an underground entry portal to a main ramp driven downward will provide access to the six (6)  horizontal  haulage  drifts  which  in  turn  provides  access  to  the  draw  points  of  the various stopes.

## a) Stoping Method

The  longhole  stoping  mining  method  is  selected  for  the  ore  extraction  located underneath the crown pillar. The stope dimensions along the longitudinal axis will be 30-m long and 30-m of height. The stope width dimension varies between 15 m and  78 m  depending  on  the  thickness  of  the  mineralized  zone.  Figure  16.6 illustrates the stope mining method with a longitudinal and cross sections.

<!-- image -->

Figure: 16.6 - Longitudinal and Cross Sections of the Stope

<!-- image -->

An access drift connecting the upper portion of the stope to the haulage drift will give access to the drilling and blasting crews while the access drift connecting to the bottom portion of the stope to the haulage drift will enable the reclaiming of the shot ore.

## b) Production Rate

The evaluation of the required work force, equipment and mining cost, is based on the following criteria's of the underground mine work schedule, annual production requirement, mill recovery and concentrate grade.

## i) Work Schedule

The underground mine work schedule will be similar to the open pit operation and based on the following parameters:

- -Fifty  (50)  weeks  per  year  (with  a  planned  mine  shut  down  period  of  2 weeks);
- -Seven (7) days per week;
- -Two (2) shifts of 12 hours per day for the development period (Phase I);
- -Two (2) shifts of ten (10) hours per day for the production period (Phase II).

## ii) Annual Production Requirement

The annual production requirement will be the same as during the open pit period with yearly lithium concentrate production ranging from 188 to 240 kt (1.2 to 1.4 Mt/y of ore). An  overlapping underground mine ramp-up production period of four (4) months with a target ROM production of 300 kt will be planned with the open pit ore extraction finishing at the end of Year 20. This will ensure an uninterrupted ROM feed to the concentrator.

<!-- image -->

## 16.3.2 Underground Development

## a) Main Ramp

The main ramp dimensions were selected at 5 m x 5 m with a 15 % grade. The main ramp connects the portal at elevation 188 m to the lowermost haulage drift located at elevation 37 m.  As shown in Figure 16.7, the main ramp dimensions will  be  designed  to  provide  sufficient  provision  to  accommodate  the  largest production  equipment  which  is  the  50-tonnes  haul  truck  along  with  secondary ventilation duct (diameter of 1.52 m). The overall length of the ramp will be 1,274 metres.

Figure 16.7 - Main Ramp Cross Section

<!-- image -->

## b) Haulage Drifts

A total of six (6) haulage drifts will be developed at a 30-metre interval along the vertical axis. The haulage drifts will be located on the footwall side of the orebody at an average of 30 m from the mineralization contact. The drift dimensions and wall supporting method will be the same as the main ramp. The elevation location and lengths of the haulage drifts are:

- · Haulage Drift @ Elevation Level 187 m: Total length = 86 m;
- · Haulage Drift @ Elevation Level 157 m: Total length = 815 m;
- · Haulage Drift @ Elevation Level 127 m: Total length = 730 m;
- · Haulage Drift @ Elevation Level 97 m: Total length = 690 m;
- · Haulage Drift @ Elevation Level 67 m: Total length = 470 m;
- · Haulage Drift @ Elevation Level 37 m: Total length = 190 m.

Figure 16.8 to Figure 16.13 show the plan views of sub-levels 187, 157, 127, 97, 67 and 37 respectively.

## c) Ore Access Drift and Drawpoints

Ore access drifts will be 5 m x 5 m (similar to the main ramp and haulage drifts) and will be excavated perpendicularly between  the haulage drift and the mineralization contact. Their length will be approximately 30-metres and each one of the drift will be space at every 30-metre along the length of the haulage drift. These ore accesses will be used for the drilling and blasting of the stopes as well as being used as drawpoints during production.

## d) Ventilation Raises

The main ventilation raise air intake will be slightly inclined (60 degrees from the horizontal)  from  the  ground  surface  down  to  elevation  157 m.  Its  cross  section area  will  be  circular  with  a  diameter  of  3.35 m.  The  remaining  intermediate  air intake raises segments will be vertical with a square cross section of 3 m x 3 m that  connects  the  haulage  drifts  from  level  157 m  down  to  level  37 m.  Figure 16.14 illustrates the details of the main ventilation raise intake wall support.

Figure 16.14 - Main Ventilation Raise Air Intake Wall Support

<!-- image -->

The main ventilation air exhaust is vertical with a circular (diameter of 3.35 m) cross  section  that  connects  the  haulage  drift  level  157 m  to  the  final  exit  point located  at  elevation  215 m.    The  remaining  intermediate  air  exhaust  segments raises will be vertical with a square cross section of 3 m x 3 m that connects the haulage drifts from level 157 m down to level 97 m.

## 16.3.3 Geotechnical Parameters

## a) Geotechnical Parameters

The geotechnical characteristics of the open pit rock mass has been used for the assesment of the underground mine features and ground support. On the basis that no known major geological structure and a low quantity of water inflow will be

<!-- image -->

encountered  in  the  underground  area,  the  following  geotechnical  considerations have been applied in the mine design and mining sequence:

- · Four (4) vertical pillar located in the middle of the longitudinal section will be required during the excavation activities.
- · The distance between these vertical pillars will vary between 120 and 150 m.
- · The crown pillar thickness will be 30 metres.
- · Ground support in the hangingwall of each stope will be required. A fan type tensioned cable spaced at every four (4) metres along the longitudinal axis of the stope is recommended;
- · Similarly to the stope hangingwall, ground support in the vertical pillars will be required.

## b) Instrumentation

Ground movement instrumentation installation  is  recommended  and  will  enable monitoring of the rock mass behavior in the hanging wall and the pillars.

## c) Ground support

The main ramp, drifts, and ventilation raises will be supported to prevent ground falls.  A  provision  for  ground  support  has  been  made  for  safety/lunch  rooms, sumps,  explosives  and  detonators  magazines,  maintenance  shops,  fueling  bays, and  electrical  stations.  Stopes  will  require  ground  support  in  the  hanging  wall. Vertical  pillars  will  also  require  ground  support  as  they  will  be  subject  to  the blasting activities in adjacent zones. The ground support methods presented below are typical in underground mines in Northern Quebec.

## i) Main Ramp and Drift Support

The ramp and drifts will be supported by rings of bolts spaced at 1.2 metres along the length of the excavation. The rings of bolts will consist of five (5) resined rebars eight (8) ft long at the back and six (6) split sets six (6) ft long on the walls. Galvanized welded wire mesh gauge-6 will be installed at the back  andon  the  walls  down  to  1.4  metres  from  the  floor.  Figure  16.15 illustrate a cross section of the supporting system.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Figure: 16.15 - Ramp and Drift Wall Support System

<!-- image -->

## ii) Main Ventilation Intake Raise

The  main  ventilation  intake  raise  will  be  supported  with  five  (5)  ft  long resined  rebars  installed  on  a  1.2 m  x  1.2 m  pattern  and  galvanized  welded wire  mesh  gauge-9  secured  by  three  (3)  ft  split  sets  installed  on  a  1.2 m  x 1.2 m pattern.

## 16.3.4 Hydrogeological Parameters and Mine Dewatering

## a) Hydrogeological Parameters

The  estimation  of  water  inflow  in  the  underground  mine  was  performed  by Richelieu  Hydrogéologie in  2012  and  2014.  This  information  was  used  for  the calculation of the installed pumping capacity during the underground life of mine.

## b) Mine Dewatering

The permanently installed water pumping capacity at the start of the underground operation in Year 20 is 96 m /h. The pumping capacity will be increased to reach 3 105  m /h  at  the  end  of  the  underground  operation  in  Year 26  by  integrating 3 additional pumps during the underground life of mine. The mining contractor will supply and install the permanent and temporary pumping stations in the mine in the following locations:

- · Permanent pumping station on Level 157 with a room dimension of 20 m x 6 m  near  the  ventilation  raise  equipped  with  two  (2)  stationary  permanent pumps  of  100 hp  and  (1)  stationary  provision  for  an  additional  pump  of 100 hp  for  back  up  and  increased  capacity  needs  each  expulsing  the  clear water  toward  the  surface  through  piping  installed  in  the  intake  ventilation raise.
- · Permanent pumping station on Level 67 with a room dimension of 20 m x 6 m  near  the  ventilation  raise  equipped  with  one  (1)  stationary  permanent

<!-- image -->

pump  of  100   hp  and  (1)  stationary  provision  for  an  additional  pump  of 100 hp for  back  up  and  increased  capacity  needs  expulsing  the  clear  water toward the Level 157 pumping station.

- · Permanent  pumping  station  on  Level 37  for  the  dirty  water  located  at  a slightly  extended end of the ramp with one (1) submersible pump of 30 hp and (1) provision for an additional submersible pump of 30 hp for back up and increased capacity needs expulsing the clear water upward to the water reservoir  of  Level 67.  The  mud  will  be  cleaned,  reclaimed  and  disposed  at regular intervals.
- · There will be one (1) 100 hp pump and two (2) 30 hp submersible pumps for back-ups in case of failures or temporary pumping needs.

## 16.3.5 Drilling and Blasting

## a) Stopes

An access drift connecting the upper portion of the stope to the haulage drift will give access for the drilling and blasting crews while an access drift connecting to the bottom portion of the stope to the haulage drift will enable mucking of the shot ore.

The powder factor used for blasting in the underground confined conditions will be  0.52  kg/tonne  with  emulsion  explosive  products.  The  drill  hole  diameter selected is 154 mm in order to minimize hole deviations. The drill hole pattern is characterized by series of fan-type hole rings spaced at every 4.0 m along the long axis of the stope. Figure 16.16 illustrates the drill ring pattern planned to be used for  the  stopes.  The  explosive  product  selected  will  be  bulk  emulsions  with electronic detonators.

Figure 16.16 - Drill Ring Pattern for the Stope

<!-- image -->

## b) Crown Pillar

The mining method selected for blasting the crown pillar will be to drill and blast the  30-metre-thick  pillar  from  the  pit  floor.  The  crown  pillar  will  be  shot  in sequence of large blast of 200,000 to 300,000 tonnes with a progression starting from  one  end  of  the  pillar  towards  the  other  end.  The  drilling  and  blasting equipment and technique used will be the same as the open pit mining apart from a higher powder factor due to the more confined condition inherent to a single free face blast. The powder factor will be 0.39 kg/tonne using 114 mm diameter holes on  a  drill  pattern  of  3 m  (burden)  x  3 m  (spacing)  with  a  5 m  stemming  in  the collar. The selected explosives will be bulk emulsion with electronic detonators. Pre-shear  drilling  and  blasting  is  planned  along  the  mineralization  contacts  on each  side  of  the  ore  to  reduce  the  dilution.  The  pre-shear  holes  will  be  75 mm diameter spaced at every 1.8 m and will be drilled by the pit production drill. The main  explosive  products used for pre-shearing will be detonator sensitive cartridges and detonating cord.

## 16.3.6 Underground Mine Planning

An underground mining contractor will be selected to perform the underground mine development and production phases. The Owner's administration staff and engineering teams  pertaining  to  the  underground  mine  will  manage  the  mining  contractor  during these phases.

## a) Development Phase

The proposed work schedule for the development of the underground mine is two (2)  12-hour  shifts  per  day,  seven  (7)  days  per  week.  The  underground  mine development  schedule  was  developed  such  that  there  will  be  a  4-month  period overlap between the end of the open pit production and the full production regime of  the  underground  operation.  Approximately  300,000  tonnes  of  ore  will  be planned to be excavated from the underground mine and temporarily stored at the bottom  of  the  mine  as  a  mean  to  mitigate  the  possible  lower  production  rate associated with the start-up of the underground mine. The ore stockpile will be processed during Year 21 of the life of mine.

The  main  ramp  will  be  the  first  underground  infrastructure  to  be  developed. Additional  equipment  such  as  jumbo  drills,  alimak,  raise  borers,  etc.  will  be brought  into  the  mine  as  needed  for  the  development  of  the  underground infrastructures such as the haulage drifts and ventilation raises once they become available for their excavation. The following production rates have been used to calculate the underground mine development schedule:

- · Ramp and haulage drift = 5 m/day;
- · Ventilation intake and exhaust raise excavation = 3 m/day;
- · Ventilation intake and exhaust raise construction = 3 m/day;
- · Ventilation raise access drift excavation = 3 m/day.

Table  16.8  presents  the  breakdown  of  the  underground  infrastructure  linear metres,  number  of  units,  unit  costs  and  the  cross  sectional  dimensions.  Figure 16.17 presents the underground mine development schedule.

## b) Production Phase

A  simplified  grid  system  has  been  developed  for  mine  planning  extracting sequence of the various stopes as shown on Figure 16.18. The mining sequence takes into consideration of the crown pillar and the Stope Blocks 11, 16, 21 and 27,  that  will  be  mined  in  the  last  three  (3)  years  of  the  operation  to  ensure workplace and mine safety.

## 16.3.8 Underground Mine Services

## a) Mine Ventilation / Heating

The  estimated  quantity  of  air  to  be  injected  into  the  main  intake  raise  is 250,000 cfm at a pressure of 10 inches of water. The estimation is based on a ratio of 125 cfm / horse power of diesel powered equipment planned to be used in the underground mine including a contingency amount.

The  ventilation  system  will  be  equipped  with  an  air  heater  installed  on  surface above the air intake raise entry to push heated air into the underground mine. Air flowing through the various drifts will be controlled with ventilation doors.

The ventilation and heating system consists of two (2) parallel fans designed to deliver  280,000  cfm  at  10.3  inches  of  water  of  static  pressure.  The  two  (2)

ventilators will run simultaneously. Each ventilator is characterized by one 350 hp motor  driving  a  fan  at  a  speed  of  18,000  rpm.  Figure  16.19  illustrates  the ventilation system.

Figure 16.19 - Plan view of the ventilation and heating system

<!-- image -->

## b) Electrical Power Distribution

The electrical power distribution to the underground mine is characterized by an interconnection point between Nemaska Lithium and Hydro-Québec 25 kV line. From there on, an aerial electrical power line brings the 6.5 MVA / 1,200A power to the main ventilator and into the air intake ventilator shaft to the electrical room located  on  the  157 m  level  haulage  drift  where  will  be  located  the  2.66  MVA electrical sub-station. From this point on, the mining contractor will hook up the required cable network and other electrical sub-stations to supply the power to its equipment. The planned power requirements will be 866 kW (1,161 hp) during the development phase and 1,416 kW (1,898 hp) during the production phase.

## c) Compressed Air

Compressed air will be required underground for various services (fans, cylinders, pumps,  jacklegs,  stoppers  production  drill,  etc).  The  compressed  air  will  be supplied underground via pipes in the intake raise and connecting to each level. The  mining  contractor  will  supply  electric  air  compressors  to  generate  the estimated  3,000  cfm  requirement.  The  compressors  will  be  located  in  a  shelter near the main ventilation intake raise collar.

## d) Maintenance

A maintenance shop of 6.0 m x 7.5 m x 30 m will be constructed and equipped for light  maintenance purposes such as regular servicing programs and small repairs. The  maintenance  bay  will  be  equipped  with  fully  portable  oil  containers  and dispenser,  a  greasing  station  and  a  20  litres  oil  container,  all  equipped  with  fire suppression, reel and hoses.

## e) Fueling Facility

One fueling station 6.0 m x 7.5 m x 30 m will be excavated and set-up off Level 157 m  haulage  drift  to  supply  diesel  for  the  underground  mine  equipment.  The fueling station is characterized by a dual portable 20,000-gallon container with a dispenser with reels, hoses and fire suppressors.

## f) Lunch Room and Refuge Station

A lunch room / refuge station will be located at the entry of Level 157 m haulage drift. Its dimensions will be 4.0 m x 4.0 m x 25 m.

## g) Explosives and Detonator Magazine

The explosive magazine will be located in a dedicated excavated area off the main ramp near Level 127 m haulage drift. The magazine dimensions will be 3.6 m x 5 m x 9 m and wil belocated at the end of a 24-metre long drift. A concrete wall with  a  2-metre  wide  steel  door  will  seal  and  protect  the  entry  of  the  explosive storage area. The magazine will have a capacity of 24,000 kg of explosives.

The detonator  room  will  be  located  in  a  dedicated  excavated  area  off  the  main ramp near Level 67 m haulage drift. The room dimensions will be 3.6 m x 5.0 m x 4.5 m and will be located at the end of a 24-metre long drift. A concrete wall with a  2-metre  wide  steel  door  will  seal  and  protect  the  entry  point  of  the  explosive storage to store 20,000 detonator units.

## 16.3.9 Underground Manpower

The  underground  mine  manpower  is  broken  down  into  the  Owner's  and  mining contractor personnel.

## a) Owner Personnel

The  Owner  will  manage  the  underground  mine  along  with  the  mine  tailings operations. This will be done by the following three (3) departments:

- · Mine operations;
- · Mine engineering;
- · Mine tailings.

A  total  of  52  to  56  employees  including  the  number  of  shifts  and  rotations requirements  is  planned  during  the  underground  mine  development  and  the production phase.

<!-- image -->

## b) Mining Contractor Personnel

The  mining  contractor  will  supply  the  manpower  to  operate  the  underground mine. This includes the maintenance functions for the various equipment supplied by  the  contractor  and  the  Owner.  The  mining  contractor's  superintendent  and supervisors will liaise  with  the  Owner's  chief  and  mine  engineers  to  ensure  the adequate  quality,  production  rate,  safety  and  development  of  the  underground mining operation.

Seventy (70) employees will be required for the development phase while 44 will be  required  during  the  production  phase.  This  number  includes  the  requirement for  shifts  and  rotations.  Table  16.13  displays  the  underground  mine  manpower requirement.

## 17.0 RECOVERY METHODS

Section 13.0  of  this  Report  described  the  metallurgical  test  work  and  how  the  results were used to derive the preliminary Process Flow sheet (' PF ') and mass balance. The process design has been split in two (2) locations. The concentrator plant will be located at Whabouchi  and  the  Hydrometallurgical  Plant  will  be  located  at  Salabery-deValleyfield.

General processing plant descriptions of various areas are provided. This information serves  as  input  information  for  the  development  of  the  capital  and  operating  cost estimates presented in Section 21.0.

## 17.1 Whabouchi Processing Plant - 216,485 Concentrate Tonnes per Year

The Spodumene concentrate will be recovered in two (2) systems. The DMS separators will recover 14.2 % by weight, while the flotation will recover 7.2 % by weight for a total of 21.4 % weight recovery.

The  processing  facility  or  concentrator  consists  of  a  crushing  area,  beneficiation  and dewatering areas.

The  concentrator  will  be  designed  to  produce  a  spodumene  concentrate  containing 6.0 % Li2O or 74.7 % spodumene (LiAlSi2O6), from an ore containing 1.53 % Li2O. To achieve  this  concentration  the  beneficiation  processes  include  crushing,  dense  media separation, grinding, flotation and magnetic separation. Further the facility will perform filtration, drying and  material handling, including storage and  loading of dried spodumene  concentrate  on  road  trucks.  The  plant  production  is  set  at  216,485  dry tonnes of spodumene concentrate per year.

## 17.1.1 Process Design Criteria

All throughput rates were based on the production of 216,485 dry tonnes of 6.0 % Li O 2 spodumene  concentrate  from  a  feed  grade  of  1.53 %  Li O.  The  weight  recovery  of 2 21.4 % and the spodumene recovery of 83.8 % were average figures based on the pilot plant test work results and may change depending on the ore composition.

The Whabouchi concentrator will operate 24 hours per day, seven (7) days per week, 52 weeks  per  year.  The  concentrator  operating  availability  will  be  92 %  except  for  the crusher will be at 60.0 %.  The concentrator capacity has been established at an average rate of 2,775 dry tonnes per day or a nominal throughput rate of 125.7 dry tonnes of ore per hour.

The crusher and concentrator have been sized to meet the parameters in Table 17.1.

## 17.1.3 Flow Sheets and Process Description

Simplified flow sheets are presented in Figure 17.2, Figure 17.3 and Figure 17.4. These flow sheets are indicative of the process. The crushing facility can operate independent from  the  concentrator.  The  concentrator  has  three  (3)  distinct  areas,  dense  media separation, flotation and dewatering. Figure 17.2 shows the crusher and the dense media concentration.  The  dry  magnetic  separation  is  considered  a  part  of  this  separation process  as  only  the  dense  media  concentrate  will  be  dried  and  undergo  dry  magnetic separation.  Figure  17.3  shows  the  beneficiation  by  flotation.  Figure  17.4  shows  the dewatering and storage of spodumene concentrate and tailings.

These simplified flow sheets are very general. The detailed description of the process areas follow below.

## a) Crushing

There will be accommodation for a seven (7) day run of mine ore stockpile at the crusher.  The  crushing  will  be  split  in  two  (2)  areas,  primary  crushing  and  fine crushing, see Figure 17.2.

The ROM ore, containing 19.1 % spodumene with a moisture content of 5 %, will be dumped onto a material feeder by the mine haul trucks. The material feeder transports the ore via a hopper and grizzly feeder underneath the hopper into the jaw  crusher.  The  jaw  crusher  breaks  the  ore  and  the  broken  material  will  be transported via conveyor  to  a  fine ore crushing  facility. The  jaw  crusher discharges rock with a particle size distribution of 80 % less than (P 80 ) 140 mm.

The fine crushing facility consists of a double deck vibrating screen and two (2) cone  crushers.  The  broken  jaw  crusher  ore  gets  screened  by  the  double  deck screen. The double deck screen will have top deck openings of 40 mm and bottom deck  openings  will  be  9.5 mm.  The  top  deck  oversize  reports  to  the  secondary cone crusher, the bottom deck oversize reports to the tertiary crusher, while the bottom  deck  undersize  at  a  particle  size  distribution  of  80 %  less  than  (P 80 ) 6.0 mm will be conveyed to the fine ore bin in the concentrator building.

The secondary crusher will be a standard cone crusher that crushes the top deck oversize to a P 80 of  18 mm. The tertiary crusher will be short head cone crusher that crushes the bottom deck oversize to a P 80 of 8.5 mm. Both crusher discharges will be re-directed to the double deck vibrating screen via two (2) conveyors.

## b) Dense Media Separation

Ore  will  be  withdrawn  from  the  fine  ore  bin  using  two  (2)  belt  feeders,  both operating at 50 % capacity. The belt feeders transfer the finely crushed ore via a conveyor  to  a  wet  double  deck  vibrating  screen  located  in  the  concentrator building. This double deck vibrating screen has a top deck with 2.0 mm openings and a bottom deck with 0.63 mm openings. The top deck is to protect the bottom deck from coarse gravel damage. The screen undersize goes to the grinding and flotation circuit. Both top deck and bottom oversize report to the DMS.

The DMS is a gravity concentrator that uses fine ferrosilicon as dense medium to enhance  the  separation  of  the  ore  by  specific  gravity.  The  fine  ferrosilicon  in water  behaves  like  a  heavy  liquid.  The  apparent  specific  gravity  of  this  'heavy liquid' will be controlled by the water addition to ferrosilicon. The material with the higher specific gravity will be referred to as sinks (concentrate), while the less dense material will be floats (tailings).

The Whabouchi concentrator design will be based on a multi-stage dense media separator unit.  The  unit  produces  three  (3)  sinks  and  one  (1)  floats  stream.  The floats  will  be  DMS  tailings.  Sinks  #3  will  be  considered  middling  and  will  be transported by conveyor to the ball mill. Sinks #1 and Sinks #2 will be combined and form the DMS concentrate. Next the DMS concentrate will be transported to the dryer. Sinks #2 will have to option to report as middlings in full or in part, when required.

The sinks and floats will be separated from the dense medium using wash screens. The ferrosilicon recovery will be further enchanced using low intensity magnetic separators.

## c) Drying and Magnetic Separation

The DMS concentrate will be dried in a rotary dryer to a moisture content of less than 2 %, as dry magnetic separation requires free flowing material. The first step in magnetics removal will be low intensity magnetic separation using 950 Gauss; the  second  step  will  be  high  intensity  magnetic  separation  at  7,200  Gauss.  The final DMS concentrate is expected to contain 5.83 % Li O. 2

## d) Grinding

The grinding circuit will be the first part of the Whabouchi flotation circuit. The ball  mill  circuit  is  required  to  liberate  the  finer  spodumene  particles.  The  DMS Sinks #3 enters the ball mill directly via the ball mill feed conveyor, while DMS screen undersize will be combined with the ball mill discharge. The combined ball mill discharge will be pumped to the ball mill screen, composed of one (1) set of 5-Stack-sizer screens. These screens will have apertures of 300 µm. The screen oversize  reports to the ball mill. The  screen  undersize,  at  a particle size distribution of 80 % less than (P 80 ) 174 µm, will be pumped to the mica flotation circuit.

<!-- image -->

## e) Mica Flotation

The  mica  flotation  circuit  consists  of  slime  removal  and  mica  flotation.  Slimes will be removed using de-sliming cyclones; hereafter the cyclones overflow will be send to tailings. The cyclone underflow will be conditioned and mica will be floated with AERO 3030C.

The mica flotation will be a reverse flotation where the floated material will be considered tailings.  There  will  be  two  (2)  stages  of  mica  flotation.  The  rougher and scavenger mica flotation are to remove as much liberated mica as possible. The  cleaner  flotation  stage,  which  receives  the  combined  mica  rougher  and scavenger concentrates, releases the entrained spodumene particles back into the beneficiation process. The mica cleaner concentrate goes to the tailings thickener. The scavenger and cleaner tailings go to the attrition circuit for further processing.

## f) De-sliming, Attrition and Wet Magnetic Separation

This circuit will be mainly for the removal of more deleterious tailings prior to spodumene flotation. This circuit starts with more slime removal. A second set of cyclones remove fines from the slurry, as not all fines will be removed during the first cyclone  de-sliming  step.  The  attrition  step  is  to  loosen  tenacious  fine particles. A dispersant will be added to enhance loosening of the fines.

During  the  test  work  magnetic  separation  was  performed  on  the  spodumene concentrate. This magnetic separation step has been moved forward in the process as  this  physical  magnetic  separation  of  spodumene  concentrate  will  be  more difficult as compared  to  spodumene  flotation  feed.  Spodumene  concentrate contains  large  quantities  of  fatty  acids  which  would  stick  to  the  drum  by  other than  magnetic  forces.  To  remove  the  fatty  acids  a  sulphuric  acid  conditioning system would be required.

The  third  sets  of  cyclones  constitute  the  final  de-sliming  phase  and  the  high density for spodumene conditioning.

## g) Spodumene Flotation

The  spodumene  flotation  circuit  uses  a  spodumene  collector,  LR19,  which  is  a blend of four (4) reagents; FA-2, AERO 855, diesel fuel and MIBC. The circuit starts with two (2) stages of high density conditioning. High density conditioning is a process  requirement  to  obtain  the  proper  flotation  results.  Spodumene flotation will be a standard rougher-cleaner flotation process. The spodumene will be floated using LR19 to produce a rougher concentrate. The rougher concentrate undergoes  2-stage  cleaning  to  produce  a  6.34 %  Li O  high  grade  spodumene 2 concentrate. The cleaner flotation concentrate will be pumped to the concentrate thickener.

## h) Spodumene Concentrate Dewatering and Storage

Spodumene  cleaner  flotation  concentrate  will  be  thickened  to  62 %  solids  in  a high  capacity  thickener.  The  thickened  concentrate  will  be  then  filtered  to  8 % moisture  using  a  vertical  plate  pressure  filter.  The  filtered  concentrate  will  be

<!-- image -->

dropped  on  the  same  conveyor  as  the  dried  DMS  concentrate.  The  blend  of filtered and DMS concentrate drop into a 12-hour spodumene concentrate storage bin.

Road haul trucks transport the concentrate to the train terminal for rail transport to Salaberry-de-Valleyfield.  Due  to  the  low  moisture  level  in  the  concentrate  no shipping precautions will be required to prevent freezing.

## i) Tailings Dewatering and Storage

Tailings from several locations in the plant will be thickened to 61 % solids in a high  capacity  thickener.  The  thickened  tailings  will  be  then  filtered  to  6 % moisture using a vertical plate pressure filter. The filtered tailings will be dropped on the same conveyor and the DMS float (DMS tailings). The blend of filtered and DMS tailings drop into a 4-hour tailings storage bin.

Mine  haul  trucks  transport  the  tailings  to an  onsite tailings disposal area concentrate no shipping precautions will be required.

## 17.1.4 Whabouchi Processing Plant - Equipment Sizing and Selection

The  equipment  selection  was  based  on  the  fulfillment  of  the  design  criteria.  The equipment  list  was  prepared  and  the  equipment  was  sized  according  to  the  design criteria developed from the flow sheet drawings and the mass balance. The design factor for crushing equipment was set at 30 %, for most of pieces of processing equipment the design factor was set at 20 % and 5 % for slurry pumps.

## a) Primary Crushing

Crushing takes place in two (2) separate crusher light structures with canvas roofs. For  cost  reduction,  preference  was  given  to  a  modular  concept.  As  primary crusher,  a  jaw  crusher  is  the  most  appropriate  crusher  for  this  facility  based  on throughput rate and cost.

The primary crushing structure houses the jaw crusher. Run of mine ore will be hauled  from  the  open  pit  mine.  The  mine  haul  trucks  dump  directly  onto  the material feeder. This 17 m long and 1.8 m wide variable speed drive feeder drops the ore in a surge hopper. A vibrating grizzly feeder meters the ore in one 800 mm × 1200 mm - 132 kW jaw crusher. The primary crushed product has a particle size distribution of 80 % less than (P 80 ) 140 mm. The crusher ore will be transported to the fine ore crushing facility. This second structure covers the crusher vibrating screen and the secondary and tertiary cone crushers.

## b) Secondary and Tertiary Crushing

A  double  deck  screen  combined  with  two  (2)  cone  crushers  are  the  most appropriate set-up for this facility and the size of crusher ore product required.

The  crushed  ore  from  the  jaw  crusher  will  be  transported  via  conveyors  to  the secondary  crushing  structure.  The  crushed  ore  will  be  classified  on  the  crusher vibrating  screen  consisting  of  one  (1)  1.83 m  wide × 4.88 m  long  double  deck

<!-- image -->

vibrating  screen  with  top  deck  screen  apertures  of  40 mm  and  the  bottom  deck screen apertures of 9.5 mm.

The top deck oversize will be crushed in the secondary cone crusher which will be one standard - 220 kW cone crusher producing crushed ore, at a P80 of 18 mm. The  discharge  from  this  crusher  will  be  recycled  back  to  the  crusher  vibrating screen.

The bottom deck oversize will be crushed in the tertiary cone crusher which will be one short head - 220 kW cone crusher and produces crushed ore at a P80 of 8.5 mm.  The  discharge  from  this  crusher  will  be  recycled  back  to  the  crusher vibrating screen.

The  crusher  vibrating  screen  undersize  will  have  a  P 80 of  6.0 mm  and  will  be transported by conveyor to the fine ore bin.

## c) Dense Media Separation

The multi-stage dense media separator has been shown to offer better performance compared  to other 1-stage, 2-product conventional dense medium  cyclone separators. From pilot plant testing, a 125 t/h DMS separator was selected. This unit will be a 3-stage, 500 mm diameter separator, and includes four (4) 1.8 m × 4.8 m dense single deck medium drain and wash screens and also a dense media recovery system. The 3-stage separator will operate stage 1 and stage 2, with high density circuits, stage 3 as a low density circuit. Stage 1 will operate at a D 50 cut point of SG of 2.97, whilst the stage 2 D 50 cut point will be at 2.85 SG. Stage 3 will operate at a low D 50 cut  point  of  2.69  SG.  Stage  3  sinks  will  be  middlings product and go to grinding and flotation. Stage 2 will have the option to report to middlings in full or in part or to the concentrate.

It  is  estimated  that  the  DMS plant will require 0.9 tonne ferrosilicon per day to maintain the proper dense media operating levels in the circuit.

## d) Drying and Magnetic Separation

Based on test work results, dry magnetic separation was found to be efficient in upgrading  the  coarse  DMS  concentrate.  The  wet  magnetic  separation  method would be more difficult to use due to the coarse particle size.

The  DMS  concentrate  will  be  conveyed  to  a  1.83 m  diameter × 10.67 m  long rotary dryer equipped with a direct diesel burner providing 2.64 MW of heat.

The dry magnetic separation of DMS concentrate will be carried out in two (2) stages. In the first stage a 0.46 m diameter × 1.22 m wide rotating drum, with an 800  Gauss  ceramic  magnet,  will  be  used  as  Low  Intensity  Magnetic  Separator (' LIMS ')  and  in  the  second  stage  with  a  0.91 m  diameter × 0.91 m  width  rare earth magnetic separator drum will be used as High Intensity Magnetic Separator (' HIMS '). The  peak  magnetic  field  intensity  on  the  HIMS  drum  will  be approximately 7,200 gauss and will be effective in removing fine ferrous iron and many  paramagnetic  constituents.  The  final  DMS  concentrate  is  expected  to contain 5.83 % Li O. 2

## e) Grinding

The  grinding  circuit  will  include  a  ball  mill  operating  in  closed  circuit  with screening. The ball mill, a standard overflow discharge ball mill, 2.80 m diameter × 4.90 m long, with 485 kW motor with a variable frequency drive, will be used to grind the DMS middlings and DMS feed screen undersize in order to liberate the locked spodumene minerals before flotation stage. The coarse middlings will be conveyed directly into the ball mill, while the DMS feed screen undersize will be first reclassified by screening.

- A  5-deck  Stack-Sizer  screen,  1.21 m  wide × 1.52 m  long,  with  screen  panels having 300 µm apertures, will be used to produce a primary grind of 80 % passing 174 µm. The Stack-Sizer undersize stream will be pumped to cyclone cluster #1 for the first stage of de-sliming.

Cyclone cluster #1 consists of ten (10) cyclones of 102 mm diameter. The cyclone overflow  will  contain  1.1 % w/w  solids  and  the  cyclone  underflow  will  have 52.0 % w/w solids.

The ball  mill  sizing  was  based  on  the  bond  ball  mill  work  index  test  and  pilot plant  testing.  The  variable  speed  drive  was  selected  to  avoid  overgrinding. Stack-Sizer screens have been selected because of the relatively small foot print per screening area. The cyclones sizing was based on the optimal slime removal.

## f) Mica Flotation

The cyclone cluster #1underflow slurry will feed the conditioning tank by gravity, where  AERO  3030C  collector  and  fuel  oil  will  be  added  as  mica  flotation reagents. The conditioned slurry will overflow from the conditioning tank into the mica rougher flotation cells.

The  mica  flotation  circuit  consists  of  a  of  mica  rougher  flotation  conditioning tank, 2.5 m diameter × 3.0 m high, equipped with a 10 kW agitator. Mica rougher flotation consists of four (4) mechanical cells in series, 2.83 m  each. The rougher 3 tailings will be pumped to the mica scavenger conditioning tank, 2.5 m diameter × 3.0 m  high,  this  tank  will  be  equipped  with  a  10-kW  agitator.  Scavenger flotation  consists  of  two  (2)  mechanical  cells  in  series,  2.83  m   each.  The  mica 3 rougher and scavenger will be combined  and then pumped  into another conditioning tank, 1.5 m diameter × 2.0 m height. This conditioning tank will be required  prior  mica  cleaner  flotation  and  will  be  equipped  with  a  three  (3)  kW agitator. The cleaner flotation will consist of three (3) mechanical cells in series, 0.71 m  each. 3

Mica flotation circuit will be used to remove undesired mica from spodumene ore and  therefore  to  increase  the  final  spodumene  concentrate  grade.  The  flotation circuit was designed based on the pilot plant results.

## g) De-sliming, Attrition and Wet Magnetic Separation

As  mica  flotation uses the reversed flotation process, the combined  mica scavenger tailings and cleaner tailings will be pumped to a second cyclone cluster

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

for additional de-sliming. The de-sliming cyclone cluster # 2 consists of seven (7), 102 mm diameter, cyclones. The cyclone overflow will contain 1.4 % w/w solids and the cyclone underflow will have 55.0 % w/w solids, more than three-quarters (¾) of the slimes are expected to be removed after this step.

Attrition scrubbing is to clean the mineral surfaces and remove more slimes from the  mineral  surface.  The  cyclone  cluster  #2  underflow  will  discharge  into  the attrition circuit with six (6) attrition scrubber cells, 2.75 m  each, where dispersant 3 D618 and caustic soda will be added to aid with the losing  of  persistent  sticky fines.

The  attrition  scrubber  discharge  will  be  pumped  to  a  wet  magnetic  separation circuit to remove hornblende and other iron minerals. This will be carried out in two (2) steps, in the first step a 0.91 m diameter × 1.21 m wide counter rotation single drum magnetic separator will be used as LIMS at 950 Gauss. The second step  will  use  a  vertical  Wet  High  Intensity  Magnetic  Separator  (' WHIMS ')  at 12,000 Gauss, to remove paramagnetic material. Placing the magnetic separation stage  before  spodumene  flotation  will  have  the  benefits  of  removing  sulphuric acid  conditioning  step  in  order  for  LIMS  and  WHIMS  to  work.  Sulphuric  acid will be used to break down the fatty acid.

The magnetics concentrate from both LIMS and WHIMS will be combined and sent  to  the  tailings  thickeners,  while  WHIMS  non  magnetics  tailings  will  be further de-slimed in a third cyclone cluster.

This  cyclone  cluster  #3  will  be  required  to  ensure  thickening  for  high  density conditioning.  The  cyclone  cluster  #3  consists  of  six  (6),  102 mm  diameter, cyclones.  The  cyclone  overflow  will  contain  0.4 % w/w  solids  and  the  cyclone underflow will have 53.0 % w/w solids.

The attrition scrubber cells residence time was derived from pilot plant test work. The  magnetic  separators  were  sized  using  bench  scale  test  work  results.  The cyclones sizing was based on the optimal slime removal.

## h) Spodumene Flotation

Spodumene flotation circuit will be used to produce spodumene concentrate. The flotation circuit was designed based on the pilot plant results.

The  high  density  conditioning  is  a  requirement  for  spodumene  flotation  to succeed.  The  cyclone  cluster  #3  underflow  slurry  will  feed  the  high  density spodumene conditioning tank #1 by gravity, where LR19 collector and soda ash will  be  added  as  spodumene  flotation  reagents.  The  conditioned  slurry  will overflow  to  the high  spodumene  conditioning  tank  #2  where  conditioning continues. The two (2) high density spodumene conditioning tanks will be 2.0 m diameter × 2.0 m high, each equipped with a 5 kW agitator.

The overflow from spodumene condition tank will be diluted with process water to  obtain  the  correct  flotation  pulp  density  for  maximum  performance  in  the spodumene rougher flotation  cells.  Spodumene  rougher  flotation  will  consist  of four (4) mechanical cells in series, 2.83 m  each. The spodumene cleaner flotation 3

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

undergoes two (2) stages cleaning. The spodumene first cleaner flotation cells will consist of four (4) mechanical cells in series, 1.41 m  each, while the spodumene 3 second cleaner flotation cells will be five (5) mechanical cells in series, 0.71 m 3 each.  The  second  cleaner  concentrate  will  be  pumped  to  the  final  concentrate thickener.  The  spodumene  rougher  tailings  and  first  cleaner  tailings  will  be pumped to the final tailings thickener.

## i) Spodumene Concentrate Dewatering and Storage

The high rate concentrate thickener was sized based on sedimentation test work conducted  at  SGS.  Magnafloc  will  be  the  flocculant  that  will  be  added  to  the thickener. The filter press was sized by filtration test work as well.

The  spodumene  final  cleaner  concentrate  will  be  pumped  to  the  5-m  diameter concentrate  thickener.  The  thickener  overflow  will  be  pumped  to  the  process water  tank  for  recirculation  of  process  water,  while  the  concentrate  thickener underflow at 62 % solids will be pumped to spodumene concentrate holding tank 4.5 m diameter × 6.0 m high. The solids will be kept in suspension with a 15 kW agitator.

From the  holding  tank  the  concentrate  will  be  pumped  to  the  concentrate  filter press. The plate and frame filter press was sized based on filtration tests. The filter press will have a total filter area of 350 m . The filtrate will be re-circulated to the 2 spodumene concentrate thickener by a filtrate pump.

The filter  cake  at  8 %  moisture  will  be  combined  with  dryed  DMS  concentrate and stored in a 12-hour capacity spodumene concentrate storage bin before being trucked  to  the  train  terminal  for  rail  transport.  The  combined  moisture  will  be about 4 % and no special shipping arrangements will be made.

## j) Tailings Dewatering and Storage

The high rate  tailings  thickener  size  was  selected  based  on  sedimentation  tests. Magnafloc will  be  the  flocculant  that  will  be  added  to  the  thickener.  The  filter press was sized by filtration test work.

Various streams from the plant, including magnetic separator tailings from DMS recovery plant, overflow from de-sliming cyclone clusters, mica cleaner concentrate, magnetics from LIMS and WHIMS, rougher tailings and first cleaner tailings  from  spodumene  flotation  circuit  will  be  directed  to  the  10-m  diameter thickener.

The  thickener  overflow  will  be  pumped  to  the  process  water  tank,  while  the tailings thickener underflow at 61 % solids will be pumped to the tailings holding tank 7.5 m diameter × 7.5 m high.

From the holding tank, the tailings will be pumped to the tailings filter press. The plate and frame filter press was sized based on filtration tests. The filter press will have a total filter area of 338 m . The filtrate will be re-circulated to the tailings 2 thickener  by  a  filtrate  pump.  The  filter  cake  at  6 %  moisture  will  be  combined

<!-- image -->

with DMS tailings and stored in a 4- hour concentrate storage bin before being trucked.

Mine  haul  trucks  will  be  used  to  transport  the  tailings  to  an  onsite  co-disposal area. No shipping precautions will be required.

## 17.1.5 Whabouchi Processing Plant - Utilities

## a) Concentrator Water Services

The water consumption is based on concentrator plant nominal water consumption per hour.

## i) Fresh Water

Underground water wells will be the main water source of fresh water near the concentrator. The fresh water will be pumped to a 12 m diameter × 12 m high fresh/fire water tank at nominal flow rate will be 5.6 m /h. Potable water 3 will be used at a rate of 1.0 m /h. The remainder of the fresh water will be 3 make-up  water  going  to  the  gland  water  system  to  an  otherwise  negative water balance.

## ii) Process Water

Reclaim Water will be recycled back, at a nominal rate of 610 m /h, from the 3 tailings and concentrate thickeners. The remainder of the water 10,633 m /h 3 comes  from  overflow  of  the  concentrate  and  the  tailings  thickeners.  The process water tank will be 10 m diameter × 10 m high process water tanks.

## iii) Gland Water

The gland water system has a separate 3.0 m diameter by 3.0 m high gland water  tank.  A  special  water  filtration  produces  6.0  m /h  gland  water.  This 3 filtration system cleans process water. The remaining 4.6 m /h water comes 3 from the fresh water system.

## b) Concentrator Compressed Air

The  concentrator  will  have  two  (2)  sets  of  compressors  for  general  use  of compressed  air. The  filter press will have  two  (2) large air compressors specifically for the pressure filtration system. The main air compressors will have a  variable  speed  drives.  The  variable  speed  drive  air  compressors,  while  more expensive, will be substantially lower in energy consumption. An air dryer will be used  for  instrument  air  only.  The  crusher  complex  has  its  own  compressed  air system.

## 17.1.6 Concentrator Processing Opportunities

For  coarse  flotation  of  spodumene  Hydrofloat  is  being  investigated.  This  method  of flotation  is  expected  to  reduce  the  reagent  costs  substantially,  while  maintaining  the same high final product quality. The lithium recovery may also be improved at the same time.

## 17.1.7 Power Requirements

The peak power requirement for the initial one (1) Mt ROM per year capacity plant has been estimated at 6.7 MW. This includes 5 MW for the concentrator process areas.

## 17.2 Hydrometallurgical Processing Plant

Based on the metallurgical testing results described in Section 13.0, the hydrometallurgical plant process design criteria, process flow sheets, equipment list as well as plant layouts were prepared for a plant feed rate of 214,320 t/y of spodumene concentrate. The following Section summarizes the process developed for the Project.

The spodumene concentrate produced at the mine site will be first transported by truck over 300 km to the Chibougamau area trans-boarding station then by train approximately 700 km to the hydrometallurgical plant located in Salaberry-deValleyfield, Quebec. The hydrometallurgical plant processing activities include decrepitation,  acid  roasting,  leaching,  purification,  electromembrane  transformation, crystallization, precipitation, drying and packaging of the different products.

## 17.2.1 Plant Design Criteria

The hydrometallurgical process plant will be designed for a nominal feed capacity (dry basis) of 26.3 t/h of spodumene  concentrate, resulting in a lithium hydroxide monohydrate crystals average production rate of 28,206 tonnes per year and a lithium carbonate powder average production rate of 3,277 tonnes per year. The overall lithium recovery of the hydrometallurgical circuit will be 88.4 %.

The  hydrometallurgical  plant  feed  consists  of  a  blend  of  dense  media  separation concentrate and flotation  concentrate.  The  concentrates  characteristics  are  included  in the design criteria summary presented in Table 17.3.

## b) Process Description

- i) Concentrate Reception and Thermal Conversion

The spodumene concentrate will be transported from the mine and concentrator site to the hydrometallurgical process plant in 90-tonne railcars (100  short  tons).  Deliveries  will  be  expected  approximately  every  three  (3) days (eighteen (18) railcars per delivery).

The  concentrate  will  be  discharged  from  one  (1)  railcar  at  a  time,  into  a receiving hopper. A reclaim apron feeder will transport the concentrate from the hopper to an unloading conveyor.

A diverter chute directs the concentrate to one (1) of two (2) conveyors. The first,  the plant feed conveyor, will feed the concentrate to the kiln feed silo. The second, the concentrate stockpile conveyor will direct the concentrate to the concentrate emergency stockpile. A wheel loader will be used to reclaim the concentrate from the emergency stockpile.

The  kiln  feed  silo  live  capacity  will  provide  eight  (8)  hours  of  continuous hydrometallurgical plant feed.

Two (2) belt feeders will feed the concentrate from the silo to the kiln feed belt  conveyor.  This  belt  conveyor  will  be  equipped  with  a  belt  scale  to monitor and control concentrate feed to the hydrometallurgical plant.

The  concentrate  will  fall  into  a  screw  conveyor  that  will  distribute  the concentrate  in  an  even  and  controlled  layer  into  the  spodumene  conversion kiln.

The kiln will be equipped with a dual burner system that allows the use of both natural gas and hydrogen as fuel. Hydrogen will be used preferentially, with natural gas acting as a backup when there will be insufficient hydrogen available. The kiln will be heated to a temperature of approximately 1,050 °C. At  this  temperature  the  spodumene  concentrate  converts  from  the  alpha crystalline structure to the beta crystalline structure. Unlike alpha-spodumene, beta-spodumene is amenable to acid roasting and water leaching. A residence time of 30 minutes at the conversion temperature will be required to ensure complete transformation. Once spodumene has achieved the beta structure, it cannot be reverted to the alpha structure.

A  flash cooler will use ambient air to cool the beta-spodumene to approximately 200 °C.

Sulfuric  acid  will  be  sprayed  onto  the  beta-spodumene  in  the  continuous paddle-type roaster with a stoichiometric ratio excess. The resulting reaction produces  solid  lithium  sulfate  and  aluminum  silicates.  A  wet  vent  scrubber draws the acidic vapors out of the mixer, cools and neutralizes them before they will be exhausted into the atmosphere.

<!-- image -->

## ii) Concentrate Leaching

Solid lithium sulfate and gangue material will drop from the roaster into the concentrate leach tank via a chute. Wash water from a downstream belt filter, which  may  contain  lithium  sulfate  in  solution,  as  well  as  a  weak  lithium sulfate solution from the downstream electrolysis process, will also be fed to the tank. A ratio of solids to liquids of 1:1 will be maintained to produce a sufficiently  concentrated  solution.  Lithium  sulfate,  being  soluble  in  water under  these  conditions,  will  dissolve,  along  with  other  sulfates  produced during the roasting step (iron sulfate, aluminum sulfate, sodium sulfate etc.).

The  resulting  slurry  will  be  pumped  to  the  aluminum  silicate  belt  filter. Lithium  sulfate  solution  will  be  separated  from  the  solid  gangue  material. Distilled water will be used in three (3) counter-current wash stages to recover any lithium sulfate solution trapped with the solid waste material. This filter cake  will  be  stockpiled  in  the  Aluminum  Silicate  Stockpile  before  being dispatched to potential end users.

## iii) Primary Impurity Removal

The filtered lithium sulfate solution will be pumped from the belt filter to the first PIR tank. There will be three (3) PIR tanks, equipped with downcomers, arranged  in  series  and  overflowing  one  into  the  other,  providing  sufficient residence time.

Hydrated lime slurry will be fed to the PIR tanks to precipitate out impurities such as iron and aluminum in the form of insoluble hydroxides. Additionally, excess sulfuric acid will be neutralized and will precipitate as gypsum. This step will increase the pH.

Compressed air will be sparged into the bottom of tanks to oxidize iron from the ferrous from (Fe 2+ ) to the ferric form (Fe 3+ ). Ferric iron is more amenable to precipitation as a hydroxide than ferrous iron.

The  precipitated  metal  hydroxides  and  gypsum  will  be  removed  from  the lithium  sulfate  solution  before  further  processing  in  order  to  prevent  redissolution.  The  slurry  will  be  pumped  to  the  PIR  residue  thickener.  The overflow of this thickener can be fed directly to the next purification step. The thickener  underflow  must  undergo  further  separation  to  minimize  lithium sulfate losses. The underflow will be pumped from the PIR residue thickener to a mix-membrane type filter press. The plant will be equipped with three (3) filter  presses  that  can  each  handle  a  maximum  of  50 %  of  the  thickener underflow. Two (2) filter presses will be in operation simultaneously while the third undergoes cake washing, pressing and cleaning. Filter press filtrate will be directed to the next purification step along with the thickener overflow and the filter press cake will be discharged via belt conveyor to the tailings tank.

<!-- image -->

## iv) Secondary Impurity Removal

In  the  SIR  tanks,  the  pH  will  be  further  increased  to  precipitate  even  more dissolved  metals  as  solid hydroxides  and  carbonates.  The  PIR  residue thickener overflow and PIR residue filter press filtrate will be pumped to the first and second SIR tanks along with lithium hydroxide solutions recovered from  the  downstream  ion  exchange  and  lithium  hydroxide  crystallization processes. Lithium hydroxide will react with dissolved manganese and zinc ions which will precipitate as insoluble hydroxides.

A  sodium carbonate solution recovered from the downstream  lithium carbonate precipitation process will be fed to the third SIR tank. The sodium carbonate will react with dissolved calcium and magnesium ions, precipitating as carbonates which are also insoluble.

In total, there will be four (4) SIR tanks and a fifth holding tank. The tanks will be will be arranged in series and flow by gravity one into the other. This step will increase the pH to the required value to promote the reaction.

The  discharge  slurry  will  be  pumped  to  the  SIR  residue  candle  filters  to remove the solid impurities from the lithium sulfate solution. The plant will be  equipped  with  two  (2)  candle  filters,  one  in  operation,  the  second  in cleaning/standby  mode,  to  ensure  continuous  plant  operation.  The  solid residue will be directed to the tailings tank. The filtrate will be pumped to the SIR  product  tank  for  storage.  The  solution  will  then  be  pumped  to  a  selfcleaning fabric filter where the solids smaller than 5 microns, and any solids that have precipitated after the candle filters, will be removed. From the filter, it  will be fed to a shell and tube type heat exchanger to cool the solution to 60 °C before being fed to the ion exchange process.

## v) Ion Exchange Process

The final lithium sulfate solution cleaning step will be performed by three (3) ion exchange columns in a round-robin configuration. Solution will be fed to two (2) columns in series (the lead column and the lag column) while the third is being cleaned/stripped/regenerated. When the lead column will be saturated with  contaminants,  it  will  be  brought  offline  to  undergo  the  cleaning/ stripping/regeneration  processes.  Meanwhile,  the  lag  column  becomes  the lead column while the third column, which was on stand-by, becomes the lag column.

Diluted sulfuric acid recovered from  the downstream  electromembrane process  will  be  used  as  the  column  stripping  agent  while  diluted  LiOH recovered from the downstream lithium hydroxide crystallization process will be used as the regeneration agent.

Purified lithium sulfate solution discharging from the columns will be stored in the LiOH feed tank. Waste solutions from the column stripping step will be collected in the ion exchange residue tank and pumped to the water treatment

system. Waste solutions from the column regeneration step will be collected in the regeneration solution tank and metered back to the first SIR tank.

## vi) Lithium Hydroxide (LiOH) Electromembrane Process

A patent  pending  electromembrane  process  will  be  used  to  convert  lithium sulfate to lithium hydroxide. Two (2) different configurations will be used in series, 2-compartment electrolysis and 3-compartment electrolysis.

The  2-compartment  electrolysis  cells  consist  of  an  anode,  a  cathode  and  a cationic membrane in-between. The lithium sulfate-rich solution will be fed to the  compartment  containing  the  anode.  An  electric  current  will  be  applied across  the cell causing  the  positive  lithium  ions  to  cross  the cationic membrane and water to split at the electrodes. In the cathode compartment, the lithium ions will combine with the free hydroxide ions producing lithium hydroxide. In the anodic compartment, protons will combine with lithium and sulfate  to  produce  lithium  bisulfate.  Approximately  35 %  of  the  lithium contained  in  the  electrolysis  feed  solution  will  be  converted  to  lithium hydroxide in the 2-compartment cells.

A  transformer  coupled  to  rectifiers  will  provide  DC  current  to  the  stacks. When  maintenance  will  be  required,  each  stack  will be taken offline individually while the others continue operation. Each stack will be equipped with its own set of auxiliary equipment such as pumps and heat exchangers feeding and discharging from common tanks.

The  lithium  hydroxide  solution  produced  by  the  stacks  will  be  fed  to  the lithium hydroxide crystallization circuit. The remaining lithium, contained in the lithium bisulfate solution will be fed to the 3-compartment cells.

The  3-compartment  electrolysis  cells  consist  of  an  anode,  a  cathode,  an anionic membrane and a cationic membrane. The lithium-rich solution will be fed  to  the  center  compartment  located  between  the  anionic  and  cationic membranes. Similarly to the 2-compartment cells, an electric current will be applied across the cell, causing the positively charged lithium ions to cross the cationic membrane and water to split at the electrodes. The lithium ions that have  crossed  the  cationic  membrane  will  combine  with  the  free  hydroxide ions  producing  lithium  hydroxide.  Additionally,  sulfate  ions  will  cross  the anionic membrane and will combine with free hydrogen ions. Approximately 85 % of the remaining lithium will be converted to the lithium hydroxide in the  3-compartment  cells.  The  remaining  lithium  discharges  from  the  center compartment as a depleted lithium sulfate solution.

The stacks will be divided into several trains. Each train will be equipped with its own transformer and rectifier to provide DC current to the stacks, as well as its own  set  of  auxiliary  equipment  such  as  tanks,  pumps  and  heat exchangers.  When  maintenance  will  be  required,  each  train  will  be  taken offline individually while the others continue to operate.

<!-- image -->

The  lithium hydroxide solution will be fed to the lithium hydroxide crystallization  circuit.  The  depleted  lithium  solution  discharging  from  the center compartment will be recycled to the water leach tank where it was used as dilution water. Finally, most of the weak sulfuric acid solution discharging from  the  anodic  compartments  of  the  stacks  will  be  sent  to  a  gypsum precipitation circuit. The remaining weak sulfuric acid solution will be used as a stripping agent for the ion exchange columns.

In the electromembrane process, solution concentrations will be an important operating parameter. Dilution water will be added to the catholyte and anolyte products to maintain  LiOH  and  H2SO4  concentrations.  Allowing  these concentrations to increase would decrease cell efficiency.

The  oxygen  generated  off  of  the  anode  and  hydrogen  generated  off  of  the cathode will  be  reused  in  the  plant.  Oxygen  gas  will  be  separated  from  the circulating  anolyte  solution  and  recycled  in  the  process.  Hydrogen  will  be separated from the catholyte solution, scrubbed and recycled to different plant burners as fuel.

## vii) Lithium Hydroxide Monohydrate (LiOH-H2O) Crystallization

The  crystallization circuit will produce  lithium  hydroxide  monohydrate crystals from the lithium hydroxide solution generated through the electromembrane process. The crystallization circuit consists of a falling film evaporator,  a  forced  circulation  crude  crystallizer  and  a  forced  circulation pure crystallizer.

Two (2) crystallization feed tanks will provide up to 18 hours of feed to the crystallization  circuit.  The  LiOH  feed  solution  will  be  pre-heated  in  a  plate and  frame  type  heat  exchanger  and  subsequently  fed  to  a  falling  film evaporator for concentration. Evaporated water will be recovered as distilled water and recycled to the plant.

The concentrated LiOH solution will feed the LiOH-H2O crude crystallizer. LiOH solution will be brought to its saturation limit causing the precipitation of LiOH-H2O crystals. Mechanical vapor recompression (' MVR '), performed by two (2) turbo fans operating in series, will allow the system to regenerate  steam,  minimizing  fresh  steam  requirements.  Evaporated  water will be recovered as distilled water and recycled to the plant.

The  crude  crystals  removed  from  the  crystallizer  will  flow  through  an elutriation leg where some of the sodium will be washed off. The crystals will be  further  washed  in  the  pusher-type  centrifuge  that  will  also  be  used  to dewater the crystals. The dewatered crystals at the discharge of the centrifuge will contain about 500 ppm Na. The filtrate recovered from the centrifuge will contain mostly sodium hydroxide and some lithium hydroxide. It will be used as a reagent in the SIR purification step and as a regeneration agent for the ion exchange  columns.  The  remaining  filtrate  will  be  pumped  to  the  lithium carbonate precipitation circuit to recover the remaining lithium.

The crude crystals will be fed to the LiOH-H2 O pure crystallizer dissolution tank  where  the  lithium  hydroxide  will  be  re-dissolved  and  pumped  to  the LiOH-H2O pure crystallizer. This second forced circulation MVR crystallizer will  operate  along  the  same  principles  as  the  LiOH-H O  crude  crystallizer. 2 The two (2) turbo-fans will supply recompressed steam to the evaporator and crystallizers.

A second elutriation  leg  and  pusher  type  centrifuge  will  perform  additional crystal washing to remove any remaining sodium and dewater the pure LiOHH2O  crystals,  which  are  expected  to  contain  a  maximum  of  20  ppm  Na. Filtrate  will  be  returned  to  the  crude  crystallization  step  to  recover  any remaining lithium.

## viii)LiOH-H2O Drying and Packaging

The  LiOH-H2O  crystals  discharging  from  the  LiOH-H2O  pure  crystals centrifuge will be dried before the final packaging step. The crystals will fall onto the top tray of the rotary tray dryer. As the dryer revolves, crystals will fall down from one tray to the next as heated nitrogen rises through the dryer. Nitrogen will be used as the heating  medium to prevent any reactions with carbon dioxide. Any moisture discharging the dryer with the nitrogen will be condensed  and  the  nitrogen  will  be  re-heated  using  an  air  to  air  heat exchanger. Hot air produced by the combustion of hydrogen will be used by this heat exchanger as the heating medium. Natural gas can also be used when hydrogen will be insufficient or unavailable.

A  robot  operated  system  will  be  used  to  package  the  crystals  into  1-tonne bags. The packaging system will be operated during one 12 hour shift per day. Around 83 bags per day will be produced.

## ix) Lithium Carbonate (Li2CO3) Precipitation

Purge solution containing lithium hydroxide and sodium hydroxide from the lithium  hydroxide  crystallization  circuit  will  feed  the  lithium  carbonate precipitation circuit. This circuit will recover uncrystallised lithium hydroxide in the form of lithium carbonate.

The Li2CO3 production process will be carried out in two (2) steps. The first step  is  called  the  Lithium  Hydroxide  Carbonisation  (' LC ')  and  may  be referred  to  as  the  lithium  carbonate  precipitation  step.  The  second  step  is called the Lithium Bicarbonate Decomposition step (' DC ').

The  LC  step  will  be  carried  out  in  a  single  tank.  Carbon  dioxide  will  be injected at the bottom of the tank to react with lithium hydroxide, producing lithium carbonate.

The slurry will be pumped to a decanter. The decanter overflow, containing a lithium bicarbonate by-product, will be fed to the second step. The decanter underflow containing the precipitated lithium carbonate will be pumped to a belt filter feed tank.

<!-- image -->

In the DC step, the lithium bicarbonate solution will be heated to 95 ºC using four (4) reactors installed in series. The tanks will be jacketed and heated with steam.

The slurry from the DC step will be then pumped to a decanter. The decanter overflow,  which  contains  sodium  bicarbonate,  will  be  fed  to the SIR precipitation  step.  Any  excess  solution  will  be  directed  towards  the  water treatment system. The decanter underflow will join the LC  decanter underflow in the belt filter feed tank.

A vacuum belt filter will be used to dewater the lithium carbonate slurry. The belt  filter  cake  will  fall  by  gravity  into  the  fluid  bed  dryer.  The  belt  filter filtrate  will  be  returned  to  the  DC  step  to  convert  any  unreacted  lithium bicarbonate into lithium carbonate.

## x) Li2 CO3 Drying, Pulverization and Packaging

A  fluid  bed  drying  system  using  an  electric  heater  will  dry  the  lithium carbonate  final  product.  The  dried  product  will  be  transferred  to  a  jet  mill. The jet mill will use high pressure air to pulverize the lithium carbonate to a P80 of about five (5) microns.

A robot operated system will be used to package the Li CO3 2 into 25-kg bags. The  packaging  system  will  be  operated  during  one  12-hour  shift  per  day. Around 386 bags per day will be filled.

## xi) Gypsum (CaSO4) Precipitation

The weak sulfuric acid solution coming from the electrolysis circuit will be neutralized  with  hydrated  lime  to  produce  CaSO   or  gypsum.  The  gypsum 4 slurry will be pumped to a hydrocyclone cluster.

The  hydrocyclone  overflow  will  be  directed  towards  the  water  treatment system while the underflow will be pumped to the gypsum vacuum belt filter for  further  dewatering.  The  filter  cake  will  be  stockpiled  in  the  gypsum stockpile before being dispatched to potential end users.

## xii) Tailings Disposal

Tailings from the SIR, PIR and IX circuits, as well as most of the plant sumps will  be  collected  in  the  tailings  tank.  Lime  will  be  added  to  neutralize  the tailings.

The  tailings  tank  content  will  be  pumped  to  a  thickener.  The  thickener overflow  will  be  directed  towards  the  water  treatment  system  while  the underflow will be pumped to the SIR tailings pond. Water recovered from the pond will be recycled to the water treatment system.

## xiii)Reagents

Quicklime (CaO) will be purchased in bulk and stored on site in a 200-tonne capacity silo. A slaker will be used to prepare hydrated lime. Hydrated lime

<!-- image -->

will be used to control tailings pH, produce gypsum and precipitate iron and other metals in the PIR tanks.

Sulfuric acid (H SO4) will also be delivered in tanker trucks or by rail and 2 unloaded  into  one  of  three  (3)  outdoor  storage  tanks.  Sulfuric  acid  will  be purchased  at  a  93 %  by  weight  concentration  and  will  be  used  at  this strength. The only requirement for sulfuric acid will be for the acid roasting step.

## xiv) Services

- -Cooling Water

A  3,000  m /h  capacity,  five  (5)  cell  towers,  will  be  required  to  provide 3 cooling water mainly to the electrolysis and crystallization circuits.

- -Steam

The plant will be equipped with two (2) boilers. A 250 hp boiler will provide steam to the lithium carbonate purification circuit. A second 250 hp will be operated  periodically  to  provide  steam  for  the  start-up  of  the  lithium hydroxide crystallization circuit.

## -Compressed Air

Two (2) high pressure air compressors (one in operation and one stand-by) will provide instrument and plant air for all users throughout the plant. Only the jet mill will require a dedicated air compressor. The main instrument air users  will  be  the  various  dust  collection  systems  and  instruments.  Plant  air will be required in the PIR tanks and for the utility stations.

## -Hydrogen

Hydrogen  (H2)  will  be  used  to  fire  the  kiln  burner,  the  lithium  hydroxide monohydrate  crystals  dryer  and  the  boiler  burners.  There  will  be  no  gas storage  facility  planned  on  site.  Hydrogen  gas  will  be  generated  by  the electrolysis  circuit.  Additional  hydrogen  will  be  purchased  and  supplied  to the plant via pipeline from nearby Akzo Nobel Pâte et Performance Canada Inc. plant when available.

## -Natural Gas

Natural gas will be used  when  hydrogen  gas  will  be  insufficient or unavailable. Natural gas will be supplied via the Gaz Metro pipeline network available at the site location.

## xv) Water Management

- -Process Water

Process  water  will  come  from  the  aluminum  silicate  belt  filter  wash  water filtrate.  Process water will be used for reagents preparation (hydrated lime) and  filter  washing.  The  excess  process  water  will  be  pumped  to  the  water treatment system.

<!-- image -->

## -Distilled Water

Distilled water will consist of the condensate from the crystallization circuit. The distilled water will be at a higher temperature than all the other sources of water (higher than 50 ºC).

Distilled water will be used for boiler feed water and as cake and belt wash water for the various plant vacuum belt filters. A make-up from the purified water tank will be required to meet the distilled water demand.

## -Purified Water

Many sources of water and process solutions will be collected in the water treatment feed tank. The gypsum hydrocylone and tailings and decomposition thickeners overflows will be collected in this tank along with other liquid waste streams.

This water will undergo multiple treatment phases including neutralization, filtration, softening and purification by reverse osmosis.

Purified  water  will  be  used  in  the  acid  roaster  scrubber,  the  IX  circuit,  the electromembrane circuit and the belt filters vacuum pumps.

The concentrate from the reverse osmosis system will be directed to the City of Salaberry-de-Valleyfield's water treatment plant.

## 18.1.1 The Route du Nord Public Road

The Route du Nord is actually located just outside a 500 metres safe distance from the open pit. The Project will be located at km 276. The portion of the road on which the Project will be located is administrated by Hydro-Quebec as part of its strategic assets in the area.

## 18.1.2 Mine Service and Hauling Roads

The site hauling roads were designed for Cat 772 with an 82,100 kg target operating weight. The quantities required for building those roads were established based on draft profiles for each section of mining road. Those profiles were determined based on the roads not exceeding a maximum slope of 8 %. To suit the Cat 772 dimensions, those mining roads have been designed to be 20 metres wide.

The quantities of fill required to construct the service roads were established the same way using a standard AASHO-H20 highway live load. All service roads were designed to be ten (10) metres wide.

## 18.1.3 Maintenance Garage and Warehouse

The multi-purpose maintenance garage building is to be located along the site access road at an easy walking distance from the mine personnel parking lot.

The garage will be used for servicing the mine equipment in addition to other mobile equipment. The garage will be equipped with overhead cranes, tools, air compressors, lubricants, and will house the following facilities:

- · Two (2) maintenance bays for the mine trucks and other large mobile equipment;
- · One (1) large equipment wash bay;
- · One (1) light-vehicle maintenance bay;
- · The guard house station at the front corner nearest to the access road;
- · Mine engineering offices including reception area and conference room;

## 18.1.4 Fresh Water Supply

It is foreseen that fresh and fire water will be supplied to the site from wells since the process and domestic water demand will be relatively low, basically under six (6) m 3 per hour.

It  is  otherwise  expected  that  the  process  itself  will  need  to  be  fed  about  20  m /h  for 3 start-up purposes. This is the basic flow rate that is being retained for the fresh water supply source.

## 18.1.5 Sewage Treatment

At the site, two (2) sewage treatment facilities will be built for all three (3) centers of operation: the administration buildings, the maintenance garage and the concentrator.

Without camp facilities on site, the unit water demand of 130 litres per person per day has been used to establish the amount of sewage to be treated daily.

Once the  manpower  requirement  was  established  at  70  people,  it  was  found  that  the largest  producer  of  waste  water  would  be  the  administration/mine  offices,  but  with  a limited quantity of nine (9) m  per day. 3

A maximum quantity of 18 m  per day is expected to be generated by the entire site. 3

One  sanitary  waste  water  treatment  system  will  be  provided  each  for  the  plant  and garage areas. Provision has been made for modular-type sanitary waste water treatment units using a Rotating Biological Contactor (' RBC ') type process. Sanitary and shower waste water will be collected from each building via underground piping and discharged into  these  modularized  sanitary  waste  water  treatment  units.  Sludge  will  need  to  be removed about twice a year by a local contractor.

## 18.7 Power Supply and Distribution

## 18.7.1 Power Line, Main Sub-Station and Electrical Distribution

The total power demand of the Project was determined to be approximately 6.66 MW, based  on  the  estimated  connected  load,  running  load  and  running  power.  Table  18.1 shows the power demand breakdown by sector.

<!-- image -->

Table 18.1 - Estimated Total Project Power Demand

| Area                        |   Power Demand  (MW) |
|-----------------------------|----------------------|
| Crushing                    |                 0.81 |
| Processing                  |                 3.16 |
| Infrastructure and Services |                 1.98 |
| Network Loss (2 %)          |                 0.11 |
| Power Demand Subtotal       |                 6.05 |
| Security Factor (10 %)      |                 0.61 |
| Total Power Demand          |                 6.66 |

Note: The power demand was calculated using an average efficiency factor, load factor and diversity factor.

The Whabouchi Project will get its power from the Hydro-Québec Albanel sub-station. From that  point,  a  new  25  kV  overhead  power  line  will  be  built  over  approximately 20 km and will terminate at a new outdoor sub-station. At this sub-station, the incoming voltage  will  be  stepped  down  to  a  distribution  voltage  of  4.16 kV  through  one  (1) 7.5/10 MVA transformer. The transformer will feed a 5-kV switchgear.

The 5-kV main switchgear will be located indoors in the pre-fabricated electrical room and provides power to:

- · The administration/garage area through an overhead 5-kV line;
- · The primary, secondary and tertiary crushing area through feeders from the 5-kV main switchgear;
- · A MV MCC;
- · A capacitor bank to improve the power factor to 95 %;
- · Two (2) 2/2.6 MVA distribution transformers 4.16 kV / 600 V.

There  will  be  no  electrical  distribution  to  and  within  the  open  mine,  as  all  mining equipment,  including  pumps,  will  be  powered  from  diesel  motors.  At  Year  19  of operation,  a  circuit  will  be  added  to  feed  the  underground  ventilation  system  and services.

## 18.7.2 Emergency Generators

## 18.8 Camp Accommodations

A construction camp and a permanent camp will be required for the Project. These two (2) camps will be built by the Compagnie de Construction et Développement Cri Ltée (' CCDC ')  on  their  own  site  at  the Relais  Routier  Nemiscau at  km 291  on Route  du Nord and will be operated by them, including all the required services.

A 125 rooms camp is already installed at the Relais Routier Nemiscau and is awaiting the official announcement for the start of construction to be hooked up to the existing services in place. Depending on the construction schedule, temporary accommodations could  easily  be  added  to  meet  the  construction  requirements.  Once  the  Project  is confirmed  and  well  underway,  a  new  more  spacious  90 rooms  permanent  camp  for Nemaska Lithium employees will be built in parallel with the construction phase and help fulfill the construction requirements.

The  common  areas  of  the  permanent  camp,  such  as  the  kitchen  and  the  recreational areas will be used by the residents of the construction and permanent camps. Thus, the kitchen  capacity  in  the  permanent  camp  will  be  sized  to  accommodate  the  additional load from the construction workforce.

## 18.8.1 Site Location

The CCDC site designated for the construction camp and the permanent camp will be located  at  the Relais  routier  Nemiscau (km  291  of Route  du  Nord ),  approximately 15 km west of the Whabouchi Project site. Employees will be transported daily by bus.

## 18.9.1 Power Line

The  hydrometallurgical  processing  plant  will  be  fed  through  a  120  kV  overhead electrical power  line  supplied  and  installed  by  Hydro-Québec  from  the  existing distribution point at the Langlois sub-station.

## 18.9.2 Site Roads

The  hydrometallurgical  processing  plant  will  be  accessible  year-round  without  any interruption by the city's road network. The access road will be located directly to the southwest  of  the  Property,  off Des  Érables Boulevard.  A  single  guard  house  will  be used to monitor the access point.

Site and service roads will be eight (8) m wide and will provide access to:

- · Process facility from city road;
- · Aluminum silicate and gypsum piles;
- · Shipping warehouse;
- · Warehouse.

## 18.9.3 Concentrate Transportation and Load-Out Facility

Concentrate  will  be  shipped  by  railcar  from  Chibougamau  to  the  hydrometallurgical processing  plant.  An  existing  CN  railway  runs  along  the  western  side  of  the  site. Railcars will be diverted from the railway at the north-western corner of the site onto a new 600 m railway. This new railway will run in parallel to the SW limit of the site.

It is expected that deliveries of up to 18 100-short ton railcars will be made every two to three (2 to 3) days. Railcars will be emptied from the bottom one (1) at a time over the concentrate receiving hopper. The hopper will be equipped with a feeder that directs the concentrate onto an unloading conveyor.

## 18.9.4 Tailings Storage Facilities

A  preliminary  assessment  of  tailings  disposal  requirements  to  store  and  manage  the tailings and process water was prepared for the hydrometallurgical processing plant.

Tailings storage design has been performed for the three (3) distinct plant tailings. The concentrate leach tailings (aluminum silicate) will be stockpiled dry, as will the gypsum produced  by  neutralizing  the  waste  from  the  electrolysis  process.  The  remaining tailings, produced mainly by the PIR and SIR processes will be stored in a tailings pond located near the plant.

## a) Aluminum Silicate Pile

Concentrate  leach  tailings  (aluminum  silicates)  will  be  discarded  from  the hydrometallurgical  processing  plant  as  a  cake  from  a  belt  filter.  They  will  be stockpiled on a pad outside. Pile capacity will allow for six (6) months storage (136,488 tonnes) of tailings with a 27 % moisture content. Design criteria were based  on  an  assumed  final  density  of  1.76  t/m . 3 Since  aluminum  silicate  is  a marketable  product,  it  has  been  assumed  that  most  of  the  aluminum  silicate

<!-- image -->

produced by the plant will be sold. Provisions for a 100 m diameter pad have been made south of the processing plant.

## b) Gypsum Storage Pond

Gypsum will be produced as a by-product of the membrane electrolysis process. Gypsum slurry will be discarded from the hydrometallurgical processing plant at a rate of 71,006 t/y (dry) with 8 % moisture. Pile capacity will allow for three (3) months  storage  (19,300  tonnes)  of  tailings.  Design  criteria  were  based  on  an assumed final density of 2.08 t/m . Since gypsum is a marketable product, it has 3 been assumed that most of the aluminum silicate produced by the plant will be sold.  Provisions  for  a  43  by  136.5 m  covered  pad  have  been  made  west  of  the aluminum silicate pile.

## c) Tailings Pond

The  Tailings  Ponds  will  receive  the  balance  of  the  tailings  generated  by  the hydrometallurgical processing plant at a rate of 20,227 t/y (dry) at 50 % moisture. The ponds will be sized to receive approximately nine (9) years of tailings.

Design criteria were based on an assumed final depositional density of 1.51 t/m 3 and  a  total  tailings  placement  requirement  of  about  13,395  m /y.  The  water 3 volume  pumped  into  the  tailings  pond  is  expected  to  be  60  m   per  day.  The 3 tailings will retain about 50 % of the pumped water while 50 % i.e. 30 m  per day 3 will be available for reclaim.

Due to space constraints, the tailings pond will be built in two (2) phases and at two (2) separated locations on the site. The smaller of the two (2) ponds will be constructed  first  in  the  northwest  corner  of  the  lot  and  will  have  an  84,000 m 3 capacity.  The second, built at Year 7 of operation, will occupy the southeastern portion of site and have a capacity of 138,000 m . 3

It was assumed that it will be possible to find a useful avenue for this residue as well within the first nine (9) years of operations. However, if this does not happen, adjacent land is available in sufficient quantity to extend the existing installations.

## 18.9.5 Site Buildings

The hydrometallurgical processing plant building will house the decrepitation, roasting, leaching,  purification,  electrolysis,  crystallization,  precipitation,  drying  and  packaging circuits. It will be 73 m wide by 140 m long and 32.3 m high at its highest point. The building  will  also  house:  offices,  a  metallurgical  laboratory,  control  room,  electrical rooms and change rooms.

In addition, the site will include the following buildings:

- · Shipping Warehouse;
- · Warehouse;
- · Guardhouse.

## 19.0 MARKET STUDIES

This Section summarizes the key information contained in market studies about lithium prepared for Nemaska and also on a general publication by Roskill on gypsum. These studies were prepared in 2012 by signumBOX Inteligencia de Mercados (' signumBOX ')  and  Roskill  Consulting  Group  Ltd.  (' Roskill '),  independent  and experienced consultants. SignumBOX and Roskill were mandated in 2012 to perform market  studies  to  evaluate  potential  target  markets  for  the  lithium  hydroxide  and concentrate. For the Feasibility Study, Nemaska mandated signumBox to do an updated study on the lithium hydroxide and lithium carbonate markets.

## 19.1 Lithium Hydroxide and Lithium Carbonate

In this Section,  the  market  study  report  titled  'Lithium  Carbonate  and  Lithium Hydroxide  Market  Study'  dated  April  17 th ,  2014  and  prepared  by  signumBOX  for Nemaska is summarized.

The first part of the report describes lithium reserves and resources, current producers and newcomers. The objective of this Section is to forecast future production capacity of lithium carbonate and lithium hydroxide from current producers as well from the new supply  that  may  enter  into  the  market.  The  second  part  analyses  lithium  demand  by applications, with a special focus on the use of lithium in batteries since this application will  drive  the  demand´s  growth  in  the  future.  Assumptions  have  also  been  made regarding the use of lithium carbonate and  lithium hydroxide  for each of the applications.  Finally,  a  sensitivity  analysis  according  to  three  (3)  different  demand's scenarios is presented.

The  recent  evolution  of  lithium  compounds  prices  are  analysed  and  according  to  the balance  between  demand  and  production  capacity,  lithium  carbonate  and  lithium hydroxide prices for the period between 2014 and 2025 are forecasted.

Finally, it also presents an analysis of the impact of the reduction on potash prices on the operational cost of some of the brine projects in Argentina, which will have a direct impact on the potential newcomers in this industry.

## 19.1.1 Lithium Supply

## a) Reserves and Resources

Lithium  (Li)  is  the  lightest  metal  and  the  least  dense  solid  element.  Lithium  is highly reactive, that's why in nature, it appears only in the form of compounds and can be found in different forms, mainly in pegmatites and continental brines.

## · Continental Brines

Continental brines come from the leaching of volcanic rocks. Most of these brines can be found below dry lakes containing salts that are very soluble, so the  lithium  does  not  crystallize.  Lithium  can  also  be  found  in  geothermal brines. Other types of brines are found in oilfields.

<!-- image -->

## · Pegmatites

Many of the lithium pegmatites contain separate masses of different minerals. Apparently, pegmatites come from a flowing magma that had slowly cooled with  some  mixing,  allowing  the  initial  crystallization  of  the  less  soluble compounds such as iron and manganese silicates. Lithium minerals found in pegmatites  include  spodumene,  amblygonite,  lepidolite,  triphylite,  petalite, zinnwaldite, lithiophilite, taeniolite, eucryptyte, and polylithionite.

## b) Lithium Demand

As  shown  on  Figure  19.1  below  'Total  lithium  demand  by  application',  the battery  market  represents  the  largest  use  of  lithium  with  38 %  of  the  overall consumption  in  2014.  After  batteries,  the  combined  ceramics  and  glass  market represents  the  second  largest  application  with  a  25 %  market  share,  while lubricating greases is the third largest application with 12 %  of  the  total consumption.

## c) Lithium Carbonate and Lithium Hydroxide

The two (2) main lithium compounds used by the different industries are lithium carbonate,  representing  48 %,  and  lithium  hydroxide,  representing  20 %  of  the overall demand as shown in Figure 19.2. Currently lithium hydroxide is mainly used in the lubricating greases.

## d) Lithium Consumption Forecast: 2011- 2025

As  can  be  seen  from  Table  19.1  below,  both  lithium  carbonate  and  lithium hydroxide  demand  are  forecasted  to  increase  significantly  compared  to  other lithium  compounds  used  mainly  in  industrial  applications.  Lithium  hydroxide demand in particular is predicted to grow from the actual 27,533 tonnes level in 2011 to over 183,303 tonnes by 2025, the demand almost doubling every five (5) years from today.

Table 19.1 - Lithium Demand By Compound - Forecast 2011-2025

Source : signumBOX estimates

This  forecasted  increase  in  demand  for  lithium  hydroxide  is  mainly  due  to  the increased use of lithium hydroxide in rechargeable batteries, especially batteries for  the  automotive  application.  Despite  the  fact  that  lithium  carbonate  has  been

<!-- image -->

widely used in batteries for portable devices, lithium hydroxide apparently suits better in cathodes such as lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO ). There are different 4 methods  of  producing  cathode  material  and  some  of  them  require  exclusively lithium  hydroxide  while  other  methods  works  equal  with  either  hydroxide  or carbonate. It is estimated that by 2025, 50 % of the lithium required for electric vehicles would be in the form of lithium hydroxide. It is also expected that the use of  lithium  hydroxide  in  batteries  for  portable  devices  will  increase  from  5 %  in 2011 to about 20 % in 2025.

Table 19.2 - Lithium Consumption By Application - Forecast 2011 - 2025 clearly shows that  the  major  increase  in  demand  is  expected  to  come  from  the  battery industry,  mainly  for  the  portable  devices  secondary  (rechargeable  batteries)  and the Hybrid (' HEV ') and electric vehicles (' EV ').

This  situation  implies  that  batteries  will  represent  the  largest  use  of  lithium hydroxide in 2025; increasing from 3 % in 2012 to 69 % in 2025.

Figure 19.3 to Figure 19.6 below, show the evolution of the demand for lithium hydroxide  and  lithium  carbonate  from  the  2011  level  to  the  forecasted  2025 expected demand.

- e) Lithium Consumption Forecast: Sensitivity Analysis

A sensitivity analysis has been done in order to assess different demand and price scenarios, using the following criteria:

- · The possibility of a deeper economic slowdown in 2012. This situation would imply a slowdown of the demand of lithium, mainly in industrial uses such as ceramics and glasses, automotive application, and batteries;
- · The penetration rate of hybrid and electric cars in the market; which depends mainly on how the cost of the battery will evolve, which represents currently the biggest cost of an electric car.

Three (3) scenarios, reflecting economic growth and electric vehicle penetration rate have been considered. Table 19.3 show these three (3) scenarios.

Table 19.3 - Possible Scenarios for Future Lithium Demand

| Scenario    | Economic  Growth   | EV Penetration  Rate   |
|-------------|--------------------|------------------------|
| Optimistic  | Base               | High                   |
| Realistic   | Base               | Base                   |
| Pessimistic |                    | Low                    |

In  terms  of  the  growth  of  total  lithium  demand,  the  more  pessimistic  scenario results  in  a  Compound  Annual  Growth  Rate (' CAGR ')  of  8.8 %  and  the  more optimist scenario in a CAGR of 11.8 % for the next 21 years as is shown in Figure 19.7.

Lithium  hydroxide  is  much  more  sensitive  to  market  conditions  than  the  other lithium compounds, because of its use as a cathode material in batteries for hybrid and electric cars. As can be seen in Table 19.4, lithium hydroxide growth would range between 12.6 % and 16.8 % per year. It is important to highlight that these estimations  do  not  consider  future  economic  recessions  as  well  as  product substitution.  They  only  consider  different  scenarios  for  the  economic  growth  in 2012  and  different  scenarios  for  HEV  and  EV's  penetration  rate.  It  is  not  yet known with certainty which will be the most used lithium chemical compound in cathode material for batteries for hybrid and electric cars. It has been assumed that the  vast  majority  of  the  manganese-spinel  and  lithium  iron  phosphates  battery

types would require lithium hydroxide as raw material while the vast majority of lithium  polymer  and  other  types  of  cathode  materials  would  require  lithium carbonate as raw material.

## 19.1.2 Supply

## a) Lithium Reserves and Resources: Description

There are two (2) main sources of supply for lithium. The main one is currently continental brines and the second one is hard rock, mainly pegmatite but also from petalite and lepidolite.

Figure 19.8 shows the actual distribution of supply between these two (2) main sources in 2011.

In the signumBOX report, the lithium minerals for direct use, representing 13 % of  the  current  supply  are  not  taken  into  consideration,  as  it  is  mainly  ore  of technical grade that is not for conversion into lithium compounds.

## b) Lithium Reserves and Resources: Estimation

There are different estimations of the amount of reserves and resources around the world. The US Geological Survey (' USGS ') updates every year its estimation of lithium  reserves  and  resources  and  according  to  the  latest  publication,  lithium reserves are 12.7 Mt (Li) while resources are estimated at 25.5 Mt (Li).

The  Table  19.5  shows  the  estimations  of  reserves  and  resources  established  by both  USGS  and  Mr.  Keith  Evans,  a  geologist  by  profession  who  has  been involved in the lithium business since 1970.

## c) Lithium Chemicals Supply

Currently  the  chemicals  production  capacity  around  the  world  is  estimated  at about 145,000 t Lithium Carbonate Equivalent (' LCE ').  Approximately 41.5 % of  the  supply  obtained  from  pegmatites  which  is  used  in  the  form  of  lithium concentrate in direct applications (13 % of total lithium supply) and in the form of lithium  chemicals  (28 %  of  total  lithium  supply),  as  shown  in  the  above  Figure 19.8.

## d) Worldwide Supply of Lithium

Total lithium production capacity is currently estimated around 198,500 t expressed as LCE. According to the Companies' information, it is forecasted that a production capacity from current lithium producers is to increase by 129,000 t in the next four (4) years reaching about 330,000 t in 2020. According to signumBOX, it is estimated that production capacity from Newcomers in 20142015, will bring an additional 50,000 t of LCE in the overall production capacity. Therefore,  signumBOX  estimate  that  by  2020  the  production  capacity  would reach about 500,000 t of which 330,000 t will come from current producers and 170,000 t from new projects including Whabouchi projected production.

## e) Production Capacity from Newcomers

Figure 19.9 shows  the potential production capacity from Newcomers  as established in 2012. Since that time Galaxy Resources has closed its Mont Marion operation and its Jiangsu plant has been purchased by Tianqi Lithium to convert spodumene concentrate produced by Talison Lithium at its Greenbushes mine. It cannot be considered any longer as a potential newcomer. Projects in Chili are all on  hold  pending  development  of  a  national  policy  on  lithium.  Except  for Orocobre, all other projects listed have been delayed one way or the other.

## 19.1.3 Prices

Current lithium carbonate prices are in the range of US$ 5,500 - US$ 5,700 per tonne, while current lithium hydroxide prices are in the range of US$ 7,100 - US$ 7,400 per tonne. Prices forecasted at the time the mine will enter into commercial production in 2017 are in the range of US$ 4,800 to US$ 5,300 for the carbonate and US$ 7,900 to US$ 8,200 for the hydroxide depending on the growth scenario selected.

## 19.1.4 Conclusions

The main conclusions of the three (3) reports received by Nemaska are:

- · There are a limited number of producers of lithium hydroxide presently around the World, all of them using a traditional process of transforming lithium carbonate into lithium hydroxide;
- · Demand for lithium hydroxide of battery grade is expected to grow at the rhythm of about 30 % per annum over the next 15 years;
- · Lithium  hydroxide  expected  growth  demand  is  mainly  related  to  secondary batteries use over the next years;
- · Overall lithium hydroxide demand is expected to grow at a rate between 12.6 % to 16.8 % depending on the rate of penetration of the electric and hybrid vehicles.

## 19.2 By-Product Market Study

In its process of producing lithium hydroxide, Nemaska will obtain two (2) by-products of commercial  value, gypsum  and  aluminum  silicate. Nemaska  has  had  initial discussions with potential buyers for both products but did not want to sign any binding agreement at this stage as it would have implied granting exclusivity on the sale of these products. Nemaska concluded that it is in its best interest to continue discussions while advancing the Project to construction and production decision.

## 19.2.1 Summary of Gypsum Study

Nemaska  assessed  the  potential  market  for  its  gypsum  by-product  by  reviewing different  literature  of  which  a  market  study  produced  by  Roskill  Consulting  Group Limited,  Gypsum  and  Anhydrite:  Global  Industry  Markets  and  Outlook,  Eleventh Edition, 2014. This study provides good indications that there is a large market for this type of product. On that basis, a neutral approach was taken for this Feasibility Study. No disposition costs have been added and no additional revenues have been accounted for.

## 19.2.2 Aluminum Silicate Market

As  for  the  aluminum  silicate  by-product,  Nemaska  has  initiated  discussions  with potential  end-users  and  also  conducted  initial  testing  of  this  product  with  a  Quebec university. It has been found to be of high purity and initial tests confirm that it can be used  in  the  making  of  cement.  Discussion  with  cement  industry  representatives  have lead Met-Chem to conclude that since this by-products is of high quality, very stable in composition and available reliably, it can represent an advantage over existing supply chain providers. On that basis, a neutral approach was taken for this Feasibility Study. No disposition costs have been added and no additional revenues have been accounted for.

## 20.0 ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES, PERMITTING, AND SOCIAL OR COMMUNITY IMPACT

All the information presented in this Section concerns the mine site, except Section 20.5 which deals specifically with the hydrometallurgical plant in Salaberry-de-Valleyfield.

On May 5 th , 2014, Nemaska tabled additional information following requests from both provincial  and  federal  authorities  pertaining  to  its  ongoing  Environmental  and  Social Impact  Assessment  (' ESIA ')  of  the  Whabouchi  Project.  It  should  also  be  noted  that complementary environmental baseline studies are ongoing at the mine site in order to complete  previous  data  gathered  as  part  of  past  studies,  especially  with  regards  to hydrology, water quality and fish habitat assessment.

## 20.1 Environmental Baseline Studies

Baseline environmental studies at the Whabouchi site began in August 2010 with field surveys for water quality, sediment quality, benthic invertebrates, and fish. During 2011 and  through  2012,  additional  data  were  collected,  focusing  on  fish,  surface  water quality,  bathymetry,  hydrology,  ground  water  quality,  soil  quality,  air  quality,  noise, large mammals, small mammals, bats, birds, amphibians, and reptiles.

Two (2) study areas have been identified for the ESIA and the associated environmental and baseline studies (Figure 20.1). The 'local study area' includes all of the areas likely to be directly physically impacted by the mine development (pit, buildings, and roads) or that is located in its immediate vicinity. Such area encompasses zones that are likely to  be  disturbed  by  the  activities  on-site  (site  preparation,  noise,  dust  emissions,  etc.). The 'regional study area' is a larger area extending out of the Property and to which is potentially  associated  cumulative  effects  with  other  projects  or  infrastructures;  such effects are typically associated with water quality, wildlife and socio-economic aspects.

The following Sections summarize the methodology used and the results gathered for each component studied since 2010. Table 20.1 shows a list of completed, ongoing, and planned work for the environmental baseline studies.

## 20.1.1 Physical Environment

The  physical  environment  of  the  Whabouchi  Project  area  was  described  based  on information collected from various sources:

- · Field surveys;
- · Aerial photographs and/or satellite images, maps, and geomatics tools;
- · Information  provided  by  various  governmental  agencies  as  well  as  by  other project proponents active in the territory (municipality, other mine or hydropower projects, etc.);
- · Studies from the scientific and technical literature.

## a) Hydrology

The characterization  and  validation  of  water  courses  and  watersheds  were  done using topographical and thematic maps, digital elevation models (' DEM '), aerial photos  and  field  surveys.  Watershed  limits  and  streams  alignments  within  the limits of the Property were established using LiDAR data. Calculations of stream flow  rates  derived  from  standard  CEHQ  models  were  made  and  supplemented with field checks.

The study area is characterized by the presence of numerous water bodies, streams and wetlands. The mine site is in the Rupert River watershed, which has a surface area  of  43,400 km   and  flows  from  east  to  west  towards  the  Rupert  Bay.  The 2 hydrographic network on the Property is made of five (5) creeks, namely A, B, C, D and E.

All of those small watersheds near the mine site drain into the Nemiscau River (2,000 km   watershed  upstream  from  the  site)  itself,  a  tributary  to  the  Rupert 2 River that it joins 70 km downstream from the site. The Nemiscau River is on the western  perimeter  of  the  site  and  the  on-site  drainage  trends  west-southwest towards  the  Nemiscau  River.  The  largest  stream  on-site  is  the  one  that  drains Spodumène Lake with a watershed of over 100 km . The other on-site watersheds 2 are well under 5 km . 2

The largest lake in the vicinity of the site is Lac des Montagnes ,  with  a  surface area of 1,375 ha. It is located on the western perimeter of the Whabouchi Property and is actually a widening of the Nemiscau River. Spodumène Lake, to the east of the site, is only 61 ha.

Field  surveys  are  scheduled  in  the  spring,  summer  and  fall  of  2014  in  order  to refine  the  hydrological  portrait  of  the  Property's  surroundings  (cross-sections, flow measurements, stage gauge and level meter, bathymetric surveys, etc.).

## b) Soil Quality

In 2011, 21 exploration trenches were completed where the projected infrastructures are to be located. No results exceeded the applicable criteria C (for industrial  areas  such  as  mine  site).  The  results  of  the  soils  characterization completed for the Project indicate that there is no contamination in the unconsolidated deposits at the site.

The  Project  study  area  is  characterized  by  the  presence  of  unconsolidated deposits, essentially of glacial and fluvio-glacial origin. Globally, their thickness is less than four (4) m, except in an area northwest of Spodumène Lake, where the thickness  can  reach  approximately  15 m.  The  landscape  in  the  study  area  is dominated  by  rocky  hills  that  are  mostly  oriented  northeast/southwest.  Most  of these hills are low, with an elevation difference of less than 50 m.

The major part of the study area is characterized by the presence of undifferentiated till in thicknesses varying from one (1) m or two (2) m to more than ten (10) m. At the southwest of the study area, particularly on either side of the Nemiscau River, segments of the Sakami Moraine can be seen.

## c) Groundwater Quality

Hydrogeological  data  was  gathered  as  part  of  field  works  completed  in  2011 (WESA-Envir-Eau, 2012a) and 2012 (Qualitas, 2012). Few data on the hydrogeological characteristics of the site were available prior to the completion of  these  studies.  Field  data  was  used  in  order  to  perform  hydrogeological modelling  ( Richelieu Hydrogéologie , 2012  and  2014). The  results of that modelling  enable  portraying  the  hydrogeological  conditions  prevailing  on  the projected  mine  site  and  identifying  the  potential  impacts  of  the  Project  on groundwater.  Moreover,  groundwater  samples  were  collected  in  October  2011, November  2011,  March  2012  and  July  2012  in  21  wells  intersecting  soils  and rocks units.

The quality of the groundwater is characterized by a pH that varies from acid to alkaline (mean pH of 6.71), and a total dissolved solids content varying from low to  intermediate.  Only  traces  of  hydrocarbons  were  detected,  mostly  because  of past  exploration  activities  (all  wells  were  past  drill  holes).  Natural  background exceedances  of  the  'warning  level',  i.e.  half  the  applicable  Soil  Protection  and Rehabilitation of Contaminated Sites Policy (' SPRCSP ') criteria, were measured for aluminum, silver, copper, zinc and mercury.

Groundwater has been analysed at several well locations and results suggests that it  is  generally  of  good  quality.  Another  sampling  campaign  is  planned  in  late spring 2014.

## d) Surface Water Quality

Different water bodies and streams were sampled to learn the current quality of the surface water in August 2010, February 2012, July 2012 and December 2012. Generally,  the  water  was  acid,  with  low  alkalinity,  low  hardness  and  low mineralization.  Some  water  quality  criteria  set  by  Quebec  and/or  Canada  were exceeded, notably for copper, iron, lead and zinc.

A preliminary analysis of the surface water quality data to date indicates that the waters on and near the site are typical for this type of environment. The pH values range from 4.7 to 7.1, depending on water body and depth. Some of the waters are acidic,  something  which  is  common  for  Canadian  Shield  water  bodies.  Most  of the  chemical  analyses  show  values  under  the  detection  limits,  typical  of  poorly mineralized  oligotrophic  waters.  Alkalinity  and  calcium  levels  are  low  in  most stations,  indicating  some  sensitivity  to  acidification.  Results  indicate  the  most naturally abundant elements in surface water are sulphates, calcium, chlorides and sodium. The metals and metalloids content in surface water of the Study area is low. Exceedances of applicable criteria were measured for aluminum, copper, lead and zinc.

Three additional field campaigns are scheduled in spring, summer and fall of 2014 in order to ensure a close monitoring of surface water quality on the Property and its vicinity.

## e) Sediment Quality

One (1) sediment sampling campaign was performed in August 2010. Sampling was done at the exact same stations than surface water sampling, exception made of Lac des Montagnes .

Except for arsenic, cadmium, chromium, copper, mercury, nickel, lead and zinc, all  metals  and  metalloids  content  were  lower  than  the  method  detection  limit. Only copper content at one (1) station did exceed applicable criteria.

Sediment quality data taken to date in the lakes and watercourse suggests that they are  generally  of  good  quality  with  some  elevated  copper  values.  Additional sediment quality sampling will be done during summer 2014 in order to monitor changes in their quality.

## 20.1.2 Biological Environment

## a) Vegetation and Wetlands

Field surveys were completed in June 2012 by Botalys. Characterization efforts focused on terrestrial habitats and wetlands where the projected surface infrastructures  are  to  be  located  and  on  the  adjacent Spodumène bog  (located south-west of the projected pit).

The Whabouchi Project is located at the northern limit of the spruce-moss forest domain, in the continuous boreal forest sub-zone. Black spruce is the dominant tree species, with other species being found, notably white birch, trembling aspen and balsam poplar. Forest fires have modeled the forest dynamic in the Nemiscau area. The presence of many recent burns near the Project site is an indication of this  phenomenon.  In  fact,  recent  burns  represent  the  most  important  class  of vegetation in the Study area (80 % of the total impacted area).

Twenty-six  (36)  special-status  plant  species  could  potentially  be  present  in  the Project  study  area.  Due  to  the  features  of  the  Project  site,  three  (3)  of  these special-status  species  are  susceptible  of  being  found  in  bogs:  dragon's  mouth, linear-leaved sundew and twin-scaped bladderwort. Even though specific attention was  paid  to  those  species  as  part  of  2012  field  works,  none  was  observed. Moreover, no exotic invasive plant was observed on the Property.

## b) Terrestrial Wildlife

Ten (10) species of amphibians and reptiles could be present in the Study area. These  include  the  yellow-spotted  salamander,  American  toad,  wood  frog,  mink frog and common garter snake. Field works performed in late June and early July 2012 confirmed the presence of four (4) species (wood frog, mink frog, American toad and common garter snake). No special-status species of amphibian or reptile is reported in the Study area.

With regards to mammals, several species of large and small fauna are present in the Study area. Moose, woodland caribou and black bear are the three (3) species of  large  mammals  found  in  the  Study  area.  During  the  aerial  surveys,  five  (5) moose yards  with  individuals  present  were  observed,  while  neither  caribou  nor

black bear were seen. Gray wolf, North American beaver, marten and red fox are among the other mammals observed in the Study area.

Six (6) bat species could be present in the Project Study area. A nursery roost of approximately 300 little brown bat individuals is located near the Project site. This maternity is monitored by the MFFP (Department of Forests, Wildlife and Parks). There is a prior record of one (1) sighting of a hoary bat near Spodumène Lake. This species is considered as likely to be designated threatened or vulnerable by the  Quebec Government. This is a species that needs trees for roosting and the recent forest fires may have made the local area less attractive for this species.

Otherwise, 13 species of micromammals (small mammals, mice and voles) might be present in the Study area. These include the rock vole, southern bog lemming, deer mouse and arctic shrew. The deer mouse was the species captured most often during the inventories completed for the Whabouchi Project.

A total of ten (10) special-status mammals (Quebec Act Respecting Threatened or Vulnerable  Species  and  Canadian  Species  at  Risk  Act)  could  be  present  in  the Whabouchi Project Study area: the least weasel, rock vole, southern bog lemming, wolverine,  woodland  caribou  (forest  ecotype),  silver-haired  bat,  northern  longeared bat, hoary bat, red bat and little brown bat.

According  to  the  documentation  that  was  consulted,  131  bird  species  from  the four (4) following groups could be present in the Study area: waterfowl (geese, ducks and loons), other aquatic birds (gulls, herons, etc.), raptors (falcons, eagles, owls, etc.) and terrestrial birds (grouse, nighthawks, woodpeckers, etc.). Among the waterfowl, the Canada goose is the most abundant species during the spring migration,  while  during  the  fall  migration,  American  black  duck  is  the  most numerous. Seven (7) species susceptible of being present in the Study area have a special  status  at  the  provincial  and/or  federal  level:  golden  eagle,  common nighthawk,  peregrine  falcon,  short-eared  owl,  olive-sided  flycatcher,  bald  eagle and  rusty  blackbird.  One  (1)  bird  species,  the  common  nighthawk,  listed  as 'threatened' under the Federal Species at Risk Act, is present at the site.

The  site  is  not  located  in  any  protected  areas,  as  designated  by  the  Quebec  or Canadian governments.

## c) Fisheries and Fish Habitats

Fisheries  and  fish  habitat  assessment  works  were  completed  at  various  periods, i.e.  August  2010,  September  2011,  November  2011  and  late  June  /  early  July 2012.  Fish  populations  were  inventoried  using  experimental  fishing  nets,  bait traps, hoop nets and electrofishing.

Thirteen (13) fish species have been found in the lakes and streams near the site during fieldwork. The species caught most frequently is the lake whitefish. Other common species include white sucker, walleye, and brook trout.

Several of the fish species present are caught and eaten by local residents, notably brook trout, walleye, lake whitefish, and pike. In November 2011, over 100 fish tissue  samples  were  collected  and  preserved  for  chemical  analyses.  Preliminary

evaluation of the results from 40 of these fish suggests that levels of metals are generally  low.  Mercury  levels  were  above  detection  limits  in  all  samples.  The mercury  levels  were  consistently  higher  in  the  lake  whitefish  samples  from Spodumène Lake.

To  date,  no  special-status  aquatic  species  has  been  found  on  the  site.  Lake sturgeon  is a species considered  as  likely to be designated  threatened  or vulnerable in Quebec and is present in some nearby lakes (i.e., Nemaska Lake) and in the Rupert River system. However, there are no indications of its presence on  the  Nemiscau  River  drainage  area  this  far  up.  Local  people  have  stated  that they have not found it in this area.

Background  benthic  invertebrate  studies  were  undertaken  in  2010.  Benthic invertebrates  are  important  indicators  of  the  quality  of  aquatic  habitats.  Results show high variability between sites.

## 20.1.3 Water, Rock and Tailings Characterization

## a) Methods

In  order  to  determine  the  geochemical  characteristics  of  mine  materials  to  be produced  as part of the Whabouchi  Project  and  to  define the associated management requirements, an initial environmental geochemical characterization was  carried  out  in  2011  and  2012  (Lamont,  2013),  and  a  complementary characterization in 2014 (Roche, 2014).

## i) Initial Characterization

For  the  initial  characterization,  83  representative  samples  of  ore  and  waste rock  were  selected.  The  distribution  of  waste  rock  samples  reflected  the relative proportion of the various lithologies in the deposit (50 % basalt, 35 % gabbro,  10 %  pegmatite  and  5 %  volcanic  felsic  rock;  see  Table  20.2).  All samples were submitted to the following analysis/tests: Acid Rock Drainage (' ARD '),  total  contents  of  major  elements  (by  X-ray  fluorescence),  partial contents of various trace elements (following partial digestion by aqua regia) and  TCLP  (USEPA-1311)  leaching  test.  Most  of  the  samples  were  also submitted to radioactivity measurements as well as SPLP (USEPA-1312) and Shake  Flask  Extraction  (' SFE ')  leaching  tests.  All  waste  rock  composite samples  and  tailings  composite  samples  were  submitted  to  the  following analysis/tests: ARD, total contents of major elements (by X-ray fluorescence) and leaching kinetic test (humidity cell).

## ii) Complementary Characterization

Eighteen (18) of the 83 samples from the initial characterization were selected for the complementary  characterization.  The  distribution  of  waste  rock samples  reflected  the  relative  proportion  of  the  various  lithologies  in  the deposit and  average  sulphide  contents  (Table  20.2).  All  samples  were submitted  to  total  and  partial  contents  tests  (total  digestion,  aqua  regia)  for numerous elements, including rare metals (Sc, Ta, Nb, Rb, Cs and Y) and all rare earth elements (lanthanides). All samples were also submitted to TCLP

## b) Applicable Management Requirements

In  Quebec, Directive  019 for  the  mining  industry  is  the  document  used  by  the Department of Sustainable Development, Environment and the Fight to Climate Change (' MDDELCC ')  to  authorize  and  monitor  mining  projects.  It  should  be noted that in that document waste rocks, tailings, treatment sludge and dusts are all defined as 'mining residues' (or mining waste).

Directive  019 outlines  requirements  with  regards  to  the  characteristics  of  the residues (low risk, leachable, acid-generating, radioactive or high risk) and defines leakproofing  measures  to  be  applied  to  mining  waste  management  facilities, thereby  ensuring  groundwater  protection.  Figure  20.2  specifies  criteria  to  be considered in determining the leakproofing measures as depicted in Directive 019 .

Are  defined  as  'low  risk'  any  mining  residues  with  metal  concentrations  that comply with criteria A of the SPRCSP for a specific geological province (in this case, Superior Geological Province) or with the natural local background levels of the  area.  However,  residues  that  produce  a  leachate  with  concentrations  lower than  the  groundwater  protection  criteria  specific  to  'leachable'  mining  residues are also considered 'low risk', even if total metal content is greater than criteria A of the SPRCSP.

<!-- image -->

Figure: 20.2 - Criteria for Determining Leakproofing Measures to be applied to Mine Residues Accumulation Areas

Source: Directive 019 for the mining industry - March 2012

<!-- image -->

A sample is considered 'leachable' for a given element if its metal concentration is higher  than  Quebec's  SPRCSP  criteria  A  and  its  leachate  concentration obtained with TCLP 1311 test is higher than the SPRCSP groundwater protection criteria for surface water seepage. Leachable  residues  require groundwater protection measures. It is important to note that there are no criteria A for some metals.

Directive 019 specifies that 'acid generating' mining wastes are characterized by a sulfur content of more than 0.3 % and for which an acid generating potential has been confirmed by one (1) of the two (2) following conditions:

- · The net acid neutralizing potential (NP-AP) is lower than 20 kg CaCO3/t of residues; or,
- · The  acid  neutralizing  potential  ratio  (NP/AP)  is  lower  than  3.  'Acidgenerating' residues require groundwater protection measures.

<!-- image -->

In Quebec, materials are considered radioactive following the Regulation respecting  hazardous  materials  definition:  'radioactive  material'  means  any material that spontaneously emits ionizing radiations and for which the result of the following equation, calculated for one (1) kg of material, is greater than one (1):

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

- -Where  'C1,  C2,  C3,  ...  Cn'  represents  the  specific  activity  of  the radioactive material for each radioelement  it contains, expressed in kilobecquerels per kilogram (kBq/kg);
- -and  'A1,  A2,  A3,  ...  An'  is  expressed  in  kBq/kg  and  represents  the maximum activity listed in Schedule 1 for one (1) kg of material for each corresponding radioelement.

This  factor  represents  the  specific  activity  of  the  radioactive  material.  When  a mining waste is classified as 'radioactive', the Proponent must plan radioactive protection measures. In fact, it is considered more of a health and safety issue than an environmental issue.

Finally, 'high risk' material are defined as those that produce leachate with levels higher than those defined in Appendix II of Directive 019 or  as  material  that  is considered  radioactive  according  to Directive  019 's definition. 'High  risk' residues require the strictest groundwater protection measures.

## c) Results

## i) Acid Rock Drainage Potential

Some waste samples from the initial characterization showed ARD potential according to short-term static tests. However, kinetic tests carried out on two (2)  composite  waste  samples  (made  from  potentially  ARD  samples)  have shown that ARD is not an issue for the Whabouchi Project.

In fact, average sulphide content in the projected waste rock and tailings pile would  be  0.14 %.  Moreover,  the  sulphide  occurred  as  disseminated  grains scatter  randomly  across  the  deposit  (there  was  no  evidence  of  localized concentration of sulphide mineralization within either strata or veins systems) and therefore it is impossible to do segregation of various types of wastes.

## ii) Radioactivity

Radioactivity  characterization  has  shown  that  activities  of  all  measured radioelements  are  low.  This  is  consistent  with  the  very  low  content  of uranium and thorium in waste and ore from the deposit.

## iii) Leaching Potential

Concerning the leaching potential, conclusions from the Initial Characterization (Lamont, 2013) were:

<!-- image -->

- « Concentrations  of  selected  metals  were  elevated  in  leachate  from  the individual  TCLP,  SPLP  and  SFE  analyses  compared  to  the  SPRCSP Criteria  for  groundwater.  However,  results  of  the  TCLP  analyses  in combination with the results of the trace metal analyses indicated that the waste rock, ore and tailings samples were classified as 'Leachable' for only copper under the Directive 019 criteria ».
- « Results  of the kinetic tests indicated  that  metal  concentrations  in leachate from the long-term tests were low:
- o Metal  concentrations  in  the  leachate  from  all  the  different  humidity cells, over  the long-term,  were  below  the  SPRCSP  Criteria  for groundwater; and
- o Only  the  humidity  cell  leachate  from  two  samples  exceeded  the SPRCSP  for  copper,  for  the  pegmatite  sample  in  week  #1  and  the tailings sample in week #0. These concentrations, however, immediately declined to levels roughly an order of magnitude below the SPRCSP criteria and remained below the criterion for copper for the  remainder of the 46 week tests indicting that copper was mobile but release rates were very low ».
- « Results of geochemical investigation to assess the ARD/ML potential of the waste rock, ore, and tailings from the Whabouchi Lithium deposit were similar  to  typical  granitic  pegmatites  and  mafic  igneous  rock,  with generally low ARD and low ML potential ».

Results  from  the  Complementary  Characterization  confirmed  most  of  the results from  the Initial Characterization. However,  results from  TCLP leaching test showed that basalt and gabbro were not « leachable » for copper.

Results  from  TCLP  leaching  test  showed  that  basalt,  gabbro  and  volcanic felsic rock  could  be  «  leachable  »  for  aluminum.  However,  aluminum concentrations in leachates from kinetic tests were consistently lower (&lt;0.10 mg/L) than the groundwater protection criteria (0.75 mg/L).

Pegmatite waste and ore could also be « leachable » for beryllium. However, beryllium contents in leachates from kinetic tests performed on a pegmatite composite sample were consistently lower (0.00002 mg/L) than the groundwater protection criteria (0.00006 mg/L). Moreover, beryllium contents  in  leachates  from  kinetic  tests  performed  on  a  tailings  composite sample were lower (0.00002 mg/L) than the groundwater protection criteria from Week 12 to the end of the testing (Week 28). Considering the fact that tailings will represents only 27.6 % of all stockpiled materials, it is unlikely that beryllium concentrations in the percolation waters could be harmful for the environment.

<!-- image -->

## iv) Rare Earth and Rare Metals Contents

Only total contents of Cs, Ta and Rb in pegmatite and ore samples and Cs content  in  waste  rock  samples  were  significantly  higher  than  the  average contents of the surficial terrestrial crust. There are no applicable criteria for the vast majority of those elements.

## v) Conclusions

According to the results from the two (2) geochemical characterizations and following Directive 019 , Whabouchi mining residues are classified as:

-  Not 'high risk';
-  Not potentially 'acid-generating';
-  Not potentially 'leachable' according to TCLP and kinetic tests results.

In this context, no groundwater protection measures are required for the waste rock and tailings pile.

## 20.2 Jurisdictions and Applicable Laws and Regulations

The legal framework for the construction and operation of the projected facilities is a combination of provincial, national, and municipal policies, regulations and guidelines. The design  and  the  environmental  management  of  the  Project  facilities  and  activities must be done in accordance with this legal framework. Outlined below are the major steps through which Nemaska went or will have to go as Project development will move forward.

## 20.2.1 Recent Modifications to the Mining Act

The  Quebec  government  is  responsible  for  mining  activities  in  the  province.  This activity  is  subject  to  the  Mining  Act  which  defines  ownership  of  the  right  to  mineral substances  (claims,  mining  exploration  licenses,  mining  leases,  mining  concessions, etc.) and the rights and obligations of the claim holder or other mining right granted by the State.

The  Act  was  substantially  amended  and  modernized  by  Bill  70,  which  the  Quebec National  Assembly  adopted  on  December  9 th , 2013.  This  fourth  attempt  to  update Quebec's mining legislation follows on the heels of the defeat of Bill 43 and that of Bill 79  and  Bill  14  in  previous  legislative  sessions.  Within  the  specific  context  of  the Whabouchi Project, the following amendments are relevant:

- · Provisions  specific  to  aboriginal  communities  and  referring  to  an  aboriginal community consultation policy specific to the mining sector (obligation to consult aboriginal  communities  and  requirement  that  the  Minister  consult  aboriginal communities separately if the circumstances so warrant);
- · On each anniversary date of a mining lease or mining concession, the lessee or grantee  will  have  to  send  the  Minister  a  report  showing  the  quantity  of  ore

<!-- image -->

extracted during the previous year, its value, the duties paid under the Mining Tax Act during that period and the overall contributions paid;

- · Mining leases to be issued will require the prior approval of a rehabilitation and restoration plan and the issue of a Certificate of Authorization (' CA ') under the Environment Quality Act (' EQA '), unless the time needed to obtain a certificate is unreasonable.

With regards to the environment, it should be noted that the Mining Act, Chapter IV, Division  III,  specifies  that  the  holder  of  mining  rights  has  the  responsibility  to rehabilitate  and  restore  the  lands  on  which  exploration  and/or  development  activities have been carried out. This work must be completed in accordance with the restoration plan  pre-approved  by  the  Department  of  Energy  and  Natural  Resources  (' MERN '). Under  the  Mining  Act,  the  Regulation  respecting  mineral  substances  other  than petroleum,  natural  gas  and  brine  details  certain  procedural  requirements  of  the  Act, particularly in terms of the information and documents to be provided to the MERN on restoration measures and locations established to store mine tailings.

On July 23 rd ,  2013, the Government of Quebec passed amendments to the Regulation respecting mineral substances other than petroleum, natural gas and brine in order to set new  rules  concerning  the  financial  guarantees  required  for  the  restoration  of  mining sites.  Among other things, those result in an increase of the financial guarantee from 70 % to 100 % of the projected costs for the work required under the rehabilitation and restoration plan. The guarantee must cover not only restoration costs associated with the accumulation areas, but all costs for the entire mine site and associated infrastructures. It must be paid in three (3) annual instalments. The first instalment corresponds to 50 % of  the  total  amount  of  the  guarantee  and  must  be  paid  within  90  days  following  the receipt  of  the  approval  of  the  plan.  The  second  and  third  instalments  each  represent 25 % of the guarantee and must be paid in full by the first and second anniversary date.

Lastly, Bill 70 amends the Regulation respecting Environmental Impact Assessment and Review  in  order  to  require  an  environmental  impact  assessment  for  all  metal  ore processing  plant  construction  projects,  and  all  metal  mine  openings  and  operation projects where the processing or production capacity of the plant or the mine is 2,000 metric tonnes or more per day. However, it should be noted that since the Whabouchi Project is located in the territory governed by the JBNQA, this last modification does not  apply  to  it.  Indeed,  on  that  territory,  all  mining  projects  are  subject  to  the environmental impact assessment process, as outlined in the following Section.

## 20.2.2 Quebec Procedure relating to the Environmental Assessment of the Project

The Quebec EQA comprises two (2) Chapters. Chapter I gives general provision and Chapter II gives provisions applicable to the Eeyou Istchee / James Bay and Northern Quebec Region in accordance with the JBNQA, signed by the Native peoples of the northern regions.

The  environmental  assessment  procedures  established for northern projects vary according to whether the project is located south or north of the 55 th parallel.

<!-- image -->

Section 133 of the EQA defines the territory south of the 55 th parallel as: «the territory bounded to the north by the 55 th parallel, to the west by the boundaries of Ontario and of the Northwest Territories, to the east by the 69 th meridian and to the south by a line that coincides with the southern limit of the middle zone and the Cree traplines located to the  south  of  the  middle  zone,  as  determined  under  the  Act  respecting  hunting  and fishing rights in the Eeyou Istchee / James Bay and New Quebec territories (chapter D13.1), as well as to the Category I and II lands for the Crees of Great Whale River ».

The  Whabouchi  site  is  located  within  the  limit  of  the  territory  described  above,  also referred to as Eeyou Istchee / James Bay Region, or Eeyou Istchee for the Cree First Nation.

The procedure described in the EQA and the Regulation respecting the environmental and social impact assessment and review procedure applicable to the territory of Eeyou Istchee / James Bay and Northern Quebec, is presented in Figure 20.3.

- a) Project Subject to the Environmental and Social Impact Assessment and Review Procedure

Section 153 of the EQA gives the list of the projects automatically subject to the ESIA and review procedure and the project which are automatically exempt from that procedure.

The list of projects automatically subject to the procedure includes:

- · All mining developments, including the additions to, alterations or modifications of existing mining developments;

The Whabouchi site is therefore subject to the procedure.

Section 154 of the EQA specifies that: 'No person may undertake or carry out any project  which  is  not  automatically  exempt  from  the  assessment  and  review procedure, unless

- · A  certificate  of  authorization  has  been  issued  by  the  Minister,  after  the application of the assessment and review procedure; or
- · An attestation  of  exemption  of  the  project  from  the  assessment  and  review procedure has been issued by the Minister.'

The first step in the ESIA process involves the proponent gathering preliminary information  on  the  project.  The  proponent  must  submit  a  Project  Notice  to  the government administrator along with this preliminary information. Such Project Notice was tabled by Nemaska on August 2 nd , 2011.

The administrator sends this preliminary information to an Evaluation Committee (' COMEV ') which is responsible for defining the nature and extent of the impact study  (ESIA).  The  COMEV  formulates  guidelines  outlining  the  extent  of  the ESIA document to be prepared by the proponent. The guidelines are submitted to the administrator who transmits them to the proponent, something that was done on February 2 nd , 2012.

<!-- image -->

Figure 20.3 - Provincial ESIA Process Applicable to the Whabouchi Project

<!-- image -->

The proponent prepares the ESIA document in accordance with the administrator's guidelines. Nemaska  submitted its ESIA  document to the administrator  on  April  2 nd , 2013,  who  forwarded  the  studies  to  a  Review Committee (' COMEX '). First Nations, i.e. the Cree Nation Government, and the public  then  made  representations  to  the  committee,  which  may  decide  to  hold public hearings or any other type of consultation. Even though the COMEX has not yet confirmed that it would hold such hearings, Nemaska expects that, based on informal discussion with the relevant authorities, it will do so and that those will have been completed prior to Q4-2014.

On  October  29 th ,  2013,  the  COMEX  asked  for  additional  information  on  the Whabouchi Project  to  complete  its  analysis;  such  information  was  provided  by Nemaska on May 5 th , 2014.

The COMEX  will  finally recommend  whether  to reject or authorize the development  of  the  Project.  In  line  with  the  recommendation  made  by  the COMEX, the administrator grants or refuses authorization for the Project.

In Quebec, Directive 019 for the mining industry is the tool used by the authorities to analyse mining projects requiring the issuance of a certificate of authorization (' CA '). Directive  019 is  not  a  statutory  instrument,  but  an  orientation  text  that provide  with  expectations  from  the  Department  of  Sustainable  Development, Environment and the Fight to Climate Change (' MDDELCC '; formerly ' MDDEFP ') pertaining to mining projects. The MDDELCC uses this Directive within  the  scope  of  powers  it  has  by  the  EQA.  The Directive defines  tailings characteristics (low  risk, acid-generating,  leachable,  etc.) and  if it requires leakproofing  measures  to  be  applied  when  soils  do  not  meet  criteria  for  the protection  of  groundwater. Directive  019 contains  similar  requirements  than  the Canadian Metal Mining Effluent Regulations (' MMER ') regarding the quality of mining effluent.

## 20.2.3 Federal Procedure

The Canadian Environmental Assessment Act (' CEAA ' 2012) was introduced on July 6 th ,  2012.  Under  this  Act,  an  environmental  assessment  focuses  on  potential  adverse environmental effects that are within federal jurisdiction, including:

- · Fish and fish habitat;
- · Other aquatic species;
- · Migratory birds;
- · Federal lands;
- · Impacts that will or could potentially cross provincial or international boundaries;
- · Impacts on Aboriginal peoples, such as land use and traditional resources;
- · Impacts that are directly linked or necessarily incidental to any federal decisions about a project.

<!-- image -->

An environmental assessment will consider a comprehensive set of factors that include any cumulative effect, mitigation measure and comments received from the public.

According to CEAA (2012), proponents of designated projects are required to submit a description  of  the  designated  project  to  the  Agency  to  inform  on  whether  or  not  an environmental assessment of the designated project is required. The project description for the Whabouchi Project was tabled by Nemaska on December 14 th , 2012.

After  having  approved  the  Project  Description  and  determined  that  an  environmental assessment  is  required,  the  Canadian  Environmental  Assessment  Agency  posted  on January 29 th , 2013, a Notice of Commencement of the environmental assessment on the registry. The Agency then prepared a preliminary version of the guidelines relative to the environmental impact assessment. These guidelines were posted on the registry on January  29 th , 2013,  allowing  the  public  to  comment  on  the  proposed  studies  and methods as well as on the information that will be required for the environmental impact assessment.

The  CEA Agency  took  into  account  the  general  public's  comments,  including  the observations  made  by  Aboriginal  groups  and  federal  ministries  before  providing  the final version of the environmental impact assessment guidelines to the proponent, which it did in April 2013.

The  proponent  then  has  to  submit  to  the  CEA Agency  an  environmental  impact assessment identifying the environmental effects of the Project and propose measures to mitigate  these  effects,  while  accounting  for  the  CEA Agency's  guidelines.  Nemaska tabled its Environmental Impact Statement in March 2013.

Following the submission of the environmental impact assessment to the CEA Agency, the latter will ensure of its relevancy and accuracy. The CEA Agency may require that the proponent provides further clarifications or additional information to better understand  the potential environmental  effects and  the proposed  mitigation and preventive measures. Such additional information was requested by the CEA Agency in late  November  2013  and  Nemaska  provided  that  information  on  May  5 th ,  2014.  The CEA Agency may also decide to hold public hearings, something which was completed in November 2013.

Once its analysis will be completed, the CEA Agency will prepare a preliminary version of the environmental assessment report, which will include the CEA Agency's conclusions  on  the  potential environmental  effects  of the Project, the proposed mitigation measures, the significance of the residual adverse environmental effects of the Project and the requirements of the monitoring program. The CEA Agency will then invite  the  public  to  comment  on  this  preliminary  report  before  finalizing  it  and submitting it to the Minister of Environment.

If  the  Minister  decides  that  the  Project  is  not  likely  to  cause  any  significant  adverse environmental  effects  or  that  the  latter  are  considered  justifiable  by  the  Governor  in Council,  then  the  conditions  relative  to  the  mitigation  measures  and  the  monitoring program  to  be  respected  by  the  proponent  as  part  of  its  Project,  are  set  out  in  the assessment decision statement issued by the Minister.

<!-- image -->

An environmental assessment to be conducted by the CEA Agency must be completed within 365 days. This timeframe begins when the environmental assessment's Notice of Commencement is released on the website of the registry and ends when the Minister of Environment issues its decision as to whether or not the designated project is likely to cause  significant  adverse  environmental  effects.  It  is  important  to  note  that  such timeframe  does  not  include  time  taken  by  proponent  to  prepare  its  Environmental Impact Statement or to provide additional information requested by the CEA Agency.

The Minister may extend the deadline for a maximum of three (3) months in order to allow for a partnership with another authority or because of particular circumstances to the project. The Federal Cabinet has the authority to extend this deadline for more than three (3) months.

## 20.2.4 Environmental Permitting

Even if the project undergoes an environmental impact assessment and is authorized by the Government pursuant to the EQA, it would still be subject to section 22 of the EQA and must therefore obtain a certificate of authorization.

In  addition  to  the  mitigation  measures  set  out  as  part  of  the  environmental  impact assessment, the final project design must comply with all applicable standards relating to the proposed infrastructure and equipment.

The issuance of the certificate of authorization, however, should only be a formality as the  certificate  issued  pursuant  to  the  approval  of  the  ESIA  binds  the  Minister  as  to where he exercises the powers provided in section 22.

In addition to the certificate of authorization required under section 22 of the EQA, the proponent  must  obtain  the  permits,  authorizations,  approvals,  certificates  and  leases required from the appropriate authorities. Those are described in the upcoming Sections.

The  authorization  application  and  permitting  process  is  expected  to  take  one  (1)  full year.  Applications  may  be  filed  concurrently  with  the  construction  work  and  should therefore not impact on the Project schedule.

## a) Certificates of Authorization

## i) General Certificate of Authorization

In  order  to  carry  out  the  Whabouchi  Project,  one  (1)  or  more  CAs  will  be required  from  the  MDDELCC  under  section 22  of  the  EQA.  For  mining activities, CA applications must comply with the Directive 019 requirements.

Moreover,  because  the  Whabouchi  Project  will  involve  discharges  into  the aquatic environment, it will be necessary to complete the effluent discharge objectives application form ( Demande d'objectifs environnementaux de rejet (' OER ')  pour  les  industries )  and  attach  it  to  the  CA  application.  The  CA application forms and all required documents must be sent to the MDDELCC's Northern Quebec regional office. The time required to analyse an  application  for  a  certificate  of  authorization  directly  depends  on  the complexity of the project. Under the Declaration of Services to the Public, the Department  is  committed  to  providing  an  official  response  within  75  days

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

following  the  receipt  of  the  application  for  a  certificate  of  authorization  or approval.

The number of CA applications to prepare will depend on the timeline of the project activities and its associated work items. By dividing the project into predefined items, it will enable a step-by-step implementation process.

Under the Ministerial Order concerning the fees payable under the Environment  Quality  Act,  fees  are  payable  by  the  company  seeking  an authorization under the Act. The fees which are indicated in the Ministerial Order are approximately $ 1,000 to $ 5,000 for each request for an authorization under sections 22, 31, 32, 48 and 70.8 of the Act.

In addition, because some project activities may potentially affect fish habitat, authorization  from  the  MERN  may  be  required  under  section 128.7  of  the Conservation and Development of Wildlife Act (' CDWA '). In this case, the application  for  authorization  will  be  made  jointly  with  the  application  for  a certificate of authorization  under  section 22  of  the  EQA.  For  activities planned in aquatic environments and wetlands, the MERN and MDDELCC have established a single-window service for issuing authorizations required under the EQA and the CDWA.

- ii) Authorization  for  Water  Supply  Intakes  and  Devices  for  the  Treatment  of Drinking Water and Disposal of Wastewater

An authorization  under  section 32  of  the  EQA  is  needed  to  establish  water supply  intakes  and  drinking  water  and  wastewater  treatment  facilities.  Two (2)  forms  must  be  completed  and  signed  by  the  Project  engineer,  and  the required  documents  must  be  attached.  The  two  (2)  forms  are  the Demande d'autorisation pour réaliser un projet d'aqueduc et d'égouts (Application for authorization  to  carry  out  a  waterworks  or  waste  water  system  project)  and Présentation des demandes d'autorisation pour les systèmes de traitement des eaux usées d'origine domestique (Submission of applications for authorization for domestic wastewater treatment systems).

- iii) Authorization  to  Install  an  Apparatus  or  Equipment  to  Prevent,  Reduce  or Cause the Cessation of the Contaminants Release into the Atmosphere

Under  section 48  of  the  EQA,  an  application  for  an  authorization  must  be submitted  for  the  installation  of  an  apparatus  or  equipment  which  will prevent, reduce or cause the cessation of the release of contaminants into the atmosphere.  The  application  for  the  authorization  of  an  industrial  project ( Demande d'autorisation pour un projet  industriel )  must  be  completed  and submitted to the MDDELCC regional branch. The documents to be attached to this application are listed in the form.

<!-- image -->

## b) Approval for the Location of the Process Concentration Plant and Mine Tailings Management Facility

Under section 240 of the Mining Act, 'Any person who intends to operate a mill for  the  preparation  of  mineral  substances,  a  concentration  plant,  a  refinery  or  a smelter  shall,  before  commencing  its  operations,  have  the  site  approved  by  the Minister or, where the project is subject to the environmental impact assessment and review procedure provided for in Division IV.1 of Chapter I of the Environment Quality Act, by the Government.' Section 241 of the same Act also states,  'Every  person  responsible  for  the  management  of  a  concentration  plant, refinery or smelter shall, before commencing activities, have the site intended as a storage  yard  for  tailings  approved  by  the  Minister.  The  same  applies  to  every holder of a mining right, Owner of mineral substances or operator who intends to establish  a  mine  tailings  site.'  Consequently,  a  request  for  approval  must  be submitted to the MERN before the activities begin at the Whabouchi Mine. This request must include the information and documents as set out in sections 124 and 125  of  the  Regulation  respecting  Mineral  Substances  other  than  Petroleum, Natural Gas and Brine .

## c) Depollution  Attestation 1

In accordance with the Order in Council 515-2002 issued on May 1 st ,  2002, the Whabouchi Project requires a depollution attestation from the MDDELCC. This certificate, which is renewable every five (5) years, identifies the environmental conditions  that  must  be  met  by  the  industrial  facilities  when  carrying  out  its activities. The certificate compiles all of the environmental requirements relating to the operation of an industrial facility. The depollution attestation differs from the certificate of authorization issued under section 22 of the EQA. The latter is a statutory  document  issued  prior  to  the  implementation  of  a  project  or  activity, whereas the former applies strictly to the operation of an industrial facility. The steps included in the depollution attestation process are described below.

## i) Order in Council

The  process  for  the  issuance  of  a  depollution  attestation  was  implemented through the adoption by the Quebec Government of an order in council that subjects certain categories of industrial facilities to Subdivision 1 of Division IV.2  of  Chapter 1  of  the  EQA.  This  Subdivision  of  the  Act establishes the legal framework for the depollution attestation.

## ii) Application for a Depollution Attestation

The operator of an industrial facility which is subject to an order in council must  apply  to  the  Ministry  for  a  depollution  attestation  within  30  days following  the  issuance  of  the  certificate  of  authorization  issued  under section 22 of the EQA for the operation of its mine project. This application

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

must be made using the form provided by the Ministry that identifies all of the required information.

## iii) First Draft of Depollution Attestation

The  Ministry  will  prepare  and  submit  a  first  draft  of  the  depollution attestation to the industrial facility. The facility management has then 30 days to provide comments, as stipulated by the regulation.

## iv) Public Consultations

As stipulated by the regulation, the Ministry must publish a notice for public consultation in a daily or weekly newspaper within 90 days of the mailing date of the first draft of the depollution attestation. The Ministry must also make  the  request  and  project  attestation  accessible  to  public  consultation. These consultations must take place over a period of at least 45 days. The facility management  is  also  informed  of the project attestation being submitted to public consultation.

## v) Second Draft of Depollution Attestation

Following  the  public  consultations,  the  Ministry  will  review  the  comments that were  received  and  will  prepare  a  second  draft  of  the  depollution attestation. The second draft is submitted to the industrial facility management, which has 30 days to provide comments.

## vi) Issuing of Depollution Attestation

The  Ministry  will  review  the  final  comments  provided  by  the  industrial facility  management  and  will  prepare  the  final  version  of  the  depollution attestation,  which  will  be  issued  to  the  industrial  facility  management  for  a period of five (5) years.

The  facility  management  for  its  part  will  be  responsible  for  requesting  a renewal of its depollution attestation at least six (6) months before it expires. The original certificate will remain in effect until a new certificate is issued.

## d) Permits

## i) Forest Management Permit for Mining Activities

Under  section 73  of  the  Sustainable  Forest  Development  Act,  holders  of mining  rights  can  obtain  forest  management  permits  relating  to  mining activities in order to exercise their rights under the Mining Act. This permit holder is allowed to cut timber on the land covered by its mining rights for the construction  of  buildings  or  any  other  operations  necessary  for  its  mining activities, in compliance with the Sustainable Forest Development Act and its regulations. The applicant must have already obtained the right to operate the site for mining purposes, a right which is granted by the Mines Division of the MERN. Prior to proceeding with its timber cutting operations, the holders of mining rights must submit a written request to the MERN forest management unit in order to obtain a permit for its mining operations. The request can be

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

for  the  clearing  of  a  site  for  mining  activities,  the  exploratory  boring  of  a gravel bed or the clearing of a gravel or sand pit.

It  is  important  to  note  that  the  holder  of  a  forest  management  permit  for mining activities must scale all timber harvested in public land according to the  standards  prescribed  by  the  Government  regulation  and  as  specified  in section 75 of the Sustainable Forest Development  Act. The  holder is responsible  for  paying  the  prescribed  duty  as  stipulated  in  section 6  of  the Regulation respecting Forest Royalties.

- ii) High-Risk Petroleum Equipment Operating Permit

Under section 120 of the Safety Code, 'The Owner of a petroleum equipment installation that includes at least one (1) component  that  is high-risk petroleum  equipment  must  obtain  a  permit  for  the  use  of  all  the  high-risk petroleum  equipment  situated  at  the  same  address,  until  the  equipment  is removed from its respective place of use'.

- A  'high-risk' petroleum equipment as defined in section 8.01 of the Construction Code is having one (1) of the following characteristics:
- -For underground storage systems:
- o Capacity of 500 or more litres, used to store gasoline or diesel;
- o Capacity of 4,000 or more litres, used to store heating oil and heavy fuel  oil  except  for  equipment  used  for  heating  a  residential  singlefamily dwelling;
- -For aboveground storage systems:
- o Capacity of 2,500 or more litres, used to store gasoline;
- o Capacity of 10,000 or more litres, used to store diesel;
- o Capacity of 10 000 or more litres, used to store heating oil and heavy fuel  oil  except  for  equipment  used  for  heating  a  residential  singlefamily dwelling;
- o Storage tanks used to store gasoline, diesel, heating oil and heavy fuel oil for profit, regardless of their capacity.

The  'Application  for  a  Permit  for  the  Use  of  a  High-Risk  Petroleum Equipment' form must be completed and submitted to the Régie du bâtiment . This application must include all of the information and documents identified in  section 121  of  the  Safety  Code.  A  permit  is  valid  for  24  months.  The issuing and renewal of a high-risk petroleum equipment permit are subject to compliance and performance monitoring under the provisions of the Construction Code and the Safety Code.

<!-- image -->

## iii) Explosives Permit

Under the Act respecting Explosives, no person shall possess, store, sell or transport  any  explosives  unless  he  is  holding  a  permit  for  such  purpose. Depending  on  the  intended  usage,  several  permits  are  required  for  the possession of explosives for industrial or commercial purposes. Division II of the  Regulation  under  the  Act  respecting  Explosives  describes  the  different types  of  permits  that  are  required.  A  general  explosives  permit  entitles  the holder  to  have  explosives  in  his  possession.  Solely  the  holder  of  a  general permit  can  obtain  a  magazine,  sale  or  transport  permit.  A  magazine  permit entitles the holder of a general permit to purchase and store explosives in a container or a building that complies with the regulations. A transport permit entitles the holder of a general permit to transport explosives.

In  order  to  obtain  these  permits,  the  'Application  for  a  General  Explosives Permit'  and  the  'Application  for  a  Sales,  Magazine  or  Transport  Permit' forms,  which  are  available  from  the Sûreté  du  Québec (' SQ '),  must  be completed.  The  required  documents  and  fees  must  be  submitted  to  the  SQ. Permits are valid for a period of five (5) years.

## iv) Occupation Licence for Works Enabling Water to be Collected or Evacuated

The  MDDELCC  may  agree,  by  issuing  an  occupation  licence  and  by imposing a fee structure, to occupation of the  water property for non-profit purposes to install structures such as works enabling water to be collected or evacuated. A licence to occupy water property in the domain of the State is valid for a period of one (1) year. A licence is automatically renewed free of charge  year  after  year  and  becomes  invalid  automatically  by  law  when  the occupation for which it was authorized has ended.

## e) Leases

- i) Mining Lease

Under  section 100 of the Mining  Act,  'no  person may  mine  mineral substances,  except  surface  mineral  substances,  petroleum,  natural  gas  and brine, unless he has previously obtained a mining lease from the Minister or a mining concession under any former Act relating to mines'. In order to obtain a mining lease, a claim holder must establish the existence of the presence of an economic deposit. Applications must be submitted to the Registrar's Office or to the regional office. The initial term of a mining lease is 20 years. The lease can then be renewed every ten (10) years for the duration of the mining operation.  The  procedure  for  obtaining  a  mining  lease  is  described  in  the MERN's online publication 'Mining Leases and Concessions'.

## ii) Non-Exclusive Lease for the Mining of Surface Mineral Substances

According to section 109 of the Mining Act, ' a lessee or a grantee may use, for their mining activities, sand and gravel that is part of the domain of the State except where the land that is subject to the lease is already subject to an exclusive  lease  to  mine  surface  mineral  substances  in  favour  of  a  third

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

person'.  The  mining  of  sand  and  gravel  located  outside  of  mining  leases requires a non-exclusive lease for the mining of surface mineral substances, under section 140 of the Mining Act. The applicant must make a request for a non-exclusive lease by completing the 'Application for Non-Exclusive Lease (' BNE ')  for  Mining  Surface  Mineral  Substances'  form  and  providing  the documents identified in section 3 of the form.

## iii) Lease for the Occupation of the Domain of the State

Under  section 239  of  the  Mining  Act, ' the  holder  of  mining  rights  or  the Owner of mineral substances may, in accordance with the Act respecting the Lands in the Domain of the State, obtain that public lands be transferred or leased to him to establish a storage site for tailings, or a site for mills, shops or facilities necessary for mining activities'. Some components of the Whabouchi Project may be located outside of the lands covered by the mining lease.  Since the Project is located on public lands, the land in question will need  to  be  leased  under  section 47  of  the  Act  respecting  the  Lands  in  the Domain of the State.

## f) Federal Permitting

- i) Fisheries Act and Metal Mining Effluent Regulations

Section 35 of the Fisheries Act specifies that:

- 1) No person shall carry on any work, undertaking or activity that results in the harmful alteration or disruption, or the destruction, of fish habitat.
- 2) A  person may  carry on a work, undertaking or activity without contravening subsection 1 if:
- a) The work, undertaking or activity is a prescribed work, undertaking or  activity, or  is carried  on  in  or  around  prescribed  Canadian fisheries waters, and the work, undertaking or activity is carried on in accordance with the prescribed conditions;
- b) The carrying on of the work, undertaking or activity is authorized by the  Minister  and  the  work,  undertaking  or  activity  is  carried  on  in accordance with the conditions established by the Minister;
- c) The carrying on of the work, undertaking or activity is authorized by a prescribed person or entity and the work, undertaking or activity is carried on in accordance with the prescribed conditions;
- d) The  harmful  alteration  or  disruption,  or  the  destruction,  of  fish habitat is produced as a result of doing anything that is authorized, otherwise permitted or required under this Act; or
- e) The work, undertaking or activity is carried on in accordance with the regulations.

When a project includes a known risk of affecting fish and fish habitat, such a project  must  be  submitted  to  Fisheries  and  Oceans  Canada  (' DFO ')  for  its

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

review. The general process that must be followed is described on the DFO website.  The  'Proponent's  Guide  to  Information  Requirements  for  Review under the Fish Habitat Protection Provisions of the Fisheries Act' identifies the  information  requirements  for  a  detailed  review  by  DFO.  In  order  for  a project  to  be  reviewed,  the  proponent  must  have  previously  completed  the form 'Request for Review under the Fish Habitat Protection Provisions of the Fisheries  Act'.  The  request  must  be  submitted  to  the  local  Fish  Habitat Management Office.

There are three (3) possible outcomes following a DFO review:

- -Mitigation measures (included in the project design or proposed by DFO are  sufficient  to  avoid  or  mitigate  the  negative  impacts  to  fish  and  fish habitat - DFO issues a 'Letter of Advice';
- -The  residual  damage  to  the  fish  habitat cannot  be  avoided,  but  is considered to  be  acceptable  -  an  authorization  for  a  Harmful  Alteration, Disruption or Destruction of fish habitat (' HADD ')  and  a  compensation for fish habitat loss are required;
- -The project will have unacceptable impacts on fish and fish habitat - the project cannot proceed as designed.

The  Ministry  will  issue  in  most  cases  an  authorization  if  the  compensation plan results in no net loss of fish habitat. Additional fish habitat characterization  works  are  scheduled  in  2014  to  determine  whether  the Whabouchi Project is expected to require or not an authorization for HADD and a compensation for the loss of habitat.

Nemaska  will  also  have  to  establish  an  Environmental  Effects  Monitoring Program (' EEMP '). This is a requirement for regulated mines in accordance with the Metal Mining Effluent Regulations (' MMER ') under the authority of the Fisheries Act. The objective of the EEMP is to evaluate the effects of mine  effluents  on  fish,  fish  habitat  and  the  use  of  fisheries  resources  by humans. Directive  019 sets  at  the  provincial  level  the  criteria  that  mine effluents  must  comply  with  at  the  end-of-pipe.  The  EEMP  examines  the effectiveness of the environmental protection measures directly in the aquatic ecosystems, i.e. downstream of the final discharge point. The EEMP consists of biological monitoring and effluent and water quality monitoring as follows:

- -Effects on fish are assessed through comparison of adult fish exposed to effluent with unexposed fish;
- -Effects  on  fish  habitat  are  assessed  through  a  comparison  on  benthic invertebrate communities from areas exposed and unexposed to effluent;
- -Effects  on  the  use  of  fisheries  resources  are  assessed  by  comparing  the designated  contaminants  (i.e., mercury  for  metal  mines)  in  fish  tissue against health guidelines for fish consumption.

<!-- image -->

Moreover, the effluent quality is monitored through sub-lethal toxicity testing. For  metal  mines,  an  effluent  characterization  and  water  quality  monitoring studies are also required.

The  requirement  of  an  EEMP  is  to  be  reviewed  as  more  information  is collected  and  when  a  better  assessment  of  the  impact  of  effluents  on  the aquatic environment is available.

Finally, it should be noted that Project design was done in a way that no fish habitats will be directly impacted by the implementation of any accumulation areas  (no  encroachment  in  fish  habitat).  Consequently,  those  infrastructures will not have to be listed in Appendix 2 of the MMER.

## ii) Licence for Explosives Factories and Magazines

Under section 7(1) a)  of  the  federal  Explosives  Act,  a  licence  issued  by  the Minister  of  Natural  Resources  Canada  is  required  for  the  operation  of explosives plants and magazines in Canada.

It is reported that there will be no explosives plant on site. Also, according to section 2 of the same Act, the term 'magazine' excludes:

'a place where an explosive is kept or stored exclusively for use at or in a mine or quarry in a province in which provision is made by the  law  of  that  province  for  efficient  inspection  and  control  of explosives'.

In Quebec, the Act respecting Explosives provides for the issuing of permits, the  inspection  and  the  control  of  activities  associated  with  explosives  (see Section d)20.2.4 d)iii)) of this Report).

Thus,  no  licence  for  explosives  should  be  required  from  Natural  Resources Canada.  If  modifications  were  to  be  implemented  to  the  Project  so  that  it would require the operation of an explosives plant or magazine, such license would be necessary. However, obtaining it would not have any impact on the permitting schedule after consideration of the recent modifications applied to the CEAA 2012.

## g) Municipal Permitting

In  January 2014, the former Municipality of James-Bay was replaced by a new regional government made up of 11 Cree representatives and 11 representatives from  the  surrounding  non-aboriginal  communities  in  the  Eeyou  Istchee  /  James Bay  region,  namely  the  Eeyou Istchee /  James  Bay  Regional  Government  (see Section 20.4.1 of this Report).

## i) Certificate of Compliance with Municipal Regulations

Under section 8 of the Regulation respecting the application of the EQA, 'A person who applies for a certificate of authorization shall also submit to the Minister  a  certificate  attesting  that  the  project  does  not  contravene  any municipal by-law. The certificate shall be issued by the clerk or the secretary-

<!-- image -->

treasurer of a local municipality or, in the case of an unorganized territory, of a  regional  county  municipality'.  Requests  for  certificates  must  therefore  be submitted  to  the  Eeyou-Istchee  /  James  Bay  Regional  Government  for  the Whabouchi Project's activities, except for those activities defined in section 246 of the Act Respecting Land use Planning and Development .

## ii) Municipal Permits

Other  minor  permits  are  required  from  the  Eeyou-Istchee  /  James  Bay Regional Government for certain activities that do not require a certificate of authorization under section 22 of the EQA.

## 20.2.5 Rehabilitation and Mine Closure Plan

Section 232.1 of the Mining Act states that:

The following persons must submit a rehabilitation and restoration plan to the Minister for approval and carry out the work provided for in the plan:

- · Every  holder  of  mining  rights  who  engages  in  exploration  work  determined  by regulation or agrees that such work be carried out on the land subject to his mining rights;
- · Every  operator  who  engages  in  mining  operations  determined  by  regulation  in respect of mineral substances listed in the regulations;
- · Every person who operates a concentration plant in respect of such substances;
- · Every  person  who  engages  in  mining  operations  determined  by  regulation  in respect of tailings.

The obligation shall subsist until the work is completed or until a certificate is issued by the Minister under section 232.10.

As stated in section 101, 'the [mining] lease cannot be granted before the rehabilitation and restoration plan is approved in accordance with this Act, and the CA mentioned in sections 22, 31.5, 164 or 201 of the EQA (chapter Q-2) has been issued.'

Hence, a rehabilitation plan will have to be prepared as part of the Project and approved by  the MERN.  The  rehabilitation  and  restoration  plan  should  be  elaborated  in accordance with the provincial  Guidelines for  Preparing  a  Mining  Site  Rehabilitation Plan and General Mining Site Rehabilitation Requirements (1997) which provides to the proponents the rehabilitation requirements. This Study accounts for costs of all works needed  for  the  rehabilitation  of  a  mining  site  following  the  Regulation  respecting Mineral Substances other than Petroleum, Natural Gas and Brine.

## a) General Principles

The main objective of mine site rehabilitation is to restore the site to a satisfactory condition by:

- · Eliminating unacceptable health hazards and ensuring the public safety;

<!-- image -->

- · Limiting the production and circulation of substances that could damage the receiving  environment  and  trying  to  eliminate  long-term  maintenance  and monitoring;
- · Restoring  the site to a condition  which  is visually acceptable  to the community;
- · Reclaiming  the  areas  where  the  infrastructures  are  located  (excluding  the accumulation areas) for future use.

## Specific objectives are to:

- · Restore degraded environmental resources and land uses;
- · Protect important ecosystems and habitats of rare and endangered flora and fauna, which favors the re-establishment of biodiversity;
- · Prevent or minimize future environmental damage;
- · Enhance the quality of specific environmental resources;
- · Improve the capacity of eligible organizations to protect, restore and enhance the environment; and,
- · Undertake  resource  recovery  and  waste  avoidance  projects  and  prevent and/or reduce pollution.

The general guidelines of a rehabilitation plan include:

- · Favouring a progressive restoration to allow for a rapid re-establishment of biodiversity;
- · Implementing a monitoring and surveillance program;
- · Maximizing recovery of previous land uses;
- · Establishing new land uses;
- · Promoting habitat rehabilitation using operational environmental criteria;
- · Ensuring sustainability of restoration efforts.

The  mine  site  rehabilitation  plan  focuses  on  land  reclamation,  reclamation  of tailings  area  and  water  basins,  and  of  surface  drainage  to  prevent  erosion.  The successful  completion  of  a  rehabilitation  plan  will  ensure  that  the  project  will result in a minimum of disturbance. Site inspections will be carried out before the property is returned to the Government.

The rehabilitation concept for the current Project is described below and complies with  the  requirements  described  in  the  Guidelines  for  Preparing  a  Mining  Site Rehabilitation Plan and General Mining Site Rehabilitation Requirements and the current legislation.

## b) Mining Site Rehabilitation Plan Concept

The rehabilitation and restoration plan concept is summarized as follows:

- i) Waste Rock and Tailings Pile
- -Exposed surfaces of the accumulation areas (waste rock and tailings piles, overburden piles) will be covered with a layer of top soil/overburden and revegetated when feasible.
- ii) Haul Roads
- -Surface will be scarified and revegetated.
- iii) Industrial Complex and Buildings
- -No building will be left in place. Whenever possible, buildings will be sold with the equipment they contain, completely or partially. During dismantling works, beneficiation/recycling of construction material will be maximized. Remaining waste will be disposed of in an appropriate site.
- -All equipment and machinery will be disposed of or recycled off-site.
- -The explosives magazine, if any, and related facilities will be dismantled.
- -The  drinking  water  supply  and  domestic  wastewater  treatment  facilities will be dismantled.
- -Infrastructure relating to electricity supply and distribution will be dismantled with the exception of Hydro-Québec requirements.

All  underground  services  (power  lines,  pipelines,  water  and  sewer  pipes,  etc.) shall remain in place since they are unlikely to cause any environmental damage. Openings and access to such pipelines, however, shall be sealed.

## c) Open Pit

The surface exploitation of a mineral substance is common in Quebec. Many open pits  that  are  created  to  extract  a  mineral  substance  or  ore  are  therefore  found throughout  the  province.  Unlike  quarries  that  are  essentially  developed  on  rock outcrops, ore deposits can be located below the surface, which means pits could be  filled  with  groundwater.  In  many  open  pit  mines,  water  could  rise  to  the overburden contact without the dewatering wells.

Once mining activities cease, the pit will gradually fill up to its equilibrium level with  rainfall  and  groundwater.  The  overburden  slope  around  the  pit  will  have already been established for a safe operation of the mine. No special work in this regard will be required upon the cessation of mining activities.

To  permanently  close  pit  access  roads,  an  embankment  two  (2) m  high  will  be built using waste rock, along with an equivalent crest line. A ditch two (2) m wide and one (1) m deep will be excavated in front of the embankment.

## d) Environmental Aspects

- i) Drainage

Whenever possible, the surface water drainage pattern will be re-established to a condition similar to the original hydrological system.

## ii) Topsoil Management

During  the  site construction period and  overburden  stripping  over  the orebody,  overburden  and  topsoil  will  be  stored  separately  and  used  for revegetation purposes. Slopes of the overburden storage area and flat surfaces will ultimately be seeded and revegetated.

- iii) Waste Management

Waste material from demolition activities will be:

- -Decontaminated when required;
- -Recycled when cost-effective;
- -Buried in an appropriate site;
- -All non-contaminated waste will be sent to an appropriate site.

## iv) Hazardous Materials

Facilities  containing  petroleum  products,  chemicals,  solid  waste,  hazardous waste, and/or contaminated soil or materials will be dismantled and managed according to regulatory requirements.

All hazardous  waste  will  be  managed  according  to  existing  laws  and regulations and will be transported off site.

## v) Characterization Study

The Land Protection and Rehabilitation Regulation, which came into force on March 27 th ,  2003,  contains  several  provisions  concerning  land  protection  in the new section IV.2.1 of the EQA.  The term 'land' also includes groundwater and surface waters. The Regulation sets limit values for a range of  contaminants,  and  specifies  the  categories  of  targeted  commercial  or industrial activities. The mining industry is one of the categories subject to the Regulation.

For  the  mining  industry,  this  generally  entails  an  undertaking  of  a  site characterization study within six (6) months following the termination of the mine operations. In cases where the contamination were to exceed the criteria set  for  in  the  Regulation,  a  rehabilitation  plan  which  would  specify  the environmental protection measures to be undertaken must be submitted to the MDDELCC for its approval.

Waste  rocks  and  mine  tailings  are  not  soils  and  are  not  covered  by  this Regulation. The characterization study will address the areas that are likely to

<!-- image -->

have  been  contaminated  by  human  activities,  specifically  the  handling  of petroleum products.

## e) Monitoring Program and Post-closure Monitoring

According to Directive 019 ,  a  Monitoring Program will have to be implemented during  the  mine  operation  to  account  for  all  the  requirements  specified  in  that Directive ,  especially with regards to noise levels, vibrations, surface and ground waters.

## i) Physical Stability

The  physical  stability  of  dams  and  of  the  waste  rock  and  tailings  pile  will need to be assessed, and signs of erosion will be noted. This monitoring will be conducted on an annual basis for a minimum of five (5) years following mine closure.

## ii) Environmental Monitoring

Monitoring of the water quality (surface and groundwater) will continue for a minimum of five (5) years after the completion of the restoration work.

## iii) Agronomic Monitoring

The agronomic monitoring program is designed to assess the effectiveness of the revegetation which will be done as part of mining rehabilitation efforts.

To  document  the  success  of  the  revegetation  efforts  over  the  accumulation areas, an agronomic monitoring will be undertaken following the establishment  of  a  vegetative  cover  on  the  areas  subject  to  the  progressive restoration program. This monitoring will be conducted annually for three (3) years  following  the  revegetation  efforts.  Reseeding  will  be  carried  out,  as required, in areas where revegetation is found unsatisfactory.

## 20.3 Water Management

## 20.3.1 Assumptions

## a) Surface Runoff

Weather data from existing weather stations, i.e. Chapais-2 (229 km), Nemiscau A (21 km)  and La  Grande  Rivière A  (241 km),  was  used  to  estimate  rain  and snowfall  in  the  area.  Interpolated  climatic  design  data  was  also  obtained  from Environment  Canada  and  Weather  Analytics.  The  annual  average  precipitation was estimated at 772 mm/y (including both rainfall and snowmelt). Evapotranspiration  rates  were  used  considering  land  types  (tailings,  waste  rock, open  pit,  etc.;  Table  20.3).  Those  rates  were  determined  following  numerical simulations performed for a different mine project located in a region with similar weather conditions.

Following  modifications  to  the  site  general  arrangement  plan  adopted  since  the previous NI 43-101  compliant  Preliminary Economic  Assessment,  the  total surface area covered by the projected infrastructures (roads, dams, open pit, waste

<!-- image -->

rock and tailings pile, overburden pile, mill and garage, sedimentation ponds, etc.) was reduced by about 23 ha (-13 %). Among the most significant reductions are the  areas  covered  by  the  mill  and  garage  area  (-63 %),  dams  (-95 %),  the overburden pile (-41 %) and the waste rock and tailings pile (-10 %). Consequently, runoff water to be managed on site was also significantly reduced.

As part of this Study, it is considered that runoff water to be managed annually on the  projected  Whabouchi  mine  site  will  vary  from  0.77  Mm³/y  at  Year 1  to 0.90 Mm³/y at Year 26.

Table 20.3 - Average Runoff and Evapotranspiration Rates Considered for Water Management

|                                   | Tailings  Area,  Overburden   | Waste Rock,  Open Pits,   Ore  Stockpile   | Built  Areas   | Natural  Areas  (lands, lakes)   |
|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------------------------|
| Annual Average Runoff             | 75 %                          | 70 %                                       | 80 %           | 60 %                             |
| Annual Average Evapotranspiration | 25 %                          | 30 %                                       | 20 %           | 40 %                             |

## i) Pit Dewatering

As  outlined  in  Section 20.1.1 a)  of  this  Report,  hydrogeological  data  was gathered as part of field works completed in 2011 (WESA-Envir-Eau, 2012) and 2012  (Qualitas, 2012). Field data was  used  in order to perform hydrogeological  modelling  ( Richelieu  Hydrogéologie ,  2012  and  2014).  The model  prepared  in  2012  was  also  updated  using  the  new  site  general arrangement plan (pit design). The results of that modelling enable portraying the  hydrogeological  conditions  prevailing  on  the  projected  mine  site  and identifying the potential impacts of the Project on groundwater. It concluded that pit dewatering will have to take place over the course of the entire mine Project  and  that  it will generate  annually  from  292 m³/y  at  Year 1  to 0.91 Mm³/y at Year 26 (including open pit and underground infrastructures).

## ii) Final Effluent

Based on the above information on surface and ground water to be managed annually as part of the Whabouchi Project, Table 20.4 presents the estimated flow at the final effluent. It is important to understand that there will be only one (1) final effluent as per Quebec's Directive 019 and that it will be located in the Lac des Montagnes ; a subaqueous pipeline will be located about 1.4 km from the shore and about 14-m deep to maximise dispersion in natural waters and enable total compliance with Quebec's Environmental Discharge Objectives (' EDO ') to be determined for the Whabouchi Project.

## b) Preliminary Water Management Plan

As part of the environmental and social impact assessment process, a preliminary water management plan was elaborated in order to adequately manage all waters generated as part of the Whabouchi Project, including all precipitation following

<!-- image -->

Directive 019 requirements (1:100 flood/storm event). Figure 20.4 illustrates the proposed Water Management Plan.

Figure 20.4 - Water Management Plan

Surface ditches will enable the diversion of surface water before they enter the site so  that  only  areas  directly  impacted  by  the  infrastructures  will  generate  runoff water to be managed.

Five (5) sedimentation ponds will be located in strategic areas (topographic lows) around  the  waste  rock  and  tailings  pile  as  well  as  around  the  garage,  mill  and temporary  ore  stockpile.  Waters  running  off  these  areas  will  be  collected  by ditches and ultimately either flow or be pumped to the waste rock and tailings pile pond. From there, a pipeline will get water to the mine water basin, located southwest  of  the  open  pit.  This  basin  will  also  collect  water  generated  as  part  of  pit dewatering activities as well as waters running off the pit area.

The final effluent, following Directive 019 's definition, will be located at the end of the mine water basin, which will act as a polishing pond (water treatment for Total Suspended Solids; ' TSS '). It will be discharged in the Lac des Montagnes at  about  1.4 km  from  the  shore  and  about  14-m  deep.  As  outlined  in  Section 20.1.1 a), additional hydrological measurements (flow, stage gauging, water level, bathymetry, etc.) will be completed in 2014 (spring, summer and fall) in order to precisely model the dispersion of the final effluent in the lake and ensure its full compliance  with  all  provincial  and  federal  quality  criteria  (ex. Directive  019 , EDO, MMER, etc.).

As  showned  in  Figure  17.1,  it  should  be  noted  that  all  process  waters  will  be recirculated/reused and that no discharge of any process water is projected, except for entrapped (interstitial) water in tailings (less than 5 % w/w). Such recirculation rate is possible considering the type of tailings management that was selected as part of the Whabouchi Project, i.e. dry stacking.

Waters running off areas not to be managed with the final effluent, such as the overburden pile and mining roads, will also be collected through ditches but will be discharged in the natural environment at 20 m away from the nearest lake or river  (at  high-water  mark),  as  per  the  Regulation  respecting  standards  of  forest management for forests in the domain of the State.

All ditches and ponds were designed considering Directive 019 's criteria for water management, i.e. considering a 1:100 flood/storm event.

Drainage ditches were designed using the following criteria:

- · Trapezoidal geometry;
- · Minimum width of one (1) m;
- · Minimum depth of one (1) m;
- · Slope: 2:1;
- · Minimum longitudinal slope of 0.5 %;
- · Maximum water speed of four (4) m/s and minimal riprap of 100-200 mm;
- · Distance of three (3) m between the ditch and the infrastructure;
- · Four-metre (4-m) wide area for maintenance.

<!-- image -->

Sedimentation ponds (Table 20.5) were designed using the following criteria:

- · Slope: 3:1;
- · One metre (1-m) freeboard at the maximum operation level;
- · Riprap located where ditch enters.

The mine water basin was designed using the following criteria:

- · Capacity determined considering the maximum monthly precipitation;
- · Maximum elevation of the dike 300 m ASL;
- · Two-metre 2-m freeboard at maximum operation level;
- · Emergency spillway (2 m below the dike crest);
- · Impermeable core in the dike;
- · Minimum lateral slope of 3:1.

Table: 20.5 - Sedimentation Ponds Characteristics

|        |   Length (m) |   Width (m) |   Height (m) | Approx. volume   (m³)   |
|--------|--------------|-------------|--------------|-------------------------|
| Pond A |           50 |          25 |            2 | 3,400                   |

| Pond E |           30 |          25 |            2 | 2,200                   |
| Pond F |           40 |          25 |            2 | 2,800                   |

## 20.3.2 Final Effluent Water Treatment

Based on the information depicted in Section 20.1.3 of this Report, it can be concluded that no specific treatment will be required at the final effluent other than the presence of a polishing pond to ensure full compliance with the applicable TSS criteria. It should be noted that not only will the mine water basin acts as such polishing pond, but as well the five (5) other sedimentation ponds located around the waste rock and tailings pile, the mill and garage area and the temporary ore stockpile (Figure 20.4).

As depicted in Table 20.4, a maximum of about 1.82 Mm³/y (or 5,000 m³/d) will be discharged  at  the  final  effluent.  Considering  both  the  maximum  monthly  flow  on  an annual basis (i.e. October) and on a historical basis (1980-2014), Table 20.6 shows the required retention capacity to enable compliance with applicable TSS criteria.

The  location  of  the  Mine  Water  Basin  is  within  a  natural  « valley »,  as  depicted  on Figure  20.4,  where  naturally  available  volume  is  significant.  The  capacity  of  the projected mine water basin is estimated at 26,000 m³ considering no excavation works. When  compared  to  the  information  presented  in  Table  20.6,  this  confirms  that  the capacity  of  the  mine  water  basin  is  definitely  sufficient  to  decant  TSS  as  part  of  the Whabouchi Project, especially considering that the particle size distribution of the TSS is projected to be similar to silt.

Monitoring at the final effluent will take place on a continuous basis as per applicable provincial and federal regulations ( Directive 019 , MMER,  etc.)  to ensure full compliance with all applicable quality criteria.

## 20.4 Relations With Stakeholders

## 20.4.1 Social Studies

Information pertaining to local demographics, economic development, land use, cultural heritage,  health  and  social  services,  and  infrastructure  has  been  collected  in  order  to provide  a  snapshot  of  the  community's  needs  and  priorities  and  to  determine  how current conditions may be affected by the proposed Whabouchi Project.

Results  are  based  largely  on  data  obtained  from  the  local  First  Nations  government (Cree  Nation  of  Nemaska  Band  Council),  local  social  service  providers,  educational institutions,  law  enforcement,  and  Census  Canada,  as  well  as  on  data  obtained  from engagement with land users and community stakeholders (ex. in-depth semi-structured interviews with trapline R20 family and other Cree users, focus groups, etc.).

Efforts were made to create and maintain a collaborative and cordial relation with the community, in particular with families affected by the Project, in order to address issues as they emerge throughout the course of consultations and Project development.

## a) Historical Background and Social Changes

The  James  Bay  Crees  occupy  the  immense  territory  called  Eeyou  Istchee,  of which the limits are defined in the JBNQA, the first major agreement concluded between the Government of Quebec, the Crees and the Inuits of northern Quebec

<!-- image -->

in  1975.  The  JBNQA,  the Paix  des  Braves (Agreement  Respecting  a  New Relationship Between the Cree Nation and the Government of Quebec) and the Agreement Concerning a New Relationship Between the Government of Canada and  the  Cree  of  Eeyou  Istchee  constitute  the  legal,  political  and  administrative framework through which we can understand the accelerated growth and social development of the signatory communities, which in turn influenced the way of life and the occupation of the land.

The territory of the Crees, namely Eeyou Istchee, comprises nine (9) communities.  These  communities  are  located  on  the  shore  of  the  James  and Hudson bays (Whapmagoostui, Chisasibi, Wemindji, Eastmain, Waskaganish) as well  as  inland  (Nemaska,  Waswanipi,  Oujé-Bougoumou,  Mistissini).  The  total population of the Cree Nation of Eeyou Istchee is currently estimated at close to 17,000 persons, the majority of which speaks English.

The  territory  of  each  Cree  community  is  subdivided  into  a  variable  number  of family hunting grounds or trapping territories (traplines), each under the authority of a tallyman whose  role  consists, among  others,  in ensuring the proper management of exploitable resources and of the areas to preserve.

The Cree communities are united under the Grand Council of the Crees (' GCC ') of  Eeyou  Istchee  and  its  administrative  branch,  the  Cree  Nation  Government (' CNG '). Furthermore, since January 1 st , 2014, the Cree and Jamesians (the nonAboriginal regional population) are unified under the new Eeyou Istchee / James Bay Regional Government, established pursuant to the Agreement on Governance in  the  Eeyou  Istchee  /  James  Bay  Territory.  This  regional  government  offers  a new model, formally constituted with equal representation of Aboriginal and nonAboriginal  populations.  It  exercise  powers  of  local  and  regional  municipal governance,  regional  development  and  land  and  resource  use  planning  over  the Category III lands of the Eeyou Istchee / James Bay region.

## b) Socio-Economic Baseline of the Cree Nation of Nemaska

The Cree Nation of  Nemaska,  which  means  'plenty  of  fish',  is  situated  on  the shores of Champion Lake in Eeyou Istchee. Nemaska is a new and modern village comprised of Cree families originally living at the Nemiscau trading post on Lake Nemiscau. The community of Nemaska is accessible all year long from Matagami via the James Bay Highway (over 390 km away), and from Chibougamau by the Route du Nord (approximately 340 km).

It is a fairly small but fully serviced community of around 800 people. Nemaska followed  the  trend  seen  in  other  Eeyou  Istchee  communities,  with  a  rapid population growth over the last 30 years. However, for the past ten (10) years, this growth rate has been decreasing gradually, as in the rest of the Cree population of Eeyou Istchee.

The main demographic feature of the Nemaska community is its youth. Thirty-one percent (31%) of the Nemaskau Eenouch (the 'people of Nemaska') is less than 15 years old and according to the 2006 Canada census data, the mean population

<!-- image -->

age  was  25  years  old.  Elders  represent  the  smallest  age  group  at  four  percent (4 %) of the total population.

The Nemaska community is an important Cree administrative center in the Eeyou Istchee  region.  The  offices  of  the  GCC  of  Eeyou  Istchee  and  of  the  CNG  are located in the community.

Social service facilities in the community include the wellness centre, Nemaska clinic,  social  services  centre,  school,  daycare,  multi-service  centre  and  youth centre.

## c) Land and Resource Use

Since  the  creation  of  beaver  preserves  that  began  in  the  1930s,  the  territory  of each  Eeyou  Istchee  Cree  community  is  subdivided  into  a  number  of  family hunting grounds or trapping territories (traplines).

The Whabouchi Project is located on part of the traditional territory of the Cree Nation of Nemaska, more specifically on Trapline R20. The trapline is under the direction of a hunting leader or tallyman, known as uuchimaau in  Cree,  who  is responsible for the continued monitoring and management of the resources.

Trapline R20 is regularly used by the tallyman, his wife, and many members of their extended family, as well as by other Crees who have camps along the Route du Nord , who frequent the Bible Camp or fish in the Lac des Montagnes and the Nemiscau River.

Traditional harvesting activities continue all year long. The spring goose hunt is practiced in several sectors of the trapline, and many lakes and rivers offer good fishing  grounds.  The  main  captures  include  walleye,  sturgeon,  longnose  sucker, lake  trout,  brook  trout,  lake  whitefish  and  cisco.  Big-game  hunting,  as  well  as waterfowl  and  ptarmigan  hunting,  are  practiced  mainly  in  the  fall  and  winter. Furbearer  trapping  is  practice  in  the  winter  and  the  harvested  species  include among  others  beaver,  otter,  mink  and  marten.  Harvesting  activities  decrease during the summer season, except for fishing and berry harvesting.

Trapline R20 hosts a site that has long been used for community activities and that was  recently  transformed  into  a  Bible  Camp  to  receive  Nemaska  children  and families for summer camps, religious gatherings and traditional Cree ceremonies.

Non-Natives also visit the territory during the summer for fishing and camping, or during  the  hunting  season.  Among  them,  there  are  workers  from  Nemaska community and from nearby work camps.

## d) Economy, Employment and Education

Even though Eeyou Istchee is considered a resource region (i.e. where the main work providers are primary sector companies such as hydroelectricity, forests and mineral),  Nemaska  is  distinct  from  other  Cree  communities  in  that  it  is  an important administrative center for the Eeyou Istchee territory.

<!-- image -->

In fact, in 2008,  the  tertiary  sector  (health,  social  and  education  services, municipal services or other governmental services) was the predominant economic  sector,  representing  85.4 %  of  the  employment  in  the  community. Moreover, nearly a third (31 %) of the jobs is in public administration, while this category  of  employment  provides  only  20 %  of  the  jobs  elsewhere  in  Eeyou Istchee.

In  Nemaska,  the  primary  sector  represented  only  8.3 %  of  the  jobs  in  the community in 2008 compared to close to one fourth (¼) of the jobs (23.8 %) in the  whole  Cree  Nation.  As  in  the  case  of  the  primary  sector,  construction  is  a marginal economic activity in Nemaska, representing only 4.9 % of the jobs in the community while, in Eeyou Istchee, it represents almost twice the proportion of jobs (8.7 %).

Several  regional  organizations  and  businesses  are  active  in  the  Eeyou  Istchee territory,  and  more specifically in Nemaska. These organizations and businesses (Newco, Cree Construction and Development Company, Air Creebec, PetroNor, Kepa Group, Cree Regional Economic Enterprises Company) belong to the Crees, the  Band  Councils  or  to  a  Cree-held  entity.  Although  Nemaska  constitutes  an administrative  center,  none  of  these  businesses  has  its  headquarters  within  this community.

However, local economic opportunities in Nemaska have increased over the past several years. Contributing factors include Hydro-Québec contracts being awarded to local contractors for construction projects and environmental monitoring, as well as new community infrastructure projects undertaken by local government  and  associated  economic  spin-offs.  Taking  into  consideration  the large  youth  population  in  Nemaska,  the  Economic  Development  branch  of  the local government is currently rolling out various training and skills development programs (heavy machinery operation, for example) which will play a key role in building local capacity to meet future needs.

A recent development in the community is the emergence of employment at the entrepreneurial level. Individuals are offering such services as equipment rentals (dump  trucks,  snowmobiles),  video  rentals,  painting,  towing  and  equipment maintenance  and  repairs.  As  well,  the new  Nemaska  clinic,  band  council headquarters and justice facilities are in the process of being erected. However, in spite  of  efforts  to  stimulate  the  local  economy,  people  in  the  community  still report a lack of jobs.

In general, the Cree communities experience a higher unemployment rate than the Quebec average. In 2008, although the unemployment rate in the community of Nemaska  was  lower  than  in  the  Eeyou  Istchee  territory,  it  was  much  higher (16.4 %) than for the population of 15 years old and more in Quebec as a whole (6.9 %).  Furthermore,  the  unemployment  rate  among  the  youth  (15  to  20  years old; 23 %) is much higher than among adults (24 to 64 years old; 15 %).

Another  important  element  that  must  be  accounted  for  is  that  the  rate  of graduation  and  participation  in  post-secondary  education  programs  is  generally

<!-- image -->

lower in the Cree communities than in the rest of Quebec. The graduation rate in the  community  of  Nemaska  is  similar  to  the  Cree  average  with  11.2 %  of vocational diplomas and 11.2 % for college diplomas, which is slightly lower than the Quebec average.

## e) Community Health and Wellness

Health and social services in all Eeyou Istchee communities are provided by the Cree Board of Health and Social Services of James Bay (' CBHSSJB '). Each of the nine Cree communities is served by a clinic that offers mainly primary care and a dental clinic.

The  community  of  Nemaska  has  a  wellness  center,  a  social  services  office,  a multiservice day care center (' MSDC ') and a youth office. Looking at the high birth and fecundity rate trends in the population, it is foreseeable that the demand for this type of service will increase in the upcoming years.

## f) Cultural and Archaeological Heritage

A  study  on  the  archaeological  potential  and  an  archaeological  inventory  were completed  in  2011  and  2012.  Even  if  a  consultation  of  the  archaeological  sites inventory database in Quebec (' ISAQ ') identified three (3) known archaeological sites in the vicinity of the Project, no remains of human establishments prior to the 1950s were identified. Therefore, no significant issues have emerged that would be considered jeopardizing to the Whabouchi Project.

## 20.4.2 First Nations

Early  in  the  preliminary  phases  of  the  development  of  its  Project,  Nemaska  devoted time  and  resources  to  ensure  a  concrete  and  constructive  involvement  of  the  various stakeholders,  notably  the  First  Nation  of  Nemaska.  Even  before  launching  the  ESIA process, the local authorities of the Nemaska Cree community took part in information and consultation activities.

Since 2009, different activities were undertaken to present the Project to the stakeholders and collect their concerns about the Project and its potential environmental and  social  impacts.  Various  subjects  were  discussed  during  these  information  and consultation  activities,  for  example  the  open-pit  mining  processes,  the  main  Project infrastructures planned and the lifecycle of the ore.

Such consultation led to significant modifications to the site general arrangement plan from what was presented in the previous NI 43-101 compliant Preliminary Economic Assessment report. Indeed, the location of the waste rock and tailings pile, as well as of sedimentation  basins  and  final  effluent,  were  modified  so  that  they  are  now  located further from the Lac des Montagnes (see Figure 18.1).

- A  3D  video  animation  describing  the  main  elements  of  the  Project  through  the construction, operation and closure phases was produced and presented during a general assembly of the community of Nemaska.

The implementation of the communication and consultation plan began in November 2011, after a series of discussions with the Nemaska Band Council administration and

<!-- image -->

an  initial  presentation  of  the  Project  during  a  community  general  assembly.  The communication and consultation plan included the completion of various engagement activities with the following stakeholders:

- · Nemaska Band Council (meetings);
- · Members  of the Community  of the Cree Nation of Nemaska  and local organizations (interviews);
- · Trapline R20 tallyman, neighbouring tallymen (R16, R18, R19 and R21) and other Cree users of the land (in-depth semi-structured interviews, meetings);
- · Youth (focus group;
- · Elders, hunters and trappers (focus group);
- · Women (focus group);
- · Community Consultative Committee - CCC (meetings).

Several  field  visits  on  the  Whabouchi  Project  site  were  also  organized  to  explain  the Project  to  the  representatives  of  the  Nemaska  community  and  to  the  Cree  land  users. Moreover,  in  March  2012,  Nemaska  opened  a  local  office  in  Nemaska  and  hired  a community liaison agent (' CLA ')  to  facilitate  the  exchanges  of  information  between Nemaska and the community.

In  November  2013,  Nemaska  participated  to  public  consultations  held  by  Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency in Nemaska.

Nemaska, the Grand Council of the Cree of Eeyou Istchee, the Cree Nation Government and the Cree community of Nemaska are currently negotiating to finalize a Resource Development  Partnership Agreement  (' RDPA ') for the purpose of establishing modalities  for  the  sharing  of  the  mine  operation  profits,  and  planning  mitigation  and valorization  measures  for  the  anticipated  impacts  of  the  Project.  These  negotiations began in March 2011 and are actively pursued by all parties. The agreement should be finalized shortly.

Further information and consultation activities are planned for the near future with the various Cree stakeholders.

## 20.4.3 Non-Aboriginal Communities and Governmental Authorities

Since 2009, Nemaska has engaged on numerous occasions with elected officials, civil servants and economic development agents of the Chibougamau-Chapais area and the Administration régionale Baie-James (formerly the ' Conférence régionale des élus de la Baie-James ') to inform them of the mining Project and its potential effects on their communities.

Nemaska and the regional-municipal leadership have since developed an engagement and communication program that is appropriate for anticipated impacts that the Project will have on the community.

Additional  discussions  were  held  in  2013  with  the  mayor  of  Chapais  regarding  the location  of  the  concentrate  transfer  site  (see  Section  18.9.3  of  this  Report).  Further

<!-- image -->

information  activities and  discussions are planned  for the near future with the Chibougamau-Chapais area stakeholders.

Although the effects anticipated at this time are mainly positive, ongoing engagement should identify any new potential impacts that have yet to be assessed.

Finally, Nemaska has taken part in numerous meetings with the Quebec's MERN and MDDELCC (formerly, MDDEFP) as well as with the federal CEA Agency to discuss mutual interests and to ensure that all involved parties could be satisfied. All parties are working  towards  common  objectives,  including  the  development  of  the  Whabouchi Project, and have been fully cooperating with Nemaska. Sections 20.2.2 and 20.2.3 of this Report  depicts  both  provincial  and  federal  ESIA  process  applicable  to  the Whabouchi Project.

## 20.5 Hydrometallurgical Plant

For the Salaberry-de-Valleyfield installation, the discussions with MDDEP indicate that this part of the Project did not require an ESIA.

However, a certificate of conformity to Salaberry-de-Valleyfield's City regulations will have to be issued each time a certificate of authorization is requested under sections 22 and  32  of  the  Environment  Quality  Act  (c.  Q-2).  Construction  permits  will  also  be required before starting any construction work.

At the provincial level, certificate of authorization will have to be delivered from the MDDELCC in accordance with the Environment Quality Act (c. Q-2).

During the construction and the operation, many permits and leases will be required. Nemaska will present the requests when required.

From  the  federal  point  of  view,  if  the  Project  does  not  fall  under  the  Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, no specific permit will be required for the construction of the plant.

A soil characterization and geotechnical survey was completed on the site and did not reveal any irregularities that would impact the construction of the plant.

## 21.0 CAPITAL AND OPERATING COSTS

The Project scope covered in this Study is based on the construction of a green field facility having a nominal daily processing capacity of 3,016 tonnes per day. The capital and  operating  cost  estimates  related  to  the  mine,  concentrator,  and  Whabouchi  site infrastructure,  the  hydrometallurgical  plant  and  associates  infrastructures  have  been developed by Met-Chem. Engineering quantities related to the water and environmental management were provided by Roche Inc., as well as the site closure plan, including the associated  costs.  Owner's  costs  were  provided  by  Nemaska.  Met-Chem  consolidated cost  information  from  all  sources.  The  capital  and  the  operating  costs  are  reported  in Canadian Dollars (' $ ').

The capital cost estimate consists of the direct capital costs for the Whabouchi mine, the concentrator site, the Slaberry-de-Valleyfield plant site and the indirect costs for the two (2) sites. Each of the estimates will have a contingency added which is larger (12.5 %) for the Salaberry-de-Valleyfield site compared with the Whabouchi site (10 %) mainly because  the  hydromet  plant  is  considered  to  be  more  complex  and  is  using  new technologies  and  processes.  The  estimated  Owner's  costs  were  also  included.  A working capital, equal to three (3) months operating costs, has been included as well. Table 21.1 presents a summary of the total estimated initial and sustaining capital costs for the Project.

## 21.1 Capital Costs

## 21.1.1 Capital Cost Estimate and Battery Limits

The Project Scope of estimation is based on the construction of green field facilities at the Whabouchi mine site having a nominal yearly processing rate of 216,485 tonnes of concentrate  and  at  the  Salaberry-de-Valleyfield  hydrometallurgical  plant  to  produce 28,206 tonnes of lithium hydroxide monohydrate and 3,277 tonnes of lithium carbonate. The  estimate  is  based  on  Met-Chem's  standard  methods  applicable  for  a  feasibility study to achieve an accuracy level of ± 15 %. The effective calendar date for the cost estimate is Q1 2014. The estimate is expressed in Canadian dollars.

## a) Major Assumptions

Estimation  is  based  on  the  Project  obtaining  all  relevant  permits  in  a  timely manner to meet the Project schedule.

In Salaberry-de-Valleyfield, Hydro-Québec will provide the permanent power line in time for use as construction power, while in Whabouchi temporary power will be available from gensets.

For earth work in Whabouchi, the following was assumed:

- · All  backfill  materials  will  be  available  from  gravel  pits,  esker  or  other sources located within a radius of five (5) km;
- · Mine  waste  rock  is  suitable  for  use  in  road  construction  (as  established following preliminary assessment);
- · Mass earthworks and haulage road construction is performed by crews from Nemaska;
- · Soil conditions will not require special foundation designs such as grouting and piling (as established following preliminary assessment);
- · All excavated material will be disposed of within the site battery limits.

## b) Major Exclusion

The following items were not included in this capital cost estimate:

- · Provision for inflation, escalation, currency fluctuations and interests incurred during construction;
- · Project financing costs;
- · Disposal of hazardous materials.
- · All duties and taxes were excluded from the capital cost, but were considered in the economic analysis.

## c) Capital Cost

The  pre-production  initial  capital  cost  for  the  base  case  scope  of  work  is $ 499.7 M,  of  which  $ 358.6 M  is  direct  cost,  $ 89.4 M  is  indirect  cost  and $ 51.7 M is contingency.

<!-- image -->

Provision for closure and rehabilitation is $ 5.6 M, of wich $ 2.8 M is included in the initial capital and $ 2.8 M is accounted for in Year 1 and 2 of production.

Provision for sustaining capital is $ 140.2 M, excluding the provision for closure and rehabilitation. Initial Capital costs are summarized in Table 21.2.

## 21.1.2 Basis of Estimate for Direct Capital Cost

## a) Currencies

Updated  indices  were  used  for  quotations  received  before  Q1  of  2014.  The exchange  rates  used  when  quotations  were  received  in  foreign  currencies  are 1.00 CAD / 0.90 USD and 1.00 CAD / 0.70 EUR.

## b) Construction Labour, Productivity Loss Factor

The labour rate was developed for a typical crew from a detailed table of current rates developed by the Corporation des Entrepreneurs Généraux du Québec. The all-inclusive hourly rate includes the basic hourly rates for the tradesman, social benefits  and  employer's  burden,  industrial  site  premium  as  required,  direct supervision,  small  tools  and  consumables,  and  contractor's  overhead  and  profit. Indirect supervision and site establishment as well as contractor's mobilization/demobilization were excluded from the hourly rate but were provided  for  as  indirect  costs  in  the  construction  contractor's  site  management provision.

The  productivity  loss  factor  was  established  in  consideration  of  the  working calendar, the work rotation, the climatic conditions and remoteness of work site. Consultation and validation with a major contractor suggested that in consideration of the specific conditions it would be advisable to establish different hourly rates and productivity loss factor for each site.

At Whabouchi, the working calendar was defined as one (1) shift per day, ten (10) hours per shift and seven (7) days per week for a total of 70 hours per week, and a rotation of three (3) weeks in and one (1) week out. At Salaberry-de-Valleyfield, the working calendar was defined as one (1) shift per day, ten (10) hours per shift and six (6) days per week for a total of 60 hours per week, and no rotation as the labour  force  will  all  be  local.  Consequently,  for  the  work  at  Whabouchi,  the hourly rate is established at $ 130 and productivity loss factor at 1.15, while for

<!-- image -->

the work at Salaberry-de-Valleyfield, the hourly rate is established at $ 120 and the productivity loss factor at 1.14.

In  addition  to  the  labour  cost,  a  construction  allowance  based  on  delivered equipment  cost  was  established  from  similar  projects  to  cover  for  construction material, sub-contract and mobile cranes to be paid by the Owner. At Whabouchi, the  middle  range  factor  of  4.0 %  is  applied  while  in  Salaberry-de-Valleyfield, since few heavy or complex crane lifts and limited specialized worker trades are expected a lower factor of 2.0 % is applied.

## c) Construction and Contractor's Costs

The  estimate  is  based  on  construction  contracts  attributed  on  the  base  of competitive  bidding  process  amongst  qualified  contractors.  Availability  of  local qualified contractors and skilled workers is expected. It is also expected that an average  level  of  site  management,  contract  administration,  quality  control  and adequate  safety  requirements  will  be  required  from  the  contractors  by  the construction  management.  Realistic  construction  schedule  is  also  expected,  as well as good site conditions, limited number of contractors on site, limited work outside in winter and also limited work required in overtime.

Provisions  have  been  included  to  cover  for  contractor's  major  equipment  and supplies, including owned and rented construction equipment, vehicles and other facilities  such  as  trailers,  tool  cribs,  power  panels,  containers,  maintenance  of area,  janitorial  and  clean-up,  and  also  the  mobilization  and  demobilization. Special  installation  tools,  cranes,  scaffolding,  cribbing  and  dunnage  were  also included as well as work place weather protection. Workers transportation within the construction site is also included.

Provision  have  also  been  made  for  construction  contractor's  site  management including supervision and support staff such as administration and procurement, coordination and scheduling, quality and safety.

## d) Freight, Duties and Taxes

Based on recent surveys and studies and when not included in the cost, the freight was accounted for by adding a factor to the value of the goods; a factor of 8.0 % is applied for work in Whabouchi and 7.0 % for work in Salaberry-de-Valleyfield. All  other  duties  and  taxes  were  excluded  from  the  capital  cost,  but  some  were considered for the after tax economic analysis.

## e) Mining

## i) Mining Equipment

Met-Chem received budgetary pricing from the equipment suppliers for each piece  of  mining  equipment.  The  major  mining  equipment  such  as  the  haul trucks, excavators and production drills as well as the dozer, grader and wheel loader will be financed in order to reduce the initial capital cost of the Project. The following terms of the financing agreement were provided by one (1) of the major equipment suppliers:

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

-  Rate - 5.95 %;
-  Length - 60 month;
-  Down payment - 20 %;
-  Residual Value - 1 %.

The  down  payment  is  treated  as  a  capital  expenditure  while  the  financing payments were treated as an operating cost. At the end of the finance period the equipment is owned by the mine. The support and service equipment that is not  financed  is  treated  as  an  outright  purchase  based  on  the  pricing received. Additional equipment that is required throughout the mine plan and equipment  that  is  purchased  to  replace  the  initial  fleet  when  it  reaches  its expected life is treated as sustaining capital.

## ii) Mine Development Cost

The open pit mine development cost accounts for the activities that will be carried  out  during  pre-production  to  prepare  the  mine  for  operations.  These activities include; clearing and grubbing, topsoil removal, overburden stripping  and  the  preparation  of  several  ore  faces.  In  order  to  estimate  the mine development cost, Met-Chem determined the cost to operate the mining fleet during the pre-production phase.

## iii) Underground Mine

The capital expenditure for  the  underground mine is broken down into the development and the production phases. The underground development phase will last two (2) years from Year 19 to Year 20. The cost is broken down into the following categories:

##  Owner's Project Services

The  Project  services  includes  the Owner's  manpower  that  will  be dedicated to the mine development work, the haulage of the waste rock to the disposal area, the air heating, electrical power consumption, maintenance of the main ventilator and the electricity consumed by the mining contractor. The estimated cost is $ 8.1 M.

##  Owner's Equipment

The capital cost estimation for the Owner's equipment is $ 5.1 M. This includes the bigger and stationary equipment that can not be mobilized and demobilized by the mining contractor.

##  U/G Development Work

This cost is the mining contractor's service to develop the underground mine. It includes the manpower and the equipment that is mobilized. The capital cost is derived from the contractor's unit cost ($/ linear metre or $/unit) to develop the underground  mine  infrastructures. The  cost estimation for the underground development work planned over a period of two (2) years is $ 32.0 M.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

When the underground mine will start the operation planned at the beginning of Year 21, only the ramp to Level 37 and the haulage drift on Level 37 will remain to be developed and will be excavated during that year. The mining contractor  will  downsize  its  personel  and  equipment  for  the  steady  ore production  rate  required  to  feed  the  concentrator.  The  estimated  cost  is $ 3.2 M.  The  total  estimated  capex  for  the  underground  mine  development work is $ 48.4 M and planned to be disbursed over a period of three (3) years. Table 21.3 presents the detail of the underground mining capex estimation.

## iv) Mine Services and Facilities

The  capital  cost  for  the  mine  services  and  facilities  includes  the  cost  to purchase and set-up the explosives storage area and magazines.

- v) Mine Haulage Road and Waste Rock Disposal Facility

The  costs  for  the  mine  haulage  road  and  waste  rock  disposal  facility  were estimated based on quantity take-off from site layouts and unit cost obtained from qualified contractors.

building consisting of the process area, the mechanical shop, the office, change room, lunch room and the laboratory areas as well as railcar unloading facility.

## i) Process Buildings

The costs for the process buildings and ancillary installations were estimated based  on  quantity  take-off  from  mechanical  layouts  and  unit  cost  obtained from qualified contractors for each location.

## ii) Process Equipment

The  process  equipment  lists  were  derived  from  the  flow  sheets  for  the Whabouchi process as well as for the Salaberry-de-Valleyfield hydrometallurgical plant. For major equipment, budget prices were obtained from  qualified  suppliers  based  on  data  sheets,  data  tables  or  preliminary technical description. The remaining equipment was estimated from databases from recent similar projects or in house estimation.

Labour for installation of process equipment was estimated for each piece of equipment based on in house database or industrial publication. Provision was also  added  by  factor  to  cover  for  special  lift,  sub-contract  or  construction material.

## iii) Piping and Pipelines

For the Whabouchi process, process piping cost was established by factorisation on delivered process equipment based on recent similar projects. No pipeline is required for the tailings; estimation of the effluent pipeline was estimated  by  sizing  of  the line and  unit prices from  recent  industrial estimation tables.

At  the  hydrometallurgical  plant,  the  estimation  of  piping  work  for  the electrolysis  cells  was  established  with  a  factor  based  on  turnkey  proposal received from the cell supplier. For the remaining of the process equipment, a piping  take-off  was  performed  for  large  bore  pipes  and  a  detailed  budget proposal was obtained from a qualified contractor. A design allowance was also  added  to  cover  for  unidentified  items  and  small  bore  piping.  Pipelines and pipe racks for tailings and gypsum by-product were estimated based on quantities from layout and unit rates from databases.

## iv) Electrical

For both sites, electrical equipment list and quantities were derived from the single line diagrams. Budget prices were obtained from qualified suppliers for major equipment or based on databases from recent projects. Quantities and costs for material as well as man-hours were also established based on recent similar  projects.  Installation  was  estimated  using  hourly  rate  as  described above.

At  the  hydrometallurgical  plant,  the  estimation  of  electrical  work  for  the electrolysis  cells  was  established  with  a  factor  based  on  turnkey  proposal received from the the cell supplier.

## v) Instrumentation

For  both  sites, instrumentation  and  automation  material  and  equipment quantities were derived from the flow sheets. Budget prices were established based  on  databases  from  recent  projects.  Installation  was  estimated  using hourly rate as described above.

At  the  hydrometallurgical  plant,  the  estimation  of  automation  work  for  the electrolysis  cells  was  established  with  a  factor  based  on  turnkey  proposal received from the the cell supplier.

## vi) Buildings Services and Supplies

For both sites, preliminary requirements were established for HVAC and fire protection  and  budget  proposal  were  obtained  from  qualified  suppliers. Preliminary  requirements  were  also  established  for  some  toolings,  interior finishing and living quarter's supplies. Cost estimation was based mainly on recent industrial catalogues and also on in-house database.

At the hydrometallurgical plant, consideration was given that some services will  be  provided  by  the  City  of  Salaberry-de-Valleyfield  such  as  water  and sewage.

## g) Tailings and By-products Management Facilities

At Whabouchi mine site, the tailings will be filtered and deposited on the waste rock  pile.  No  additional  capital  cost  will  be  required,  transport  operation  costs only were provided for in the mine opex.

At Salaberry-de-Valleyfield hydrometallurgical plant, the management and storage facilities for tailings and by-products include two (2) ponds for tailings, a stockpile for the aluminium silicate and a shelter for the gypsum.

The ponds will accept up to nine (9) years of tailings production; the first one will be  built  in  pre-production  while  the  second  will  be  built  when  required.  The aluminium silicate stockpile is designed to accept six (6) months of production, since it is assumed that it can be disposed of at no cost. Only some site preparation is required. The gypsum stockpiling and storage shelter will accept up to three (3) month of production since it is also assumed that it will be disposed of at no cost. Costs  were  based  on  material  take-offs  from  the  layouts  and  unit  cost  obtained from qualified contractors.

## h) General Services, Infrastructure and Ancillary Buildings

General  services  such  as  propane,  natural  gas  and  general  fire  protection  were estimated based on budget proposal or recent similar projects. At the hydrometallurgical  plant,  services  such  as  sanitary  waste  disposal  and  potable water  were  not  included  as  they  will  be  supplied  by  the  City  of  Salaberry-deValleyfield. However,  a  provision  was  made  for  interconnection  to  public networks  based  on  a  budget  price  provided  by  the  City  of  Salaberry-deValleyfield.

June 2014

For  both  sites,  site  preparation,  peripheral  fencing  and  site  roads  cost  estimate were established based on allowance, quantities derived from general layouts and budget unit price based on budget proposal from qualified contractors.

## i) Ancillary Buildings and Facilities

At the Whabouchi mine site, requirements were established from the layouts and also process data for the site preparation and drainage, the site roads, the garage including some offices and the concentrator also including some offices. Power supply requirements, toolings and various supplies were also estimated based on recent budget proposal or in-house database.

Concentrate handling and storage facilities will be built in the Chibougamau area to allow for concentrate receiving by trailers, unloading, storage and loading into rail car for transportation by train to Salaberry-de-Valleyfield. The initial capital cost includes provision for the facilities while transportation costs were accounted for in the operation cost. Estimates were based on budget proposal obtained from qualified contractors and transporters.

At the hydrometallurgical plant, requirements were established from the layouts and also process data for the site preparation, the storage warehouse, the shipping warehouse, the railcar unloading system cover structure and the guard house.

Unit  rates  and  allowances  based  on  recent  similar  projects  were  applied  to estimate  the  costs  of  the  storage  warehouse  and  the  guardhouse,  while  budget prices were obtained from a qualified supplier for prefabricated structures for the shipping warehouse and the railcar unloading system cover structure.

Facilities  such  as  offices,  change  rooms,  laboratory,  as  well  as  mechanical  and electrical rooms, will be located within the main process building and included in its cost. Finally, because the Salaberry-de-Valleyfield facility is centrally located, there are no provisions for permanent camp or construction camp.

## j) Site Access

The  Whabouchi  mine  site  will  be  directly  accessible  from  the  main  road.  A crossing will be required for the mine trucks to go to the waste rock stockpile; an allowance is provided to cover for traffic control system.

The hydrometallurgical plant will also be directly accessible from the main road. Railway  will  be  laid  for  the  reception  of  concentrate  and  also  some  reagents. Quantities  were  calculated  from  the  layout  for  the  construction  of  the  railway, some  turnouts  and  also  connection  to  the  main  existing  CN  line.  Unit  rates obtained from a qualified contractor were applied to estimate the cost.

## k) Power Supply, Main Sub-Station and Communication

At the Whabouchi mine site, requirements were established for a main power line and the cost was estimated based on preliminary appraisal by Hydro-Quebec. At the  Salaberry-de-Valleyfield  hydrometallurgical  plant,  requirements  were  also established for a main power line but the cost will be assumed by Hydro-Quebec.

## a) Project Development

Project Development  includes  as  requred: permitting, land acquisition and administration,  various  studies  as  geotechnical  studies,  market  studies  and  also independent  reviews.  No  provision  was  made  for  development,  implementation and operation of a demonstration plant.

## b) Project Implementation

Project Implementation includes: EPCM and Owner's Costs.

EPCM includes detailed engineering, procurement, construction management and commissioning and site Assistance.

Owner's costs include:

<!-- image -->

- · Spares and consumables: namely capital spares and first fills;
- · Vendor's rep. expenses for commissioning;
- · Construction site Owner's costs, namely power and temporary facilities, site services, personnel and contractor's transportation, room and board;
- · Owner's project team and services included are the financial costs, namely NSR buyout, insurances, legal fees, training and manual.

Escalation  and  interests  were  excluded  from  the  capital  cost.  Working  capital, taxes  and  duties  were  also  excluded  from  the  capital  cost  estimate  but  were considered in the financial analysis.

## c) Closure and Rehabilitation Costs

Preliminary  indication  is  that  no  provision  will  be  required  for  closure  and rehabilitation of the Salaberry-de-Valleyfield  site.  Based  on  site  layouts,  a provision  of  $ 5.6 M  was  estimated  for  the  closure  and  rehabilitation  of  the Whabouchi mine site. Requirements were established and estimation of the cost was based on material take-off and unit rates from recent database. The expenses were accounted for according to the most recent legislation; $ 2.8 M will be spent as  pre-production  capital  while  $  1.4 M  will  be  spent  in  each  of  the  1 st and  2 nd year of production.

## 21.1.4 Contingency

Based on the level of development stage of the Project as well as assessment of major risks, a factor was applied to estimate the provision for contingency. For the Whabouchi mine site,  including  the  Chibougamau facility,  a  provision  of  $ 17.3 M  was  included. For the Salaberry-de-Valleyfield hydrometallurgical plant, a provision of $ 34.3 M was included. No contingency provision was made to cover technological risks associated with the process. It is also expected that sufficiently developed engineering, adequate project  management  and  tight  cost  control  will  be  implemented  in  order  to  meet  the budget for the Project.

## 21.1.5 Sustaining Capital Expenditures

A  provision  of  $ 140.2 M  covers  for  sustaining  capital.  It  includes  open  pit  mining equipment replacement, underground development and equipment procurement. Sustaining  capital  also  includes  tailings  storage  expansion  at  the  hydrometallurgical plant and some provision for the RDPA, for wich the terms remain confidential at this time.

## 21.2 Operating Costs

## 21.2.1 Whabouchi Operating Costs

This Section provides information on the estimated operating costs of the Whabouchi Project and covers mining, concentrator plant, G&amp;A and site services.

The  sources  of  information  used  to  develop  the  operating  costs  include  in-house databases and outside sources particularly for materials, services and consumables.

|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Mining (Open Pit Years 1 to 20)                  |                                               74.1  |
| Mining (Underground, Years 21 to 26)             |                                              111.33 |
| Tailings Transport (Open Pit Years 1 to 20)      |                                                5.77 |
| Tailings Transport (Underground, Years 21 to 26) |                                                7.31 |
| Average Mining Operating Costs                   |                                               88.98 |

The totals may not add up due to rounding errors.

## b) Summary of Personnel Requirements

Figure  21.1  presents  the  estimated  personnel  requirements  for  the  Whabouchi mining operation.

Figure 21.1 - Whabouchi Mining Operation Total Personnel Requirement

<!-- image -->

Total annual Owner's costs for the above manpower including base salary, bonus and  fringe  benefits  have  been  estimated  at  $ 8.4  M/y  for  open  pit  mining, $ 11.5 M/y during the transition period (Years 19 and 20) and $ 3.6 M/y during the  underground  mining  operation.  Contractor's  personnel  costs  are  part  of  the mining cost.

## c) Mining (Open Pit)

The open pit mine operating cost was estimated for each period of the mine plan. This  cost  is  based  on  operating  the  equipment,  the  manpower  associated  with operating  the  mine,  the  cost  for  explosives  as  well  as  pit  dewatering,  road maintenance and other activities.

<!-- image -->

The open pit mine operating cost was estimated to average $ 5.07/t mined for the life  of  the  open  pit  mine.  This  cost  is  divided  into  $ 5.39/t  for  ore,  $ 3.39/t  for overburden and $4.99/t for waste rock (see Table 21.7).

Table 21.7 - Summary of Estimated Mine Operating Costs by Type of Material

## ii) Mining Equipment

The hourly operating cost for most of the mining equipment was supplied by the  equipment  suppliers  and  manufacturer.  These  were  used  to  develop  the operating costs. For certain equipment where hourly operating cost estimates were not obtained, Met-Chem used its internal database. Table 21.10 provides a detailed breakdown of the hourly operating cost for each piece of equipment in the mining fleet.

## iv) Explosives

The  cost  for  explosives  has  been  estimated  at  $ 0.61/t  of  blasted  rock  and $ 4.86/m   for  pre  shearing  of  the  final  pit  walls.  This  pricing  was  obtained 2 from quotations from explosive suppliers. The price accounts for the purchase of the bulk emulsion and blasting accessories and accounts for the transportation to site.

## v) Haulage of Coarse Tailings

Met-Chem has estimated the cost to transport the tailings from the plant to the waste dump at $ 1.30/t of tailings ($ 0.40/t mined or $ 5.77/t of concentrate).

## d) Underground Mining Operating Costs

The opex estimation for the production period planned from Year 21 to Year 26 was broken down into the following categories:

- i) Owner operating cost

This  includes  the  Owner's  personel  salaries  and  the  operating  costs  of  the waste rock handling to the disposal area and the mine tailings operations. It also  includes  the  propane  and  electrical  energy  for  mine  air  heating  and Owner's and mining contractor's equipment.

## ii) Mining contractor services

This cost estimation was based on the contractor's unit prices for the drilling, explosive  and  blasting,  ore  handling  and  transportation.  It  also  includes  the drift accesses to the stopes (waste and ore areas).

The average opex estimation over the six (6) years of planned operation will be  $ 21.30/tonne  of  ROM.  Table  21.12  presents  the  details  of  the  opex estimation.

Based  on  the  above  values,  yearly  production  costs  were  calculated.  The  LiOH production  cost  (based  on  19,645 t/y)  will  be  $ 55,353,894 /y  and  the  cost  adders  for LiOH-H2O (28,206 t/y) and Li2 CO3 (3,277 t/y) will be $ 3,129,715 /y and $ 1,262,726 /y respectively.

To determine each final product's total production cost, the LiOH cost was distributed according  to  the  lithium  split  between  the  hydroxide  monohydrate  and  the  carbonate circuit (88.3 % of Li units to LiOH-H O and 11.7 % to Li CO ). 2 2 3

The LiOH distributed cost and the adders have been combined and the operating cost was obtained by dividing this combined cost by the annual production tonnage. Results are shown in Table 21.21.

## 22.0 ECONOMIC ANALYSIS

The economic/financial assessment of the Whabouchi Project of Nemaska Lithium Inc. is based on Q1-2014 price projections in U.S. currency and cost estimates in Canadian currency. An exchange rate of 0.90 USD per CAD was assumed to convert USD market price  projections  and  particular  components  of  the  initial  capital  cost  estimates  into CAD. No provision was made for the effects of inflation. The evaluation was carried out on a 100 %-equity basis. Current Canadian tax regulations were applied to assess the corporate  tax  liabilities  while  the  recently  proposed  regulations  in  Quebec  (Bill  55, December 2013) were applied to assess the mining tax liabilities.

The financial indicators under base case conditions are:

| Base Case Financial Results   | Unit   |   Value |
|-------------------------------|--------|---------|
| B-T NPV @ 8 %                 | M CAD  |   924.2 |
| A-T NPV @ 8 %                 | M CAD  |   580.8 |
| B-T IRR                       | %      |    25.2 |
| A-T IRR                       | %      |    21   |
| B-T Payback Period            | years  |     3.7 |
| A-T Payback Period            | years  |     4   |

A  sensitivity  analysis  reveals  that  the  Project's  viability  will  not  be  significantly vulnerable  to  variations  in  capital  and  operating  costs,  within  the  margins  of  error associated  with  feasibility  study  estimates.  However,  the  Project's  viability  remains more vulnerable to the larger uncertainty in future market prices.

## 22.1 Assumptions

## 22.1.1 Macro-Economic Assumptions

The main macro-economic assumptions used in the base case are given in Table 22.1. The  price  forecasts  for  lithium  hydroxide  monohydrate  (LiOH-H O)  and  lithium 2 carbonate  (Li CO3)  were  based  on  projections  from  the  SignumBOX  study.  The 2 sensitivity analysis examines a range of prices 30 % above and below these base case prices.

Table 22.1 - Macro-Economic Assumptions

| Item                                                                             | Unit       | Base Case Value   |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|-------------------|
| Lithium Hydroxide Monohydrate (LiOH-H2O)  Price Forecast (F.O.B. Hydromet Plant) | USD/tonne  | 8,000             |
| Lithium Carbonate (Li CO )  2 3 Price Forecast (F.O.B. Hydromet Plant)           | USD/tonne  | 5,000             |
| Exchange Rate                                                                    | CAD/USD    | 0.90              |
| Discount Rate                                                                    | % per year | 8                 |
| Discount Rate Variants                                                           | % per year | 6 and 10          |

An exchange rate of 0.90 USD per CAD was used to convert the USD market price projections  into  Canadian  currency.  The  sensitivity  of  base  case  financial  results  to variations in exchange rate was examined. Those capital cost components which include U.S. content originally converted to Canadian currency using the base case exchange rate were adjusted accordingly.

The current Canadian tax system applicable to Mineral Resource Income was used to assess  the  Project's  annual  tax  liabilities.  This  consists  of  federal  and  provincial corporate taxes as well as provincial mining taxes. The federal and provincial corporate tax rates currently applicable over the Project's operating life are 15.0 % and 11.9 % of taxable  income,  respectively.  The  marginal  tax  rates  applicable  under  the  recently proposed mining tax regulations in Quebec (Bill 55, December 2013) are 16 %, 22 % and 28 % of taxable income and depend on the profit margin. It has been assumed that the 20 % processing allowance rate associated with transformation of the mine product to a more advanced stage within the province would be applicable in this instance.

The  assessment  was  carried  out  on  a  100 %-equity  basis.  Apart  from  the  base  case discount rate of 8.0 %, two (2) variants of 6.0 and 10.0 % were used to determine the Net Present Value of the Project. These discount rates represent possible costs of equity capital.

## 22.1.2 Royalty and Resource Development Partnership Agreement Payments

The  present  financial  analysis  incorporates  both  a  net  profit  royalty  agreement  and payments related to the RDPA.

The annual royalty payment was based on 2.0 % (originally 3.0 % less 1.0 % bought out with a lump-sum payment of $ 1 M) of the 'net value' of the concentrate produced at the mill. The net unit value of the concentrate was calculated from the pre-established concentrate  sales  price  of  $ 325,  less  mine  operating  costs,  mine  capital  expenses incurred over the life of the Project, and mine rehabilitation costs, expressed per tonne of estimated concentrate production. Based on the capital and operating costs estimates associated with this Project, the net unit value of the concentrate amounts to $ 92.31 per tonne, leading to a royalty payment of $ 1.85 per tonne of concentrate produced.

The terms of the RDPA are confidential and cannot be disclosed at this time.

A reduced production of 725 kt milled in the first production year provides for a rampup to full capacity.

## 22.2 Financial Model and Results

A summary of the base case results is given in Table 22.3. The cash flow statement for the base case is given in Table 22.4.

The summary and cash flow statement indicate that the total pre-production capital costs were  evaluated  at  $ 499.7 M,  which  includes  the  first  mine  rehabilitation  trust  fund payment in the amount of $ 2.8 M. The sustaining capital requirement was evaluated at $ 140.2 M,  which  includes  underground  mine  development  and  equipment.  Mine rehabilitation  trust  fund  payments  once  production  has  started  were  estimated  at  an additional $ 2.8 M.

<!-- image -->

The  cash  flow  statement  shows  a  capital  cost  breakdown  by  area  and  provides  a preliminary  capital  spending  schedule  over  the  2-year  pre-production  period  of  the Project. Working capital requirements were estimated at three (3) months of total annual operating costs. As operating costs vary annually over the mine life, additional amounts of working capital will be injected or withdrawn as required.

The total revenue derived from the sale of the two (2) products from the hydromet plant was estimated at $ 6,943.7 M ($ 6,473.6 M for LiOH-H2O and $ 470.1 M for Li2CO3), or  on  average,  $ 254.09 /tonne  milled.  The  total  operating  costs  were  estimated  at $ 2,890.4 M, or on average, $ 105.77 /tonne milled.

The financial results indicate a before-tax Net Present Value (' NPV ') of $ 924.2 M at a discount rate of 8.0 %. The before-tax Internal Rate of Return (' IRR ') is 25.2 % and the payback period is 3.7 years.

The after-tax NPV is $ 580.8 M at a discount rate of 8.0 %. The after-tax IRR is 21.0 % and the payback period is 4.0 years.

## 22.3 Sensitivity Analysis

A  sensitivity  analysis  has  been  carried  out,  with  the  base  case  described  above  as  a starting point, to assess the impact of changes in total pre-production capital expenditure (' Capex '), operating costs (' Opex ') and product prices on the Project's NPV @ 8.0 % and  IRR.  Each  variable  was  examined  one-at-a-time.  An  interval  of  30 %  with increments  of  10.0 %  was  used  for  all  three  (3)  variables.  It  is  to  be  noted  that  the margin  of  error  for  cost  estimates  at  the  feasibility  study  level  is  typically  ±15 %. However, the uncertainty in price forecasts usually remains significantly higher, and is a function of price volatility.

The before-tax results of the sensitivity analysis, as shown in Figure 22.1 and Figure 22.2, indicate that, within the limits of accuracy of the cost estimates in this Study, the Project's  before-tax  viability  does  not  seem  significantly  vulnerable  to  the  underestimation of capital and operating costs, taken one at-a-time. The vertical dashed lines show the typical 15 % margin of error associated with the cost estimates. As seen in Figure 22.1, the NPV is more sensitive to variations in Opex than pre-production Capex, as  shown  by  the  steeper  slope  of  the  Opex  curve.  As  expected,  the  NPV  is  most sensitive  to  variations  in  price  (both  product  prices  were  varied  together).  The  NPV becomes somewhat marginal at the lowest price variation in the interval, i.e., at -30 % (this  corresponds to a price combination of $ 5,600 and $ 3,500 per tonne for lithium hydroxide monohydrate and lithium carbonate, respectively). By trial and error, it was found that a reduction of about 39 % in both prices (down to $ 4,880 and $ 3,050 per tonne for lithium hydroxide monohydrate and lithium carbonate, respectively) results in a break-even NPV @ 8.0 %.

Figure 22.2, showing variations in internal rate of return, provides the same conclusions. As seen, the IRR becomes somewhat marginal (above the 8.0 % IRR break-even dashed line) at the lowest price variation of the interval. Compared to Figure 22.1, which shows linear variations in NPV for the three (3) variables studied, variations associated with IRR  are  not  linear.  Because  of  the  different  timing  associated  with  pre-production Capex versus Opex, the IRR is more sensitive to negative variations in pre-production Capex than Opex, but is of equal sensitivity for positive variations, as evidenced by the shape of the Capex curve.

The  after-tax  results  of  the  sensitivity  analysis  are  shown  in  Figure  22.3  and  Figure 22.4. Figure 22.3 indicates that the Project's after-tax viability is mostly vulnerable to a price  forecast  reduction  while  being  less  affected  by  under-estimation  of  capital  and operating costs. By trial and error, it was found that a reduction of about 36 % in both price forecasts (down  to $ 5,120 and $ 3,200 per tonne for lithium hydroxide monohydrate  and  lithium  carbonate,  respectively)  results  in  a  break-even  net  present value @ 8.0 %.

USD/CAD exchange rate variations can affect the Project's viability significantly. The base case uses an exchange rate of 0.90 USD per CAD. Table 22.5 - Sensitivity to the USD/CAD  Exchange  Rate  examines  the  sensitivity  of  key  financial  indicators  to exchange rate forecasts. The U.S. content associated with the capital cost estimate was adjusted accordingly for each exchange rate assumption. As can be projected from the results  observed  in  the  table  below,  an  'at  par'  CAD  would  impact  the  Project's viability should market prices be significantly below expectations. For an 'at par' CAD, break-even conditions were achieved at about the lower limit of the price interval, i.e., at a  -30 %  price  variation  ($ 5,600  and  $ 3,500  per  tonne  for  lithium  hydroxide monohydrate and lithium carbonate, respectively).

| Exchange Rate (USD/CAD)     | 0.85    | 0.90    | 0.95    | 1.00    |
|-----------------------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| A-T Total Cash Flow (M CAD) | 2,518.9 | 2,280.0 | 2,064.7 | 1,870.3 |
| A-T NPV @ 8 % (M CAD)       | 664.2   | 580.8   | 505.7   | 437.7   |

## 23.0 ADJACENT PROPERTIES

Critical Element Corporation (' Critical Element ') holds most of the adjacent properties to the Whabouchi deposit (Figure 23.1). The most notable property, over the ten (10) owned by Critical Element is the Lac Levac property which hosts the Nisk-1 Ni-Cu-Co-PGE  deposit.  The  nine  (9)  other  properties  located  east  and  west  of  the Whabouchi Property are early stage projects and show potential for hosting magmatic and volcanogenic sulfides mineralization, as well as spodumene-bearing pegmatites.

Critical Element's Lac Levac property (owned by Monarques Resources and Nemaska Lithium in the past) hosts the Nisk-1 Ni-Cu-Co-PGE deposit. The deposit is associated with  an  elongated  body  of  serpentinized  ultramafic  rocks  that  intrude  paragneiss  and amphibolite sequences. The ultramafic rock intrusion is interpreted as a sill composed of at least two (2) distinct ultramafic lithological units: a grey serpentinized peridotite with  magnetite  veinlets,  and  a  black  serpentinized  peridotite  with  chrysotile  veinlets hosting the Ni-Cu-Co-PGE sulphide mineralization. The Nisk-1 deposit hosts NI 43-101 compliant Mineral Resources (December, 2009) with Measured Resource of 1,255,000 tonnes  at  1.09 %  Ni;  0.56 %  Cu;  0.07 %  Co;  1.11  g/t  Pd  and  0.20  g/t  Pt;  Indicated Resource of 783,000 tonnes at 1.00 % Ni; 0.53 % Cu; 0.06 % Co; 0.91 g/t Pd and 0.29 g/t  Pt  and  Inferred  Resource:  1,053,000  tonnes  at  0.81 %  Ni;  0.32 %  Cu;  0.06 %  Co; 1.06 g/t Pd and 0.50 g/t Pt (Trudel, 2009). The resources are reported without the use of a cut-off grade.

Tucana  Exploration Inc. owns  an exploration property located in between the Whabouchi  Property  and  the  Nisk  property  known  as  the  Abigail  Property  (Figure 23.1). A technical report for exploration on the property was prepared by Solumines and highlighted the potential for five (5) types of mineral  deposits, but significant mineralization as yet to be discovered: 1) lithium (spodumene)-bearing pegmatites; 2) magmatic nickel sulphide deposits associated with an ultramafic intrusion; 3) volcanogenic massive sulphide (VMS) deposits; 4) Uranium and associated elements in pegmatites and 5) chromite deposits.

## 23.1 Comparable Projects

Nemaska  also  published  recently  (January  15 th , 2014)  a  technical  report  for  the resources  estimation  of  a  second  lithium  property  named  Sirmac.  This  property  is located  120 km  southeast  of  the  Whabouchi  Property.  The  Sirmac  deposit  comprises 185 kt of Measured Resources at an average grade of 1.40 % Li2O, 79 kt of Indicated Resources  at  a  grade  of  1.40 %  Li O  and  40 kt  of  Inferred  Resources  at  a  grade  of 2 1.10 % Li2O, using a cut-off grade of 0.50 % Li O. A mineral potential for tantalum was 2 also reported for the Sirmac property with 147 kt at an average grade of 0.01 % Ta O 2 5 reported using a cut-off grade of 0.005 % Ta O . 2 5

Other exploration properties also developing spodumene-bearing pegmatites are located in the region surrounding the Whabouchi Property. The Rose-Pivert property owned by Critical Element Corp. and located 47 km northwest of Whabouchi hosts a NI 43-101 compliant  Mineral  Resource.  The  Mineral  Resources  estimate  for  the  Rose  project  is dated  July  20 th , 2011  (Genivar,  2011).  This  is  the  most  recent  Mineral  Resources estimate for the Rose project and it comprises Indicated Mineral Resources of 26.5 Mt grading 0.98 % Li2O and 163 ppm Ta2O5 and Inferred Mineral Resources of 10.7 Mt grading 0.86 % Li2O and 145 ppm Ta2O5. A minimum mining width of two (2) metres (true width) and cut-off grades ('tonne values') of $ 41 /t (for the open pit model) and $ 66 /t (for the underground model) were used for the Mineral Resource Estimate. These resources are part of a Preliminary Economic Assessment published by Critical Element on December 20 th , 2011.

Galaxy Resources Inc. lithium property located 105 km northwest of Whabouchi hosts an NI 43-101 compliant with in-pit Mineral Resources containing Indicated Resources of  11.75 Mt  grading  at  1.30 %  Li O  and  Inferred  Resources  of  10.47 Mt  grading  at 2 1.20 %  Li O.  The  Mineral  Resources  are  reported  using  a  0.75 %  Li O  cut-off  grade 2 2 (SRK - November 2010).

At 125 km southeast of Whabouchi, the Moblan property jointly owned by Perilya Ltd, through Globe Star Mining (60 %) and Soquem (40 %) hosts an NI 43-101 compliant Mineral Resources comprising 4.7 Mt grading 1.63 % Li2O in the Measured category, 6.8 Mt grading 1.33 % Li2O in the Indicated category with an additional 2.8 Mt grading 1.22 % Li2O in the Inferred category, using a cut-off grade of 0.6 % Li O (Perilya NR 2 May 2011).

The information is not necessarily indicative of the mineralization on the Property that is the subject of the Technical Report.

## 24.0 OTHER RELEVANT DATA AND INFORMATION

## 24.1 Project Schedule

The Project implementation schedule covers all the areas of the Project and includes the engineering,  procurement,  construction  and  commissioning  of  the  facilities,  including the  main  sub-station,  the  processing  installations  and  the  site  infrastructures.  Preproduction mining, initial water management, and related activities are also part of the Project implementation schedule.

The hydrometallurgical plant will be the most important element in terms of scope and magnitude. As a result, the overall schedule is governed by the engineering, equipment delivery, construction, commissioning, and other activities related to the start-up of this processing facility.

The schedule assumes that the Project execution team will start in the third quarter of 2014.  The  schedule  also  assumes  that  the  environmental  permits,  required  to  start construction  work  at  the  site,  will  be  received  by  December,  2014.  The  planned production start-up is for the second quarter of 2017. Figure 24.1 presents a summary of the Project Schedule.

## 24.2 Whabouchi Construction

## 24.2.1 Construction Infrastructure

A construction camp and a permanent camp will be required for the Project. These two (2) camps will be built by the Compagnie de Construction et Développement Cri Ltée (' CCDC ')  on  their  own  site  at  the Relais  Routier  Nemiscau at  km 291  on Route  du Nord and will be operated by them, including all the required services.

A 125 rooms camp is already installed at the Relais Routier Nemiscau and is awaiting the official announcement for the start of construction to be hooked up to the existing services in place. Depending on the construction schedule, temporary accommodations could  easily  be  added  to  meet  the  construction  requirements.  Once  the  Project  is confirmed  and  well  underway,  a  new  more  spacious  90 rooms  permanent  camp  for Nemaska Lithium employees will be built in parallel with the construction phase and help fulfill the construction requirements.

The  common  areas  of  the  permanent  camp,  such  as  the  kitchen  and  the  recreational areas will be used by the residents of the construction and permanent camps. Thus, the kitchen  capacity  in  the  permanent  camp  will  be  sized  to  accommodate  the  additional load from the construction workforce.

Permanent power will be delivered by Hydro-Québec in time for the start of production. Until the time when the main sub-station will be commissioned, construction power will be supplied through a temporary installation.

## 24.2.2 Mining

In 2015, initial orders for mining equipment are expected to be placed. Deliveries will start in the second quarter of 2016 and assembly will have taken place in time for preproduction to start in the fourth quarter of 2016. Logistics for on-site assembly plans will  be  made  to  ensure  that  all  equipment  will  be  operational  in  time  to  perform  the mine production tonnages corresponding to the mine planning requirements.

## 24.2.3 Site Infrastructure

Detailed engineering related to site infrastructures is scheduled to start with the award of  the  EPCM  services.  Related  procurement  activities  are  to  follow  three  (3)  months later.  Construction  of  the  maintenance  garage  which  include  offices,  change  room, guard  office,  etc.,  is  expected  to  be  substantially  completed  by  the  second  quarter  of 2015 to be used as construction on-site facilies.

## 24.2.4 Concentrator Processing Plant

## a) Processing Plant Implementation Plan

The  processing  plant  implementation  plan  takes  into  account  that  detailed engineering is required to start within 12 months prior to the construction start-up. The  implementation  plan  covers  the  period  from  the  ball  mill  specification preparation up to the end of the processing plant commissioning. The schedule is derived from  major equipment  typical delivery information obtained from suppliers.

<!-- image -->

## b) Engineering

In  order  to  achieve  a  proposed  plant  commissioning  and  start-up  in  the  fourth quarter of 2016, proper sequencing of detailed engineering is fundamental. Being ready to start construction of the concentrator building early in the spring 2016 is of prime importance in this plan. When ever possible, foundations will be casted in  place  during  the  third  and  fourth  quarters  of  2015.  To  help  achieve  this aggressive  schedule,  a  pre-engineered  building  shell-type  construction  has  also been selected. Key to this type of installation is freezing the equipment layout and building  sizing  early.  In  order  to  achieve  this,  all  major  mechanical  equipment with potential impact on these elements will be designed and procured at the onset of the Project.

The detailed engineering for the processing plant is estimated at 18 months and will include the mobile crushing equipment and the process plant.

## c) Long Lead Items

As part of this Study, budgetary prices and delivery periods have been requested from  suppliers  for  major  equipment.  The  equipment  fabrication  times  for  the pressure  filters,  ball  mill  have  a  delivery  period  from  12  to  14  months.  The implementation schedule allows for 14 months for the crusher and grinding mills to be delivered on site.

## d) Procurement Plan

In  order  to  complete  engineering,  certified  drawings  will  be  required.  For  this reason,  efforts  will  be  made  to  purchase  all  other  equipment  early.  This  has  a secondary advantage of securing early fabrication slots, hence reducing the impact of  potential  fabrication  delays.  The  procurement  of  equipment  will  include  the preparation of comprehensive engineering and tender documents.

## e) Construction

The  first  priority  will  be  site  preparation  and  temporary  installations  such  as construction  management  camp  and  temporary  construction  power  distribution. Early during the site preparation, the concrete contractor will install a batch plant to  be  ready  for  the  first  concrete  pour.  Construction  activities  will  start  with concrete  foundations  for  the  maintenance  garage  facility,  the  grinding  mill  and concentrator  building.  The  building  shell,  complete  with  siding  panels,  will  be erected. Other equipment foundations, elevated concrete slabs and finally the slab on grade in the main process building will precede the erection of the balance of the  steel.  The  structural  steel  work  of  the  main  process  building  will  follow, starting from the grinding area moving northeast along the plant site. The building roofing  and  siding  will  follow  to  complete  building  closure  that  will  allow workers to work in an enclosed area. The internal equipment steel supports and platforms will then precede the grinding mills installation and mechanical, piping and electrical work  will continue to completion in December  2016.  The commissioning  will  start  in  parallel  with  the  end  of  construction  as  soon  as

<!-- image -->

systems  will  be  ready.  All  other  work  areas  not  on  the  critical  path  will  be optimized, based on resources leveling and availability.

## f) Commissioning and Start-Up

The  commissioning  activities will be performed  by  a team  comprised  of construction managers,  contractors,  engineers, suppliers' representatives and operation personnel in order to maximize efficiency. A four (4) month commissioning  period  has  been  scheduled.  The  dry  commissioning  will  start while the construction will still be on-going. A detailed commissioning schedule will  identify  process  systems  that  can  be  commissioned  prior  to  construction completion  and  turned  over  to  Operations  to  reduce  the  last  minute  turnover procedures. Commissioning  will  start  with  individual equipment  evaluation followed by a dry run for a short period. Systems will then be flushed and run with water, where possible, to check functionality of controls and equipment. Any discovered deficiencies or leaks will then be repaired. Once all process deficiencies are corrected, systems will be turned over to the production personnel to start normal operation.

## 24.2.5 Water Management

Detailed engineering for water management will be initiated in the fall of 2014. Actual earthworks, dykes and trenches, required for the start-up of operations, will be carried out between both the summer and fall of 2016.

## 24.3 Valleyfield Construction

This part of the Project will follow the same schedule basis. Delivery periods have been requested  from  suppliers  for  the  major  equipment.  The  long  lead  equipment  area  as follows:

- · Electrolysis cells delivery 40 to 60 weeks After Reception of Order (' ARO ');
- · Kiln and cooler delivery 52 weeks ARO;
- · Crystallizer delivery 48 weeks ARO.

The construction and commissioning are aligned with the completion of the Wabouchi Plant since the concentrate from this Plant will be required for start-up.

## 25.0 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS

## 25.1 Conclusion

The Whabouchi Lithium Deposit and Hydromet Plant Project consists in the development of an open mine 300 km North of Chibougamau and a lithium compounds production complex to be built in Salaberry-de-Valleyfield.

The parameters used in this Feasibility Study warrant the development of a 1,015 Mt/y open-pit  mine  using  a  small  fleet  of  mining  equipment  for  the  first  20  years,  then followed by an underground operation for the following six (6) years, construction of a concentrator  at  the  mine  site  (crushing,  dense  media  separation,  grinding,  flotation circuits  and  magnetic separation) with a nominal capacity of 3,016 t/d of mineralized material  at  92 %  availability  and  the  construction  of  a  31,500  t/y  lithium  compounds complex production plant at Salaberry-de-Valleyfield.

Met-Chem has examined the technical and economic aspects of the Whabouchi mine Project  within  the  level  of  precision  of  a  feasibility  study.  The  current  Report  is  a Feasibility Study in conformance with the standards required by NI 43-101 and Form 43 101F1.

A computed cash flow analysis was developed by Met-Chem from the technical aspects and  on  metal  prices  projections  made  for  lithium  hydroxide  and  carbonate  from  a reputable market study.

As it stands, the Whabouchi deposit contains a Mineral Reserves.

Consequently, Met-Chem concludes that the Whabouchi Lithium Deposit and Hydromet  Plant  Project  is  technically  feasible  as  well  as  economically  viable.  The authors  of  this  Technical  Report  consider  the  Whabouchi  Project  to  be  sufficiently robust to warrant moving it to the implementation phase.

## 25.2 Risks Evaluation

Most aspects of the Whabouchi Lithium Deposit and Hydrometallurgical Plant Project are  fairly  well  defined,  however  some  aspects  and  assumptions  need  to  be  taken  into consideration while reviewing this Report. Met-Chem has proposed several recommendations that should be followed up to for the next phase in Section 26.0.

The  most  significant  risks  identified  in  the  Project  were  in  technology,  markets  and environmental as explained in the following paragraphs.

On the mining side, the main risks relate to the pit slope angles and the stability of the underground openings. Mitigation measures include re-evaluation of the final pit walls after a few years of operation and prepare a detail geotechnical study for the stablity of the underground infrastucture and open stopes.

The size and grade of the Whabouchi deposit are well defined. The process to produce spodumene concentrate is also well known and should not be problematic. However the processes  of  making  lithium  hydroxide  monohydrate  from  spodumene  concentrate  by electromembrane  process  and  lithium  carbonate  from  lithium  hydroxide  in  solution,

<!-- image -->

have  only  been  developed  recently  by  Nemaska  with  the  assistance  of  SGS  and  and Electrosynthesis Company, Inc. These processes, for which Nemaska has filed several patent applications, have not been used on a commercial basis and therefore risk that the production and capital costs associated to this portion of the processes differ from the ones used in the economic analysis which could have a direct impact on the economics of the Project.

Lithium  is  considered  as  an  industrial  mineral  and  the  sales  prices  for  the  different lithium compounds are not public. Sales agreements are negotiated on an individual and private basis with each different end-user. Therefore it is possible that the sales prices used in the financial analysis be different than the actual market when Nemaska is in fact in a position to sell lithium compounds. In addition, there are a limited number of producers of lithium compounds and it is possible that these existing producers try to prevent new comers in the chain of supply by increasing their production capacity and lowering sales prices. In such case the economics of the Project could be affected.

Gypsum  and  aluminum  silicate  by-product  disposition  could  become  problematic should  the  identified  potential  end-users  not  accepting  the  product  as  is.  Although valorisation of these products have shown high potential, no cost for its disposition in regulated landfill neither as potential sales revenues have been included in this Report. However, testing with the financial model has shown that neither alternative will have a major impact on the economics of the Project, with the inclusion of a revenue being more important as shown by the sensitivy analysis curves.

One important uncertainty of the Project is the delay to obtain the required authorization ( Certificat d'autorisation ) to start construction of the mine  and  concentrator  at Whabouchi, as well as the underlying conditions to the Authorization certificate from MDDELCC. Consequently it is possible that the capital and operating costs forecasted in the financial model be different and increased in such a way as to affect the economic of the Project.

The  delays  to  obtain  construction  permits,  therfeore  beginning  of  production  of concentrate at Whabouchi, may allow other project to begin production before Nemaska and therefore reduce the portion of the market that Nemaska is targeting, which would impact  sales  level  and  economic  of  the  Project.  However,  processus  to  obtain  such permits are well underway and significant progress has been made so far.

Nemaska  intends  to  produce  mainly  lithium  hydroxide  monohydrate  to  address  the increasing demand  for that compound  favored  in the making  of cathodes for rechargeable batteries. If cathode manufacturers use less hydroxide than expected or if the demand for rechargeable batteries, mainly in the electric and hybrid vehicles, is less than forecasted, it could have an effect on the sales price of that compound and the need for new production.

## 26.0 RECOMMENDATIONS

This Feasibility Study demontrates that the Whabouchi Lithium Deposit and Hydromet Plant Project is technically feasible as well as economically viable.

The following recommendations should be considered during the implementation of this Project.

## 26.1 For Whabouchi Site

- · Update  the  pit  optimization  analysis  before  mining  commences  with  current lithium prices to confirm the limits of the open pit;
- · Complete an evaluation to determine if there is a benefit in using a contract miner to carry out the mining operations;
- · Continue test work on alternate flotation equipment. This has shown potential to further reduce capital and operating cost while improving overall recovery;
- · Start discussions with proper authorities to finalize the trans-shipment site in the Chibougamau area;
- · Perform detail underground stability studies prior to development of the underground mine around Year 18 of the mine life;
- · Define the extensions of the underground extensions of the deposit;
- · Continue environmental investigation to comply with regulations;
- · Finalize local communities' discussions to get Project acceptability and conclude the RDPA;
- · Continue discussions with Hydro-Québec to firm-up power supply, costs to site and long term road and airport sharing arrangement;
- · Prepare to award long lead items contracts at the beginning of detailed engineering;
- · Continue discussions with CN  Rail to firm-up a potential agreement for concentrate transportation;
- · Start recruitment of Owner's Construction Management personnel early. Include sufficient float in schedule to minimize delays risks.

## 26.2 For Hydrometallurgical Plant

- · Continue investigation into membrane material composition in order to improve operating life and efficiency;
- · Further define aluminium silicates and gypsum by-product characteristics in order to make these products attractive to potential clients;
- · Continue  discussions  with  Hydro-Québec  to  firm-up  power  supply  and  costs  to site;
