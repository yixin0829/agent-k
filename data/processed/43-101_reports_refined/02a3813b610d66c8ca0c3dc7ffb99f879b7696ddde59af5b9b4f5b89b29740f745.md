## 1 SUMMARY

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

## INTRODUCTION

Roscoe Postle Associates Inc. (RPA) was retained by IAMGOLD  Corporation (IAMGOLD),  to  prepare  an  independent  Technical  Report  on  the  Niobec  Mine  (the Project), near Ville de Saguenay (Chicoutimi), Québec.  The purpose of this report is to prepare an updated Mineral Resource estimate and a Preliminary Economic Assessment  (PEA)  on  the  viability  of  an  open  pit  (OP)  mining  option  and  production expansion  at  the  Project.  This  Technical  Report  conforms  to  NI  43-101  Standards  of Disclosure for Mineral Projects.  RPA visited the property on March 4, 2011 and again from March 21 to 22, 2011.

## CONCLUSIONS

It is RPA's opinion that mining the Niobec deposit by open pit mining method may have considerable  potential  over  the  current  underground  method  to  extend  mine  life  and better maximize the extraction of the resource.  The Project base case scenario consists of technical and cost assumptions outlined in this report.

The Project will benefit from the expertise developed in the existing operation, including the processing and converting of niobium ore into ferroniobium over the years and the local and regional infrastructure currently used in the niobium mining/milling/converting activities at the mine site.

The  most  important  risk  elements  for  the  Project  are  the  niobium  price  and,  at  the present time, the location of waste rock dumps in areas with underlying soils capable of supporting the large tonnage of waste rock.  Fluctuations in the niobium price constitute an  uncontrollable  parameter  for  which  no  mitigation  measures  are  proposed.  Other elements  to  which  the  Project  is  economically  sensitive  are  controllable  and  will  be addressed  in  further  steps.    Waste  rock  dump  issues  should  be  investigated  as  the Project progresses.

At the PEA level, the open pit scenario is technically feasible and economically viable and  should  be  advanced  to  the  pre-feasibility  study  level.    The  economic  analysis contained in this report is based, in part, on Inferred Resources, and is preliminary in nature.  Inferred Resources are considered too geologically speculative to have mining and  economic  considerations  applied  to  them  and  to  be  categorized  as  Mineral Reserves.    There  is  no  certainty  that  the  reserves  development,  production,  and economic  forecasts  on  which  this  preliminary  economic  assessment  is  based  will  be realized.

## Specific conclusions are as follows:

- · The  combined  Measured  and  Indicated  Resources  are  458.11  million  tonnes grading 0.42% Nb2O5 containing 1,927 million kg Nb2O5.  In addition, there is an Inferred  Resource  of  336.45  million  tonnes  grading  0.37%  Nb2O5  containing 1,240 million kg Nb2O5.  All these Mineral Resources are constrained by a Whittle open pit shell (6T) at a cut-off grade of 0.20% Nb2O5.
- · A second economic optimization, which was time constrained, was performed on the 6T pit shell in order to maximize the net present value (NPV) at 8%.  The maximum NPV occurs at a cut-off grade of 0.33% Nb2O5.  This resulted in a total of 370.2 million tonnes of niobium bearing material grading 0.46% Nb2O5 within a smaller pit shell, 4T (564 m deep).  The proportion of Inferred Resources in the above  tonnage  that  may  be  potentially  mineable  via  open  pit  is  approximately 20%.
- · Ore production will be expanded from the current level of 2.2 million tonnes per year from underground to 10 million tonnes per year from OP.  The life of mine (LOM)  of  the  OP  scenario  will  be  42  years,  consisting  of  four  years  of  preproduction  and  38  years  of  production.  During  the  pre-production  period,  the existing underground mine will contribute, at the current mining rate, an additional 8.8 Mt  grading  0.60% Nb2O5.  At full  production,  ore  will  be  mined  at  a  rate  of 27,400 tpd requiring the excavation of 109,000 tpd waste on average over the Project total duration.
- · As part of the analysis of options, RPA and IAMGOLD reviewed an underground block caving scenario as an alternative to an open pit.  At this level of study and assumptions,  the  underground  scenario  is  a  viable  but  slightly  less  attractive option than the open pit scenario.
- · Project  components  and  costs  were  developed  to  a  ±  40%  level  of  accuracy. Operating  costs  were  estimated  in  2011  Canadian  dollars  while  capital  costs were mostly estimated in 2011 US dollars.
- · Capital expenditures, including 15% contingency and sustaining/ongoing investments,  are  estimated  to  be  US$1.4  billion  (excluding  the  recovery  of

US$66.4 million for working capital and warehouse inventory at the end of the LOM). This amount excludes taxes, duties, and inflation.  Initial open pit related capital expenditures will amount to US$830 million; the remaining capital outlay is considered as ongoing investment that will occur during the production period or the operation of the existing underground mine (US$91 million) during the preproduction period.

- · The total mine site and ore processing operating cost, for the period ranging from 2011  to  2052  inclusively,  is  estimated  to  be  C$26.67/t  milled.  This  includes mining,  mineral  processing  and  converting,  maintenance,  administration  and human resources costs.
- · At peak, manpower  is estimated to be 743 individuals for the various administrative  units,  namely  administration,  mine,  mill,  converter,  and  surface and electrical.
- · IAMGOLD  and  RPA  developed  the  open  pit  mine  plan  based  on  a  3D  block model built by RPA.  RPA is of the opinion the resource model is conservative and has good potential to expand.  The pit shell comprises many blocks that are outside the four main zones, in the mineralized carbonatite where limited to no information is available.  A grade of zero has been assigned to those blocks.
- · There are no current Mineral Reserves estimated for the open pit mining option at  Niobec.    Mineral  Reserves  will  be  assessed  at  the  pre-feasibility  stage  of study.
- · Open pit mining will be carried out along 564 vertical metres.  For the pit size, production  requirements,  and  recommended  equipment  fleet,  RPA  considers mining  of  12  m  benches  and  33  m  wide  ramps,  including  ditches  and  safety berms, to be appropriate.
- · Ore will be delivered to a gyratory crusher prior to a covered stockpile and then conveyed into the processing plant.  The flowsheet is similar to the current plant, comprising  crushing,  grinding,  desliming,  flotation  (carbonate,  pyrochlore,  and sulphide), dewatering, leaching, filtration, drying, and packaging.  Concentrate is transferred  into  the  converter  where  the  ferroniobium  (FeNb  final  product)  is produced.  The mill and the converter will be new installations to be constructed to handle the increased production and because the current buildings lie within the open pit footprint.  The existing tailings impoundment facility will be expanded to accommodate the additional tonnage.
- · Recovery rates are estimated to be 49.6% Nb2O5 at the processing plant (head grade  dependent)  and  97%  at  the  converting  stage.  FeNb  production  will  total 597 M kg over the LOM.
- · Environment mitigation measures will be implemented, with particular emphasis on the open pit and waste rock dumps.  Proper water control and treatment will be implemented in order to minimize volumes to release final effluent respecting provincial regulations.

- · The conceptual closure plan aims at returning the site in a state compatible with the environment.  Particularly, waste rock dumps and tailings pond will be subject to progressive rehabilitation and revegetation measures while the existing pit will naturally flood once operations cease.
- · An economic evaluation was carried out by means of pre-tax and after-tax cash flow  analysis  expressed  in  2011  constant  US  dollars.  An  exchange  rate  of US$1.00/C$1.05 was assumed. The average metal price forecast is US$45/kg niobium and was assumed to be constant for the duration of the Project, except for the first year of the LOM (2011) at US$40/kg Nb.
- · Sunk costs (exploration and delineation drilling, metallurgical test work, feasibility study  costs,  Environmental  Impact  Assessment,  etc.)  are  not  included  in  the Project capital cost or financial evaluation.
- · Total revenues generated by the Project are estimated to be US$27.3 billion, and operating cash flow before capital costs total US$10.1 billion.  Using a discount rate  of  8%,  the  Project  has  NPVs  of  US$3.3  billion  pre-tax  and  US$2.0  billion after-tax.
- · The after-tax internal rate of return (IRR) of the Project is 47.5%. The after-tax cumulative cash flow turns positive during the third year of the Project production phase and amounts to US$9.3 billion over the LOM.  The capital payback period is 2.2 years.
- · Sensitivity  calculations  were  performed  on  the  Project  cash  flow  by  applying  a ± 20%  variance  on  head  grade,  mill  recovery,  niobium  price,  operating  costs, capital expenditures, and C$/US$ exchange rate. The sensitivity analysis shows that the Project is most sensitive to head grade, mill recovery, and niobium price, moderately sensitive to exchange rate and operating costs, and less sensitive to capital costs.

## RECOMMENDATIONS

RPA makes the following recommendations:

- · Initiate the preparation of pre-feasibility studies for both the block caving and the open pit options in order to compare scenarios at a higher level of definition and accuracy, given both returned quite similar economic results.
- · Confirm the waste rock dump location.
- · Initiate geotechnical  assessments  of  underlying/surrounding  overburden  and soils at waste rock dumps, open pit, and tailings pond locations.
- · Initiate geomechanical and rock mechanics assessments for open pit wall slope angle  and  stability, and  effects  on  advancing  pit  bottom  through  existing underground openings.

- · Initiate an environmental program that will result in the preparation of a document in  support  of  permitting.  The  program  should  be  comprehensive  and  include baseline  work,  acid  base  accounting,  waste  rock  dump  stability,  tailings  pond stability,  open  pit  wall  stability,  radon  and  radiation  emission,  dust  emission, water balance and hydrology, salt contamination of water being exposed to rock in open pit and waste rock dumps and socio-economic studies.
- · Initiate negotiations with individuals and governments concerning land purchases.
- · Carry  out  further  metallurgical  testwork,  using  representative  samples.  The program  would  consist  of  completing  test  work  to  a  typical  standard  for  prefeasibility study, including:
- o Crushing  and  milling  (SAG  work  index)  to  properly  design  and  select equipment.
- o Extensive  metallurgical  testwork  to  validate  the  niobium  recovery  and concentrate quality grade, given the lower head grade anticipated and the sensitivity of final product to impurities.
- o Niobium recovery  improvement in  investigating modifications  to  reagent scheme  and  process  flowsheet,  in  considering  previous  testing  on niobium recovery from the plant tailings and by benchmarking mill results with the laboratory results.
- o Comparative  testwork  between  conventional  grinding  and  classification presently used and new grinding circuit using SAG-ball mill.
- · Carry  out  specific  hydrological/hydrogeological  studies  to  refine  dewatering needs in the underground mine during pre-production period and in the open pit mine over the LOM.
- · Carry out condemnation drilling in advance of mining in areas where waste rock dumps  and  the  tailings  storage  facility  are  expected  to  be  located  for  the operations.
- · For the resource database:
- o Remove duplicate sample numbers from the drill database and investigate zero values for Nb2O5.
- o Investigate  the  large  number  of  assays  in  the  database  without  sample numbers, if possible, by cross referencing drill logs and assay certificates.
- o Study the use of a top cut for Nb2O5 assay results and consider adoption for future resource estimations.
- o Initiate the insertion of blanks and  independent  certified reference materials (CRM) into the sample stream so that they comprise approximately  15%  to  20%  of  the  total  determinations.    RPA  also recommends external laboratory check on sample rejects in addition  to sample pulps.
- o Investigate  the  cause  of  the  mild  bias  observed  in  pulp  duplicates assayed at a second, independent, laboratory.
- o Study the use of equal length composites for resource estimation rather than raw samples.

The economic analysis contained in this report is based, in part, on Inferred Resources, and  is  preliminary  in  nature.    Inferred  Resources  are  considered  too  geologically speculative  to  have  mining  and  economic  considerations  applied  to  them  and  to  be categorized as Mineral Reserves.  There is no certainty that the reserves development, production, and economic forecasts on which this preliminary economic assessment is based will be realized.

## CASH FLOW ANALYSIS

Considering  the  Project  on  a  stand-alone  basis,  the  undiscounted  pre-tax  cash  flow totals US$15.0 billion over the mine life, and simple payback occurs near the mid-point of 2016 (approximately 19 months from start of OP production).  On an after-tax basis, the undiscounted cash flow is US$9.3 billion and the payback occurs at the beginning of 2017 (approximately 26 months from start of open pit production).

The Total Cash Cost is US$16.15 per kg of niobium. The mine life capital unit cost is US$2.35 per kg, for a Total Production Cost of US$18.50 per kg of niobium.  Average niobium production during underground and open pit operations is 14.2 million  kg per year.

The  pre-tax  NPV  at  an  8%  discount  rate  is  US$3.3  billion  and  the  after-tax  NPV  is US$2.0 billion, and the after-tax IRR is 47.5%.

Table 1-2 is a comparison of the economic impact of the 10 Mtpa open pit scenario and the 10 Mtpa block caving scenario to the current LOM plan.

Notes::

- 1. Although the resources are estimated down to Block 6, the NPV under both scenarios only assesses the economic impact of the first 42 years.
- 2. Based on a US$45/kg niobium price. The current margin is US$18/kg based on a US$40/kg niobium price.
- 3. Includes working capital, warehouse inventory and C$20 M of capital for pre-stripping (in the OP scenario).
- 4. Includes the sustaining capital for the current operation and the sustaining capital required for the expansion.
- 5. Assumed niobium prices per kilogram are US$40/kg in 2011 and US$45/kg thereafter as estimated by an independent source.
- 6. Percentage points above the IRR of the current 2.2 Mtpa scenario.

## SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS

Project risks can be identified in both economic and non-economic terms.  Key economic risks were examined by running cash flow sensitivities:

- · Head Grade
- · Mill Recovery
- · Niobium Price
- · Operating Costs
- · Capital Costs
- · Exchange Rate

## HISTORY

SOQUEM  Inc.  (SOQUEM)  discovered  the  Niobec  deposit  while  conducting  airborne geophysical surveys to explore for uranium in 1967.  In 1970, SOQUEM entered into a joint  venture  agreement  (JVA)  with  Copperfields  Mining  Corporation  (Copperfields),  a predecessor company of Teck Resources (Teck), to explore and develop the niobium deposit.

A joint decision was taken, in 1974, to initiate the development of a 1,500 tpd mine and mill under  the  management  of  Teck.  The  mine  was  completed  and  commercial operations  started  in  1976  with  the  production  of  the  first  niobium  pentoxide  (Nb O ) 2 5 concentrate.    In  1979,  mine  production  was  increased  by  30%  and  mill  throughput increased approximately 50% to 2,260 tpd.

As  a  result  of  the  partial  privatization  of  SOQUEM  in  1986,  the  50%  interest  in  the Project was transferred to Cambior Inc. (Cambior).

In 1994, the process was expanded to allow conversion to ferroniobium to expand the marketability of the product.

Teck sold its 50% interest to Mazarin Inc. (Mazarin) in 2001.  A corporate reorganization of Mazarin resulted in the creation of Sequoia Minerals Inc. (Sequoia) that comprised the industrial minerals segment of Mazarin's holdings.  In 2004, Sequoia was acquired by Cambior and in 2006 IAMGOLD and Cambior merged.

## GEOLOGY

## REGIONAL GEOLOGY

The Saguenay region is underlain by Grenville Province rocks of the Canadian Shield.  It is characterized by high-grade metamorphic terranes and deep-level thrust stacks along ductile  shear  zones.    During  the  Grenvillian  Orogeny  (1.08  Ga  to  0.98  Ga),  extensive crustal thickening and tectonic extrusion led to widespread high grade metamorphism. Tectonic  extension  at  the  beginning  of  the  Paleozoic  incorporated  normal  faulting, updoming, and igneous alkaline activity and resulted in the formation of the St. Lawrence River Rift system.

<!-- image -->

The  Saint-Honoré  alkaline  complex  (SAC)  which  hosts  the  Niobec  Mine,  is  situated along the Saguenay Graben, a 250 km long and 25 km to 40 km wide structure that extends  from  the  St.  Lawrence  River  near  Tadoussac  to  the  Lac  St.-Jean  district. Geology in the vicinity of the SAC comprises anorthosite, syenites, and magnetic diorite gneiss.  Shales and limestones found in the vicinity of Saint-Honoré are thought to be the result of a marine transgression during the Ordovician period (about 470 Ma).

## PROPERTY GEOLOGY

The  SAC,  the  host  to  the  Niobec  Mine,  is  elliptical  in  plan  view  with  a  north-south trending major axial length of four kilometres and covers approximately 12 km 2 in area. It is comprised of a series of crescent shaped lenses whose age and composition vary with proximity to the core.

The two main niobium zones are subvertical and lenticular in shape.  Foliated and often brecciated dolomites and calcites alternate with more massive dolomites that contain red ankerite  alteration.    The  foliated  and  brecciated  unit  is  host  to  pyrochlore,  the  most prevalent niobium mineral, while the massive unit is less mineralized.

## MINERAL RESOURCES AND MINERAL RESERVES

RPA conducted an independent update of Mineral Resource estimation, constrained in a Whittle  open  pit  shell.    Grades  for  Nb O ,  SiO ,  P O ,  and  Fe O 2 5 2 2 5 2 3 were estimated into blocks using ID  weighting.  Table 1-4 presents Mineral Resource estimates constrained 2 by Whittle open pit shell at a cut-off grade of 0.2% Nb2O5.

Notes::

- 1. CIM definitions were followed for Mineral Resources.
- 2. The Qualified Person for this Mineral Resource estimate is Bernard Salmon, ing.
- 3. Mineral Resources are estimated at a cut-off grade of 0.20% Nb2O5.
- 4. Mineral Resources are estimated using an average long-term niobium price of US$42 per kg and a US$/C$ exchange rate of 1:1.05.
- 5. Mineral Resources are constrained by a pit shell to the 2400 level (725 m below surface).
- 6. Numbers may not add due to rounding.

Grade estimation was conducted using ID  in Gemcom GEMS v6.3.0.1 software using 2 uncut  original  assays  employing  'hard  boundaries'  between  mineralized  domains. Interpolation of grade inside the blocks was done using the following parameters:

- · First Pass - Search ellipse dimension of 24.4 m by 18.3 m by 9.1 m.
- · Second Pass - Search ellipse dimension of 48.8 m by 36.6 m by 9.1 m.
- · Third Pass - Search ellipse dimension of 121.9 m by 91.4 m by 18.2 m.

RPA notes that while Nb2O5 is the only material of economic value, other materials, such as SiO2, Fe2O3 and P2O5 are also estimated, using the same methodology as Nb2O5, because of their importance for blending to maintain the metallurgical recovery of the mill feed.

As  the  metallurgical  recovery  of  the  niobium  is  variable,  each  individual  sample  was coded  based  on  its  lithology  and  mineralization.    In  the  block  model,  each  block  is assigned a code using 'nearest neighbour' estimation employing the same large search ellipse used for Nb2O5 grade estimation.

There are no current Mineral Reserves estimated for the open pit or block caving mining options.  Mineral Reserves will be assessed at the pre-feasibility stage of study.

## MINING OPERATIONS

The  Niobec  Mine  has  been  in  production  since  1976.  The  present  four  compartment shaft is 850 m deep and is used for production (ore hoisting) and services (materials and manpower).  In addition to the shaft, the mine is serviced by a ramp reaching a depth of 750 m.

Actual  production  levels  are  located  on  the  600,  1000,  and  1450  levels  and  there  is further  development  on  the  300,  700,  and  1150  levels.    Development  on  production levels  is  mainly  used  for  ore  haulage  by  trucks  to  the  ore  pass.    Development  is performed using hydraulic jumbos.  Ground support is performed to secure the openings using bolters.  The broken rock is loaded by load haul dump units (LHD) and hauled by truck to the ore pass.  The ore is crushed and hoisted to surface by a skip.  Horizontal sill pillars are left between the production levels.

Open stoping has been the main mining method used since mine start-up. Transition to underground paste fill mining method is ongoing.  The open stoping method is still used in the upper part of the mine in Block 1 to 3.  The average size of the stopes is about 60 m in length, 25 m in width, and 90 m in height.  A 25 m pillar is left between the stopes. Secondary extraction of the pillars can be carried out after the complete extraction of the primary stopes.  Paste fill mining method is planned in Block 4 to 6.

Three  underground  mining  scenarios  were  investigated  in  order  to  guide  future expansion.  The  first  scenario  is  an  updated  LOM  using  the  latest  2010  reserve  and resource  estimates.    The  second  scenario  involves  the  addition  of  three  new  mining blocks (7 to 9) using the paste fill mining method.  The third scenario involves a change in the mining method approach as the mine would be converted to block caving.  This scenario was built using the April 2011 RPA block model.

RPA, in collaboration with IAMGOLD, investigated the potential for open pit mining at the Niobec  property.  Whittle  pit  optimization  runs  were  performed  based  on  the  following costs and operating parameters:

• Open pit mining:

$1.80/t moved

• Milling:

$9.50/t milled

• G&amp;A:

$1.25/t milled

• Converting:

$4.00/kg Nb

<!-- image -->

• Marketing and freight:

$1.41/kg Nb 97%

• Mill recovery:

40% to 60%, depending on Nb2O5 head grade

• Converter recovery:

- · Niobium in FeNb:

69.9%.

Revenue  factors  were  calculated  using  the  above  metallurgical  recoveries  based  on Niobec historical  data. The  revenue factors  were  used  to generate  a  net  value  model which was used to float cones in the Whittle software.

For  the  purpose  of  pit  optimization,  a  re-blocking  of  the  block  model  was  done  to increase block size to 24.4 m by 24.4 m horizontal by 15.2 m vertical.  A pit optimization was run  using  the  previous  inputs  and  a  pit  slope  of  45°.  The  values  of  blocks  were calculated  using  a  niobium  price  based  on  long-term forecasts  of  $45  per  kg  and  the aforementioned mill and converter recoveries.

The Whittle  economic  optimization  yielded  a  pit  (Pit  6T)  which  contained  the  Mineral Resources  stated  previously  in  this  report.  A  second  economic  optimization  was performed  on  the  first  Whittle  result  by  means  of  IAMGOLD's  Comet  Production Scheduler  Software  in  order  to  maximize  the  NPV  at  8%.  A  time  parameter  was introduced into this process to force the schedule to stop in 2052, as was done in the block  caving  scenario,  for  comparison  purposes.  The  maximum  NPV  of  this  pit optimization process occurred at a cut-off grade of 0.33% Nb2O5.

The exercise returned 370  Mt grading 0.46% Nb2O5 and corresponds to a smaller pit within Pit 6T, Pit 4T.  The proportion of Inferred Resources in the material that may be potentially  mineable  via  open  pit  is  approximately  20%.  Waste  mining  of  1,482  Mt  is required, for a strip ratio of 4:1. The pit shell is of circular shape with a 1,830 m diameter and is a maximum of 564 m deep.  The crest of the pit encroaches on the current tailings and settling ponds.

For  the  pit  size,  production  requirements,  and  recommended  equipment  fleet,  RPA considers  mining  of  12  m  benches  and  development  of  33  m  wide  ramps,  including ditches and safety berms, to be appropriate.

## MINING APPROACH THROUGH UNDERGROUND MINE OPENINGS AND EXISTING SURFACE INFRASTRUCTURES

An OP mining method will be used to extract all of the ore in the current mining area.  As the pit will be mining through old open stope mine workings, the operating plan includes backfilling of each open stope with crushed limestone or low grade ore when available. During stripping the limestone horizon in the OP, a portion of the waste will be crushed in the pit with a mobile crusher and this material will serve as fill for the UG open stopes of Block 1 via sub-vertical 12 in. to 14 in. diameter drill holes.  Sub-economic or low grade ore from Block 1 will be used to fill Block 2 UG openings and same material from Block 2 will be used to fill Block 3 UG openings following the same approach.  During stripping overburden and waste, the UG mine will operate until the OP will start producing.

During OP mining, if filled UG stopes are encountered on a bench, the fill material will be reclaimed  first  and  hauled  to  the  waste  rock  dump  or  to  low  grade  stock  pile  or  the primary  crusher  and  these  openings  will  serve  as  first  cuts.    The  OP  bench  floor elevations for few assigned benches will be designed to fit with drift floor elevations of the UG level.

The pit footprint will eventually reach the existing tailings pond and will be near the future tailings  pond. When  required,  a  portion  of  the  existing  tailings  will  be  relocated  into  a new pond and the existing pond will be re-profiled.

The location for waste rock dumps was determined based on the area required (12 km² and 76 m high) and with first objectives to minimize the impact on water courses, to have a  100  m  buffer  distance  from  Hydro  Quebec's  high-voltage  power  lines,  and  to  avoid sterilization of known potential Mineral Resources (REE mineralization north of the open pit).    Geotechnical studies and condemnation drilling will have to be carried out at the waste rock dump locations.

Finally,  a  provisional  surface  area  allows  for  land  purchases  for  the  OP  expansion option, particularly for waste rock dumps.

## PRE-PRODUCTION SCHEDULE

It is currently estimated that the feasibility studies and permitting will be completed from 2011 through 2013, overlapped and followed by a development and construction phase of two years with increased production starting in the first quarter of 2015.

## LIFE OF MINE PRODUCTION SCHEDULE

The mill throughput is scheduled at 10 Mtpa in Year 3 and beyond, ramping up from 5 Mtpa and 7.5 Mtpa in the first and second years of production, respectively.

Twelve million tonnes of waste pre-stripping will be required in Year -1. The transition from UG and OP mines will last four years from Year -4 to -1 (or from 2011 to 2014, as currently planned).

The remaining production from the UG mine combined with the OP expansion project results in a 42 year LOM, up to 2052.

## MINE EQUIPMENT

The production schedule requires a fleet capable of moving 55 Mt of material per year, on a 24 hour per day and 365 day per annum schedule.

## INFRASTRUCTURE

The OP expansion option is principally a new construction as the current UG operation will be inside the pit limit created by this mining approach.  As the current shaft will not be  affected  until  mining  activities  reach  the  shaft  installation,  the  existing  UG  shaft services will remain in place as current underground mining will continue until open pit production start-up.

The water line and water recirculation infrastructure  will  continue  to  be  used,  with  the prospect of being expanded.  The remainder of the equipment will require demolition. The existing 25 kV line power will be decommissioned in appropriate areas but will keep supplying power to water pumping stations.

With the pit footprint cutting through the Columbium Road near the current mine site, a new road is proposed to reduce traffic flow around the communities.  This would permit

<!-- image -->

transport of material to Niobec without having to pass through small villages.  The seven kilometre road would be paved.

Building  infrastructure  is  added  to  the  new  open  pit  project  to  provide  appropriate services.    Each  building  is  linked  up  to  fire  suppression  services  where  required  and serviced by a septic field.  Potable water is assumed to be provided by the city of SaintHonoré.

A crushing facility is required to process open pit run-of-mine (ROM) material.  A 54' by 75' Metso crusher is proposed to be used with a 50 t/20 t bridge crane.  The crane will be installed early to be used during construction.  An apron feeder will feed ROM ore via a stockpile conveyor to the ROM coarse ore stockpile of 25,000 t live load capacity.  Ore from the covered stockpile will be fed by four apron feeders via another conveyor to the new grinding facility.

As the existing main electrical substation is located in the zone affected by mining, a new substation is proposed just near the new plant.  Communications system infrastructure is reproduced in the new design taking advantage of fibre optic links from the 25 kV power network.

This  scenario  requires  a  new  processing  plant  as  the  existing  infrastructure  will  be demolished as a result of open pit operations.  Each area has provision for its own or combined heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system.  The areas affected will be Grinding, Desliming, Pyrite Flotation, Carbonates Flotation, Dewatering, Magnetic Separation,  Pyrochlore  Flotation,  Sulphide  Flotation,  Leaching  and  Leach  Filtration, Filtration, Drying and Packaging, Tailings Disposal, Converter, Concentrate Storage, and Tailings and Water Management.

## RECOVERABILITY

Historically at Niobec, the process recovery has varied for the Nb2O5 head grade while the converter recovery has been constant and equal to 97%.  The average grade of the potentially mineable material included in the pit shell implies an average mill recovery of 49.6%.

<!-- image -->

## MINERAL PROCESSING

The process utilized at Niobec was first developed from pilot plant programs.    The ROM ore is crushed to 100% passing 1 ½ in. and fed to rod mills, ball mills, and classification circuits  where  the  ore  is  ground  to  80%  passing  180  µm.  The  ore  is  deslimed  in  two stages  of  cycloning,  and  the  underflow  is  sent  for  conditioning  prior  to  carbonate flotation.  The carbonate concentrate is sent to the tails.  The carbonate flotation rougher and cleaner tails are cycloned in two stages to change the process water and then sent to  the  pyrochlore  rougher  flotation.    The  rougher  concentrate  is  sent  to  five  stages  of cleaner cells.  This is followed by pyrite flotation to remove the sulphides leaching with hydrochloric  acid  to  remove  phosphorus  and  then  followed  by  drying  to  produce  a concentrate  with  less  than  0.1%  moisture  before  being  converted  into  ferroniobium. Since 2000, three major expansions have been completed to increase the ferroniobium production.

## ORE CHARACTERISTICS

The deposit contains at least two dozen minerals but, at the present time, only two of them  are  of  economic  interest.    These  are  pyrochlore  (Na,Ca)Nb2O6F  and  columbite (Fe,Mn)(Nb,Ta)2O6.  Pyrochlore itself does not have a rigid chemical composition and contains REE (tantalum, titanium, strontium and zirconium among others) in addition to niobium.  Up to eight different varieties of pyrochlore can be found in the deposit.  The Fe-enriched  pyrochlore  and  columbite  are  usually  found  in  altered  ore,  but  are  also present in unaltered ore where they are of primary origin.

The variable chemical composition has a major influence on mill production results.  A portion  of  black  Fe-enriched  pyrochlore  and  columbite  at  a  certain  pH  have  surface properties different from those of the sodium type of pyrochlore.  These two minerals are in fact lost to tailings in the flotation process.

## CRUSHING

Primary crushing is done underground with a jaw type crusher before being hoisted to the headframe bin, which has 600 t capacity.  A vibrating feeder is located under the headframe bin in order to feed the conveyor to the secondary crusher.  The secondary crusher is a gyratory type crusher and its product is stored in four 1,200 t insulated bins.

<!-- image -->

## GRINDING

There are two parallel grinding circuits.  Each line is designed with the same equipment specifications.  The tertiary crusher screen undersize and tertiary crusher discharge are directly fed to both rod mills.  The rod mill discharges on each line is combined with the ball  mill  discharges  before  each  feeding  a  24  way  distributor  via  their  mill  discharge pump box pumps.  Each distributor feeds a set of vibrating screens where the coarse material reports to a screw classifier and the fines that are at 80% passing 180 µm are sent to the desliming circuit.

The softness  of  the  ore,  the  relatively  high  specific  gravity  of  the  pyrochlore,  and  the chemistry of the flotation process dictates the configuration of the grinding circuit in order to avoid overgrinding of the pyrochlore crystals.

## DESLIMING

The desliming circuit is designed to remove the material that is smaller than seven µm before flotation.  This is done in two steps of cyclone classification.

## PYRITE FLOTATION

The slurry at 54% solids is first conditioned in two high intensity conditioners in series where  copper  sulphate  and  potassium  amyl  xanthate  (PAX)  are  added.    The  pyrite flotation  is  done  in  two  steps  including  a  rougher  and  cleaner.    The  cleaning  step  is made up of 12 cells.

## CARBONATE FLOTATION

After the pyrite flotation, the slurry is conditioned with high intensity at 55% solids with an emulsified fatty acid collector and the pH stays close to its natural level.  High intensity conditioning  is  done  in  two  agitated  tanks  in  series.    The  carbonate  flotation  has  one rougher step and two cleaning steps.  Approximately 35% of the weight and 9% of the pyrochlore of the mill feed is floated off in the second cleaner concentrate.  The flotation concentrate consists of very fine calcite particles (-50 µm) and medium size apatite.

## DEWATERING

After  carbonate flotation,  the  slurry  is  sent  to  cyclones.    The  slurry  is  first  diluted  with fresh  water  to  30%  solids.    It  is  then  pumped  to  primary  dewatering  cyclones.    The overflow, at about 2% solids, is pumped to the secondary dewatering cyclones.  About

<!-- image -->

4% of the mill feed by weight and 7% of the pyrochlore are removed in the dewatering cyclones overflow.

## MAGNETIC SEPARATION

The  dewatering  cyclone  underflows  are  sent  to  magnetic  separation.    This  process removes 2% of the weight and 1% of the pyrochlore.

## PYROCHLORE FLOTATION

The non-magnetic material from the magnetic separator is pumped to two high intensity conditioning tanks in series.  The slurry is then sent to a bank of flotation cells where the pyrochlore collector is stage added.  The rougher concentrate is sent to five stages of cleaning where the pH is gradually reduced to 2.7.  Approximately 60% of the pyrochlore is recovered in the concentrate in 0.8% of the weight, while 20% of the pyrochlore is sent to the tails

## SULPHIDE FLOTATION

The  cleaned  pyrochlore  concentrate  contains  about  20  wt%  of  pyrite,  which  after  the addition of sodium hydroxide is conditioned with silicate to depress the pyrochlore.  PAX is then added and a rougher pyrite concentrate is floated.

## LEACH FILTERING

The leached product is sent to a belt filter to remove most of the water.  The solid cake is mixed with fresh water and copper sulphate for the second sulphide flotation.

## SECOND SULPHIDE FLOTATION

The  leftover  activated  sulphides  are  floated  in  conventional  type  cells.    The  pH  is adjusted to 11 with NaOH and PAX is added as collector.

## DRYING

The final pyrochlore concentrate is pumped at about 40% solids to a double 4 in. disks filter and sent to a propane countercurrent dryer where the moisture level is reduced to less than 0.1%.

## PACKAGING

The dried product is stored in twelve bins.  The concentrate is packed into large bags by an automated packing-handling system then transferred to the converter.

<!-- image -->

## CONVERTER

After  the  pyrochlore  concentrate  is  dried,  it  is  transferred  to  the  converter  where  the material  is  transformed  into  ferroniobium  (standard  grade).    The  niobium  oxide  is converted into FeNb by using an aluminothermic reaction on a batch basis.

## PROCESS SELECTION

The  expansion  to  an  open  pit  or  block  caving  mining  scenario  will  necessitate  the construction of a new processing plant facility.  Major issues will be faced, principally due to the increase in equipment size and the lower mill feed grade.  Those issues will be minimized by the utilization of well know equipment and trials done during the last few years.    The  utilization  of  the  SAG  mill  and  ball  mill  with  conventional  cyclones  are considered  one  of  the  major  risks  in  terms  of  niobium  recovery  due  to  the  potential increase  in  fine  particle  production  and  losses  at  the  desliming  stage.    The  grinding circuit,  however,  will  be  simpler  to  operate  and  easier  to  perform  automatic  control strategies.  The niobium recovery process will stay the same in terms of metallurgy.

Proposed plant modifications are discussed below.

## ORE HANDLING, CRUSHING AND STORAGE

The ore will be delivered to a gyratory crusher before it is sent to the covered stockpile. The ore from the current underground mine will be redirected to the new ore stacker.

## GRINDING AND CLASSIFICATION

The grinding circuit will be modified in terms of technology.  The ore classification will continue to be done using vibrating screen technology.

## DESLIMING

The same type and size of equipment used in the present circuit will be used.

## PYRITE FLOTATION

A pyrite circuit will be built based on the current design.

<!-- image -->

## CARBONATE FLOTATION

Two parallel lines of tank cells, each including a conditioner for reagent conditioning, will be used.  The first  cleaner  will  consist  of  eight  tank  cells  and  the  second  of  five  tank cells.

## DEWATERING

The  dewatering  will  be  done  using  two  clusters  of  D10  cyclones  followed  by  eight clusters of D4 and finally two clusters of D2 cyclones

## PYROCHLORE FLOTATION

The rougher circuit will be done in 12 tank cells in series.  The reagent conditioning will be done in a highly agitated tank.  Five cleaner stages will follow.  The concentrate will be cleaned using three magnet separators before being sent to the sulphide flotation.

## SULPHIDE FLOTATION

The final sulphide flotation will be done using twelve flotation cells.

## PHOSPHATE LEACHING

The pyrochlore concentrate from the sulphide flotation will be sent to a 25 m diameter thickener before being sent to four leach tanks in series.  The concentrate will be filtered using six belt filters in parallel.

## SECOND SULPHIDE FLOTATION

The removal of final sulphide minerals will be done using eight flotation cells.

## PACKAGING

The current packaging system built in 2010 appears to have the capacity to support the additional production by adding 12 additional concentrate storage bins.

## CONVERTER

The design capacity will be twice the existing converter capacity.

## TAILINGS PUMPS

Two tailings lines will be installed, one to provide the coarse material for the tailings dam construction  and  the  second  for  the  disposal  of  the  carbonate  and  slimes  inside  the pond.

## MILL WATER SUPPLIES AND DISPOSAL

To provide the additional water demand to the mill, the new system that will be built at the Shipshaw River will need to quadruple the current water intake.

## OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT

Most of the operating basis will be the same as the current.

## OPERATING COSTS

Operating costs have been derived from the actual and historical cost.

## REAGENT CONSUMPTIONS AND SUPPLIES

A study performed on the reagents used in the process revealed that at the time of the study no issues were raised on the supplies.

## METALLURGICAL TESTING

Metallurgical  testwork  will  need  to  be  done  in  order  to  properly  design  the  new processing facilities.  Crushing  and  principally  the  SAG  index  will  need  to  be  done  for proper equipment design and selection.  Extensive metallurgical testwork will need to be performed to validate the niobium recovery and concentrate quality grade.  Also, niobium recovery improvement will be investigated by modifying the reagent scheme or process flowsheet.    Comparative  testwork  between  conventional  grinding  and  classification presently used and new grinding circuit using SAG-Ball mill will need to be done.

## ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS

The environmental management system (EMS) for the Niobec Mine is certified under the 2004 revision of the ISO 14001 standard.  Niobec successfully passed the ISO 14001 recertification audit in November 2010.  Niobec's quality management system is certified ISO 9001:2008 since 1995; it was last recertified in 2009.

In terms of environmental requirements, the Niobec Mine must comply with both Federal and Provincial laws and regulations.

All expansion, construction, and major modification projects in Québec need approval by the Provincial government through the environmental permitting process.

<!-- image -->

In terms of health and safety requirements, the Niobec Mine must comply with Québec's provincial laws and regulations.

The  most  recent  version  of  Niobec's  closure  plan  was  approved  by  Ministère  des Ressources  Naturelles  et  de  la  Faune  (MRNF)  in  September  2009.    A  revised rehabilitation plan has to be submitted to the MRNF by September 2014.

Depending  on  the  nature  of  the  project,  a  detailed  environmental  and  social  impact assessment  may  be  required.    The  environmental  and  social  impact  assessment process is triggered if the production rate of a mineral processing plant is greater than 7,000 tpd or if a mine is opened and operated with a production rate greater than 7,000 tpd.    This  threshold  will  be  lowered  to  3,000  tpa  if  proposed  Mining  Act  reforms  are enacted.  The whole assessment, public hearing, and subsequent project analysis by the Provincial  government  may  take  up  to  15  months  and  the  cost  is  estimated  at  C$1 million.

A  formal  risk  assessment  for  the  Project  will  be  conducted  through  three  distinct processes: the environmental and social impact assessment required for the permitting process, the IAMGOLD risk assessment process, and the IAMGOLD Safety in Design study.

For  the  PEA  purposes,  the  main  foreseeable  risks  and  impacts  associated  with  the Project are:

- · The OP  scenario (1,140 tonnes per hour) would trigger the provincial environmental and social impact assessment and public hearing process
- · The existing surface  infrastructure  would  have  to  be  demolished  and  could  be considered as a partial existing mine closure thereby partially activating the Asset Retirement Obligation (ARO) plan.
- · Significant  land  purchase is necessary for the proposed tailings storage facility and  waste  rock  dumps.    Depending  on  how  the  land  purchase  negotiation process goes, it may be required to expropriate land.
- · New water supply and effluent discharge lines are required.  In order to install those new water lines, it may be necessary to expropriate lands located between Niobec and the Shipshaw River. The freshwater supply to the expanded mill and infrastructure would increase significantly.  Since mine effluent will be discharged back  into  the  river,  additional  retention  basins  and/or  a  wastewater  treatment plant may need to be constructed.  Additional septic tanks and leachate fields will

<!-- image -->

be  required  as  well,  to  account  for  a  potential  increase  in  the  discharge  of domestic wastewater.

- · The hazardous materials and reagents consumption is expected to increase, as well  as  the  hazardous  waste  and  non-hazardous  waste  generation,  energy consumption, and the greenhouse gas emissions.
- · Increased health and safety risks will be associated with infrastructure construction activities as well as shaft demolition activities.  Opening new surface excavations may lead to a release of radon.
- · The  open  pit  itself  and  the  waste  rock  dumps  may  constitute  a  significant environmental and community impact.

These risks would be managed under the Safety Management Plans such as the Health, Safety, Environmental and Community Management Plans and the Closure Plan.

## CAPITAL AND OPERATING COST ESTIMATES

The mine capital cost includes mining equipment fleet purchases and pre-stripping and site work related to the open pit.  The mine fleet was estimated based on OP operations of a similar scale.  The mine services cost covers haul road construction and site work related  to  open  pit  and  waste  rock  dump  preparation  (stripping  of  vegetation  and overburden).    Capital  expenditures  for  the  underground  mine  are  also  required  as, during  the  first  four  years  of  the  LOM,  production  will  continue  from  the  existing  UG mine.  The UG capital costs include a new ventilation system and distribution network (existing  ventilation  raises  located  within  the  pit  footprint),  an  increase  in  pumping capacity to manage additional surface water flowing through the filled open stopes to be eventually  found  within  the  open  pit,  and  the  first  drilling  campaign  (contracted)  to  fill open stopes with crushed waste rock.

The  ore  processing  capital  cost  was  estimated  by  IAMGOLD  based  on  the  current process flow sheet and a scale-up of the existing mill and converter facilities.  Detailed equipment lists were generated for each area within the ore processing cost item.  This capital  cost  prevails  for  the  block  caving  and  the  open  pit  options  as  the  respective production rates are the same.

Infrastructure costs include general site preparation, construction of on-site roads, and upgrade of a provincial road as main access to the industrial mine site, etc.  Also under

<!-- image -->

this cost item are building construction, equipment and furniture, power distribution, fuel storage and distribution, fire protection and laboratory.

Waste  rock  dump  water  management  costs  were  provided  based  on  IAMGOLD's approach  to  tailings  water  management  regarding  ditches  and  effluent  water  system. The  effluent  water  system  also  considers  open  pit  mine  water.  Budget  allocation  is included here for land purchases at waste rock dump location.

Tailings  and  process  water  management  costs  include  an  upgrade  to  the  fresh  water intake system and pipeline from/to Shipshaw River to the west, as well as effluent water system and tailings pond site preparation and construction.  For waste rock dumps, a budget allocation is included for land purchases at the tailings pond location.

Indirect capital costs consist of working capital, warehouse inventory, owner's cost, mill start-up/commissioning, and Engineering, Procurement, Construction Management (EPCM).  EPCM costs vary between 15% and 20% of direct capital cost items and also include construction of temporary installations, equipment, tools, travel and lodging, for an average of approximately 13% of total direct capital cost (not considering OP mine fleet).

The  mine,  mill,  and  site  infrastructure  capital  costs  are  summarized  in  Table  1-5.  All costs are in 2011 US$.

Sustaining capital costs are subdivided into two periods. First, during the initial four-year pre-production  period  (or  construction  phase),  from  Year  -4  to  Year  -1  (2011  to  2014 inclusively),  costs  related  to  existing  underground  mine  expansion  are  labelled  as sustaining capital.  Second, from Year 1 to Year 38 of the production phase (2015 to 2052  inclusively),  all  capital  costs  occurring  during  this  period  were  considered  as sustaining capital.  Sustaining capital consists of:

- · Mine equipment fleet replacement;
- · Crusher, mill, and converter buildings maintenance and equipment replacement;
- · Relocation of a portion of existing tails, once open pit reach existing tailings pond;
- · Drilling holes (contracted) to fill UG openings from the open pit;
- · Progressive rehabilitation and mine closure.

Sustaining capital costs are shown in Table 1-6.

The following is excluded from the capital cost estimate:

- · Project financing and interest charges
- · Escalation during the project
- · Permits, fees and process royalties
- · Pre-feasibility and Feasibility studies
- · Environmental impact studies
- · Any  additional  civil,  concrete  work  due  to  the  adverse  soil  condition  and location
- · Taxes
- · Import duties and custom fees
- · Cost of geotechnical and geomechanical investigations

<!-- image -->

- · Rock mechanics study
- · Metallurgical testwork
- · Exploration drilling
- · Costs of fluctuations in currency exchanges
- · Project application and approval expenses

Operating costs for production over the LOM are summarized in Table 1-7.  Unit costs are  detailed  for  the  whole  Project  and  for  the  open  pit  only,  because  the  existing underground mine will still  be  producing  at  2.2 Mtpa  during  the four-year  construction phase of the Project.  All costs in this section are in 2011 C$.

## 2 INTRODUCTION

Roscoe Postle Associates Inc. (RPA) was retained by IAMGOLD  Corporation (IAMGOLD),  to  prepare  an  independent  Technical  Report  on  the  Niobec  Mine  (the Project), near Ville de Saguenay (Chicoutimi), Québec.  The purpose of this report is to prepare an updated Mineral Resource estimate and a Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA) on the viability of an OP option at the Project.  This Technical Report conforms to NI 43-101 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects.  RPA  visited the property on March 4, 2011 and again from March 21 to 22, 2011.

IAMGOLD  is  a  Canadian  mining  company,  headquartered  in  Toronto,  Ontario,  that produces  one  million  ounces  annually  from  eight  gold  mines  on  three  continents. IAMGOLD was created as a private company in 1991 when it discovered its first gold deposit, the Sadiola Hill mine (Sadiola) in Mali, Africa.  In 1996, IAMGOLD began trading on  the  Toronto  Stock  Exchange,  Sadiola  poured  it  first  gold  bar,  and  exploration commenced  in  South  America.    IAMGOLD  continued  to  expand  through  strategic acquisitions  of  projects  and  through  the  conversion  of  discretionary  assets  into  gold bullion.  IAMGOLD began trading on the American Stock Exchange in 2001 and the New York Stock Exchange in 2005.  In 2006, IAMGOLD acquired Cambior Inc. and its 100% ownership of the Project.  IAMGOLD has since acquired Orezone Resources in 2009 and  declared  commercial  gold  production  at  its  Essakane  Project  in  Burkina  Faso, Africa.  IAMGOLD has development projects in Canada, Ecuador, and French Guiana, and is actively exploring in Africa and South America.  IAMGOLD also holds a 1% royalty in the Diavik diamond property in Canada.  A summary of IAMGOLD 2009 production is shown in Table 2-1.

Prior  RPA  involvement  in  the  Niobec  Project  includes  a  reserve  audit  and  review  of mining operations that formed part of a technical due diligence conducted in 2001.

This  report  is  considered  by  RPA  to  meet  the  requirements  of  a  PEA  as  defined  in Canadian  NI  43-101  regulations.    The  economic  analysis  contained  in  this  report  is based, in part, on Inferred Resources, and is preliminary in nature.  Inferred Resources are considered too geologically speculative to have mining and economic considerations applied to them and to be categorized as Mineral Reserves.  There is no certainty that the reserves development, production and economic forecasts on which this preliminary assessment is based will be realized.

## 4 PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION

The Niobec Mine is located 25 km north of Ville de Saguenay (Chicoutimi), Québec, in the limits of the municipality of Saint-Honoré, in Simard Township, Québec (Figure 4-1). The property is held 100% by Gestion IAMGOLD Québec inc. (IQM), a wholly-owned subsidiary of IAMGOLD.  The approximate geographic centre of the property is within National  Topographic  Series  Map  reference  22D/11  at  longitude  71°  9'  37"  west  and latitude  48°  31'  44"  north.    Universal  Transverse  Mercator  (UTM)  coordinates  for  the project  centre  utilizing  projection  North  American  Datum  (NAD)  83,  Zone  19  are approximately  340,511  m  east  and  5,377,347  m  north.    Access  to  the  property  is  via paved all-weather roads.

## LAND TENURE

The Niobec Mine is located on a 2,422.6 ha property comprising two mining leases, Nos. 663 and 706 (with areas of 79.9 ha and 49.5 ha, respectively), and 66 claims totalling 2,293.2  ha.    The  mining  leases  have  been  renewed  until  2015  and  include  surface rights.    A  list  of  the  active  mineral  tenures  is  shown  in  Table  4-1  and  a  map  showing claims in the vicinity of the mine is shown in Figure 4-2.  Mineral lease boundaries have been  established  by  legal  survey.    The  remaining  property  boundaries  have  been established by cadastral survey for the mining claims delineated by lots and parcels and by  geographical  coordinates  for  the  map  designated  map  claims.    There  are  no outstanding royalty payments  on  the  property and  mineral lease payments  are C$2,947.35 per annum.

RPA is of the opinion that the proposed pit will necessitate the expansion of the mining lease and will require permitting for waste rock and overburden dumps.  Permitting for environment will require to be updated.

## 5 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE AND PHYSIOGRAPHY

## ACCESSIBILITY

The  Project  is  readily  accessible  by  well  established,  all-weather  paved  and  gravel roads.    It  is  located  in  Simard  Township,  approximately  25  km  north  of  the  Ville  de Saguenay  (Chicoutimi),  Québec,  and  adjacent  to  the  municipality  of  Saint-Honoré, Québec.    Access  to  the  Project  from  Ville  de  Saguenay  is  via  Québec  Provincial Highway 172, travelling west, to Rue Martel.  Bearing north-northeast for approximately nine kilometres, Rue Martel intersects Rue de l'Hôtel-de-Ville.  Rue de l'Hôtel-de-Ville is followed  west-northwest  for  approximately  five  kilometres  to  where  it  intersects  the gravel  Route  du  Columbium.    The  mine  gate  is  located  approximately  1.5  km  southsouthwest of this intersection.

## CLIMATE

The climate in the Saguenay-Lac-St-Jean region is humid temperate with mild summers. The mean annual temperature for the area is above the freezing point at 2.3°C.  Average July temperature is 18.1°C, and average January temperature is -16.1°C.

According to the 1971 to 2000 precipitation data from Environment Canada, the average annual precipitation is 951 mm.  Rain precipitation is highest in July, averaging 123 mm of  water.    Snow  precipitation  is  registered  between  September  and  May,  but  its  peak falls on the period between December and March, when its monthly average reaches 63 mm (expressed in mm of water). The prevailing winds are from the West (33% of the time).

## LOCAL RESOURCES

The  Niobec  Mine  is  close  to  Ville  de  Saguenay  with  a  population,  according  to  2001 census  data,  of  about  170,000.  The  city  is  serviced  several  times  a  day  by  regional airlines from Montreal and boasts excellent road, rail, and port infrastructures.

<!-- image -->

The  mine  has  been  in  production  since  1976  and  has  well  established  suppliers  of equipment and services from the region.  Governmental and health services, schools, and  manpower  are  all  available  in  Ville  de  Saguenay  and  other  communities  in  the vicinity.  The Project enjoys the support of local communities.

## INFRASTRUCTURE

Currently, the major assets and facilities associated with the Project are:

- · The orebody.
- · A  mine  shaft,  headframe,  access  ramp,  ventilation  raises,  maintenance shops, and mobile equipment fleet.
- · A coarse ore bin.
- · A crushing plant.
- · A pyrochlore-to-niobium pentoxide (Nb2O5) concentrator.
- · A concentrate to ferroniobium (FeNb) converter.
- · A paste backfill plant.
- · Main ventilation fan.
- · A stand-alone assay laboratory.
- · Workshops, warehouses, administration buildings, and dry facilities.
- · Ample water supply, fire suppression system and sewage treatment.
- · Fuel storage and distribution system.
- · Main  line  to  Provincial  electrical  grid,  main  electrical  substation  (161  kV), main plant substation, and site distribution network (25 kV).
- · Access  by  paved  and  gravel  all-weather  roads  to  the  Ville  de  Saguenay (Chicoutimi)  and  rail  and  port  infrastructures  linking  to  North  American markets.

## PHYSIOGRAPHY

The topography is generally flat in the vicinity of the mine with an average altitude of 144 MASL.  The vegetation in the Niobec area is mostly forest dominated by coniferous three species such as black spruce, fir tree, and larch tree.  There is also some poplar tree

and grey pine.  The average vegetation density ranges from 40% to 80%.  There is no known plant or tree species at risk around the Niobec area.

The fauna found in the Niobec area is typical of the Saguenay-Lac-St-Jean region.  Red fox,  rabbits,  squirrels,  black  bears,  partridges,  black  crows,  Canada  geese,  and  other types of birds and mammals are found in the area.  No significant water bodies are found at  the  Niobec  Mine.    However,  a  river,  the  Rivière-aux-Vases,  is  located  about  two kilometres west of Niobec.  There is no known animal species at risk around the Niobec area.

## 6 HISTORY

While  conducting  airborne  geophysical surveys  to explore for uranium  in 1967, SOQUEM  Inc.  (SOQUEM)  detected  coincident  circular  radiometric  and  magnetic anomalies.  The anomalies, in the vicinity of the deposit, were followed up and led to the discovery  of  the  Saint-Honoré  carbonatite  complex.    Later  ground  geophysics  and diamond  drilling  by  SOQUEM  led  to  the  discovery  of  the  Rare-Earth  zone  and  two niobium-bearing zones that lie in the southern part of the complex.

In  1970,  SOQUEM  entered  into  a  joint  venture  agreement  (JVA)  with  Copperfields Mining  Corporation  (Copperfields),  a  predecessor  company  of  Teck,  to  explore  and develop the niobium deposit (Hatch, 2001).

A  shaft  was  sunk  to  obtain  adequate  samples  for  metallurgical  evaluation.    After  700 bench scale tests, 11 months of pilot plant operation, and worldwide market research, a joint decision was taken, in 1974, to initiate the development of a 1,500 tpd mine and mill under the management of Teck.  The mine was completed and commercial operations started  in  1976  with  the  production  of  the  first  niobium  pentoxide  (Nb O )  concentrate 2 5 (Belzile, 2009).

In  1978,  Niobec  Inc.  on  behalf  of  SOQUEM,  and  The  Yukon  Consolidated  Gold Corporation  Limited  (Yukon)  on  behalf  of  Copperfields,  signed  a  JVA  based  on  the previous SOQUEM/Copperfields agreement.  The terms of the JVA included:

- · Niobec Inc. would sell an undivided 50% interest in certain claims to Yukon.
- · Teck  Mining  Group  Limited  (TMG)  would  act  as  manager  of  the  joint  venture project and carry out exploration and develop the niobium deposit.

Simultaneously,  Yukon,  on  behalf  of  Copperfields,  and  Niobec  Inc.,  on  behalf  of SOQUEM,  also  signed  an  Operators  Agreement  and  Marketing  Operator  Agreement with terms that included, among others:

- · TMG would become Operator of the Niobec Mine.

- · TMG  would  act  as  an  independent  contractor  and  not  as  an  agent  of  the participants in the agreement.
- · Niobec Inc. would become the Marketing Operator responsible for administering the sales contracts for niobium produced at the Niobec Mine.
- · Niobec Inc. would act as an independent contractor and not as an agent of the participants in the agreement.

In 1979,  mine  production  was  increased  by  30%  and  mill  throughput  increased approximately 50% to 2,260 tpd (Hatch, 2001).

As  a  result  of  the  partial  privatization  of  SOQUEM  in  1986,  the  50%  interest  in  the Project was transferred to Cambior.

Since 1994, the operators have converted pyrochlore to niobium pentoxide and then into ferroniobium to expand the marketability of their product.  On-site infrastructure has been built and the ferroniobium can be delivered in various grain sizes and packaged to meet customer needs.

In  1996,  the  cut-off  grade  for  production  was  raised  from  0.5%  Nb O5 2 to  0.6%  Nb2O5 (Hatch, 2001).

Teck sold its 50% interest to Mazarin Inc. (Mazarin) in 2001.  A corporate reorganization of Mazarin resulted in the creation of Sequoia Minerals Inc. (Sequoia) that comprised the industrial minerals segment of Mazarin's holdings.  In 2004, Sequoia was acquired by Cambior and in 2006 IAMGOLD and Cambior merged.

The  Project  is  currently  supplying  approximately  7%  to  8%  of  global  consumption  of niobium.  Historical production numbers are provided in Table 6-1.

There was no production on the property prior to SOQUEM's discovery and the mine has seen uninterrupted operation since that time.

## MINING METHODS

Open  stoping  has  been  the  only  mining  method  used  since  the  Project  started production. While this method is simple and cost effective, it has the disadvantage that the  mineralized  zones  exceed  the  maximum  widths  allowed  by  rock  mechanics  and consequently,  economic  mineralization  is  left  in  place.    This  issue  is  exacerbated  at depth where mineralized zones are wider.

Stopes are planned using available diamond drilling data and the average stope size is 61.0  m  long  by  24.4  m  wide  by  91.4  m  high  corresponding  to  the  distance  between production and development levels.  Pillars of 24.4 m are left between stopes and may be extracted after primary stopes are mined.  Occasionally, due to various factors, the secondary extraction of these pillars is impractical or impossible.  Mining of the upper two blocks are nearing completion and, with depth, ground mechanics change.

Golder  Associates  Ltd.  (Golder)  completed  a  rock  mechanics  study  in  2007  and recommended  higher  horizontal  pillars  and  narrower  stope  dimensions.    The  wider zones of mineralization, combined with the restrictive mining factors, prompted a review of mining recovery and horizontal pillar recovery.

Also in 2007, Golder Paste Technology Ltd. (PasteTec) carried out a test on the Niobec mine tailings to determine their suitability for use as a cemented UG mine paste backfill. The study concluded that a blended waste stream consisting of 60% pyrochlore, 25% carbonate, and 15% cyclone overflow produced a promising result in the tested areas. Additional  testing  in  2008  included  the  introduction  of  a  binder  produced  from  finely ground slag, which was a waste product of the refinery process containing low levels of radiation.  Studies concluded that there was no strength advantage to using the material as a cement substitute (Belzile, 2009).

Based on the paste backfill studies and simulations, the recommended size of a stope is 15.2 m by 24.4 m by 91.4 m together with a mining sequence that would allow enough time for curing.  Golder has reviewed the results and is in agreement with the studies' conclusions.  IAMGOLD's intentions are to use this method for the mining of Block 4 and deeper.

## HISTORIC RESOURCE ESTIMATE

Past resource estimates were done for internal purposes and were not disclosed to the public.    In  2009,  a  NI  43-101  compliant  Mineral  Resource  estimate  was  prepared  by IAMGOLD  and  audited  by  Belzile  Solutions  Inc.  (BSI).  Mineral Resources  were estimated by mining block, using an Inverse Distance to the power two (ID ) interpolation 2 method,  and  were  inclusive  of  Mineral  Reserves.    The  IAMGOLD  Mineral  Resource estimate is shown in Table 6-2 and the BSI Mineral Resource estimate, as a check, is shown in Table 6-3.

BSI reported that resource classification followed 'CIM Definition Standards for Mineral Resources and Reserves' (2005) and were classified according to the diamond drilling pattern,  the  proximity  of  stoping,  and  the  availability  of  reconciliation  data  between models  and  production.    The  BSI  estimate  was  not  identical  to  IAMGOLD's,  but  BSI concluded  that  the  differences  were  negligible  and  confirmed  that  the  IAMGOLD Resource Estimate was reliable and repeatable (Belzile, 2009).

Measured Resources were limited to blocks where the diamond drilling pattern is 22.9 m vertically by 15.2 m, with an east-west direction, usually corresponding to areas where final definition drilling had been completed (i.e., mining blocks 1, 2, and 3).

Indicated Resources corresponded to blocks located in an area with a 45.7 m by 30.5 m drilling  pattern.    This  corresponded  to  the  first  stage  of  definition,  where  exploration drilling had identified the continuity of mineralization (mining block 4).

Inferred Resources corresponded to estimated blocks in areas where exploration drilling had been completed on a 91.4 m by 91.4 m drilling pattern (i.e., mining blocks 5 and 6).

Three different search ellipses were used for grade interpolation for the three categories, depending on the density of information.

Mining factors were applied before the final resource estimation was produced.  Stopes were  designed  and  only  the  blocks  inside  the  stopes  were  compiled  for  resource estimation.    For  mining  blocks  1,  2  and  3,  the  Measured  Resources  can  then  be transferred directly into Proven Reserves as shown in Table 6-4.

For blocks 4 and 5, the stope maximum dimensions were 24.4 m by 24.4 m using the cemented  paste  backfill  mining  method.    In  the  resource  estimation,  there  was  no associated dilution in the modelling of the stopes, although a 5% dilution at zero grade has been added to the resource estimate.  As all the Indicated Resources of blocks 4, 5, and  6  were  above  economic  cut-off,  they  were  transferred  into  Probable  Reserves (Belzile, 2009).  RPA notes that no resources were estimated for mining blocks below Block 6 in 2009.

## 7 GEOLOGICAL SETTING

## REGIONAL GEOLOGY

The Saguenay region is underlain by Grenville Province rocks of the Canadian Shield.  It is characterized by high-grade metamorphic terranes and deep-level thrust stacks along ductile  shear  zones  and  are  analogous  to  a  Himalayan-style  collisional  orogen.    The Grenville Province extends for more than 2,000 km and ranges from 300 km to 600 km wide.  During the Grenvillian Orogeny (1.08 Ga to 0.98 Ga) extensive crustal thickening and tectonic extrusion lead to widespread high grade metamorphism.  Large anorthosite massifs and coeval batholiths of margerite-charnockite-granite and, frequently, layered mafic intrusives mark periods of post-orogenic emplacement. Post-Grenvillian carbonatite  intrusions  like  the  Saint-Honoré  and  Sept-Îles  are  host  to  niobium,  and ilmenite and apatite deposits, respectively (Corriveau et al., 2008).

The rocks of the Saguenay area were divided by Dimroth et al. (1981) into three distinct litho-structural  units.    Unit  one  constitutes  a  gneiss  complex  that  is  divided  in  three Groups  based  on  increasing  structural  complexity  from  the  youngest  to  the  oldest. These are:

- · Group I which comprises rocks that have been migmatized and deformed during the Hudsonian Orogeny (1.74 Ga).
- · Group  II  which  is  composed  of  post-Hudsonian  rocks  they  may  have  been emplaced during a periods of non-orogenic felsic magmatism.
- · Group III rocks which comprised dykes of granite and amphibolite that generally parallel anorthosite contacts.

The second unit is comprised of anorthosite and charnockite-mangerite batholiths with well preserved igneous structures and textures. Anorthosite emplacement likely commenced during pre-Grenvillian crustal  extension  and  continued through  until  postOrogeny but the timing of the final intrusion is uncertain.

Unit three is characterized by calc-alkaline intrusions that cross-cut the host rocks and contains superior amphibolite facies mineralogy.  Tectonic extension at the beginning of the Paleozoic incorporated normal faulting, updoming, and igneous alkaline activity, and resulted in the formation of the St. Lawrence River Rift system.  The emplacement of this

third unit included the intrusion of the SAC, which hosts the Niobec mine, around 650 Ma based on potassium-argon (K-Ar) dating (Belzile, 2009).  The SAC is situated along the Saguenay Graben, a 250 km long and 25 km to 40 km wide structure that extends from the  St.  Lawrence  River  near  Tadoussac  to  the  Lac  St.-Jean  district  (Figure  7-1). Geology in the vicinity of the SAC comprises anorthosite, syenites and magnetic diorite gneiss (Hatch, 2001).

Shales and limestones found in the vicinity of Saint-Honoré are thought to be the result of a marine transgression during the Ordovician period (about 470 Ma).  Overlying the deposit are limestone and dolomite of the Trenton group.  Up to 75 m thick, this unit is quarried in nearby Saint-Honoré (Belzile, 2009).

## PROPERTY GEOLOGY

The  SAC,  the  host  to  the  Niobec  Mine,  is  elliptical  in  plan  view  with  a  north-south trending major axial length of four kilometres and covers approximately 12 km 2 in area. It is comprised of a series of crescent shaped lenses whose age and composition vary with proximity to the core.  The outer edge is composed of calcite that gets progressively younger inward through dolomite to ferro-carbonatite and is shown in Figure 7-2.

Three main lithologic units are present on the property.  These are:

- · An elliptical carbonatite core that includes:
- o An  excentric  core  composed  of  brecciated  to  massive  dolomite  and ankerite contains up to 4.5% rare-earth elements (REE) such as cerium, lanthanum, and europium in fine-grained bastnaesite.
- o Ring  dykes  or  cone  sheets  of  barren  to  low-grade  niobium  and  REEbearing dolomite.
- o High-grade niobium (greater than 0.4% Nb2O5) dolomites and calcites in the  southern  portion  of  the  core  bordered  with  massive,  red,  altered dolomite.
- o A ring dyke of phlogopite calcite at the northern extremity of the core.
- o A belt of variable thickness composed of pyroxene calcite at the southern extent of the core.
- · A circular outer ring containing feldspathic and feldspathoidal alkaline rocks.
- · A  triangular  body  of  garnet  syenite  and  cancrinite  (a  Na-Ca-Al-silicate  and carbonate mineral) that lies at the extreme southeast part of the complex.

The two main niobium zones are subvertical and lenticular in shape and vary in lithology. Foliated  and  often  brecciated  dolomites  and  calcites  alternate  with  more  massive dolomites that contain red ankerite alteration.  The foliated and brecciated unit is host to pyrochlore, the most  prevalent niobium  mineral, while the massive  unit is less mineralized.  The lenses measure up to 300 m in length, vary in width from 10 m to 80 m,  cover  a  total  area  of  approximately  600  m  by  800  m,  and  are,  generally,  oriented concentrically around the core of the pluton.  Minor northeast trending structures appear to have cut the lenses, post-mineralization.  These mineralized zones are limited to the

south  by  a  ring  dyke  composed  of  massive  fine-grained  dolomite  containing  chlorite, pyrite and magnetite (Hatch, 2001).

The complex is surrounded by magnetite diorite gneisses as well as hypersthene syenite that have  been  subjected  metasomatic  alteration from the emplacement  of  the carbonatites (Belzile, 2009).

## 8 DEPOSIT TYPES

A  carbonatite  is  an  igneous  rock  comprising  at  least  fifty  percent  carbonate  minerals. Globally,  occurrences  are  sparse,  typically  small  and  widely  distributed.    Carbonatites usually occur as small plugs within zoned alkalic intrusive complexes, or as dykes, sills, breccias,  and  veins.    Nearly  all  carbonatite  occurrences  are  intrusives  due  to  the unstable nature of carbonatite lava flows which react quickly in the atmosphere and have been poorly preserved.  Carbonatites are almost exclusively associated with continental rift-related  tectonic settings. However, they also occur in oceanic crust and have been recognized  in  compressional  fold  belts  (Belzile,  2009).    They  are  typically  associated with  under  saturated  igneous  rocks  that  are  nearly  peralkaline  but  any  rock  type, including intrusives or metamorphic rocks can host these complexes (USGS, 2009).

Pyrochlore, bastnaesite, monazite, baddeleyite, and bornite mineralization are important components in some carbonatites because they carry niobium, REE, and other metals in concentrations high enough for economic extraction.

Carbonatites range in age from Archean to Recent (USGS, 1995).  A summary of these is shown in Table 8-1.

Constituent  carbonate  minerals,  in  order  of  decreasing  abundance,  include  calcite, dolomite, ankerite, and rarely siderite and magnesite.  Carbonatites are greatly enriched in niobium, REE, barium, strontium, phosphorus, and fluorine, and relatively depleted in silicon,  aluminum,  iron,  magnesium,  nickel,  titanium,  sodium,  potassium,  and  chlorine. Sodium-  and  potassium-rich  carbonate  minerals  have  been  confirmed  at  only  one locality:  the  active  volcano  Oldoinyo  Lengai  in  Tanzania.    The  extreme  differences  in mineralogy is thought to be due to the strong fractionation that occurs between the silica and  oxide  solid  phases  and  the  carbonate  liquids  while  the  carbonate  liquids  are separating from their source.

Typical  non-carbonate  minerals  in  carbonatites  are  apatite,  magnetite,  phlogopite  or biotite,  clinopyroxene, amphibole, monticellite, perovskite, and rarely olivine or melilite. Secondary minerals produced by alteration of primary magmatic minerals include barite, alkali feldspar, quartz, fluorite, hematite, rutile, pyrite, and chlorite.

Carbonatites yield a variety of mineral commodities, including phosphate, lime, niobium, REE, anatase, fluorite, and copper.  Agricultural phosphate fertilizer is the single most valuable product derived from carbonatites; most is obtained from apatite concentrations that  develop  in  lateritic  soils  during  tropical  weathering.  Lime  for  agriculture  and  for cement  manufacture  is  obtained  from  carbonatites  in  regions  where  limestones  are lacking (Belzile, 2009).

## 9 MINERALIZATION

This section is derived from Belzile (2009).

Recognized minerals species at Niobec include carbonates (65%), oxides (magnetite, hematite)  (12%),  silicates  (11%),  apatite  (10%),  sulphides  (1%),  fluorite,  barite  and zircon (1% collectively).

Bi-pyramidal  niobium  minerals,  primarily  pyrochlore,  are  disseminated  throughout  the carbonatite and are generally associated with geological units rich in magnetite, biotite and apatite (typically units C3b, C3c and C3a).  Niobium minerals are between 0.2 mm to  0.8  mm  in  diameter  and  rarely  visible.    Contacts  are  gradational  and  cannot  be visually  determined  by  mineralogy.    Diamond  drill  core  assays  are  the  only  way  to delineate mineralization zones.

The  mineralization  is  defined  in  terms  of  percentage  of  Nb2O5,  with  the  mineralized lenses  broadly  delineated  using  a  cut-off  of  0.35%  Nb2O5  on  vertical  sections  spaced every 15.2 m.  Lenses 101 and 102 are localized in the northern portion of the deposit. The mineralization  in  this  area  is  characterized  by  hematite  alteration  that  appears  to reduce  in  intensity  with  depth.    Lenses  206  and  208  occur  in  a  more  calcite-rich carbonatite with syenite xenoliths.

The economic mineralization  is  formed  of  ferrian-  and  sodic-pyrochlore.    Metallurgical recovery, which can vary from 30% to 70%, is greatly influenced by the mineralogical characteristics of the rock type, alteration and type of mineralization.

Mineralized envelopes, oriented north-south, vary between 45.7 m and 182.9 m in width and  extend  up  to  762.0  m  in  length.    Dips  are  generally  vertical  or  steeply  dipping (greater  than  70°)  to  the  northwest  or  northeast.    These  zones  have  been  defined vertically  for  at  least  731.5  m  and  remain  open  at  depth.    Based  on  data  from  the deepest completed drill  holes,  the  grades  of  mineralization  at  depth  are  equivalent  to those currently being mined.

<!-- image -->

Average  grades  of  the  large  mineralized  envelopes  are  between  0.44%  Nb2O5 and 0.51%  Nb2O5.  Mine  workings  are  concentrated  between  the  91.4  m  level  and  442  m levels,  operating  simultaneously  on  three  mining  blocks.    The  majority  of  the  Mineral Reserves and the Measured and Indicated Resources are located in the four first mining blocks between the 91.4 m level and 563.9 m level.  The bulk of the Mineral Resources classified as Inferred are exclusively found in mining blocks 4 to 8, below the 563.9 m level.

## 10 EXPLORATION

Exploration  at  Niobec  is  concentrated  within  the  carbonatite  complex  as  there  is  no known  occurrence  of  niobium  outside  of  it.    As  the  mineralization  is  not  visible, exploration is carried out using diamond drilling and all the core is assayed for Nb2O5.

The focus of past exploration has been to extend the known mineralization to depth and increase  the  mine  life.    To  date,  the  exploration  has  enjoyed  annual  success  in delineating new Resources and Reserves year as detailed in Table 10-1.  Mineralization remains open at depth and there is good future potential to increase resources.

## REE EXPLORATION

Original exploration efforts in the area discovered a geological unit on the mine property that hosts an occurrence of REEs such as cerium, lanthanum, neodymium, praseodymium,  samarium,  dysprosium,  and  europium.    Located  approximately  one kilometre north of the existing infrastructure it underwent preliminary evaluation in 1985 but was not pursued at the time due to unfavourable market conditions.

In 2010, IAMGOLD began to re-assess the previous work by conducting mineralogical studies on historic core specimen.  Results were sufficiently encouraging that IAMGOLD planned  a  four  hole  surface  diamond  drilling  program  to  confirm  previous  geological information and obtain fresh samples for testing.

At  the  time  of  RPA's  site  inspections  in  March  2011,  the  surface  diamond  drilling program  was  underway  but  no  work  was  being  conducted  at  the  time.  Results  are pending and RPA cannot offer any opinion regarding adequacy.

## 11 DRILLING

Most  of  the  drilling  at  the  Project  was  done  by  independent  contractor  Forage  Major Kennebec Ltée. (Major Kennebec) of Thetford Mines, Québec, using an air powered drill. In  2010,  Major  Kennebec  was  replaced  by  Boreal  Drilling  Ltd.,  another  independent drilling  contractor,  of  Val  d'Or,  Québec,  which  employs  electric  drills  that  offer  more range, in terms of drill depth and angle, and the ability to drill BQ-size core.

Diamond drilling is a primary method of exploration at Niobec.  Initially, holes are drilled on approximately 91.4 m by 91.4 m spacings that are reduced to 45.7 m by 30.5 m for zone interpretation as results warrant.  For stope design and to increase confidence in the  location  of  the  mineralization,  final  drilling  is  done  on  22.9  m  by  15.2  m  intervals. Most holes were drilled using AQ-size (27 mm dia.) core with some longer holes drilled using BQ-size (36.4 mm dia.) core.  Due to the restrictions of the air-powered equipment, inclined  holes  could  not  exceed  +45° in  dip  or  91.4  m  in  length  and flat  or  downward dipping holes could not exceed 198.1 m in length.

Holes  are  designated  based  on  order  of  planification  and  there  is  no  distinction  in numbering between exploration and definition drill holes.  Hole numbers range from S-1 to S-3556 as of December 31, 2010.  RPA notes that there are breaks in sequence of hole numbers so the total number of holes in the database is 3,525.

All  holes  are  designed  by  the  mine's  geology  department  and  information  such  as location, azimuth, dip and special instructions are noted on a drill hole plan.  The holes, generally, are drilled on mine section with azimuths of 180° and 360°.  Definition holes are  used  to  outline  stope  blocks  based  on  a  designated  cut-off  that  is  informed  by recovery  and  dilution  inputs.    These  inputs  are  based  on  mining  and  metallurgical recoveries and measured against mine reconciliations.

Collar are located by the mine's survey department who also delineate the azimuth of the hole with front sights and back sights.  The dip of the hole is determined by using a degree  rule.    Periodic  checks  are  done  by  the  survey  department  to  ensure  proper alignment of the drill and dip of the drill head.

Rev. 0 Page 11-1

Due to the small diameter of the AQ-size drill holes, dip deviation was checked using acid  tests  at  30.5  m  or  45.7  m  intervals.    In  2010  the  use  of  a  Flexit  Reflex  EZ-AQ orientation tool was implemented to check both azimuth and dip deviations.  RPA notes that magnetite is present in the rocks at Niobec and that drill hole orientation readings may not be accurate.  IAMGOLD personnel also report that efforts are being made to acquire  a  gyroscopic  orientation  tool  to  ameliorate  any  magnetism  issues  that  might affect readings.  IAMGOLD personnel also report that drill hole intersections are located, where  possible,  in  excavated  stopes  and  the  new  information  is  used  to  update  and adjust the drill hole database.  In RPA's opinion, because of the density of drilling and the efforts made to correct any errors based on observation of intersections in stopes, any deviation in the drill hole orientation will have negligible impact on the estimation of Mineral Resources.

Once retrieved from the core barrel the core is placed in sequential order in core boxes labelled with the hole number.  Each run, usually 3.05 m, is identified by a wood block on which  the  depth  of  the  hole  is  marked.    At  the  end  of  each  shift,  core  boxes  are transported to surface by the drill contractor via the mine shaft.

Some,  but  not  all,  drill  holes  are  located  upon  completion  by  the  survey  department. RPA is of the opinion that all drill holes should be surveyed.  All holes are sealed using an aluminum plug (P 187) and tests are performed to ensure the plugs are firmly set.

IAMGOLD  reports  that,  despite  the  small  core  diameter  recoveries  are  very  good, exceeding 95%.

RPA inspected an UG drill station and found it to be orderly and well configured for its intended purpose.  The drill was not active due to electrical issues but the equipment was  found  to  be  industry  standard.    RPA  notes  the  above  industry-standard  safety modifications that have been applied to the equipment to protect its operators.

Drill  hole  planning  is  based  on  exploration  and  production  history  at  Niobec.    Past positive  reconciliations  provide  confidence  in  the  geological  model  and  the  diamond drilling, as the primary means of defining that model, have well established orientations

<!-- image -->

that  reflect  the  true  width  and  orientation  of  the  mineralization.    A  summary  of  all diamond drilling at Niobec to December 2010 is shown in Table 11-1.

RPA found the geological data at Niobec to well organized and competently managed. In  the  opinion  of  RPA,  diamond  drilling  is  planned  and  executed  in  manner  that  is consistent with industry standards and that information derived from these programs are adequate for use in an estimation of Mineral Resources.

## 12 SAMPLING METHOD AND APPROACH

## DRILL CORE SAMPLING

Estimation of  Mineral  Resources at the  Project are  based  exclusively  on  the  diamond drill core sampling conducted by the mine's geology personnel.

The  core  is  brought  to  surface,  via  the  shaft,  by  the  contract  diamond  drillers  and deposited at the core shack.  The core boxes are brought into the core shack, opened, and laid out on logging tables by IAMGOLD personnel.  It is measured, for core recovery purposes, and then logged for Rock Quality Designation (RQD).  RPA notes that RQD measurements  were  designed  for  NQ-size  (47.6  mm  dia.)  core  and  are  likely  to  be underestimated with  the  smaller  diameter  core.    Notwithstanding  its  smaller  diameter, the AQ-size core recovery at Niobec generally exceeds 80% and should improve with the move to BQ-size core.

Core is then logged by trained geological personnel for lithology, mineralogy, alteration and structure.  Percentages of magnetite, hematite, biotite, apatite, pyrite, ankerite and fluorite  are  routinely  noted.    Niobium mineralization  is  very  fine-grained and  difficult to distinguish.    No  core  photographs  were  taken  prior  to  2010  when  that  procedure  has been implemented.

A nominal sample length of 3.05 m has been accepted as the norm.  When judged to be geologically appropriate, the sample interval can be shortened.  The logging geologist notes  start  and  end  of  each  sample  interval  and  assigns  a  rock  code  based  on  the lithology and mineralogy of that interval.  This rock code along with other factors, like the silica  and  iron  contents,  which  are  derived  from  assaying,  influence  the  predicted metallurgical recovery.  These factors, in turn, influence the Mineral Resource estimate.

These data are recorded in Gemcom GEMS Logger, off-the-shelf third-party software. Earlier  exploration  and  definition  drilling  had  these  data  recorded  on  paper  and  later entered into the Logger program.  RPA has inspected the Niobec GEMS database and notes some drill holes are missing lithological data.  These omissions were brought to the attention of Niobec geology staff and corrected.

<!-- image -->

Once the intervals  have  been  established  by  the  logging  geologist,  the  whole  core  is sampled.  Core is broken, as necessary, to make sampling more manageable but no reference core remains after selection.  Each specimen is placed in a plastic bag along with  the  tag  that  bears  the  unique,  assigned  sample  number.    The  samples  are  then delivered  to  the  on-site  laboratory  by  geology  personnel.    The  empty  core  boxes  are returned UG to be used again.

Historically, specific gravity (SG) measurements have been routinely taken at Niobec.  In 2010 an additional 53 measurements were added to the dataset.  The new data did not cause any change in the accepted values.  The density of the rock varies by location within the deposit with Zones 101 and 102 having a value of 2.92 t/m  and Zones 206 3 and 208 have a value of 2.78 t/m .  The historic data comprises readings from the upper 3 part of the deposit and more SG data will be required for deeper mineralized zones.

RPA inspected the core logging facility and found it to be in good order and adequately configured for its intended purpose.  It is, however, quite small and limited in its ability to handle large volumes of core.  A new, larger, core logging facility has been designed and will be built to better accommodate increased core volumes.  RPA notes that a premanufactured SG station, comprising an ultrasonic water bath and electronic balance, is located in the core facility.

RPA  agrees  that  the  approach  used  to  plan,  locate,  log  and  sample  drill  holes  is reasonable and, in RPA's opinion, gives an adequate representation of the mineralization.

## GRADE CONTROL SAMPLING

Grade control at Niobec is based on muck samples.  On average, there are six active headings per day.  Muck sampling is not done by a geologist but by UG truck drivers at a rate of one sample per shift.  Samples are delivered to the shaft and brought to surface by UG personnel.  These samples are retrieved by laboratory staff and subject to the same analyses and drill core with results returned within 36 to 48 hours and used for production reconciliation.

Grade control samples were not used in the estimation of Mineral Resources at Niobec.

## 13 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND SECURITY

The  core  is  stored  in  secure  wooden  boxes  and  transported  from  UG  to  surface,  by independent contract personnel, where possession is assumed by IAMGOLD personnel. The core is logged and whole-sampled in the core shack.  Samples are then taken, by mine employees, to the on-site assay laboratory for analysis.  The minesite is fenced and employs closed circuit video cameras and around the clock security personnel.  In the opinion of the RPA, the premises are reasonably secure and the chain of custody protocols employed are adequate.

Sample preparation and assaying are conducted by IAMGOLD personnel at the on-site mine laboratory.  The Niobec laboratory is certified ISO 9001 and all working procedures are  written  in  detail.    IAMGOLD  reports  that  internal  and  external  audits  are  regularly performed.

Samples are received, weighed and crushed until 90% of the sample passes -8 mesh (2.38 mm).  Samples average approximately four kilograms of which two kilograms are retained and the remainder discarded.  From the two kilogram sub-sample a 100 g split is  taken  and  pulverized  to  80%  passing  -325  mesh  (44  µm)  from  which  a  one  gram aliquot  is  taken  for  analysis.    The  remaining  crushed  sub-sample  is  retained  for metallurgical testing and stored separately.

Prepared samples are dissolved in a borate flux at high temperatures which results in homogeneous bead.  This bead is  then  analyzed  using  X-ray  fluorescence  (XRF)  for Nb2O5, SiO2, MgO, P2O5, Fe2O3, CaO, MnO, TiO2, ZrO2 and Al2O3.  While Nb2O5 is the only  component  of  economic  interest,  the  other  components  are  used  to  estimate potential  metallurgical  recovery  and  to  assist  in  ore  blending  to  optimize  Project economics.  These factors,  especially  metallurgical  recovery,  impact  the  estimation  of Mineral Resources.

As  part  of  the  Niobec  laboratory's  internal  quality  control/quality  assurance  (QA/QC) protocols Certified Reference Materials (CRM) are assayed to confirm the precision and accuracy of determinations.  Results are plotted on control charts and reviewed.  Where

<!-- image -->

discrepancies  are  noted  actions  are  taken  to  ameliorate  any  issues.    Calibration  of equipment  is  done  using  CRM  that  have  been  tested  at  independent  laboratories. External QA/QC protocols are reviewed in Section 13.

RPA  inspected  the  Niobec  laboratory  and  found  it  to  be  in  good  order,  adequately configured for its intended use, and staffed by well-trained personnel.  In RPA's opinion, sample preparation and analysis method are appropriate for the mineralization and the laboratory QA/QC procedures are adequate.  RPA did not inspect the laboratories data management system.  Assay results are kept electronically and reported to the Geology department  in  digital  format.    Hard  copies  of  assay  certificates  are  available  upon request.

## 14 DATA VERIFICATION

## ASSAY QA/QC

The insertion of blanks and independent CRMs into the sample stream is not currently part  of  the  QA/QC  protocol  at  the  Project.    Since  whole-core  is  sampled,  there  is  no opportunity for core duplicate analyses.  QA/QC procedures at Niobec consist of internal checks  using  Internal  Reference  Material  and  running  duplicate  analyses  on  second samples  derived  from  both  pulps  and  coarse  rejects.    These  internal  pulp  and  reject duplicate assay checks comprise approximately 20% (10% each) of the determinations conducted at the Niobec laboratory.  Results are reviewed using statistical control charts and actions are taken when discrepancies are found in the data.

## PULP DUPLICATE ASSAYS

Every tenth submitted sample, i.e., those with a sample numbers ending in '0' (zero), has a duplicate analysis run from a second split from the original pulp.  The original and duplicate  determinations  were  plotted  on  control  charts  and  reviewed.    RPA  has inspected the results for the 577 duplicate assays done for Nb2O5 and concludes that correlation between analyses is excellent.  The graphical results are shown in Figure 141.

<!-- image -->

Figure: 14-1   PULP DUPLICATE ASSAYS

<!-- image -->

RPA plotted  these  duplicate  results  on  a  relative  difference  (Thompson-Howarth)  plot and inspected the data for indications of bias.  No bias was observed.  The results are presented in Figure 14-2.

<!-- image -->

Figure: 14-2   RELATIVE DIFFERENCE (THOMPSON-HOWARTH) PLOTS FOR PULP DUPLICATE ASSAYS

<!-- image -->

## COARSE REJECT DUPLICATE ASSAYS

Every tenth submitted sample, i.e., those with a sample numbers ending in '5' (five), has a  duplicate  analysis  run  from  a  second  split  from  the  original  coarse  reject.    These duplicates were taken to help assess a minor change to the sampling protocol that was initiated in 2010.  The change resulted in samples terminating at geological boundaries rather that extending across them in an effort to normalize sample lengths to 3.05 m.

The original and duplicate determinations were plotted on control charts and reviewed. RPA  has  inspected  the  results  for  the  577  duplicate  assays  done  for  Nb2O5  and concludes that, as with the pulp duplicates, correlation between analyses is excellent. The graphical results are shown in Figure 14-3.

<!-- image -->

Figure: 14-3   REJECT DUPLICATE ASSAYS

<!-- image -->

No bias was observed in the assay data when RPA plotted the duplicate results on a relative difference (Thompson-Howarth) plot.  The results are presented in Figure 14-4 and are, predictably, more scattered than pulp duplicate assays.

## INDEPENDENT SECOND LABORATORY PULP DUPLICATE ASSAYS

As  a  check  of  the  Niobec  laboratory,  103  pulp  duplicates  were  shipped  to  COREM Laboratories (COREM)  of  Ste.-Foy,  Québec,  an  ISO/IEC  17025:2005  accredited laboratory, for analyses.  The results of the second analyses, again, showed excellent correlation with the original assays and are shown in Figure 14-5.

<!-- image -->

Figure: 14-5   SECOND LABORATORY PULP DUPLICATE ASSAYS

<!-- image -->

When the relative differences between the two sets of results were plotted by RPA a mild bias was revealed.  Original assay results from the Niobec laboratory return, generally, slightly  higher  grades  than  those  from  COREM.    RPA  notes  that  the  differences  are minor  and  will  have  no  significant  impact  on  the  estimation  of  Mineral  Resources. IAMGOLD should, however, investigate the  cause  of  the  bias.    Results  are  shown  in Figure 14-6.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Figure: 14-6   RELATIVE DIFFERENCE (THOMPSON-HOWARTH) PLOTS FOR SECOND LABORATORY PULP DUPLICATE ASSAYS

<!-- image -->

Assay  sample  reanalysis shows  excellent correlation between  original and  pulp duplicate, and reject duplicate, samples.  RPA recommends, however, the introduction of blanks  and  independently  derived  CRM  into  the  sample  stream  to  further  increase confidence  in  the  assay  data.    RPA  also  recommends  external  laboratory  checks  on sample rejects in addition to sample pulps.

## SAMPLE DATABASE

The  data  from  the  Niobec  mine  resides  in  a  Gemcom  GEMS  v6.0.1  database MODĖLE\_DEC\_2006 that  is  maintained  by  IAMGOLD  personnel.    RPA  carried  out  a number of database validation  and  verification  checks  on  both  historic  and  new  data. RPA  notes  that  a  significant  part  of  the  data  pre-dates  NI  43-101  Standards  of Disclosure for Mineral Projects.  The database contains 3,525 diamond drill holes with a total of 15,436 downhole and collar surveys and 164,177 drill sample records. .

<!-- image -->

## VALIDATION

Gemcom GEMS software contains validation routines that were run on selected tables in the database.  No discrepancies were noted in the data required for Mineral Resource estimation and only minor discrepancies were noted in other, less critical, data.  These minor discrepancies were corrected prior to the Mineral Resource estimation.

## VERIFICATION

The  Niobec  database  contains  records  for  3,525  drill  holes  and  comprises,  primarily, collar,  survey,  lithologic,  assay  and  RQD  data.    There  is  a  well  established  history  of production and positive reconciliations between the geological model and mill output at Niobec.    In  RPA's  opinion,  a  program  of  spot  checking  the  database  is  sufficient  to establish its adequacy and appropriate for confirming its use in the estimation of Mineral Resources.

Collar,  lithology  and  survey  tables  were  checked  against  hard  copy  diamond drill  logs and found to be error free.  Both early holes, logged on paper, and later holes, logged electronically  and  printed  out,  were  inspected  to  confirm  that  both  forms  of  data  input were adequate.  RPA notes that drill holes prior to 2007, i.e., those logged on paper and later input manually, do not have associated dates in the in the database.

The assay database comprises 164,177 sample records as to December 31, 2010.  RPA inspected this database and notes the following errors:

- · A total of 71,307 samples in the database without sample numbers.
- · A total of 319 assays with duplicate sample numbers.
- · A total of 248 assay intervals in excess of 6.10 m, with 73 of those possessing non-zero values for Nb2O5.
- · A total of 871 samples with zero value for Nb2O5.

Using electronic versions of assay certificates RPA imported 2,006 sample results and compared them against the database results for Nb2O5, SiO2, P2O5 and Fe2O3 for a total of 8,024 determinations evaluated.  One sample assay comprising four determinations was found to be erroneous with values in the database lower than those reported from the laboratory.  RPA notes that a large number of samples in the database do not have sample numbers and, as such, could not be verified using assay certificates.

<!-- image -->

In the opinion of RPA minor errors will have little effect on the global grades and that the database is adequate for use in the estimation of Mineral Resources.  RPA notes that the presence of zero grade values in the Nb2O5 field of the assay database will result in a  more  conservative  estimation  of  Mineral  Resources  and  recommends  database corrections to improve accuracy.

## INDEPENDENT SAMPLING

Since no drilling was taking place during the time of the site inspection, and since drill core  is  whole-sampled  with  no  reference  core  retained,  RPA  was  not  able  to  take independent  samples  for  verification.    Given  the  long  history  of  production  at  Niobec RPA does not consider the lack of independent sampling to be an issue.

## UNDERGROUND INSPECTION

An  UG  inspection  was  conducted  on  March  22,  2011  by  RPA  personnel.    Numerous mining levels were visited and open stope mining was observed to be in progress

RPA has conducted verification checks on assays, collars, downhole surveys in addition to validation checks on the database and inspection of QA/QC results.  In RPA's opinion the  database  is  reasonably  sound  and  adequate  for  use  in  the  estimation  of  Mineral Resources.

## 15 ADJACENT PROPERTIES

## SHIPSHAW PROPERTY

Located  seven  kilometres  from  Niobec,  DIOS  Exploration  Inc.  (DIOS)  has  recently discovered  a  satellite  carbonatite  complex  on  its  Shipshaw  property.    Drill  testing  has identified a circular low magnetic  geophysical feature that is coincident with a topographic bedrock low below the overburden.  This topographic low is possibly related to  a  fault  zone  associated  with  the  Shipshaw  River.   The  airborne geophysical survey that resulted in the discovery of the Niobec Mine did not cover the area underlying the Shipshaw property, but a later, federally sponsored, magnetic survey was done over the DIOS ground.

In June 2010, DIOS announced the results of assays from its drill program that returned grades  of  0.053%  Nb2O5  over  1.5  m  with  12%  P2O5  and  0.487%  total  REE  oxides (excluding  yttrium  and  zirconium)  (TREO).    Early  drill  results  indicate  that  the  syenite horizon was intersected by drilling within 20 m of surface and contained strontium and high apatite grades (DIOS, 2010a).

DIOS entered into a letter of offer from IAMGOLD to participate in a C$1.2 million private placement  in  common  shares  of  DIOS  at  C$0.35  per  share.    As  a  consequence, IAMGOLD is granted an exclusive option to enter into an Option and JVA to earn 60% of DIOS' interest in the Shipshaw property within two years (DIOS, 2010b).

## CREVIER PROJECT

Located  approximately  70  km  north-northwest  of  Saguenay,  Québec,  the  niobiumtantalum  mineralized  Crevier  property  comprises  186  contiguous  claims  covering 10,416.5 ha in Crevier and Lagorce townships.  Discovered by SOQUEM in 1975, the property  was  transferred  to  Cambior  in  1986  as  part  of  the  privatization  of  its  assets. IAMGOLD acquired the  project  in  2006  with  its  acquisition  of  Cambior  and,  in  2008, vended it to Les Minéreux Crevier Inc. (Crevier) for C$500,000 and 2 million shares of Crevier.  In 2010 MDN Inc. (MDN) acquired part of Crevier and now controls 72.5% of the company, with IAMGOLD holding the remaining 27.5%.

<!-- image -->

The igneous alkaline complex, covering approximately 2,500 ha, is found within gneissic Grenville  Province  rocks  along  the  Waswanipi-Saguenay  corridor,  a  major  structural lineament that also hosts the Ste.-Honoré carbonatite.  The zone of niobium-tantalum mineralization  is  located  in  the  southern  part  of  the  Crevier  alkaline  intrusive  and  is associated  with  a  northwest  striking,  steeply  northeast  dipping,  porphyritic  nepheline syenite dyke.  The dyke is approximately 3,000 m long with an average thickness of 20 m and hosts pyrochlore mineralization to a depth of 300 m.

In 2009, SGS Geostat Ltd. (SGS Geostat), using a 0.1% Nb2O5 cut-off grade, prepared a NI  43-101  compliant  Mineral  Resource  estimate.    SGS  Geostat  estimated  Indicated Mineral  Resources to be 25.8 Mt at 0.186% Nb2O5 and 199 ppm Ta2O5, and Inferred Mineral Resources at 16.9 Mt at 0.162% Nb2O5 and 204 ppm Ta2O5 (SGS, 2009).  A preliminary  economic  assessment  prepared  by  Met-Chem  Canada  Inc.  of  Montreal, Québec, recommended bulk mining the deposit at a rate of 4,000 tpd (Bureau, 2010).

RPA  has  been  unable  to  verify  the  information,  and  that  the  information  is  not necessarily  indicative  of  the  mineralization  on  the  property  that  is  the  subject  of  the technical report.

## 16 MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING

## MINERAL PROCESSING

The process utilized at Niobec was first developed from pilot plant programs.  Over the years, the process has evolved with the mill operating team.  The ROM ore is crushed to 100% passing 1 ½ in. and fed to rod mills, ball mills, and classification circuits where the ore is ground to 80% passing 180 µm. The ore is deslimed in two stages of cycloning, and the underflow is sent for conditioning prior to  carbonate flotation.   The  carbonate concentrate is  sent  to  the  tails.    The  carbonate  flotation  rougher  and  cleaner  tails  are cycloned  in  two  stages  to  change  the  process  water  and  then  sent  to  the  pyrochlore rougher flotation.  The rougher concentrate is sent to five stages of cleaner cells.  This is followed  by  pyrite  flotation  to  remove  the  sulphides  leaching  with  hydrochloric  acid  to remove phosphorus and then followed by drying to produce a concentrate with less than 0.1% moisture before being converted into ferroniobium.

Since 2000, three major expansions have been completed to increase the ferroniobium production.    The  main  goals  of  these  expansions  have  been  to  maintain  Niobec's worldwide  market  share  and  to  reduce  the  ore  cut-off  ratio  by  having  a  higher throughput.  They have also contributed to the delay of the development of the fourth block, which requires a significant investment and increase in the Mineral Reserve as unit operating costs decrease.  Table 16-1 summarizes Niobec's production rate since 1998.

## ORE CHARACTERISTICS

The  unusual,  heterogeneous  mineralogy  of  the  deposit  makes  milling  and  research  a capital intensive undertaking.  The deposit contains at least two dozen minerals but, at the  present  time,  only  two  of  them  are  of  economic  interest.    These  are  pyrochlore (Na,Ca)Nb2O6F  and  columbite  (Fe,Mn)(Nb,Ta)2O6.    They  are  unequally  distributed throughout the carbonate ore.  Typical mineral composition of the ore is shown in Table 16-2.

silica

Pyrochlore  itself  does  not  have  a  rigid  chemical  composition  and  contains  REE (tantalum, titanium, strontium and zirconium among others) in addition to niobium.  Up to eight different varieties of pyrochlore can be found in the deposit.  The most common

<!-- image -->

variety is the sodium type, characterized by its sodium and calcium content as shown in Table  16-3.    The  progressive  replacement  of  sodium  and  calcium  by  iron  and  other elements produced an iron enriched type of pyrochlore and columbite.

The  replacement  is  seldom  complete  and  in  fact,  pyrochlore  and  columbite  form  a continuous  series.    The  Fe-enriched  pyrochlore  and  columbite  are  usually  found  in altered ore, but are present in unaltered ore where they are of primary origin.

The variable chemical composition has a major influence on mill production results.  A portion  of  black  Fe-enriched  pyrochlore  and  columbite  at  a  certain  pH,  have  surface properties different from those of the sodium type of pyrochlore.  These two minerals are in fact lost to tailings in the flotation process.

## CURRENT PROCESS DESCRIPTION

The following sections contain a process description for the current processing plant that has a 260 tph capacity.  A simplified flowsheet of this process is shown on Figure 16-1.

## CRUSHING

Primary crushing is done underground with a jaw type crusher before being hoisted to the head frame bin that has a capacity of 600 t.  A vibrating feeder is located under the head  frame  bin  in  order  to  feed  the  conveyor  before  the  secondary  crusher.    The secondary crusher is a  gyratory type crusher and its product is stored in four 1,200 t insulated bins.  From this point until the secondary desliming step there are two parallel lines.  Via conveyors two of the insulated bins are directed to the first line and the two others are directed to the  second line.    Each  bin  has  two  vibrating feeders  which  are used to control the throughput measured on the belt-scale on the two lines.  On each line,  the  ore  is  screened  in  order  to  send  only  the  coarse  product to  tertiary  crushing. Tertiary  crushing  consists  of  a  cone  crusher  on  each  line.    The  fine  product  from  the screen and the crushers discharge, which are 100% passing 1½ in., are then conveyed to the two grinding circuits.

## GRINDING

As mentioned, there are two parallel grinding circuits.    Each  line  is  designed  with  the same  equipment  specifications.    The  tertiary  crusher  screen  under  size  and  tertiary crusher discharge are directly fed to both rod mills.  The rod mill discharge on each line is combined with the ball mill discharges before each line is fed into a 24 way distributor via  their  mill  discharge  pump  box  pumps.    Each  distributor  feeds  a  set  of  vibrating screens  where  the  coarse  reports  to  a  screw  classifier  and  the  fines  that  are  at  80% passing 180 microns are sent to the desliming circuit.  Both screw classifier fines are sent to a trash screen before reporting to their respective mill discharge pump box.  The coarse material from the screw classifiers is sent to the ball mill feed.

The  softness  of  the  ore,  the  relatively  high  specific  gravity  of  the  pyrochlore  and  the chemistry of the flotation process dictates the configuration of the grinding circuit in order to avoid over grinding of the pyrochlore crystals.

Mine water was initially used for make-up in the grinding circuit.  It has a very high salts content  of  up  to  6  g/l  and  has  a  deleterious  effect  on  the  collection  of  pyrochlore  by amine.  Therefore, only reclaimed water is now used in the grinding circuit.

<!-- image -->

## DESLIMING

The desliming circuit is designed to remove the material that is smaller than seven µm before flotation.  This is done in two steps of cyclone classification.  The first step is done with two sets of parallel cyclones that are fed by the two parallel grinding lines where the slurry has been diluted to 22% solids.  The overflow of the primary desliming cyclones at 5% to 7% solids are combined and fed to a second cyclone stage.  Overflow from the two stages is sent to the tailings pump box.  The cyclones achieve a very efficient sizing by  removing  nearly  all  of  the  -7  µm  and  nearly  none  of  the  plus  15  µm  particles. Approximately 9% of the mill feed by weight and 5% of the pyrochlore are removed as slime.

## PYRITE FLOTATION

A pyrite flotation is done following the desliming process.  The slurry at 54% solids is first conditioned in two high intensity conditioners in series where copper sulphate and PAX are added.  The pyrite flotation is done in two steps including a rougher and cleaner. The  cleaning  step  is  made  up  of  12  cells.    The  tailings  are  sent  to  the  carbonates flotation circuit and the concentrate is sent to the tailings pump box.  Approximately 0.2% of the mill feed by weight and 0.1% of the pyrochlore are removed in the pyrite flotation tailings.

## CARBONATE FLOTATION

After the pyrite flotation, the slurry is conditioned with high intensity at 55% solids with an emulsified  fatty  acid  collector.    The  pH  stays  close  to  its  natural  level  at  about  eight. High  intensity  conditioning  is  done  in  two  agitated  tanks  in  series.    The  carbonate flotation has one rougher step and two cleaning steps.  The two cleaning stages do not significantly reduce the total weight of material discarded, however, they do reduce the Nb2O5 content from 0.20% in the rougher concentrate to less  than  0.10%  in  the  final concentrate.  Approximately 35% of the weight and 9% of the pyrochlore of the mill feed is  floated  off  in  the  second  cleaner  concentrate.   The flotation  concentrate  consists of very  fine  calcite  particles  (-50  µm)  and  medium  size  apatite.    The  carbonate  flotation tailings are sent to the dewatering process.

<!-- image -->

## DEWATERING

After carbonate flotation, the slurry is sent to cyclones in an arrangement similar to the desliming circuit for dewatering.  The slurry is first diluted with fresh water to 30% solids. It is then pumped to primary dewatering cyclones.  The overflow, at about 2%, solids is pumped to the secondary dewatering cyclones.  The underflows from the two stages are combined and diluted with fresh water from 64% solids to 40% solids.  The second stage overflow at less than 1% solids is sent to the tailings area.  About 4% of the mill feed by weight and 7% of the pyrochlore are removed in the dewatering cyclones overflow.  The total salt content is reduced about 3.5 times by the process.

## MAGNETIC SEPARATION

The  dewatering  cyclone  underflows  are  sent  to  magnetic  separation.    This  process removes 2% of the weight and 1% of the pyrochlore.

## PYROCHLORE FLOTATION

The non magnetic material is pumped to two high intensity conditioning tanks in series. The slurry is then sent to a bank of flotation cells where the pyrochlore collector is stage added.    The  rougher  concentrate  is  sent  to  five  stages  of  cleaning  where  the  pH  is gradually reduced to 2.7.  Each stage, including the rougher, achieves a concentration ratio of about 1.9.  The pyrochlore flotation concentrate is sent to sulphide flotation and the  tails  are  sent  to  the  tailings  pump  box.    Approximately  60%  of  the  pyrochlore  is recovered in the concentrate in 0.8% of the weight while 20% of the pyrochlore is sent to the tails. As mentioned, pyrochlore is a sodium calcium fluoroniobate (Na Ca Nb2O5 F).

## SULPHIDE FLOTATION

The  cleaned  pyrochlore  concentrate  contains  about  20  wt%  pyrite,  which  after  the addition of sodium hydroxide is conditioned with silicate to depress the pyrochlore.  PAX is then added and a rougher pyrite concentrate is floated.  It is cleaned twice and then pumped back to the grinding circuit to assure that the pyrochlore loss from this flotation is well liberated.  About 95% of the pyrite is removed at this stage.

<!-- image -->

## PHOSPHATE LEACHING

The  pyrite  flotation  tailings  are  sent  to  a  30  ft.  thickener  tank  prior  to  leaching.    The thickened slurry at 60% solids is then pumped to four leaching tanks where concentrated hydrochloric acid is added.  The small amount of apatite present is rapidly dissolved.

## LEACH FILTERING

The leached product is sent to a belt filter to remove most of the water.  The solid cake is mixed with fresh water and copper sulphate for the second sulphide flotation.

## SECOND SULPHIDE FLOTATION

The  leftover  activated  sulphides  are  floated  in  conventional  type  cells.    The  pH  is adjusted to 11 with NaOH and PAX is added as a collector.  This concentrate is sent back to the first pyrite flotation circuit.

## DRYING

The final pyrochlore concentrate is pumped at about 40% solids to a double 4 in disks filter and sent to a propane counter current dryer where the moisture level is reduced to less than 0.1%.  The dryers are equipped with a cyclone for dust collection.

## PACKAGING

The dried product is stored in twelve bins.  The concentrate is packed into big bags by an automated packing-handling system then transferred to the converter.

## CONVERTER

After  the  pyrochlore  concentrate  is  dried,  it  is  transferred  to  the  converter  where  the material  is  transformed  into  ferroniobium  (standard  grade).    The  niobium  oxide  is converted into FeNb by using an aluminothermic reaction on a batch basis.

The raw materials used in the reaction, apart from the pyrochlore concentrate, include aluminum flakes and chops, a source of iron oxide hematite or mill scale, quick lime (to lower the fusion point of the slag) and sodium nitrate (chemical agent to increase the available  energy).    Each  element  in  the  reaction  is  calculated  to  obtain  the  desired

<!-- image -->

quantity of niobium contained in the FeNb.  The total batch size contains a total of 6,000 kg of raw materials to produce 2,200 kg of ferroniobium.

After the raw material is well mixed and added to the reaction vessel (a vertical cylinder), the reactor is placed under a hook and the reaction is started after the fuse, made of barium peroxide, and aluminum powder is ignited.  The conversion process serves two basics  functions:  the  reduction  of  niobium  pentoxide  (pyrochlore)  and  iron  oxide  to ferroniobium metal and the separation of impurity elements from the pyrochlore.  The reaction  is  between  the  aluminum  and  the  oxide  materials.    The  reaction  is  strongly exothermic and once it is ignited it cannot be stopped.  The aluminothermic reaction is summarized as follow:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

The iron will combine with the niobium to form ferroniobium metal and the alumina will be collected as slag.

It only takes five minutes to liquefy all material at a temperature of 2,200 C. During the o following seven to eight minutes, separation of the alloy and slag occurs.  After cooling, the  slag  is  brought  back  underground  while  the  ferroniobium  ingot  is  sampled  and stored.    The  metal  ingots  are  selected  and  withdrawn  from  storage  according  to  their chemical analysis and customer's requirements.  They are then crushed and fed to a classification  section  where  the  ferroniobium  is  packed  to  suit  the  customer's  product size specifications.

## PROCESS SELECTION

## SELECTION BASIS

The  remainder  of  this  section  will  focus  on  the  open  pit  expansion  option  (10  Mtpa production  rate)  and  will  summarize  information  and  data  concerning  the  existing operations  (current  and  mining  expansion  underway  prior  to  this  PEA)  and  the  block

<!-- image -->

caving  expansion  option  (also  10  Mtpa  production  rate)  driven  by  IAMGOLD,  for comparison purposes.

A completely new processing plant facility will need to be constructed for either the open pit or block caving scenario.  New approaches will need to be adopted with respect to the mill throughput and equipment sizes. Conventional crushing and grinding using rod mill and ball mill will be replaced by Semi autogenous grinding (SAG) mill and ball mill. The ore will be crushed at surface and a primary crushing plant will need to be installed. Inside the grinding circuit, the screw classifier will be replaced by conventional cyclones to minimize the circulating load on the classification screens.  Attention will be given to the cyclone design to minimize fine particle recirculation to the mill.  The design of the recovery process will be based on scale adjustments from the existing facilities in the majority of the cases where it will be possible.  As the current converter will fall inside the open  pit  foot  print,  it  will  be  relocated  near  the  new  processing  plant  facility  and  the capacity will be doubled.

## TECHNOLOGY AND RISK ISSUES

Some  major  issues  and  risks  will  be  faced,  principally  due  to  the  huge  increase  in equipment size and the lower mill feed grade.  Those issues will be minimized by the utilization  of  well  know  equipment  and  trials  done  during  the  last  few  years.    The utilization of the SAG mill and ball mill with conventional cyclones are considered one of the major risks in terms of niobium recovery due to the potential increase in fine particle production  and  losses  at  the  desliming  stage.    The  grinding  circuit  will  be  simpler  to operate  and  easier  to  perform  automatic  control  strategies.    The  niobium  recovery process will stay the same in term of metallurgy.  In terms of mill feed grade reduction, the risk will come from the increase of the concentration ratio requested to achieve the concentrate grade and the control of the concentrate quality.

The commissioning of an entirely new plant will need to be well planned and will pose the  highest  risk.  Sufficient  time  allocated  for  the  commissioning  will  be  requested  to assure a good transition and to continue to produce ferroniobium to respond to client needs.  The commissioning will be more of a transitional and physical replacement.  The last  35  years  of  ore  processing  experience  will  help  to  minimize  and  accelerate  the commissioning time.

## PLANT MODIFICATIONS

## ORE HANDLING, CRUSHING AND STORAGE

The ore will be delivered to a gyratory crusher before it is sent to the covered stockpile.

The ore from the current underground mine will be redirected to the new ore stacker.

<!-- image -->

## GRINDING AND CLASSIFICATION

The  grinding  circuit  will  be  modified  in  terms  of  technology.    Considering  the  mill throughput,  conventional  SAG  mill  and  ball  mill  circuit  with  cyclone  classification  will replace the existing rod mill and ball mill technology.  The ore classification will continue to  be  done  using  vibrating  screen  technology;  this  approach  will  simplify  the  process flowsheet drastically in terms of operation and maintenance.  Otherwise, the hypothesis at this stage is that if the additional niobium losses occur in the fines it will be offset by the lower operating costs and the better control of the grinding stage.  Grinding test work will  be requested for the SAG mill and grinding circuit design.  The grinding circuit will have a SAG mill with two ball mills in a closed circuit.  A grinding screen at the discharge of  the  SAG mill will collect the pebbles at the discharge and those pebbles will be recirculated to the SAG mill feed.  The intent is to maintain low residence time inside the mills  and  minimize  the  production  of  fines.    The  cyclones  used  will  be  designed  to minimize the final product size at the cyclone underflow.  Overflow from the cyclones will be  screened  using  180  microns  five  decks  vibrating  screens.    The  screen  oversize product will be recirculated to the ball mill.  The underflow will go to the desliming stage

## DESLIMING

The same type and size of equipment used in the present desliming circuit will be used. The primary cyclone will be 10 inches followed by two inches cyclone size.  Four parallel clusters  of  D10  will  be  used,  each  followed  by  four  clusters  of  D2.    Experience  and importance of the desliming size drives the decision to stay with same equipment size.

## PYRITE FLOTATION

A  pyrite  circuit  will  be  built  based  on  the  current  design.    Two  conditioner  tanks  will provide the capacity for the reagents prior to the flotation stage.  Tank cells in series will be used for the sulphur flotation.

## CARBONATE FLOTATION

Two parallel lines of tank cells, each including a conditioner for reagent conditioning, will be used.  The first cleaner will  consist  in  eight  tank  cells  and  the  second  of  five  tank cells.

<!-- image -->

## DEWATERING (WATER CHANGE)

The dewatering will be done using two clusters of D10 cyclones followed by eight cluster of D4 and finally two clusters of D2 cyclones.  The underflow from those cyclones will be cleaned by magnetic separation to remove magnetic minerals before being sent to the pyrochlore separation.

## PYROCHLORE FLOTATION

The rougher circuit will be done in 12 tank cells in series.  The reagent conditioning will be done in a highly agitated tank.  The first cleaner will be done using 10 x tank cells in series followed by 8 x tank cells for the second cleaning stage.  The third cleaner will be done in 12 x 5 m³ cells in series followed by 10 x OK3R flotation cells in series for the fourth cleaner stage and 10 x OK 1.5R for the fifth cleaner stage.  The concentrate will be cleaned using three magnet separators before being sent to the sulphide flotation.

## SULPHIDE FLOTATION

The final sulphide flotation will be done using twelve flotation cells.

## PHOSPHATE LEACHING

The pyrochlore concentrate from the sulphide flotation will be sent to a 25 m diameter thickener tank before being sent to four leach tanks in series.  The concentrate will be filtered  using  six  belt  filters  in  parallel.    The  filtered  concentrate  will  be  re-pulped  and send to the second sulphide flotation step for residual sulphide minerals removal.

## SECOND SULPHIDE FLOTATION

The removal of final sulphide minerals will be done using eight flotation cells drying.

## PACKAGING

The current packaging system built in 2010 appears to have the capacity to support the additional production by adding 12 additional concentrate storage bins.  The enhanced production will be managed by increasing the packaging schedule.

<!-- image -->

## CONVERTER

The design capacity will be twice the existing converter capacity.

## TAILINGS PUMPS

Two tailings lines will be installed, one to provide the coarse material for the tailings dam construction  and  the  second  for  the  disposal  of  the  carbonate  and  slimes  inside  the pond.

## MILL WATER SUPPLIES AND DISPOSAL

To provide the additional water demand to the mill, the new system that will be built at the Shipshaw River will need to quadruple the current water intake.  The capacity of the return  line  for  the  discharge  water  will  be  increased.  The  recirculating  pump  at  the recirculation pond will need to be replaced.  The existing one will be relocated to the mill pond number three in a new pumping station.  The main mill water line will be replaced.

## REAGENT CONSUMPTIONS AND SUPPLIES

A study performed on the reagents used in the process revealed that at the time of the study  no  issues  were  raised  on  the  supplies.    Each  individual  supplier  has  been contacted.

## METALLURGICAL TESTING

## ADDITIONAL TESTWORK

Metallurgical  testwork  will  need  to  be  done  in  order  to  properly  design  the  new processing facilities. Crushing and principally SAG index will need to be done for proper equipment design and selection.  Because  of  the  lower  head  grade  than  the  historical value  and  the  sensitivity  of  the  niobium  concentrate  quality  to  impurities,  extensive metallurgical  testwork  will  need  to  be  performed  to  validate  the  niobium  recovery  and concentrate quality grade.  Also, niobium recovery improvement will be investigated by modifying the reagent scheme or process flowsheet.  Following the laboratory tests and results  achieved,  pilot  plant  investigation  could  be  required  for  the  new  approach. Comparative testwork between conventional grinding and classification presently used and new grinding circuit using SAG-Ball mill will need to be done.

## 17 MINERAL RESOURCE AND MINERAL RESERVE ESTIMATES

## MINERAL RESOURCES

## SUMMARY

As part of the PEA on the economic viability of open pit bulk mining at the Project, RPA conducted  an  independent  update  of  Mineral  Resource  estimation,  constrained  in  a Whittle  open  pit  shell.    Grades  for  Nb O ,  SiO ,  P O ,  and  Fe O   were  estimated  into 2 5 2 2 5 2 3 blocks using ID 2 weighting. Table 17-1 presents Mineral Resource estimates constrained by Whittle open pit shell at a 0.2% Nb2O5 cut-off grade.

- 6. Numbers may not add due to rounding.

## IAMGOLD MINERAL RESOURCE AND RESERVE ESTIMATION

Historically,  stope  design  was  integral  to  resource  estimation  at  Niobec.    In  the  upper three mining blocks, open stopes are limited to a width of approximately 24.4 m.  Where mineralized zones exceed 24 m, resources were limited to the volume of the designed stopes.  The  same  methods  were  applied  to  the  pillars  that  were  not  scheduled  for recovery.    Consequently,  historical  resource  estimates  had  Measured  and  Indicated

<!-- image -->

Mineral Resources identical to Proven and Probable Mineral Reserves.  Stope design was also considered in the estimation of Inferred Resources.  These restrictions did not apply  to  the  lower  mining  blocks  (4  to  9)  that  employed  paste  backfill.    All  potential stopes, designed at 24.4 m by 24.4 m by 91.4 m or 15.2 m by 24.4 m by 91.4 m, within the  mineralized  zones  could  now  be  included  in  the  resources  provided  the  average grade of the volume, based on block model estimation, exceeded the economic cut-off.

The adoption of bulk mining methods will remove mining size restrictions, result in less ore loss, and allow for a lower economic cut-off grade, which reflects mining efficiencies realized through this extraction method.

Historically, IAMGOLD estimated Mineral Resources at the Project but did not publicly disclose the results.  In 2009, IAMGOLD produced a Mineral Resource estimate that was audited  and  confirmed  by  BSI.    A  later  internal  IAMGOLD  estimate  was  done  as  of December 31, 2010, employing updated data and is shown in Table 17-2.

## 2009 IAMGOLD RESOURCE ESTIMATE

In 2009, BSI completed an audit of the IAMGOLD resource estimate prepared using a block  model  constrained  by  wireframe  models  of  the  four  mineralized  zones,  surface topography, and the overlying Trenton limestone.  Grades were interpolated into blocks using ID .  Mineral Resources were quoted inclusive of Mineral Reserves and are shown 2 in  Table  6-3  of  this  report.    The  BSI  estimate  showed  negligible  differences  with  the IAMGOLD resource estimate, which employed the same ID  interpolation methodology. 2

BSI concluded that the IAMGOLD estimate was reliable and repeatable (Belzile, 2009).

## 2010 IAMGOLD MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATE

Currently, the Project is mined using longhole open stopes with cemented backfill.  As part of its annual evaluation, IAMGOLD produced estimates of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves using updated data from 2010 and employing similar parameters and assumptions used in previous estimates.  The results of the IAMGOLD Mineral Resource estimation are presented in Table 17-2.

RPA independently  verified  the  2010  Mineral  Resource  estimates  by  using  the  same interpolation parameters. In RPA's opinion, IAMGOLD's  estimation of Mineral Resources is reliable and repeatable.

## 2010 IAMGOLD MINERAL RESERVE ESTIMATE

Mineral Reserves are limited to mining blocks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.  Since mining factors are  applied  before  Mineral  Resources  are  estimated,  Measured  Resources  can  be transferred directly into Proven Reserves for blocks 1, 2, and 3.

For blocks 4 to 6, the stopes are designed using the cemented backfill mining method at a maximum stope size of 15.2 m by 24.4 m.  A lack of operation experience with the backfill mining method led to an assumption that some of the mineralized material would be diluted by waste despite the generally good ground conditions.  Therefore, a total of 5% dilution has been added to the estimate at zero grade.  Despite the added dilution, all Indicated Resources in blocks 4, 5, and 6 remain above the economic cut-off and, as such, they are transferred to Probable Reserves.

The 2010 Mineral Reserve estimate is summarized in Table 17-3.

## RPA MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATION DATABASE

## SAMPLES

The data used for grade interpolations  are  entirely  from  diamond  drill  sampling.    The database contains records for 3,525 holes, of which all are located within the resource model area.  The number of sampled intervals varies depending on the element.  Key components  such  as  Nb2O5,  SiO2,  P2O5,  and  Fe2O3  were  assayed  in  virtually  all samples.  Determinations for elements other than Nb2O5, the key economic component, were done to understand their impacts on niobium recovery and, ultimately, on yield.

The total number of samples within the database is 165,049, with 871 (0.5%) containing a value of zero for Nb2O5.  Other elements also contain zero assay values to varying degrees. A table of sample statistics used in the estimate is provided below in Table 174.    RPA  notes  that  the  use  of  samples  containing  zero  assay  values  in  interpolation produces a conservative resource estimate.

## COMPOSITES

Mineral Resource estimates at Niobec are done on raw assay data since the majority of the  sample  intervals  in  the  database  are  3.05  m  in  length.    RPA  has  inspected  the database  and  confirms  that  approximately  76.5%  of  the  samples  are  exactly  3.05  m long.

RPA notes that approximately 3.5% of samples in the database are equal or less than 1.52 m and approximately 1.3% are equal or greater than 4.57 m.  Approximately 10.8%

<!-- image -->

of samples  exceeding  4.57  m  have  zero  values  for  Nb2O5,  which  likely  reflects unsampled drill holes that are assigned zero grade for their entire length.  For samples with lengths less than or equal to 1.52 m, approximately 3.4% of those values are equal to zero.

In the opinion of RPA, the assay database should be composited for those samples that lie within interpreted mineralized zones as a means of achieving uniform sample support before interpolation.

## ESTIMATION DOMAINS

In  2007,  lenses  of  similar  characteristics  were  identified  and  regrouped  into  four  main zones (Zones 101, 102, 206 and 208) using an approximate modelling cut-off grade of 0.35%  Nb2O5  (Figures  17-1  and  17-2).    This  was  done  to  assist  in  the  estimation  of Mineral Resources in the lower blocks that were scheduled to be mined and filled using paste backfill.  At the upper levels of the mine, since mining was restricted due to lack of backfill support, the mineralized envelopes were modelled to capture the highest grade material (Belzile, 2009).

The mineralized zones extend 500 m to 800 m along strike and approximately 1,000 m at depth.  The zones extend to approximately 1,000 m in depth.

RPA used IAMGOLD's mineralization solids for Mineral Resource estimation.

In addition to the mineralized zones, the surface topography, the interpreted base of the overburden,  and  Trenton  limestone  were  modelled.    Surface  and  mineralized  domain wireframes were updated using the latest drill results.  RPA has inspected these solids and judged the interpretation to be reasonable and suitable for use in the estimation of Mineral Resources.

Domain coding of the block model (i.e., rock type model) was based on these wireframe constraints and is presented below in Table 17-5.

Descriptive and distribution statistics of the assay results were generated and grouped by mineralized domain and are shown in Table 17-6.  The low Coefficient of Variation (CV) values derived from the analyses indicate that high grade values contribute only moderately to the mean grades.  Using this data, IAMGOLD has, historically, not used top cuts to mitigate the effects of high grade Nb2O5 assays on the overall mean assay grade.

## CAPPING OF HIGH GRADES

As  in  the  past,  no  capping  of  high  grades  was  done  for  this  resource  estimation. Reconciliation  of  past  production  results  against  grades  predicted  from  the  model supports this practice.  RPA carried out an analysis as a check to determine if the use of a top cut is appropriate.

RPA  generated  'cutting  curve'  plots  of  non-zero  assay  results  for  Nb2O5  for  all mineralized domains wherein the samples are subjected to a range of cuts and the 'cut mean' is plotted against the top cut value.  An example of one of these plots is provided in Figure 17-3.

In RPA's opinion, a reasonable top cut value generally falls along the flatter portion of the curve just before it curves downward toward the y-axis.  In the example shown in Figure  17-3,  this  would  be  in  the  range  of  2%  Nb O   to  3%  Nb O5.    RPA  conducted 2 5 2 additional  checks  to  determine  the  impact  the  top  cuts  will  have  on  the  mean,  the number of samples affected, and the percentiles of top cuts.  A top cut of 2.5% Nb2O5, affects only 81 samples, or 0.1% of those within the mineralized domains, and reduces the mean grade 0.5%.

In RPA's opinion, IAMGOLD should study the use of a top cut and consider its adoption for future resource estimations but, overall, they appear to have little impact on global grades.

## GEOSTATISTICS

## VARIOGRAPHY

Variography is not used for resource estimation at Niobec because ID  is used for grade 2 interpolation.  However, to verify if the search ellipses used for resource estimation and classification  were  appropriate,  studies  of  vertical  and  horizontal  variograms  were performed by RPA.  Point areas for mineralized zones, derived from raw Nb2O5 assays that  were  not  composited,  were  used  for  interpretation.  RPA  makes  the  following observations:

- · The modelled variograms reveal that a slight anisotropy is developed for the four zones, the major axis being along dip.  The semi-major axis, along strike, and the minor axis, across dip, appears similar.  Anisotropy ratios are from 1.5 to 2.3 for both major/semi-major and major/minor.
- · Variability  and  ranges  in  the  dip  direction  appear  different  from  zone  to  zone. The lowest variability (sill) appears to be in Zone 101 while the highest appears in 102 and 206 zones.  Ranges are 15 m to 30 m (40 ft to 100 ft) in 102, 206, and 208 zones while range in Zone 101 is in the order of 50 m to 65 m (150 ft to 200 ft).
- · Downhole variography indicates that the nugget effect represents 40% to 50% of the sill.  Two structures can be modeled:
- o Structure 1: 8 m to 10 m.
- o Structure 2: 20 m to 30 m.

In  RPA's  opinion,  search  ellipsoids  used  for  grade  interpolation  are  appropriate.    The variograms are shown in Appendix 1.

## BLOCK MODEL GEOMETRY

A block model was constructed (RPA2011\_rem) within the MODELE\_DEC2006 GEMS v6.3.0.1 project (Figure 17-4).  RPA notes that original IAMGOLD's dimensions of the block model were expanded significantly to accommodate the proposed pit shell.  Block model parameters are summarized in Table 17-8.

Mined out blocks have been identified by IAMGOLD and a rock code was assigned to these blocks.

## GRADE ESTIMATION METHODOLOGY

Grade estimation was conducted using ID  in Gemcom GEMS v6.3.0.1 software using 2 uncut  original  assays  employing  'hard  boundaries'  between  mineralized  domains. Interpolation of grade inside the blocks was done using the following parameters:

<!-- image -->

- · First  Pass  -  Search  ellipse  dimension  of  24.4  m  by  18.3  m  by  9.1  m  with  a minimum of four and maximum of 12 samples within the search ellipse, and a maximum number of two samples per drill hole.
- · Second Pass - Search ellipse dimension of 48.8 m by 36.6 m by 9.1 m with a minimum of four and maximum of 12 samples within the search ellipse, and a maximum number of two samples per drill hole.
- · Third Pass - Search ellipse dimension of 121.9 m by 91.4 m by 18.2 m with a minimum of four and maximum of six samples within the search ellipse, and a maximum number of two samples per drill hole.

RPA notes that while Nb2O5 is the only material of economic value, other materials, such as SiO2, Fe2O3 and P2O5 are also estimated, using the same methodology as Nb2O5, because of their importance for blending to maintain the metallurgical recovery of the mill feed.

An example of block model interpolation results is shown on Figure 17-5.

## ESTIMATION OF METALLURGICAL RECOVERY

As  the  metallurgical  recovery  of  the  niobium  is  variable,  each  individual  sample  was coded based on its lithology and mineralization.  IAMGOLD has conducted numerous

<!-- image -->

metallurgical tests on different lithologies since production started at Niobec in 1976 and has  built  up  considerable  experience  and  confidence.    The  expected  recovery  is  an average for each lithological unit and the samples are coded based on these data.  A summary  of  the  sample  coding  and  expected  metallurgical recoveries for each lithological characteristic are shown in Table 17-9.

In the block model, each block is assigned a code using 'nearest neighbour' estimation employing the same large search ellipse used for Nb2O5 grade estimation (i.e., 121.9 m by 91.4 m by 18.2 m).

## ESTIMATION OF RECOVERED METAL CONTENT

In the block model, each block is assigned a recovered metal content, which is defined as  the  product  of  the  grade  (%  Nb2O5)  and  the  predicted  recovery  derived  from  the metallurgical testing.  The economic cut-off at Niobec is based on this product (Yield) expressed in kg/t since recovery not only varies between zones but can vary even within stopes.    A  value  is  calculated  for  each  block  in  the  block  model  and  is  stored  in  the RENDEMENT attribute.  An example of the calculation used to populate this attribute is shown below.

0.60% Nb2O5 * 60% Recovery = 0.36% Nb2O5 or 3.60 kg Nb2O5/t

## SPECIFIC GRAVITY

Historically, specific gravity (SG) measurements have been routinely taken at Niobec.  In 2010, an additional 53 measurements were added to the dataset.  The new data did not cause any change in the accepted values.  The density of the rock varies by location within the deposit with Zones 101 and 102 having a value of 2.92 t/m  and Zones 206 3 and 208 have a value of 2.78 t/m .  The historic data comprises readings from the upper 3 part of the deposit but more SG data will be required for deeper mineralized zones.

## CLASSIFICATION

Mineral Resources estimated for the Niobec deposit are classified according to the CIM Definition  Standards  for  Mineral  Resources  and  Reserves  (December  11,  2005)  and follow the Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects as defined in NI 43-101.

RPA has classified  Mineral  Resources  at  Niobec  according  to  the  search  parameters used to inform the block model:

- · Measured Resources are limited to blocks which lie  within the search ellipsoid dimension of 24.4 m by 18.3 m by 9.1 m.  Interpolation indicates that the mean distance of samples to block centres is 14 m.
- · Indicated  Resources  are  limited  to  blocks  which  lie  within  the  search  ellipsoid dimensions of 48.8 m by 36.6 m by 9.1 m.  Interpolation indicates that the mean distance of samples to block centres is 29 m.
- · Inferred  Resources  are  limited  to  blocks  which  lie  within  the  search  ellipsoid dimensions  of  121.9  m  by  91.4  m  by  18.2  m.    Interpolation  indicates  that  the mean distance of samples to block centres is 64 m.

Resource classification at Niobec is supported by the quality and reliability of drilling and sampling data, the distance between sample points (i.e., drilling density), confidence in the geological interpretation of the mineralized body, continuity of geological structures and grade of material within, and a history of positive reconciliations between geological model and mill outputs.

An example of resource classification is shown on Figure 17-6.

## CALCULATION OF ECONOMIC CUT-OFF GRADE

Mineral Resources, as defined by the CIM Definition Standards for Mineral Resources and  Reserves  (2005),  must  have  reasonable  prospects  for  economic  extraction.    A breakeven  cut-off  grade  was  calculated  for  the  Niobec  Mine  using  the  following assumptions:

- · Average long-term niobium price of US$42.00 per kg.
- · A US$/C$ exchange rate of 1:1.05.
- · An estimated average annual production of 10.0 Mt.
- · Average grade of 0.40% Nb2O5 for Measured, Indicated and Inferred Resources.
- · Metallurgical recovery concentrator of 45.3%.
- · Metallurgical recovery convertor of 97.0%.
- · Production costs of C$ 26.47/t of ore

These assumptions correspond to scaled-up production and costs.

<!-- image -->

The breakdown of the production costs is as follows:

- · Mining costs of C$10.80/t of ore considering a waste to ore ratio of 5:1.
- · Concentrator costs of C$9.50/t of ore.
- · Converter costs of C$4.92/t of ore.
- · Administration costs of C$1.25/t of ore.

RPA notes that the long term niobium price used in the cut-off calculation is higher than the average of the last three years but lower than the current price.

## 2010 RPA ESTIMATE (PIT SHELL CONSTRAINED)

As  part  of  the  PEA,  RPA  conducted  an  independent  update  of  Mineral  Resource estimation.    Grades  for  Nb2O5,  SiO2,  P O5,  and  Fe2O3 2 were estimated into  the  blocks using ID 2 weighting.  Mineral Resources have been constrained to open pit Whittle shell 6T (refer to Section 18 for details) and are presented in Table 17-1 at the beginning of Section 17.

Figures  17-7  and  17-8  present  Mineral  Resources  vs.  Whittle  pit  shell  block  model grades and resource classification, respectively.

The independent Mineral Resource estimate conducted by RPA was not identical to the estimate  produced  by  IAMGOLD  but,  in  the  opinion  of  RPA,  the  differences  are negligible and can be attributed to the re-blocking of the model done by IAMGOLD

RPA is of the opinion that the resource model is conservative and has good potential to be expanded.  The pit shell includes many blocks that are outside the four main zones, in the mineralized carbonatite where limited to no information is available.  A grade of zero has been assigned to those blocks.

## 18 OTHER RELEVANT DATA AND INFORMATION

RPA  and  IAMGOLD  investigated  the  potential  for  open  pit  and  underground  (block caving)  mining  at  an  expanded  rate  at  Niobec  Options  were  evaluated  with  ROM  ore being  processed  at  27,400  tpd  in  a  mill  and  converter  plant  on  site  producing  FeNb. Infrastructure requirements, road access, and power were investigated. Environmental considerations include the impact of the pit, waste rock dump, and tailings storage.

This section focuses on the OP expansion option and summarizes information and data concerning the existing operations (current and mining expansion under way prior to this PEA)  and  the  block  caving  expansion  option  studied  concurrently  by  IAMGOLD,  for comparison and ease of understanding purposes.

## CURRENT MINING OPERATIONS

The  Niobec  Mine  has  been  in  production  since  1976.  The  present  shaft (four compartments)  is  850  m  deep  and  is  used  for  production  (ore  hoisting)  and  services (materials  and  manpower).    In  addition  to  the  shaft,  the  mine  is  serviced  by  a  ramp reaching a depth of 750 m

Actual production levels are located on the 600, 1000, and 1450 levels and there is also development  on  the  300,  700,  and  1150  levels  (Figure  18-1).    Development  on production levels are mainly used  for ore haulage  by  trucks  to the ore pass. Development  is  performed  using  hydraulic  jumbos.    Ground  support  is  performed  to secure the openings using bolters.  The broken rock is loaded by LHD and hauled by truck to the ore pass.  The ore is crushed and then hoisted to surface by a skip (skip cage configuration hoisting system). Horizontal sill pillars are left between the production levels.

Open stoping has been the only mining method used since mine start-up.  This method is used in the upper part of the mine in block 1 to 3.  Stopes are planned and designed based on geological information obtained from diamond drilling.  The average size of the stopes is about 60 m in length, 25 m in width and 90 m in height, corresponding to the vertical  distance  between  development  and  production  levels.    A  25  m  pillar  is  left between  the  stopes.    Secondary  extraction  of  the  pillars  can  be  carried  out  after  the complete  extraction  of  the  primary  stopes.    Occasional  mining  of  the  horizontal  pillar between two mining blocks is also possible.

Access to a stope is  achieved  on  two  levels.    On  the  upper  level,  secondary  parallel drifts  separated  by  a  temporary  pillar  of  4.3  m  are  excavated  within  the  limits  of  the stope.    On  the  lower  level  (production  level),  draw  points  are  opened  at  60°  from  the transverse drift.  They are joined by a drift in the centre of the stope.

Vertical production holes are drilled from the upper secondary.  Drilling and blasting of a drop raise (from bottom to top) completes the stope preparation.  Production of the stope is achieved with several vertical rings blasted at the same time.

The  bulk  open  stope  mining  method  production  cost  is  the  main  advantage  of  the method.    At  Niobec,  this  method  has  been  successful  as  a  result  of  the  size  of  the mineralized zones combined with excellent ground conditions.

A  disadvantage  of  the  method  is  that  mineralized  zones  are  wider  than  the  allowable stope width.  As a result, a part of the economic mineralization must be left in place as a permanent  pillar.    Stope  design  is  an  important  consideration  in  the  Niobec  resource estimation.  In the upper three mining blocks, open stopes are limited to a width of about 24 m. Where mineralized zones are wider than 24 m, resources must be limited to the volume dictated by stope design; therefore, the remaining resources will not be mined. The  same  approach  applies  to  pillars  that  are  not  planned  to  be  recovered.    Mining factors  are  therefore  applied  before  the  final  resource  estimation.    Consequently, historical  resource  estimates  (Measured  and  Indicated)  were  the  same  as  reserve estimates (Proven and Probable).  Inferred Resources were also estimated taking stope design into account.

<!-- image -->

The extraction of the top two mining blocks is near completion (less than 5% of current reserves are located in these blocks).  Based on a recent rock mechanics study (Golder, 2007), the horizontal pillars will have to be thicker below these depths (45 m between block three and four and 76 m between block four and five).  Stope dimensions will also need to be smaller.

Following  the  Golder  recommendations  (2007),  mining  recovery  and  horizontal  pillar recovery were reviewed.  The restrictive mining factors described above, combined with the fact that the mineralized zones are wider at depth led to the conclusion that mining extraction could be less than 40% if the current mining method is maintained for blocks 4 to 6.

## UNDERGROUND MINING OPTIONS

Three UG mining scenarios were investigated in order to guide future expansion.  The first  scenario  is  an  updated  life  of  mine  (LOM)  using  the  latest  2010  reserve  and resource estimates.

The second scenario involves the addition of three new mining blocks (7 to 9) using the paste  fill  mining  method.    The  second  scenario  is  based  on  the  assumption  that  the deposit would continue at depth with the same size and metal content.  As the second scenario is based on partial or insufficient geological information, the reader should use it  as  a  guide  for  future  strategic  decisions.    Exploration  work  combined  with  detailed optimization studies would be required to confirm the validity of this scenario.

The  third  scenario  involves  a  change  in  the  mining  approach  as  the  mine  would  be converted  to  block  caving.    This  scenario  was  built  using  the  April  2011  RPA  block model.

## BASE CASE SCENARIO (2.2 M tpa )

In 2007, a decision was made to deepen the Niobec shaft to 850 m to get access to new mining blocks (4 to 6).  As mentioned in the previous section, the mining recovery using open  stoping  would  be  as  low  as  40%.    A  mining  method  using  cemented  fill  was selected to allow a much better mining recovery.

<!-- image -->

Based on the paste backfill studies and simulations, stopes of 15.2 m by 24.4 m by 91.5 m were selected together with a mining sequence that would allow enough curing time. Golder reviewed the work and agreed with the conclusions.

Paste backfill is intended to be used mainly for the mining of block four and lower.  As mining is almost completed in blocks one and two, there is currently no plan to backfill these  blocks.    However,  some  isolated  stopes  in  the  block  three  could  potentially  be mined by this method in the future.  The recovery of pillar by the paste backfill method was not considered for these blocks.

Stope design restrictions do not apply to the lower mining blocks (four to six) using the paste backfill method.  Potential stopes of 24 m X 15 m X 91 m within the mineralized zones are now included in the resources as long as the average grade of the volume (based  on  the  block  model)  is  higher  than  the  economic  cut-off.    This  leads  to  a substantial resource and  reserve increase compared  to  the open  stope  mining estimation.  The use of a pyramidal mining sequence should be considered for maximal production.

Conversion  of  the  currently  used  open  stoping  method  to  paste  fill  pyramidal  mining method is planned for blocks four to six.  As mentioned, a 300 tph backfill plant was required and installed on surface in 2010.  The remaining reserves in blocks one to three will be extracted using the open stoping method.

## CASE A SCENARIO (3.5 M tpa )

Case A Scenario involves the addition of three new mining blocks (7 to 9).  Blocks 7, 8, and 9 were evaluated using the same mining method as blocks 4, 5, and 6.  As such, much of the assumptions are similar to current performances from the Niobec Mine.

Stope drilling and blasting is planned to be similar to current practices.  Stopes are 15.2 m wide by 24.4 m long, with sills parallel to the longer edge.  Stopes are 91.5 m high, and contain 87,000 t of ore.  Drilling and blasting patterns are identical to blocks 4, 5, and 6.  For rock stability reasons, a 91.5 m pillar is planned between blocks 6 and 7.

<!-- image -->

Additional  development  must  be  completed  to  extract  blocks  7,  8,  and  9.    Niobec's current shaft has a depth of 800 m and provides access to blocks one to six.  In order to avoid conflicts with current production work and provide additional hoisting capacity, a second shaft is to be sunk 450 m southwest of the present shaft.  To facilitate sinking, UG  access  to  the  second  shaft  should  be  possible  via  the  2400  level.    The  UG development work and shaft sinking can begin once the future location of station 2400 is reached.

An east-west longitudinal section view of the mine is shown in Figure 18-2.

## CASE B SCENARIO (10 MTPA)

Case B scenario  involves  a  completely  different  mining  method.    The  mine  would  be progressively converted to block caving.  Block caving mining method is one of the most cost effective UG methods given that its cost could be compared to that achieved with an OP.  The deposit  needs  to  satisfy  several  criteria  to  be  suitable  for  block  caving.    In 2011,  IAMGOLD  engaged  Golder  to  conduct  a  cavability  assessment  of  the  Niobec deposit.  In order to guide the reader, an east-west longitudinal section of the Niobec Mine is shown in Figure 18-3.

Block Caving is defined as the process whereby large blocks of ore are undercut and allowed  to  fall  and  fracture  into  smaller  pieces  that  can  be  loaded  and  taken  to  the surface.

Draw points are evenly spaced along the bottom of the orebody and undercut drifts are driven above.  From these drifts, miners drill closely spaced holes in a fanning pattern, fracturing  the  rock.    In  some  cases,  explosives  can  be  used  to  help  with  the  initial fracturation.  As said before, the rock above will then rupture under its own weight, falling into  the  draw  points.    Once  caving  begins,  the  rest  of  the  orebody  will  continue  to collapse  and  fill  the  void  created,  eliminating  the  need  for  any  additional  drilling  and blasting.

According to results from Golder's cavability assessment, the required area to ensure caving of the rock mass has to be a 160 m by 160 m. Golder also estimates in this study that  a  maximum  caving  height  of  between  400  m  and  500  m  would  be  implemented, after which the draw points will no longer be usable. Consequently, in order to maximize overall mine  recovery,  two  block  caving  zones  are  currently  planned  in  existing resources and reserves.  The upper block caving would be developed to extract ore up to limestone horizon from 440 m depth level.  The lower block caving reaches resources from 730 m depth level up to the upper block caving production level.

The progression rate within the mine is inversely proportional to the overall height being caved.  That is, as the height being caved increases, the rate at which draw points are exhausted and need to be replenished diminishes.  For the upper block caving level, the caving height of 350 m extracts 24 draw points per year.  The lower one, with a height of 250 m, requires 32 draw points per year.

While production continues in the upper parts of the mine, two shafts would be sunk from surface to a depth of 825 m.  In order to guarantee the accomplishment of schedule for the upper block caving level, development works such as the drilling levels, production levels and accesses, will have to be finished within the time allowed for shaft sinking. The access for these tasks would be possible by the old shaft. Since the production level will be developed prior and then concurrently with the shafts, block caving can start with

<!-- image -->

the  completion  of  the  two  shafts.    Production  using  the  open  stoping  method  would cease with start up of block caving.

Due to limitations on the size of the conveyors, the mine must operate using both the western  and  eastern  halves  simultaneously.    Production  teams  would  start  from  the central  haulage  accesses,  moving  towards  the  extremities  as  the  grade  in  the  draw points becomes too low.  This method is similar to panel caving with the fronts moving in an east-west orientated direction.

Use of block caving method in the upper part of the mine (blocks 1, 2, and 3) will allow recovery of the reserves left in place from the open stoping method and mining of new resources and reserves that have been identified in these levels.

## OPEN PIT EXPANSION OPTION

## MINING METHOD

RPA, in  collaboration  with  IAMGOLD,  investigated  the  potential  for  OP  This  option  is named the Case C scenario. Open pit possibilities  were investigated by floating cone analysis,  using  Whittle  software,  run  on  the  resource  block  model.  Pit  optimizations indicated that a significant proportion of the resource block model would be economic to mine, using OP methods.

Whittle pit runs were performed based on typical costs for Canadian mining operations of a similar scale, and on IAMGOLD scale-up of current processing/converting, marketing and freight costs as follows:

• Open pit mining:

$1.80/t moved

• Milling:

$9.50/t milled

• G&amp;A:

$1.25/t milled

• Converting:

$4.00/kg Nb

• Marketing and freight:

$1.41/kg Nb

• Mill recovery:

40% to 60%, depending on Nb2O5 head grade

<!-- image -->

• Converter recovery:

97%

• Niobium in FeNb:

69.9%

Revenue  factors  were  calculated  using  the  above  metallurgical  recoveries  based  on Niobec historical  data. The  revenue factors  were  used  to generate  a  net  value  model which was used to float cones in the Whittle software.

## MINE DESIGN

For  the  purpose  of  pit  optimization,  a  re-blocking  of  the  block  model  was  done  to increase block size to 24.4 m by 24.4 m horizontal by 15.2 m vertical (current Niobec coordinates system is Imperial).  A pit optimization was run using the previous inputs and a pit slope of 45°. The values of blocks were calculated using a niobium price based on long-term forecasts of $45 per kg and the aforementioned mill and converter recoveries.

In  the  absence  of  geotechnical  information,  pit  slope  angles  were  selected  based  on industry averages. In RPA's opinion, 45° angles may prove conservative, as rock mass is  generally  competent  (stable  UG  huge  open  stopes),  and  steeper  slopes  have  been applied successfully at other mines in the region, such as Inmet's Troilus Mine, which averages  58°.  RPA  recommends  geotechnical  testing  of  representative  core  samples (located where pit walls are anticipated to be), and, as the Project is advanced, detailed analysis of slope angles is warranted.

Cost inputs for Whittle were based on estimates detailed below, under Operating Costs.

The topographic surface  at  the  Niobec  property  area  is  almost  flat  and  the  reference surface elevation is approximately 3,050 m.  The overburden thickness at the pit location varies from 0.9 m to 5 m, averaging 3 m. For economic purposes in the current PEA, overburden was considered as waste rock.

The Whittle  economic  optimization  yielded  a  pit  (Pit  6T)  which  contained  the  Mineral Resource  stated  previously  in this report. A  second  economic  optimization  was performed  on  the  first  Whittle  result  by  means  of  IAMGOLD's  Comet  Production Scheduler  Software  in  order  to  maximize  its  net  present  value  (NPV)  at  8%.    A  time parameter was introduced into this process to force the schedule to stop in 2052, as was

<!-- image -->

done in the block caving scenario, for comparison purposes. The maximum NPV of this pit optimization process occurred at a cut-off grade of 0.33% Nb2O5.

The exercise returned 370  Mt grading 0.46% Nb2O5 and corresponds to a smaller pit within Pit 6T. The proportion of Inferred Resources in the material that may be potentially mineable via open pit is approximately 20%. Waste mining of 1,482 Mt is required, for a strip  ratio  of  4:1.  The  pit  shell  is  of  circular  shape  with  a  1,830  m  diameter  and  is  a maximum of 564 m deep.  The crest of the pit encroaches on the current tailings and settling pond (Figure 18-4).

Floating cone analysis does not include individual benches or ramp design.  For the pit size,  production  requirements,  and  recommended  equipment  fleet,  RPA  considers mining of 12 m benches and development of 33 m wide ramps, including ditches and safety berm, to be appropriate. The ramps should be designed at 10% grade to exit the pit towards the northwest and the southwest, in the directions of the mill and the waste rock dumps, respectively.

A section view of the Whittle pit shells looking north is shown in Figure 18-5. The pit shell 4T (bottom at 564 m below surface) is the subject of the PEA in this report. With the exception  of  pit  6T  (host  of  the  Mineral  Resource),  all  other  pit  shells  were  used  to develop  the  LOM  production  schedule.  Pit  shell  numbers  correspond  to  existing  UG mining block numbering that will be referred to in the following subsections.

## MINING THROUGH UNDERGROUND MINE OPENINGS AND EXISTING SURFACE INFRASTRUCTURE

At Niobec, the use of UG open stope mining in the past left behind mineralized pillars as structural support for the mine.

As  the  pit  will  be  mining  through  old  open  stope  mine  workings,  the  operating  plan includes backfilling of each open stope with crushed limestone or low grade ore when available.  Mining through UG voids without backfilling is common in some large open pits (Super Pit at Kalgoorlie, Western Australia and Dome Mine at Timmins, Ontario) so there remains potential upside to improve mining costs by eliminating the fill.

The vertical layering of current UG mine workings is approximately as follow:

• 0 - 300 ft. (91.4 m ) deep:

Trenton limestone horizon (waste)

• 300 - 600 ft. (182. 8 m) deep:

UG mining Block 1

• 600 - 700 ft. (213.3 m) deep:

sill pillar

• 700 - 1,000 ft. (304.8 m) deep:

UG mining Block 2

• 1,000 - 1,150 ft. (350.5 m) deep:

sill pillar

• 1,150 - 1,450 ft. (441.9 m) deep:

UG mining Block 3

• 1,450 - 1,600 ft. (487.7 m) deep:

sill pillar

• 1,600 - 1,850 ft. (563.9 m) deep:

UG mining Block 4.

During  stripping  of  the  OP  in  the  limestone  horizon,  a  portion  of  the  waste  will  be crushed in the pit with a mobile crusher and this material will serve as fill for the UG open stopes of Block 1 via sub-vertical 12 in to 14 in dia. drill holes. Mining will be scheduled to always have a 'buffer' pillar of at least 100 m above UG openings, thus drill holes for filling purposes will be 100 m long at least.  Sub-economic or low grade ore from Block 1 will be used to fill Block 2 UG openings and same material from Block 2 will be used to fill Block 3 UG openings following the same approach.

During stripping of the OP in overburden and Trenton waste, the UG mine will operate until OP will start producing. Both operations will manage to have an approximate 243.8

<!-- image -->

m 'buffer'  pillar  between  the  bottom  of  the  pit  and  the  UG  working  places  during  this transitional  period.    Therefore,  a  transitional  period  at  2.2  Mtpa  as  current  will  be followed by the OP production start-up; at that time, UG mine will contribute zero tonnes and be closed. Prior to begin OP development, UG ventilation raise and infrastructures will have to be relocated because currently located inside future pit footprint.

During OP mining, once filled UG stopes are encountered on a bench, the fill material will be reclaimed first and hauled to the waste rock dump (Trenton in Block 1), or hauled to  low  grade  stock  pile  or  the  primary  crusher  (low  grade  ore  in  blocks 2  and  3),  and these openings will serve as first cuts.  Drilling and blasting will then start around them and progress further away.  Reclaiming of crushed Trenton into the UG stopes during OP mining will be done very carefully in order to avoid sending Trenton waste to the mill. Trenton limestone is very deleterious material to the process and impacts on the quality of the final product.

The OP bench floor elevations for few assigned benches will be designed to fit with drift floor elevations of UG level (at depth of 300, 450, 600, 700, 850, 1,000, 1,150, 1,300, 1,450 and 1,600 ft). This way, on a bench height basis (12 m), the UG drifts (3.6 m high) should not be an issue because production drill holes will connect with them, be plugged at the bottom, loaded and blasted. If the pillar above drift collapses, the swell should fill the drift before reaching the OP bench floor above.

During the UG to OP transition production period, the filled stopes, once connected into the pit, will potentially drain OP surface water into the UG mine. A provisional increase of the current UG pumping capacity will be considered in the costs estimation.

The buffer pillar approach will have to be validated with geotechnical / geomechanical / rock mechanics studies, as well as the 45° open pit slope angle for scoping design. The OP surface water inflow  into the  UG mine  will  both  have  to  be  validated  as  well  with hydrology / hydrogeology studies.

The pit footprint will eventually reach the existing tailings pond and be near the future tailings pond. Once required, a portion of the existing tailings will be relocated into new pond and the existing pond will be re-profiled. A safe distance between tailings dam toes

<!-- image -->

and  pit  crest  will  have  to  be  determined  upon  a  geotechnical  assessment  of  the overburden underlying/surrounding the tailings ponds at these locations.

The location for waste rock dumps (as shown in Figure 18-4) was determined based on the area required (12 km² and 76 m high) and with first objectives to minimize the impact on water courses, to have a 100 m buffer distance from Hydro Quebec's high-voltage power  lines and  to avoid being over known  potential Mineral Resources  (REE mineralization north of the open pit). The waste rock dumps and the underlying soils will have to be assessed upon geotechnical studies as well as condemnation drilling at their locations.

Finally, a provisional surface area allows for land purchases for OP expansion option, particularly for waste rock dump footprints.

## PRE-PRODUCTION SCHEDULE

It is currently estimated that the feasibility studies and permitting will be completed from 2011 through 2013, overlapped and followed by a development and construction phase of two years with increased production starting in the first quarter of 2015.

## LIFE OF MINE PRODUCTION SCHEDULE

The production schedule was generated with the participation of IAMGOLD using Comet Scheduler Software with Whittle optimization results as inputs. The mill throughput was set to 10 Mtpa at Year 3 and beyond, ramping-up from 5 Mtpa and 7.5 Mtpa in the first and second years of production respectively.

Twelve million tonnes of waste pre-stripping will be required in Year -1. The transition from UG and OP mines will last four years from Year -4 to -1 (or from 2011 to 2014, as currently planned).

The UG mine remaining production combined with the OP expansion project resulted in a 42-year LOM, or up to 2052, as shown in Table 18-1.

## INFRASTRUCTURE

The OP expansion option is principally a new construction as the current installation will be inside the pit limit created by this mining approach. As the current shaft will not be compromised  until  mining  activities  reach  the  shaft  installation,  the  existing  UG  shaft services will remain in place as current underground mining will continue until open pit production start-up. For this purpose, part of the existing ventilation surface system and raises will have to be temporarily relocated. The water line from the Shipshaw River is only infrastructure that will be useful beyond this time.

<!-- image -->

## EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE

The existing shaft will be conserved up until the open pit production start-up and then be demolished.  The water line and water recirculation infrastructure will be conserved as per its existing function and also expanded upon.  The remainder of the equipment will require demolition.  The value of demolition is considered as zero cost, as the value of equipment  and  scrap  metal  generated  will  compensate  for  the  cost  work  to  remove. Special attention will be required to removing equipment that has high radon emission values.  The existing 25 kV line power will be decommissioned in appropriate areas to keep supplying power to water pumping stations.

## ROADS

With the pit footprint cutting through the Columbium Road nearby the current mine site, a new road is proposed to reduce traffic flow around the communities.  The road is shown in Figure 18-6.

For this reason, it has been included in the study to upgrade the road from Highway 172 to  the  Columbium  Road  shown  by  marker  A  to  B  in  Figure  18-6.    This  would  permit transport of material to Niobec without having to pass through small villages.  The seven kilometre  road  would  be  paved.  Additionally  roads  and  parking  facilities  as  well  as terracing  of  the  plant  are  provided  for.    A  total  of  four  kilometres  of  gravel  road  is foreseen.  This will be a gravel road for local private traffic and employee parking.

## BUILDINGS

The  following  buildings  infrastructure  is  added  to  the  new  open  pit  project  to  provide appropriate services: Mine Administration and Service Office, Mill Workshop, Mill Service and Dry Building, Mill Office, and Truck shop and Mine Dry Building.

The  Mine  Administration  and  Service  Office  will  be  subdivided  as  per  the  following: 5,000 m²  of  offices  and  500  m²  of  warehouse  space.  Offices  are  provided  with Information Technology (IT) and communications infrastructure.  This warehouse will be principally for mill equipment and general supplies.

The Mill Workshop building provides shop layout with central foreman offices for welding and mechanical services as well as small repairs.

The  Mill  Service  and  Dry  building  provides  a  change  house  and  services  building  for plant  workers  for  a  total  of  500  m².  This  is  a  typical  layout  of  showers,  lockers  and sanitary facilities.

The Mill Office provides for 1,000 m² for offices and conference room for mill personnel. Office  sizes  and  layout  are  similar  to  the  mine  offices  and  provides  for  IT  and communications infrastructure.

Open pit  mining  operation  will  require  a  truck  shop  for  doing  maintenance  on  mobile equipment and change rooms for mine and maintenance workers. These services will be housed  into  the  Truck  shop  and  Mine  Dry  Building.  To  allow  for  mine  maintenance planning and execution, attached to the facilities are the mine maintenance offices.  This building is divided up into five main areas: the offices, the change rooms, the workshop, the warehouse and the truck shop.

The truck shop offices are laid out over 400 m² comprising of 16 closed offices for the supervisors, engineers, foremen and managers, a larger room for dispatchers and IT, a conference  room  and  a  copy  room.  Leading  off  from  the  offices  are  the  men's  and women's  change  room  areas.  The  women's  change  room  has  a  10  person  capacity while the men's change has a 375 person capacity, and both span an area of 360 m². The workshop is located between the men's change room, the warehouse area and the

<!-- image -->

truck shop, and spans 230 m².  It links the truck shop and warehouse, and contains the electrical room, the mechanical room and the tool crib.  The workshop has a second floor mezzanine, covering 200 m², with windows overlooking the truck shop.  It has a training room for eight people, as well as four private offices for the maintenance staff.  There are also two large offices for maintenance coordinators, and smaller room for maintenance general foremen. The warehouse area spans 490 m², and is equipped with a climate control storage area. The truck shop floor is 1,600 m² (approx. 60 m x 26 m) and has an 18-m high roof.  The bays are split in two types: preventative maintenance and heavy duty repairs. There is also a 25-t bridge crane spans the length of the entire truck shop.

The wash bay is located near the truck shop and situated in such a way as to provide easy  access  to  all  the  maintenance  bays.  The  entire  area  is  enclosed  by  a  building envelope with sufficient heating to prevent freezing.

Each building is linked up to fire suppression services where required and serviced by a septic field.  Potable water is assumed to be provided by the city of Saint-Honoré.

## PRIMARY CRUSHER AND STOCKPILE FACILITY

In this scenario, a crushing facility is required to process rock from open pit run-of-mine (ROM).  A 54 by 75 Metso Crusher is foreseen with necessary 50/20 t bridge crane.  The crane will be installed early to permit its use during construction.  An apron feeder feeds a stockpile conveyor that in turn feeds the ROM coarse ore stockpile of 25,000 t live load capacity. The covered stockpile is drawn using four apron feeders leading onto another conveyor providing feed to the new grinding facility SAG mill feed chute. All conveyors are covered with access from both sides (one side for maintenance and the other side for operation/maintenance).

## POWER AND COMMUNICATIONS

As  the  existing  main  substation  lies  in  the  affected  zone  of  mining,  a  new  substation located just nearby the new plant is proposed.  The modification will require extending the current 161  kV  line by Hydro  Québec  and  installing  two  new  60/80  MVA transformers.  Redundancy is optimized by being able to tie-in the two switch gears in case  one  transformer  is  damaged.    The  work  of  constructing  the  new  station  will  not affect  current  operations  as  it  is  located  in  a  new  area.    Energization  will  be  the  only

<!-- image -->

constraint for the new substation.  The estimated total load of the new plant is 80 MW and the design proposed will have no issue in supplying this power.

Communication systems infrastructure is reproduced in the new design taking advantage of  fiber  optic  links  from  the  25  kV  power  network.    All  new  infrastructures  will  have appropriate supply of networking capacity especially in offices where network access is required.  Server and outside link services are provided for in all major buildings.  As foreseen for all additional plant equipment infrastructure related to communications is the design  and  pricing, extending  out  the  present  PLC  infrastructure  to the current communication backbone.

## FUEL STORAGE AND DISTRIBUTION

A fuel handling system will be provided for the open pit fleet and be equipped with a fire suppression system.

## PROCESSING PLANT

This  scenario  requires  a  new  processing  plant  as  the  existing  infrastructure  will  be compromised by the open pit footprint generated from the new mining approach.  The major equipment used for processing has been covered into the Mineral processing and Metallurgical testing section earlier in the report, section 16.  The following are significant descriptions of the new required plant.

Each area has provision for its own or combined heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC)  system.  Architecture  is  appropriately  sized  for  each  area.  Most  areas  have bridge cranes foreseen to permit installation of equipment and servicing later upon startup.  There is one central electrical room that services the processing plant.

GRINDING, DESLIMING, PYRITE FLOTATION, CARBONATES FLOTATION, DEWATERING, MAGNETIC SEPARATION, PYROCHLORE FLOTATION, SULPHIDE FLOTATION, LEACHING AND LEACH FILTRATION, FILTRATION, DRYING AND PACKAGING, TAILINGS DISPOSAL, CONVERTER, CONCENTRATE STORAGE

All  these  items  were  evaluated  and  estimated  properly.    Details  of  the  sizing  and arrangements are confidential

<!-- image -->

## TAILINGS AND WATER MANAGEMENT

The increased capacity of storage required with the open pit scenario is approximately 400  million  tonnes  of  mine  residue,  including  existing  tailings  relocation.    The  current tailings ponds No. 1 and No. 2, presently have a surface of 2.2 km². SNC-Lavalin Inc. (SNC) was mandated to study the new tailings impoundment scenario earlier this year for a 350-Mt capacity. The design was based on the assumption of a 1.65 t/m³ residue specific gravity and that 100% of the mining residue is stored in the tailings pond with the mining method of this scenario.  Despite the difference in capacity, the area at surface was assumed to remain the same, thus SNC's capital cost estimate prevailed.  At the end of the LOM, the tailings pond will be higher than estimated resulting in additional dam raising; this has been accounted for into processing operating cost item.

Assuming  a  design  similar  to  tailings  pond  No.  2  with  decantation  of  water  to  a collecting/polishing  pond,  the  new  tailings  pond  will  have  a  surface  area  6.5  km²  and roughly be 43 m high (38 m high initially estimated by SNC), as shown in Figure 18-7. All lands  required  for  this  new  impoundment  have  been  estimated  at  a  flat  rate  and assumed that impediments in acquiring the land.  Construction of the ponds will borrow from  methods  of  construction  and  operation  based  on  the  existing  No.  1  and  No.  2 basins which have proved effective.

Water management follows an extension of the existing layout using basin No. 8 as the polishing basin and principal return of water for the mill with overflow directed to effluent water stream pumped to the Shipshaw River.

A new pump station is built beside pump station No. 5 and is expanded to accommodate the increase water require from the plant.

The  water  provided  by  the  Shipshaw  River  is  augmented  by  quadrupling  its  present design  capacity  feeding  basin  No.  2  and  No.  3.    The  twin  500  mm  high  density polyethylene  (HDPE)  pipe  line  12  km  long  will  be  implanted  alongside  the  pipelines foreseen to be installed in early 2011. The pumping station at the Shipshaw River will be consequently quadrupled in capacity.  The intake affluent and diffusion effluent into the Shipshaw River will be performed in the identical manner of the current concept.  The total  capacity  will  be  designed  at  a  minimum  54,520  standard  cubic  metres  per  day (SCMD) and maximum 65,500 SCMD of fresh water and minimum 62,800 and maximum 80,800 SCMD of effluent water.

As it is assumed that effluent control for suspended solids will remain an important factor for  discharge,  three  new  clarifying  systems  will  be  installed  to  cover  the  increased discharge capacity.

## RECOVERABILITY

Historically at Niobec, the process recovery varies with the Nb2O5 head grade while the converter recovery is constant and equal to 97%.

Within  the  mineable  ore  tonnage  delineated  in  the  pit  shell  under  assessment,  the average  ore  grade  implies  a  49.6%  mill  recovery  on  average.  Typical  historic  head grades vary between 0.35% and 0.70% Nb2O5 which resulted in respective mill recovery of 40% and 60% at grade limits. On a unit mining block basis, the pit optimization and production  schedule  were  performed  using  the  following  equation  to  correlate  Nb2O5 grade and process recovery. When Nb2O5 grade is below 0.35% or over 0.70%, the mill recovery is therefore the minimum (40%) or the maximum (60%) values achieved in the past.

## MARKETS

The primary use of niobium is as an alloy to strengthen steel for the automotive, gas pipeline and construction industries.  Demand is driven almost entirely by growth in steel production, enhanced by specific increasing demand for high strength steel.

In  2000,  world  consumption  of  ferroniobium  was  30.9  million  kilograms,  rising  to  an estimated 86 million kilograms in 2011.  Consumption is mainly split equally between the EU, North America, and China, with a lesser amount to Japan.

Over 90% of world niobium production is in the form of standard grade (~66% niobium) ferroniobium  produced  from  primary  deposits  in  Brazil,  Canada,  and  Australia.    Over 95% of the production comes from three producers:

- · Companhia Brasileira de Metalurgia e Mineração (CBMM)
- · Mineração Catalão de Goias (Catalao), owned by Anglo American
- · IAMGOLD Niobec

CBMM  has historically been the largest producer by far, generally covering approximately 80% to 85% of the market.  Niobec has historically covered 8% to 10% of the market, and Catalao somewhat less.

The ferroniobium  market  is  very  secretive,  with  public  and  transparent  pricing  forums non-existent.  Commensurate with the demand increase, prices have risen from the area of US$ 15 per kg contained niobium in 2006 to over US$ 40 per kg currently.

For the purposes of this study, RPA has assumed the following for market assumptions:

- · Annual consumption at 10% growth for the first four years and then declining to a long  term  annual  growth  of  3.5%  commencing  in  2020  (the  latter  based  on standardized forecasted Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR));
- · Long term price of US$ 45 per kilogram niobium;
- · Niobec  forecast  annual  production  at  full  capacity  of  14  million  to  18  million kilograms of niobium.

## CONTRACTS

Niobec's FeNb marketing and sales around the world is contracted to a specialized firm. Transportation cost of FeNb to customers, added to marketing and sales cost over the Project LOM, total C$ 875 million. Details of the agreement are confidential.

## ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS

## INTRODUCTION

The environmental management system (EMS) for the Niobec mine is certified under the 2004 revision of the ISO 14001 standard.  Niobec successfully passed the ISO 14001 recertification audit in November 2010.  Niobec's quality management system is certified ISO 9001: 2008 since 1995; it was last recertified in 2009.

Since  2008,  samples  of  Niobec's  final  effluent  are  submitted  to  the  Daphnia  magna toxicity test.  This test, required under provincial regulations, is frequently failed.  After many studies, IAMGOLD believes that Niobec's final effluent toxicity issue will be solved by  using  the  Shipshaw  River  as  the  source  of  the  freshwater  supplies  to  the  mill  and discharge the final effluent into this large water body.  IAMGOLD are very confident that this option will resolve both the toxicity and freshwater supply issues.  Niobec continues to work diligently on obtaining all the authorizations to begin the construction in spring of 2011.

Since  2006,  Niobec  exceeded  the  total  suspended  solids  (TSS)  monthly  average concentration allowed in the MMER (Metal Mining Effluent Regulations and Environmental Effects) during several months each year.  A new sedimentation pond, built  in  2008  is  effective,  but  not  enough  to  prevent  the  proliferation  of  algae  in  the presence of phosphor, which is the cause of the TSS.  On October 28, 2010 IAMGOLD received a directive, in accordance with the Fisheries Act, from the enforcement branch of  Environment  Canada  regarding  intermittent  exceedances  of  TSS.    Sedimentation fences were installed and an active treatment unit will be used as contingency to achieve consistent compliance.  The TSS issue will be solved through the Shipshaw River project

<!-- image -->

and various TSS control measures (i.e., wastewater treatment plant, silt curtains, use of coagulants and ultrasound, etc.).  IAMGOLD provided a detailed management plan to Environment  Canada  without  delay  and  IAMGOLD  has  committed  to  take  all  the necessary measures to be in compliance with the MMER.

## LEGAL REQUIREMENTS - HEALTH, SAFETY, ENVIRONMENT AND COMMUNITY

In terms of environmental requirements, Niobec mine must comply with both federal and Québec provincial laws and regulations directives.  The main laws Niobec has to comply with  are  the  Canadian  Environmental  Protection  Act  (CEPA)  and  the  Environmental Québec  Act  (EQA).    Numerous  regulations  and  directives  such  as  the  MMRE  and 'Directive 019' also apply.

It  must  be  noted  that  all  expansion,  construction  and  major  modification  projects  in Québec  need  approval  by  the  provincial government  through  the  environmental permitting process. Depending on the nature of the project, many  provincial governmental agencies may be involved in the permitting process.  Typically, the project approval  is  done  through  the  delivery  of  a  certificate  of  authorization  emitted  by  the Québec  department  of the environment -Minister of Sustainable Development, Environment  and  Parks  (MDDEP).    Niobec  presently  holds  numerous  certificates.    In 2011, the MDDEP will deliver to Niobec a document called 'Attestation d'assainissement' which is equivalent to an environmental operation permit delivered in other jurisdictions such  as  Ontario.    This permit will set out the environmental requirements  that  will  apply  to  Niobec  for  the  next  five  years.    This  document  was available to the public from November 2010 until January 2011.  This permit includes all certificates  of  approval  emitted  prior  to  2011.    For  some  projects,  especially  those requiring  work  in  water  bodies,  the  federal  government  may  also  be  involved  in  the permitting process.

In  terms  of  health  and  safety  requirements,  Niobec  mine  must  comply  with  Québec's provincial laws and regulations.  The main Health and Safety law in Québec is the 'Loi sur la santé et la sécurité du travail'.  Numerous regulations such as the 'Règlement sur la santé et la sécurité dans les mines' and the 'Règlement sur la santé et la sécurité' also apply.  The worker compensation regime in Québec is a no-fault system whereby

<!-- image -->

an employer cannot be prosecuted should a fatality occurs on a work site.  However, the newly  revised  Canadian  Criminal  Code  considers  that  an  employer  or  its  agents  (i.e. managers,  supervisors,  and  employees)  may  be  guilty  of  a  criminal  offence  if  it demonstrated  that  occupational  health  and  safety  is  not  managed  in  a  due  diligent manner.

The Québec Mining Act is another important legislation that determines how mines are to  be  developed,  operated  and  closed.    It  also  allows  for  mines  to  expropriate  land owners in order to build utilities such as water lines and power lines.  Despite this right, the expropriation process can take up to nine to twelve months and involves an approval by  the  provincial  Council  of  ministers.    The  Mining  Act,  and  the  regulations  under  it, includes provisions that require mining companies to rehabilitate the areas affected by their  activities.    The  provisions  cover  extraction  activities,  exploration  activities  that require earth work, and mine tailings sites.  By law, companies are required to file a site rehabilitation plan and, provide financial guarantees.

Companies carrying out mining activities under the Mining Act must submit a reclamation plan to the Department of Natural Resources of Québec (MRNF).  Following consultation with  the  MDDEP,  the  MRNF  may  approve  the  plan  and  its  implementation  schedule. The MRNF may if necessary, request additional research or studies before approving the  plan.    The  closure  plan  must  be  submitted  for  approval  to  the  department  before work can begin.  The closure plan must be revised every five years, but in certain cases the MRNF may require more frequent revisions.

In 2009, the MRNF made public its Mineral Strategy in which it defines the objectives to be reached and the measures to be taken for the future of the mineral sector in Québec. On December 2, 2009, Bill 79, which seeks to amend the Mining Act, was introduced by Québec's  Minister  for  Natural  Resources  and  Wildlife.    Bill  79  proposes  several significant amendments to the Mining Act, including the following:

- · Under  current  rules,  the  financial guarantee  is  equivalent  to 70%  of  the anticipated cost of rehabilitating accumulation areas.  The guarantee must now cover  100%  of  the  anticipated  cost  of  rehabilitating  accumulation  areas,  soil stabilization,  stabilizing  mine  openings  and  surface  pillars,  water  treatment  and roadwork;

<!-- image -->

- · Currently, the schedule of payment for the guarantee is established on the life of the  mine  basis.  The  proposed  rules  will  require  that  the  entire  guarantee  be provided in five annual payments;
- · Under the EQA, a public consultation, with an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA)  process  and  public  hearings  before  the  BAPE  -  Bureau  d'audiences publiques  en  environnement  -  is  required  in  the  case  of  metal  mine  with  a production  capacity  over  7,000  tpd.    In  its  Mineral  Strategy,  the  Government announced its intention to reduce the threshold for triggering an EIA process for metal mine to a production capacity over 3,000 tpd;
- · The proposed changes will mean that all new mines will be subject to a public consultation  process  including  those  for  which  the  EQA  does  not  presently provide  a  public  consultation  and  in  particular  metal  mine  below  the  capacity threshold mentioned above;
- · Urban ban (RPA notes Niobec is not in an urban area).

The Minister announced in February 2011 that Bill 79 was suspended and that there is no plan to introduce a new mining bill for at least a year.

The  most  recent  version  of  Niobec's  closure  plan  was  approved  by  the  MRNF  in September  2009.    A  revised  rehabilitation  plan  has  to  be  submitted  to  the  MRNF  by September 2014.  A company that expects to use or that is already using an area must provide  the  MRNF  with  a  financial  guarantee  once  its  rehabilitation  plan  has  been approved.  The amount of the guarantee must cover 70% of the estimated closure cost and  the  accumulation  areas  (i.e.  waste  rock  dumps,  tailings  pond,  etc.).    Under  the mining  reform,  the  guarantee  will  be  a  100%  in  the  future.    Niobec  has  no  financial guarantee in  place,  based  on  the  life  of  the  mine,  but  the  first  installment  ($7,280)  is scheduled for September 2011.

Once the rehabilitation work has been completed in accordance with the approved plan, and it has been confirmed that there is no future risk of acid mine drainage at the site, the  MRNF  will  issue  a  certificate  stating  that  the  company  is  released  from  its obligations.    The  same  certificate  will  be  issued  if  a  third  party  agrees  to  take responsibility for rehabilitation.

In terms of community relations, Niobec mine is also complying with the Québec's Civil Code which describes how neighbours interact and how contracts are to be managed.

## ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT / STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS

Depending  on  the  nature  of  the  project,  a  detailed  environmental  and  social  impact assessment  may  be  required  in  order  to  comply  with  the  provincial  'Règlement  sur l'évaluation et l'examen des impacts sur l'environnement'. At this time, the environmental  and  social impact assessment  process  would  be  triggered  if  the production rate of a mineral processing plant is greater than 7,000 tpd or if a mine is opened and operated with a production rate greater than 7,000 tpd.  As stated above, with  the  reform,  the  threshold  for  triggering  an  EIA  process  for  metal  mine  would  be lowered at 3,000 tpd.  The cornerstone of this process is the environmental and social impact study, which is conducted by a consulting firm, based on the requirement set out by the Québec's environment department.

The environmental and social impact assessment is typically followed by public hearings conducted by the 'Bureau des audiences publiques sur l'environnement' (BAPE).  The whole  assessment,  public  hearing  and  subsequent  project  analysis  by  the  provincial government may take up to 15 months.  The cost for the EIA and the whole assessment is estimated at C$ 1M.

## BASELINE STUDIES

No baseline study was conducted at Niobec prior to 1994.  In December 1994, Niobec prepared its first  mine  closure  plan  for  the  benefit  of  the  provincial  government.    This plan contains a baseline study describing the environmental conditions, the surrounding community, and the existing infrastructures.

## RISK ASSESSMENT

A  formal  risk  assessment  for  the  Project  will  be  conducted  through  three  distinct processes:

- · The  environmental  and  social  impact  assessment  required  for  the  permitting process;
- · The IAMGOLD risk assessment process;
- · The IAMGOLD Safety in Design study.

All  likely  health,  safety,  environmental  and  community  risks  and  impacts  and  risk management programs would be identified during the course of those processes.

The main foreseeable risks and impacts associated with the Project are briefly described in the following paragraphs.

## HEALTH AND SAFETY RISK ASSESSMENT

The  health  and  safety  risk  assessment  will  be  conducted  through  the  IAMGOLD  risk assessment process and the Safety in Design study.

## ENVIRONMENTAL AND COMMUNITY RISK ASSESSMENT

The environmental and community (social) risk assessment will be conducted through the  environmental  and  social  impact  assessment  required  by  the  provincial  permitting process and obviously through the IAMGOLD risk assessment process.

## POTENTIAL HEALTH, SAFETY, ENVIRONMENTAL AND COMMUNITY IMPACTS

A preliminary risk assessment cession was held with the Niobec Staff in order to identify the major health, safety, environmental and community impacts.  For the PEA purposes, the main foreseeable risks and impacts associated with the Project have been identified and are briefly described in the following paragraphs.

Increased  health  and  safety  risks  will  be  associated  with  infrastructure  construction activities  as  well  as  infrastructure  demolition  activities.  Some  areas  of  the  processing plant  may  exceed  the  radioactivity  regulation  and  require  a  particular  dismantling  and disposition  plan.  Opening  new  surface  excavations  may  lead  to  a  release  of  radon.

These risks will be mitigated by the existing health and safety management programs.

The  OP  scenario  (1,140  tph)  would  trigger  the  provincial  environmental  and  social impact assessment and public hearing process as the final daily production rate would be much higher than the 7,000 tpd threshold.

Due  to  the  open  pit  foot  print,  the  existing  surface  infrastructure  would  have  to  be demolished.  This scenario could be considered a partial existing mine closure thereby partially activating the Asset Retirement Obligation (ARO) plan.

As  new  tailings  storage  facility  (approximately  400  Mt  capacity)  is  required,  very significant land purchase is necessary.  Assuming a design similar to tailings pond No. 2 with decantation of water to a collecting/polishing pond, the new tailings pond will have a

<!-- image -->

surface area 6.5 km² and roughly be 43 m high (Figure 18-7). All lands required for this new impoundment have been estimated at a flat rate and assumed no impediments in acquiring  the  land.    Construction  of  the  tailings  pond  will  borrow  from  methods  of construction and operation based on the existing No. 1 and No. 2 tailings ponds which have proved effective. The waste rock dump also has to be expanded: a surface area of 12 km² and a height of approximately 76 m will be required to accommodate the planned material.

Depending on how the land purchase negotiation process goes, it may be required to expropriate some land owners, which is unsuitable.  The surrounding community may be concerned  with  the  expanding  mine  footprint  and  infringement  on  actual  or  potential agricultural  land.  A  good  communication  and  community  relation  plan  will  be  a  key  to success of this process.

New water supply and effluent discharge lines are required.  In order to install those new water lines, it may be necessary to expropriate few lands owners whose lots are located between Niobec and the Shipshaw River. The freshwater supply to the expanded mill and  infrastructure would  increase  significantly.  The  future  freshwater  source,  the Shipshaw River, can easily supply the required amount of water for the production.  As the mine effluent is discharged back into this river, a net positive impact is expected in terms of water balance, meaning the amount of water returned to the river will be equal or greater than the amount pumped from the river.  In order to allow efficient control of the total suspended solids load in the final effluent, additional retention basins and/or a wastewater treatment  plant  may  need  to  be  constructed.    Additional  septic  tanks  and leachate  fields  will  be  required  as  well  to  account  for  a  potential  increase  in  the discharge of domestic wastewater.  At this point in time, no change in effluent discharge point is expected.

The  hazardous  materials  and  reagents  consumption  is  expected  to  increase  as  the hazardous waste (i.e., waste oil, grease and lubricants, etc.) and non-hazardous waste generation  (i.e.  cardboard,  paper,  plastic,  etc.).    The  same  holds  true  for  the  energy consumption and the greenhouse gas emissions.

<!-- image -->

Increased  health  and  safety  risks  will  be  associated  with  infrastructure  construction activities as well as shaft demolition activities.  Opening new surface excavations may lead to a release of radon.  These risks will be mitigated by the existing health and safety management programs.

In order to minimize the community impact associated with material transport to the mine site  (potential  for  hazmat  spill,  noise,  dust,  etc.),  an  opportunity  exists  to  build  a  new access  road  leading  from  a  major  road  (i.e.,  boulevard  Martel  or  boulevard  Ste. Genevieve) directly to the mine site, away from residential areas.

The open pit itself and the waste rock dumps may constitute a significant environmental and community impact.  It may be a safety and/or visual issues issue as well as the open pit  and waste rock dump area would need to be secured.  A safety management plan would need to be developed to account for these new risks.

## MANAGEMENT PLANS

As  discussed  above,  the  overall  management  program  at  Niobec  is  ISO  9001:2008 certified.    The  health,  safety,  environmental  and  community  management  plans  and programs are described below.

## HEALTH, SAFETY, ENVIRONMENTAL AND COMMUNITY MANAGEMENT PLANS

Niobec's  environmental  management  program  is  ISO  14001:2004  certified.    This program  contains  numerous  policies  and  procedures  dealing  with anything  from biomedical  waste  management  to  spill  response.    The  environmental  management program is audited on a yearly basis, both internally by environmental professionals from other IAMGOLD operation and externally by certified auditors.

Niobec's water management plan is part of the overall environmental management plan. Currently,  the  freshwater  required  for  the  milling  process  is  pumped  from  an  aquifer located eight km east of the mine site.  However, about 85% of the water consumed at the mill is reclaimed from the tailings pond.  Due to water demand increase, Niobec is presently  building  a  pumping  stations  and  water  lines  to  get  its  freshwater  from  the Shipshaw  River  located  10  km  west  from  the  mine.    Once,  the  project  is  completed, Niobec  will  reduce  its  pumping  rate  in  the  aquifer  by  90%,  which  is  a  very  positive

<!-- image -->

community benefit  as  the  aquifer  is  also  used  by  two  municipalities  as  drinking  water supply.

The final effluent of the mine site is presently discharged into the Cimon creek, which runs about seven km before joining up with the Aux-Vases River.  This river reaches the Saguenay River six km further south.  The final effluent average flow rate is 8,500 m³/d and is composed of two sub-effluents, the tailings sub-effluent and the mine dewatering sub-effluent.  The tailings sub-effluent typically accounts for 80% of the final effluent flow. The water is considered non-toxic but still very hard.  It contains traces of phosphorous, which may cause occasional algae bloom (leading to an increase TSS load).  The mine water is also very hard water and typically fails the acute toxicity Daphnia magna test due to its  saline  nature.    Both  the  algae  bloom  and  toxicity  issues  will  be  resolved  in 2011  through  the  Shipshaw  River  project  and  various  TSS  control  measures  (i.e. wastewater  treatment  plant,  silt  curtains,  use  of  coagulants  and  ultrasound,  etc.).    It should be noted that once the Shipshaw River project is completed in 2011, the final effluent will be discharged into this river, thereby guaranteeing a positive water balance in this ecosystem.

Niobec' health and safety management program is composed of two distinct programs and numerous associated procedures:

- · Safety prevention program; and
- · Occupational health program.

Those programs, or parts of those programs, are audited yearly by safety professionals from other mine sites in Québec, through the Québec Mining Association audit program. Niobec is presently developing a health and safety management program, based on the OHSAS 18001 and the CSA Z1000 recognized standards.  The plan is to fully implement the health and safety management program by September 2012.

Various significant aspects of health, safety, environmental and community management programs  are  audited  internally  every  year  through  audit  protocols  set  out  by  the Canadian Mining Association towards Sustainable Mining (TSM) program.

## CLOSURE PLAN

In 1994, Niobec presented its first closure plan to the provincial government.  This plan was approved by  the  MRNF.    The  most  recent  version  of  Niobec's  closure  plan  was

<!-- image -->

approved by the MRNF in September 2009.  Also, as per IAMGOLD's policies, Niobec prepares every year an Asset Retirement Obligation (ARO) plan.  This plan describes in details how the mine site is to be reclaimed, cleaned up, secured, and revegetated once the mine closes.  In the 2010 version of the ARO plan, it was estimated that it would cost C$ 7.7 million to totally reclaim and restore the Niobec site.

## GENERAL ENVIRONMENTAL SITE AND REGIONAL CONDITIONS

## COMMUNITY

Niobec is located in the Saguenay-Lac-St-Jean region in Central Québec.  It is a highly industrial region where many aluminum smelters and associated facilities are installed. They are owned and operated by Rio Tinto Alcan.  The lumber and paper milling industry is also very present in this area. Niobec is the only active mine in the region.

The region is accessible through a deep-waterway, the Saguenay River which is linked to the St. Lawrence-Great Lakes waterways, a well developed road network, a railroad network  and  many  airports,  the  largest  one  being  located  the  Bagotville-Saguenay Airport (located at the Canadian Air Force base Bagotville).  The Saint-Honoré airport is located about eight km East of Niobec.  In 2006, more than 275,000 people lived in the Saguenay-Lac-St-Jean region.

More  precisely,  Niobec  is  located  in  the  municipality  of  Saint-Honoré  de  Chicoutimi. About  5,000  people  lives  in  this  municipality.    Niobec  is  the  largest  industry  and employer in Saint-Honoré.  Around Niobec, the population density is low with the closest house being located about 1.5 km north of the mine site.  The surrounding land is mostly used for agriculture (mostly potato, canola and blueberries) but most of the land is still natural or replanted forest.

In  general,  the  relations  between  Niobec  and  the  municipality  and  the  community  in general are excellent.  Niobec receives on average one complaint per year, due to dust generated  by  wind  erosion  on  the  tailings  storage  facilities.    Since  2010,  Niobec  is equipped with a vehicle that controls the dust using water.  In 2010, no complaint was received.

The closest aboriginal reserve, Mashteuiash, is located about 100 km west of Niobec.

## CLIMATE

The climate in the Saguenay-Lac-St-Jean region is humid temperate with mild summers. The annual average temperature in the region is  2.3 C  with  monthly  average  ranging o from -16.1 C in January to 18.1 C in July.  On average, the total precipitations are 950.8 o o mm per year, including 341.6 cm falling in form of snow.

## FLORA AND FAUNA

The  vegetation  in  the  Niobec  area  is  mostly  forest  dominated  by  coniferous  three species such as black spruce, fir tree and larch tree.  There is also some poplar tree and grey pine.  The average vegetation density ranges from 40 to 80%.  There is no known plant or tree species at risk around the Niobec area.

The fauna found in the Niobec area is typical of the Saguenay-Lac-St-Jean region.  Red fox,  rabbits,  squirrels,  black  bears,  partridges,  black  crows,  Canada  geese  and  other types of birds and mammals are found in the area.  No significant water bodies are found at  the  mine  Niobec.    However,  a  river,  the  'Rivière-aux-Vases'  is  located  about  two kilometres west of Niobec.  There is no known animal species at risk around the Niobec area.

## ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITES

There is no archaeological site identified around the Niobec mine or the area of influence of the Project

## TAXES

RPA  has  relied  on  IAMGOLD  for  guidance  on  applicable  taxes,  royalties,  and  other government levies or interests, applicable to revenue or income from the Niobec Open Pit.

## CAPITAL AND OPERATING COST ESTIMATES - OPEN PIT

## PRE-PRODUCTION CAPITAL

The mine, mill and site infrastructure costs are summarized in Table 18-3. All costs in this section are in 2011 US$.

Mine capital cost includes mining equipment fleet purchases and pre-stripping and site work related to the open pit.  The mine fleet was estimated based on OP operations of a similar  scale.  Most  equipment  costs  were  based  on  costs  published  by  InfoMine  USA Inc.  Costs  in  2009  US$  were  escalated  by  5%  to  convert  them  to  2011  US$.  Mine services cost covers haul roads construction and site work related to open pit and waste rock dump preparation (stripping of vegetation and overburden). In addition, a provision was made for the first 12 Mt of waste rock stripping at the unit mining cost per tonne. In this  particular  project,  capital  expenditures  were  also  required  under  the  underground mine cost item for work enabled by the interaction of the open pit with the existing mine, namely  a  new  ventilation  system  and  distribution  network  (existing  ventilation  raises located  into  the  pit  footprint),  an  increase  in  pumping  capacity  to  manage  additional surface water flowing through the filled open stopes eventually connected with the open pit  and the first drilling campaign of holes (contracted) to fill open stopes with crushed waste rock.  Open pit and UG mine capital costs are shown in the Table 18-4.

Ore processing capital cost was estimated by IAMGOLD based on the current process flow sheet and a scale-up of the existing mill and converter facilities. Detailed equipment lists  were  generated  for  each  area  within  the  ore  processing  cost  item.  Since  annual production rates for the block caving and the open pit options are the same, the following cost details are relevant for both scenarios.  Ore processing capital costs are shown in Table 18-5.

Indirect capital cost consists of working capital, warehouse inventory, owner's cost, mill start-up/commissioning and Engineering, Procurement, Construction Management (EPCM). Working capital is equivalent to a 2-month FeNb marketing and freight and total operating cost (detailed further in this report), while warehouse inventory was estimated to be 5% of mine, mill, crusher and converter direct capital costs. During the construction phase,  owner's  cost  represents  approximately  85%  of  a  one-year  total  General  and Administrative  (G&amp;A)  operating  cost  (detailed  further  in  this  report)  which  consists  of usual cost items such as administration, wages and salaries, office supplies, consultants cost, insurance, taxes, etc. Finally, EPCM cost varies between 15% and 20% of direct capital  cost  items  and  also  includes  construction  temporary  installations,  equipment, tools, travel and lodging, for an average of almost 13% of total direct capital cost (not considering OP mine fleet).  Indirect capital costs are shown in Table 18-9.

## SUSTAINING CAPITAL

Sustaining capital costs are subdivided into two periods. First, during the initial 4-year pre-production  period  (or  construction  phase),  from  Year  -4  to  Year  -1  (2011  to  2014 inclusively),  costs  related  to  existing  underground  mine  expansion  were  labeled  as sustaining capital.  All are quoted in 2011 US$.

Second, from Year 1 to Year 38 of the production phase (2015 to 2052 inclusively), all capital  costs  occurring  during  this  period  were  considered  as  sustaining  capital.  It consists of:

- · Mine equipment fleet replacement;
- · Crusher, mill and converter buildings maintenance and equipment replacement;
- · Relocation of a portion of existing tails, once open pit reach existing tailings pond;
- · Drilling campaigns of holes (contracted) to fill UG openings from open pit;
- · Progressive rehabilitation and mine closure.

Sustaining capital costs are shown in Table 18-10.

## OPERATING COSTS

Unit  costs  for  production  for  the  LOM  are  summarized  in  Table  18-11.  Unit  costs  are detailed for the whole Project and for the OP project only because the existing UG mine will still be producing at 2.2 Mtpa during the four-year construction phase of the Project. All costs in this section are in 2011 C$.

The unit operating cost for open pit mining was estimated based on open pit operations of  a  similar  scale.  Annual  allocations  of  C$  200,000  and  C$1,000,000  were  made

<!-- image -->

respectively  to  handle  UG  mine  rock  bolts,  cables,  steels  and  other  materials  once encountered in the open pit and for treatment of mine water and waste rock dump runoff water.

Operating  costs  have  been  derived  from  the  actual  and  historical  cost.    Adjustments were  done  taking  into  account  the  tonnage  increase,  additional  manpower  and  work schedule changes.  Most of the costs are variable and will be the same on a cost per tonne  basis  independently  of  the  scenario  throughput.  Details  of  mill  operating  costs considering open pit production only, fully provided by IAMGOLD are shown in Table 1813.

TABLE 18-13   MILL OPERATING COST DETAIL IAMGOLD Corp. - Niobec Mine

| Processing                           |   C$/t milled  8.87 |
|--------------------------------------|---------------------|
| Laboratory                           |                0.51 |
| Environment and Tailings dam raising |                0.12 |
| Total Mill                           |                9.5  |

For confidentiality reasons, the above unit costs will not be more detailed. Summarily, the  processing  unit  cost  covers  manpower  for  operation,  for  maintenance  and  for services, and also includes training, power, reagents, heating, material and services, and contractor services.

The converting cost was estimated by IAMGOLD to C$ 4.00/kg Nb or C$ 6.23/t milled, including slag hauling and disposal into the waste rock dump. As for the processing cost, the converter operating cost accounts for the same cost item and no more details will be revealed for the same reasons.

The G&amp;A unit cost was estimated by IAMGOLD and totalled C$ 12.5 M per year or C$ 1.25/t milled (basis 10 Mtpa). This is equivalent to a 40% increase compare with current annual budget of C$8.9 M. Administrational costs and site services costs comprise the G&amp;A.  Salary for administrational, engineering, geology, supervision and surface maintenance  staff  accounts  for  a  large  percentage  of  administrational  costs;  the

<!-- image -->

remaining is for office supplies, consultants, insurance and taxes. Site services include water supply, sewage treatment and waste disposal.

## MANPOWER

Manpower estimates were based on typical numbers in Canadian OP operations of a similar  scale,  and  IAMGOLD  scaled-up  manning  based  on  current  data  for  milling, converting and G&amp;A.  Most of the operating basis will be the same as the current.  The grinding circuit  will  return  to  a  single  circuit  compared  to  the  current  circuit.    The  new design with bigger equipment  will optimize the efficiency in term of operations management.  In this scenario, it was anticipated that the operation of the 10-Mtpa plant will require an equivalent of a 50% increase in manpower compared to the existing level for the mill and 80% for the converter based on niobium production.

Manpower estimates for the various administrative units are shown in Table 18-14 while representative salaries are shown in Table 18-15.

The economic analysis contained in this report is based, in part, on Inferred Resources, and  is  preliminary  in  nature.    Inferred  Resources  are  considered  too  geologically speculative  to  have  mining  and  economic  considerations  applied  to  them  and  to  be categorized as Mineral Reserves.  There is no certainty that the reserves development, production, and economic forecasts on which this preliminary economic assessment is based will be realized.

## CASH FLOW ANALYSIS

Considering  the  Project  on  a  stand-alone  basis,  the  undiscounted  pre-tax  cash  flow totals US$15.0 billion over the mine life, and simple payback occurs near the mid-point of 2016 (approximately 19 months from start of OP production).  On an after-tax basis, the undiscounted cash flow is US$9.3 billion and the payback occurs at the beginning of 2017 (approximately 26 months from start of open pit production).

The Total Cash Cost is US$16.15 per kg of niobium. The mine life capital unit cost is US$2.35 per kg, for a Total Production Cost of US$18.50 per kg of niobium.  Average niobium production during underground and open pit operations is 14.2 million kg per year.

The  pre-tax  NPV  at  an  8%  discount  rate  is  US$3.3  billion  and  the  after-tax  NPV  is US$2.0 billion, and the after-tax internal rate of return (IRR) is 47.5%.

## SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS

Project risks can be identified in both economic and non-economic terms.  Key economic risks were examined by running cash flow sensitivities:

- · Head Grade;
- · Mill Recovery;
- · Niobium Price;
- · Operating Costs;
- · Capital Costs;
- · Exchange Rate.

The after-tax NPV (8%) sensitivity over the base case has been calculated for -20% to +20% variations.  The sensitivities are shown in Figure 18-8 and Table 18-18.

## 19 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS

It is RPA's opinion that mining the Niobec deposit by open pit mining method may have considerable  potential  over  the  current  underground  method  to  extend  mine  life  and better maximize the extraction of the resource.  The Project base case scenario consists of technical and cost assumptions outlined in this report.

The Project will benefit from the expertise developed in the existing operation, including the processing and converting of niobium ore into ferroniobium over the years and the local and regional infrastructure currently used in the niobium mining/milling/converting activities at the mine site.

The  most  important  risk  elements  for  the  Project  are  the  niobium  price  and,  at  the present time, the location of waste rock dumps in areas with underlying soils capable of supporting the large tonnage of waste rock.  Fluctuations in the niobium price constitute an  uncontrollable  parameter  for  which  no  mitigation  measures  are  proposed.  Other elements  to  which  the  Project  is  economically  sensitive  are  controllable  and  will  be addressed  in  further  steps.    Waste  rock  dump  issues  should  be  investigated  as  the Project progresses.

At the PEA level, the open pit scenario is technically feasible and economically viable and  should  be  advanced  to  the  pre-feasibility  study  level.    The  economic  analysis contained in this report is based, in part, on Inferred Resources, and is preliminary in nature.  Inferred Resources are considered too geologically speculative to have mining and  economic  considerations  applied  to  them  and  to  be  categorized  as  Mineral Reserves.    There  is  no  certainty  that  the  reserves  development,  production,  and economic  forecasts  on  which  this  preliminary  economic  assessment  is  based  will  be realized.

Specific conclusions are as follows:

- · The  combined  Measured  and  Indicated  Resources  are  458.11  million  tonnes grading 0.42% Nb2O5 containing 1,927 million kg Nb2O5.  In addition, there is an Inferred  Resource  of  336.45  million  tonnes  grading  0.37%  Nb2O5  containing

<!-- image -->

1,240 million kg Nb2O5.  All these Mineral Resources are constrained by a Whittle open pit shell (6T) at a cut-off grade of 0.20% Nb2O5.

- · A second economic optimization, which was time constrained, was performed on the 6T pit shell in order to maximize the NPV at 8%.  The maximum NPV occurs at a cut-off grade of 0.33% Nb2O5.  This resulted in a total of 370.2 million tonnes of  niobium bearing material grading 0.46% Nb2O5 within a smaller pit shell, 4T (564 m deep).  The proportion of Inferred Resources in the above tonnage that may be potentially mineable via open pit is approximately 20%.
- · Ore production will be expanded from the current level of 2.2 million tonnes per year from underground to 10 million tonnes per year from OP.  The LOM of the OP scenario will be 42 years, consisting of four years of pre-production and 38 years of production. During the pre-production period, the existing underground mine  will  contribute,  at  the  current  mining  rate,  an  additional  8.8 Mt  grading 0.60% Nb2O5.    At  full  production,  ore  will  be  mined  at  a  rate  of  27,400  tpd requiring the excavation of 109,000 tpd waste on average over the Project total duration.
- · As part of the analysis of options, RPA and IAMGOLD reviewed an underground block caving scenario as an alternative to an open pit.  At this level of study and assumptions,  the  underground  scenario  is  a  viable  but  slightly  less  attractive option than the open pit scenario.
- · Project  components  and  costs  were  developed  to  a  ±  40%  level  of  accuracy. Operating  costs  were  estimated  in  2011  Canadian  dollars  while  capital  costs were mostly estimated in 2011 US dollars.
- · Capital expenditures, including 15% contingency and sustaining/ongoing investments,  are  estimated  to  be  US$1.4  billion  (excluding  the  recovery  of US$66.4 million for working capital and warehouse inventory at the end of the LOM). This amount excludes taxes, duties, and inflation.  Initial open pit related capital expenditures will amount to US$830 million; the remaining capital outlay is considered as ongoing investment that will occur during the production period or the operation of the existing underground mine (US$91 million) during the preproduction period.
- · The total mine site and ore processing operating cost, for the period ranging from 2011  to  2052  inclusively,  is  estimated  to  be  C$26.67/t  milled.  This  includes mining,  mineral  processing  and  converting,  maintenance,  administration  and human resources costs.
- · At peak, manpower  is estimated to be 743 individuals for the various administrative  units,  namely  administration,  mine,  mill,  converter,  and  surface and electrical.
- · IAMGOLD  and  RPA  developed  the  open  pit  mine  plan  based  on  a  3D  block model built by RPA.  RPA is of the opinion the resource model is conservative and has good potential to expand.  The pit shell comprises many blocks that are outside the four main zones, in the mineralized carbonatite where limited to no information is available.  A grade of zero has been assigned to those blocks.

- · There are no current Mineral Reserves estimated for the open pit mining option at  Niobec.    Mineral  Reserves  will  be  assessed  at  the  pre-feasibility  stage  of study.
- · Open pit mining will be carried out along 564 vertical metres.  For the pit size, production  requirements,  and  recommended  equipment  fleet,  RPA  considers mining  of  12  m  benches  and  33  m  wide  ramps,  including  ditches  and  safety berms, to be appropriate.
- · Ore will be delivered to a gyratory crusher prior to a covered stockpile and then conveyed into the processing plant.  The flowsheet is similar to the current plant, comprising  crushing,  grinding,  desliming,  flotation  (carbonate,  pyrochlore,  and sulphide), dewatering, leaching, filtration, drying, and packaging.  Concentrate is transferred  into  the  converter  where  the  ferroniobium  (FeNb  final  product)  is produced.  The mill and the converter will be new installations to be constructed to handle the increased production and because the current buildings lie within the open pit footprint.  The existing tailings impoundment facility will be expanded to accommodate the additional tonnage.
- · Recovery rates are estimated to be 49.6% Nb2O5 at the processing plant (head grade  dependent)  and  97%  at  the  converting  stage.  FeNb  production  will  total 597 M kg over the LOM.
- · Environment mitigation measures will be implemented, with particular emphasis on the open pit and waste rock dumps.  Proper water control and treatment will be implemented in order to minimize volumes to release final effluent respecting provincial regulations.
- · The conceptual closure plan aims at returning the site in a state compatible with the environment.  Particularly, waste rock dumps and tailings pond will be subject to progressive rehabilitation and revegetation measures while the existing pit will naturally flood once operations cease.
- · An economic evaluation was carried out by means of pre-tax and after-tax cash flow  analysis  expressed  in  2011  constant  US  dollars.  An  exchange  rate  of US$1.00/C$1.05 was assumed. The average metal price forecast is US$45/kg niobium and was assumed to be constant for the duration of the Project, except for the first year of the LOM (2011) at US$40/kg Nb.
- · Sunk costs (exploration and delineation drilling, metallurgical test work, feasibility study  costs,  Environmental  Impact  Assessment,  etc.)  are  not  included  in  the Project capital cost or financial evaluation.
- · Total revenues generated by the Project are estimated to be US$27.3 billion, and operating cash flow before capital costs total US$10.1 billion.  Using a discount rate  of  8%,  the  Project  has  NPVs  of  US$3.3  billion  pre-tax  and  US$2.0  billion after-tax.
- · The  after-tax  IRR  of  the  Project  is  47.5%.  The  after-tax  cumulative  cash  flow turns positive during the third year of the Project production phase and amounts to US$9.3 billion over the LOM.  The capital payback period is 2.2 years.

- · Sensitivity  calculations  were  performed  on  the  Project  cash  flow  by  applying  a ± 20%  variance  on  head  grade,  mill  recovery,  niobium  price,  operating  costs, capital expenditures, and C$/US$ exchange rate. The sensitivity analysis shows that the Project is most sensitive to head grade, mill recovery, and niobium price, moderately sensitive to exchange rate and operating costs, and less sensitive to capital costs.

## 20 RECOMMENDATIONS

RPA makes the following recommendations:

- · Initiate the preparation of pre-feasibility studies for both the block caving and the open pit options in order to compare scenarios at a higher level of definition and accuracy, given both returned quite similar economic results.
- · Confirm the waste rock dump location.
- · Initiate geotechnical  assessments  of  underlying/surrounding  overburden  and soils at waste rock dumps, open pit, and tailings pond locations.
- · Initiate geomechanical and rock mechanics assessments for open pit wall slope angle  and  stability, and  effects  on  advancing  pit  bottom  through  existing underground openings.
- · Initiate an environmental program that will result in the preparation of a document in  support  of  permitting.  The  program  should  be  comprehensive  and  include baseline  work,  acid  base  accounting,  waste  rock  dump  stability,  tailings  pond stability,  open  pit  wall  stability,  radon  and  radiation  emission,  dust  emission, water balance and hydrology, salt contamination of water being exposed to rock in open pit and waste rock dumps and socio-economic studies.
- · Initiate negotiations with individuals and governments concerning land purchases.
- · Carry  out  further  metallurgical  testwork,  using  representative  samples.  The program  would  consist  of  completing  test  work  to  a  typical  standard  for  prefeasibility study, including:
- o Crushing  and  milling  (SAG  work  index)  to  properly  design  and  select equipment.
- o Extensive  metallurgical  testwork  to  validate  the  niobium  recovery  and concentrate quality grade, given the lower head grade anticipated and the sensitivity of final product to impurities.
- o Niobium recovery  improvement in  investigating modifications  to  reagent scheme  and  process  flowsheet,  in  considering  previous  testing  on niobium recovery from the plant tailings and by benchmarking mill results with the laboratory results.
- o Comparative  testwork  between  conventional  grinding  and  classification presently used and new grinding circuit using SAG-ball mill.
- · Carry  out  specific  hydrological/hydrogeological  studies  to  refine  dewatering needs in the underground mine during pre-production period and in the open pit mine over the LOM.
- · Carry out condemnation drilling in advance of mining in areas where waste rock dumps  and  the  tailings  storage  facility  are  expected  to  be  located  for  the operations.

- · For the resource database:
- o Remove duplicate sample numbers from the drill database and investigate zero values for Nb2O5.
- o Investigate  the  large  number  of  assays  in  the  database  without  sample numbers, if possible, by cross referencing drill logs and assay certificates.
- o Study the use of a top cut for Nb2O5 assay results and consider adoption for future resource estimations.
- o Initiate  the  insertion  of  blanks  and  independent  CRMs  into  the  sample stream  so  that  they  comprise  approximately  15%  to  20%  of  the  total determinations.    RPA  also  recommends  external  laboratory  check  on sample rejects in addition to sample pulps.
- o Investigate  the  cause  of  the  mild  bias  observed  in  pulp  duplicates assayed at a second, independent, laboratory.
- o Study the use of equal length composites for resource estimation rather than raw samples.
