## 1.  SUMMARY

On  26  May  2017,  Forrester  Metals Inc. (' Forrester ') of  Toronto,  Ontario  Canada  accepted the  proposal  of Watts,  Griffis  and  McOuat  Limited  (" WGM ")  to  prepare  a  technical  report that  is  compliant  with  Canada's  security ule  National  Instrument  43- 101  (' r NI  43-101 ')  for the Bongar√° zinc-oxide project  (the  ' Project ').    On  June  1,  2017,  Zinc  One  Resourcesnc. I (' Zinc  One ')  of Vancouver,  Canada  acquired  all  of  the  issued  and  outstanding  shares  of Forrester Metals Inc. As a result, this report has been prepared for Zinc One.

The area  of  interest  is  located  in  the Yambrasbamba District of Bongar√°  Province within the Amazonas  Department  in  north- central  Peru.   The Project  is  located  approximately  695 km north-northwest of Lima and 190 west-northwest of the nearest airport at Tarapoto (Figure 1). The Project  includes  eight  mineral  concessions  for  8,009.5 ectares  ('ha') that  comprise  the h Bongar√° Zinc Mine  Project ( ' BZMP ')  and fiv e mineral   concessions for 3,115.4  ha  that comprise the Charlotte-Bongar√° Zone Project (' CBZP ').

The Project is hosted within a substantial zinc belt that extends the entire length of Peru and hosts a great many carbonate replacement deposits of various genetic affinities.

The BZMP mineralization  was  discovered  by  Canadian  geologist William Menges in 1973. A number of companies have explored the area since that time including Explorations Co.  (1974-1984),  Canper   Resources  (1986),  Solitario  Resources   (' Solitario ') (1993-95), Cominco Ltd. (1997)), Mauricio  Hochschild  &amp;  C√≠a. (' MHC ')  (2003-2005), and C√≠a. Minera Corianta  SA (' Corianta ')  (2005-2011).   Zinc  One  commenced its exploration program in September, 2017, which started  th wi sampling of existing exploration followed by drilling in 2018.

Noranda pits

WGM first visited the Property in the mid- and late 1980s for Cominco.  During 1987, WGM made a historical  'preliminary  resource  estimate'  that was  based  on  20  test  pits  and  resulted in a historical resource of 325,000  tonnes  averaging  27.8% Zn and  1.8%  Pb. While  this estimate  was  made  by  appropriately  qualified  professionals,  it  was  completed  prior  to  the implementation of current Canadian  Institute  of  Mining,  Metallurgy  and Petroleum  (" CIM ") standards for classifying Mineral Resource estimates as required under NI 43101 and should -therefore not be relied upon for investment decisions.

Many pits have been  excavated ,  most  notably  497  hand- dug  pits  on  a  nominal  25 metr e grid by  Solitario during  1993-95.   A  subsequent  Solitario  historical  mineral  resources  estimate  in 1995 was based on the test -pits and was predicated on the use of a 7.5%  Zn+Pb cut-off grade

and a density factor of 2.15 that appears to be a 'best guesstimate' considering there is a high degree of variability in the mineralization.  There was no discussion of the impact of moisture content.

This estimate produced historical  esources r of approximately 1.64 Mt  t a 19.3%  Zn and 2.3% Pb  for  the  main  zone  of  mineralization  at  ina Grand√© and  approximately  0.27 Mt at M 19.0% Zn and 1.3% Pb in a smaller zone referred to as Mina Chica.  Like the historical WGM estimate, these resources are no t compliant with CIM standards and guidelines and cannot be relied upon. Following  this, MHC  drilled   diamond  holes   totalling 69 1,974.88 m during 2003-2005.

The CBZP  was  the  focus  of  exploration  between  2006  and  2011  by  Rio  Cristal  Resources Corp. and its predecessor (' Rio Cristal ').  Its mineral concessions covered a larger area than Zinc One's concessions today. Within that larger area, at least 773 rock, 871 soil 339 stream-sediment samples were collected, and in addition, 97 diamond  holes  lling t ota 9,141.7 m were drilled with a focus on the Cristal and Charlita prospects.   Near-surface, highgrade, zinc-oxide mineralization was encountered throughout the area, however a n NI 43-101 compliant resource estimate was never  filed.  Approximately 150,000 tonnes of zinc ore was mined  from  the Mina Grand√© Centro  and Mina Grand√© North  sectors of  the  BZMP  during 2007-08 (see Figure 1).  High-grade ore was shipped to the coast where it was treated using a Waelz  kiln to produce zinc calcine that was sold  various to smelters   and  approximately 25,000  tonnes  of  zinc  metal  was  produced.   Corianta  explored  the  area  to  the  northwest  and completed surface sampling and trenching at Camp Cielo (see Figure 1).

The most recent historical mineral resources estimated at Bongar√° are from a 2011 report by Corianta  that  cited 1.01 Mt at a grade of 21.61%n  as  'measured' Z and 'indicated' and 0.21 Mt at a grade of 21.18% Zn a 'inferred' from five zones: 1)  Mina Grand√© Sur, 2) Mina Grand√©  Centro, 3) Mina  Grand√©  Nort√©, 4) Mina  Chica,  and  5) Bongarita. Although  the resource  categories  are  not  compliant  with  CIM  definitions,  the  higher  confidence  areas  are relevant  as  they  represent  the  main  targets  for  future  exploration  and  development  work  on the Bongar√° zinc-oxide mineralization.

WGM has not completed sufficient work to verify any of these historical estimates as current resource estimates, and therefore they cannot be treated as current resource estimates or relied upon for investment decisions.

Between  September  2017  and  January  2018,  Zinc  One  collected  473  samples  from  select ed historical exploration  pits  and  from  the  surface  in  the  Bongarita,  Minahica, Mina Grand√© C Nort√©  and  Mina  Grand√©  Sur  areas  (Table  1).   Between  February  and  July  2018,  Zinc  One and

completed  264 diamond  drill  holes  totalling 7, 930.6 m  using NTW-sized  core  in the five sectors with known mineralization.

mineable

Following the surveying, test pitting and drilling programs and the receipt of the assay results from Zinc One's samples, WGM modelled the geology and estimated the  Mineral Resources. The BZMP Mineral  Resources  occur  in  five  zones  of  variable  mineralization  at have  the th potential for economic extraction of zinc from oxide -type zinc mineralization.  The minimum 10%  zinc cut-off grade was  selected in order to determinthe  amount  of  higherrading e -g mineral  resources  approaching  20%  zinc.    WGM's  sensitivity  analysis  included  additional estimates  using  cut- off  grades  of  5%  and  15%  zinc.    The  block  sizes sed  for  the  estimates u were applied with the assumption that the resources have potential bulk characteristics and have been appropriately estimated using these parameters ineral . M Resource estimates, with an effective date of  January 30, 2019, are summarised as follows in Tables 2 and 3.

The various zones on the property were divided into domains that were constrained by grade and geology.  WGM's exploratory data analysis was carried out resulting in the use of 3.0 m run-length composites on the drill hole data for each of the zones.

On the  basis  of  previous  historical  mining,  and  recent  exploration  work  by  Zinc  One  during 2017-18,  including  bulk  density  measurements  on  core  samples,  a  bulk  density  of  1.90 T/m 3 was assigned to mineralized material reported in the Mineral Resource estimates.

The Mineral  Resource  estimates  are  based  on  surface  diamond  drilling, cluding  historical in drilling  results  where  the  drill  sites  could  be  confirmed,  as  well  as  recent  surface  sampling from  excavated  pits  up  to  several metres  deep.   There  are  a  total  o   320  drill  holes  with  an f

<!-- image -->

aggregate  length  of  9,180 m  and  723  surface  sampleswith  an  aggregate  length  of  2,133 m used for the estimates.

On  the  basis  of  WGM's  exploratory  data  analysis  and  he  grade  distribution  of  zinc ssay t a data, a 40% zinc top cut  ade gr was applied to assay values before compositinghe . T difference  in  contained  metal  between  the  uncut  and  cut  grades  for  the  resource  estimates ranges from about 0.5% to 7% depending on the domain.

A  5x5x5m  block  model  was  used  for  each  zone  with  grades  interpolated  into  constrained domains using ordinary kriging.

The  cut-off  value  used  for  the  2019  resource  estimates  is  based  on  the  three  year  average metal  price  US $1.20/lb for  Zn.    There  are  no  current  metallurgical  studies  for  the  property and  WGM makes no  assumptions  with  respect  to  recovery  of  zinc  for  the  Mineral  Resource estimates.

The  following notes are important to the understanding of the aforementioned report Mineral Resources:

of

- 1. Resources  were  estimated  using  composites  within  constrained  block  models  with  block  dimensions  of 5x5x5m and using ordinary kriging grade interpolation methods.
- 2. Top cuts at a grade of 40% Zn were applied to Zn grades of assays before compositing   A cut-off grade of . 10%  Zn  was  applied  which  incorporates  3  year  average  metal  prices  and  approximates  the  cutused -off during  past  mining  operations .   Zn%  grades  can  be  converted  by  applying  a  conversion  factor  of  22.046 pounds per Zn% to obtain lbs of Zn per metric tonne;
- 3. A Bulk Density of 1.90 was applied using the geological block model density field.
- 4. Mineral Resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability .  The estimate of mineral resources may be materially affected by commodity prices, environmental, permitting, legal, title, socio-political, marketing, or other relevant issues.
- 5. The quantity  and  grade  of  estimated  Inferred  Mineral  Resources  is  uncertain  in  nature  as  there  has  been insufficient  exploration  to  define  these  resources  as  an  Indicated  or  Measured  Mineral  Resource,  and  it  is uncertain if further exploration will result in up-grading the confidence level of Inferred Resources.
- 6. The Mineral  Resources  were  estimated  using  the  Canadian  Institute  of  Mining,  Metallurgy  and  Petroleum (' CIM ')  Standards  on  Mineral  Resources  and  Reserves,  Definitions  and  Guidelines  prepared  by  the  CIM Standing Committee on Reserve Definitions and adopted by CIM Council May 10, 2014;  nd mandated in a National Instrument 43-101 (' NI 43-101 ').
- 7. Figures may not total due to rounding.

The  mineralized  trend  on  which  the  zincearing  zones  are  located  represents  an  excellent -b target  for  additional  drilling     I   WGM's  opinion,  in- fill  drilling  with  the  objective  of  up . n -grading  the  Inferred  Mineral  Resources  to  Indicated  Mineral  Resources  is  warranted Zinc . grade  variability is sufficient however,  that  not all Inferred Resources  will  be  up ed. -grad With continuing exploration drilling in the Mina Chica area, some enlargement of the deposit is  possible.    Exploration  drilling  along  the  trend  between  Mina  Chica  and  Campo  Ceilo  and

six kilometres (6  km) farther  to  the  Cristal  zinc  prospect  area  should  be  considered  in ture fu drilling programs.

WGM

With respect to  maintaining  the data available for Mineral Resource estimation, recommends  that Zinc  One  continue,  as  it  did  during  2018,   collect  detailed rock  quality to data (' RQD ') and core recovery data on a sample by sample basis.

typical

Although the measurement of specific gravity on selected drill core samples to achieve guidance on the bulk density of the mineralization has provided a useful basis for the Mineral Resources  estimates,  the  understanding  of  bulk  density  data should  be  improved  through  the systematic measuring of largerle -sca excavated and drill core samples of mineralization.    This  should  be  done  to  provide  sufficient  data  density  to  develop  a  bulk density model for the deposits.

WGM also recommends that survey control be improved by means of establishing  additional permanent monuments in each deposit area to be used for improved location of drill hole coordinates.  Zinc One will continue marking drill hole collars with permanent cement markers.

The  existing assay  database  includes  lead  and  silver  analyses,  however  many  of  the  lead assays  and  some  silver  assays  exceed  the  upper  detection  limit  for  the  analytical  technique used.  This is not the case for zinc which was re -analysed to ascertain the con tent for samples exceeding the detection limit.  This lack of data has prevented WGM from reliably estimating the  average  lead  and  silver  grades  for  the  deposits WGM  recommends  that  the  actual  lead . and  silver  content  be  determined  for  all  those  samples  affected  by  over imit  assays  to  allow -l these  metals  to  be  included  in  the  Mineral  Resources  estimates,  and  it  further  recommends that actual values be determined in the future for all over-limit lead and silver values.

Measured

The reader  is  cautioned  that  although  Mineral  Resources  must  have  reasonable  prospects  for eventual  economic  extraction,  they  are  not  Mineral  Reserves  and  do  not  have  demonstrated economic  viability .   The  quantity  and  grade  of  reported  Inferred  Mineral  Resours  in  this ce estimation are less certain in nature because the amount of exploration has been insufficient to provide the level of confidence necessary to classify them as an Indicated or Mineral  Resource.   It  is  uncertain  if  further  exploration  wi  result  in  upgrading  them  to  an ll Indicated or Measured Mineral Resource category.

produced

Zinc One  has  not carried out metallurgical testing to provide information concerning  the recovery  of  zinc  from  mineralization  at  ongar√°.   During  2007-08,  the  previous  oper ator  at B the Bongar √°  Mine produced an average of 358 tonnes of ore per day and approximately  25,000  tonnes  (55.1  million  pounds)  of  zinc  metal  using very  simple wella established processing method.  Zinc One's long-term plans are to continue its exploration of the  8  kilometre  long  mineraliz ed  trend  passing  through  Mina  Grand√©  and  Mina  Chica  and extending  6 kilom etres  to  the  north-orthwest  into  the  Cristal  area  where  previous  drilling n defined  high-grade  zinc  mineralization .   To support  this  work,  Zinc  One  has  applied  to  the Ministry  of  Energy  and  Mining  for  approval  to  drill  583  holes  from  364  platforms  along  a 1.4 kilometre  long  ridge  from  Mina Grand√© Sur  to  and  beyond  Mina  Chica.   The platforms planned  for  in- fill drilling of the known  deposits  are  laid  out  in  a  nominal  30 metr id e  gr spacing.  Those holes that explore for new mineralization are planned on a nominal 50 metr e drilling grid.   A  total 141 platforms,  each  to  be  permitted  for  two  drill  holes,  will  delineate and  infill  previous  drilling  at  Mina  Chica nd  Mina  Grand√©.   Exploration  drilling  will  be a prioritized  in  favourable  settings  within  areas  of  lowing  or  stunted vegetation  that  may -ly represent areas of zinc toxicity Currently, . Zinc One is addressing environmentand al logistical questions posed by the Ministry of Energy and Mining, which will confirm that Zinc One's proposals comply with existing regulations and allow the Ministry to grant the permit.

## 2.  INTRODUCTION

## 2.1 GENERAL

One

On  26  May  2017,  Forrester Metals  Inc.  (' FMI ')  of  Toronto,  Ontario  Canada  accepted  the proposal of Watts, Griffis and McOuat Limited (" WGM ") to prepare a technical report that is compliant  with Canada's  security rule National Instrument  101 43-(' NI  43-101 ') for the Bongar√° zinc-oxide project (the ' Project '), see Figure 1. On June 1, 2017, Zinc Resources Inc. (' Zinc One ') of Vancouver, Canada acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Forrester Metals Inc. As a result, this report has been prepared for Zinc One.

Through a  previous  engagement,  WGM  Senior Geologist  and  Vice -President,  Al  Workman, P.Geo.,  and Qualified Person ('QP')  for the Project,  sited vi the Bongar√°  Project site on 4-7 September,  2014.   Part  of  the  previous  day  was  spent in a meeting  with Mr. Charles Ushela  of  Lima,  Peru,  the  representative of C√≠a. Pilar  del Amazonas S.A., which  at  the  time controlled  the  Bongar√° concessions   consisting of 8,009.5 ha. The  adjoining Charlotte Bongar√°  concessions  were  owned  by  Inversiones  Charlotte S.A.,  whose  representative  was also Mr. Ushela.  Mr. Ushela was the main provider of technical information on the Bongar√° and surrounding areas at the time of WGM's site visit.

During  the  site  visit,   Mr. Workman  examined  the Mina Grand√© Centro and Nort√© workings (Day 1),  the Mine  Chica and  Bongarita  prospects  (Day  2) ,  and  the Mina  Grand√©  Sur  area (Day 3).   The  Mina  Grand√©  Centro  and Nort√©  workings  and Mina  Chica were  outlined  in detail  by  GPS track at the time they were xamined and check sampled by WGM .  All track e and  sample  location  (waypoint)  data  were collected  using  the  PSAD -56  datum  and  imported into Google  Earth software . All sites reported an estimated precision error of less than 3 metres.  The fourth day was spent at the drying facility near the village of Yambrasbamba in a  failed  effort  to  examine  Bongar√°  drill  core  prior  to  beginning  the  return  trip  to  Tarapoto (most  of  the  core  was  lost  and  remaining  core  was  unusable A  total  of  16  samples were . collected  of  mineralization  in  outcrop  for  multi- element  analysis  by  ICP,  quantitative  ore -grade  analysis  for  zinc,  lead  and  silver  and  a  determination  of  major  elements  (oxides)  by fusion  XRF.   Water  content  data  and  specific  gravity  determinations  were  requested  on  all samples.  The samples were delivered by WGM to the SGS laboratory in Lakefield, Ontario . WGM's observations and the results from these samples confirmed the type of mineralization present, its geological setting and the general grade of the mineralization.

During  15- 18  February,  2018,  Al  Workman  again  visited  the  project  siteccompanied  by , a Dr. Bill Williams, COO of Zinc One, for the purpose of reviewing project procedures, the use of quality assurance / quality control protocols and for collecting a small set of check samples

of typical mineralization . Most  of  the  time  on  site  was  spent  in  prolonged  question  and answer sessions on project protocols focusing on geological logging, measuring, sampling and security procedures.  WGM had the opportunity to observe the drillers activities, the attention paid  to  rpm  and  torque,  the  removal  of  core  from  the  corebe  and  generally  how  well  the -tu drillers  and  assistants  co ordinate  their  activities .    As  it  was  the  rainy  season,  the  working -conditions were far from ideal yet WGM  observed a high degree of competence professionalism  within  the  drilling  crew    WGM  noted  the  interactions  between  the  drillers . and the geologists, and was satisfied that the work was carried out in an atmosphere o f mutual co-operation.    WGM  also  observed  the eologists  logging  core and  was  able  to  confirm  the g use of a standardized legend and notational format for recording  .  datae  marking Th of intervals for analysis, cutting and sampling of drill core followed a conventional approach in accordance with industry best practices.  An unusual format was used for numbering samples, however  it was  well understood by the geologists and served the purpose entifying of id intervals without the  flagging  of consecutive samplesthat pre -numbered tags provide. d WGM's  set  of  10  duplicate  drill  core  samples  provided  assays  that  generally  confirmed  the Zinc  One's  assay  results  (see  Section  12.3  in Chapter 12 - Data  Verification in  this  report) . Overall, the WGM geologist was satisfied that the degree of care taken on the project site was appropriate, and that the Zinc One exploration program was producing accurate representative results.

and and

WGM Senior Associate  Resource Geologist,  John  Reddick,  P.Geo ,  visited  the  project  site . from  11-13  June, 2018.   Mr. Reddick visited all areas f o the project in order to better understand the physical and geological setting of the mineralization .  He was accompanied by Dr. Bill Williams of Zinc One, and the exploration team.  Mr. Reddick observed the drillers in action  to gauge the  level  of  expertise  and  care  taken  in  operating  the  drill  and  checked  the location of drill pads.  I n discussion with Zinc One personnel he reviewed sections and plans that were current at th e time, checked the logging of drill core and photographed some of the better  drill  holes for  which assay  results  had  been  received.   Core  boxes  were  weighed  to calculate in-situ  density  to  estimate  the  bulk  density  of  the  rock  over  a  defined  interval  from which the volume could be known.  This resulted in a specific gravity value of 1.9  /m , for T 3 mineralized material that matched well with the overall SG used previously   This is still not . well understood as the values for individual boxes of drill core are highly variable, a problem that WGM attributes to the occurrence of  voids and also to the presence of broken core.  The over-riding purpose of Mr. Reddick's visit was to develop an understanding of the controls on mineralization (oxidized MVT)  and  its  spatial distribution (original contacts modified by oxidation, distribution of economic metal modified by oxidation and chemical transport, contacts modified by post mineral faulting and erosion).

## 2.2 TERMS OF REFERENCE

As  a  result  of  a  binding  letter  of  intent  signed  on  27  June,  2016  subsequently  amended  and signed on 1 September, 2016, and a subsequent vending agreement dated 30 September, 2016, Vena Resources Corp. (' Vena ') acquired the right to purchase the Bongar√° Zinc Mine Project (' BZMP ) and the Charlotte ongar√° -B Zone Project (' CBZP '), both of which combined comprise the  ' Project '.   On 5 October,  2016,  Vena  formerly  changed  its  name  to  Forrester Metals  Inc. On  1  June, 2017, Zinc One  esources  Inc.  acquired R all of the issued and outstanding shares of FMI and subsequently announced that it exercised its option to acquire a 100% interest in the Project, subject to a  Net 2 % Smelter Returnpayable to the  former owners.  As shown in Figure 2, the  property comprising the Bongar√° Project is composed of two blocks of exploration concessions(1)  BZMP  comprising : eight concessions  totalling 8,009.5 ha; and, (2) CBZP comprising five concessions totalling 3,115.4 ha, for a total area of 11,125 ha (111.25 km ). 2

Zinc One filed an NI 43-101 compliant technical report prepared by WGM on 8 August, 2017 after the acquisition of FMI; this report was based on that filed by FMI on 11 October, 2016.

## 2.3 SOURCES OF INFORMATION

The major sources of information used in the preparation of this report include a large volume of  technical  reports  prepared  by  various  consultants  who  have  been  engaged  in  providing professional services to the former owners and operators of the Bongar√° project.  Some of the reports  have  been  prepared  by  geologists  and  engineers  working  directly  for  the  operators. WGM has also relied on its own experience with the Bongar√° project having been involved in some of the very earlier evaluation studies during the  id-1980s, including the first resource m estimate.  These sources of information are listed in the references chapter at the back of this report. Before  being  engaged  by  Zinc  One,  WGM  previously  visited  the  project  site  for another  client during  which  time  it  examined  the  major  zincring  zones  and -bea collected characterization  samples  for  geochemical  analysis     I n a  wider  sense,  one  of  the  WGM  co . -authors  has  also  drawn  on  extensive  global  experience  with  non lphide  zinc  deposits  in -su drawing conclusions regarding Zinc One's project.

All  monetary  sums  relating  to  zinc  prices  are  reported  in  United  States ollars (US$)  unless D stated otherwise.  A conversion rate of US$0.77 to the Canadian Dollar (C$) is effective as of the date of this report.

Measurements in this report are stated  in  the  SI  (metric)  system.    Zinc  and  lead  contents  are expressed  in  percent  (%) .   Precious  metal  contents,  notably that  for  silver, are expressed  in grams per tonne (g/t).  One tonne is equivalent to 1.10231 short tons.

The  classification of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves in Canada follows codification  established  by  the  CIM.    The CIM  system,  which  must  be  followed  in  order  to ensure  NI  43- 101  compliance,  ranks  Mineral  Resources  and  Mineral  Reserves  in  terms  of confidence  level  which  in  turn  is  a reflection  of  the  types  and  amounts  of  exploration  work completed  and certainty that the results are representative. The version con of Mineral Resources to Mineral Reserves must be based on a feasibility study containing a discussion of mineral  economics that  establishes  the  economic  viability  of  the  existing  resources  under  a specific set of conditions. These definitions, standards and guidelines can be found https://mrmr.cim.org/en/standards/canadian-mineral-resource-and-mineral-reserve-definitions/

The historical  resources  quoted  in  this  report  cannot  be  precisely  confirmed  by  the  authors, and therefore are not  in  compliance  with  CIM  Standards  and  should  not  be  relied  upon  for investment decisions.

## 2.4 RISK FACTORS

As is generally the case in the world at large, natural resources including mineral commodities are the property of the sovereign State, and the right to develop and exploit mineral deposits is conveyed  to  private  interests  via  laws  and  regulations  that  govern  permitting  and  licensing procedures and agreements . Mineral projects must therefore meet certain statutory requirements to be permitted to go into production.  This is the case in Peru.

In  recent years, the Peruvian Government  has  moved  to  improve  perceptions concerning mineral  project development  in  the  country This  follows  a  period  during . which  special interest groups encouraged not-for-profit agencies to oppose mining projects in many parts of the  country,  with  adverse  consequences  for  investment  and  employment  in  poor  rural  areas . Today,  the  Peru  Ministry  of  Mining  and  Energy,  among  others,  e  supportive  of  mineral ar exploration and mining projects and are seeking solutions to promote increased investment in the

the  Minerals  Sector .    Investors  must  also  be  conscious  of  the  need  for  a  'social  licence'  to operate,  and  thus  the  authorities  will  not  award  any  permits  without  the  petitioner  having  an active and valid agreement with the affected communities.

Zinc  One  has  been  conscientious  in  maintaining  a  dialogue  with  all  interested  parties  in  the Project  area.    At  this  time,  there  are  no  land  use  restrictions  of  which  WGM  is  aware  t tha might  restrict  the  ability  of  Zinc  One  to ccess  the  project  areas,  or  hat  might restrict  its a t ability to bring the BZMP into production.

zinc

The  economic viability of the ZMP  is B likely dependent on outlining additional mineralization to increase the resource base for the Project   Although ro ad access is assured . to the Project at this time, other factors that are relevant include:

- ¬∑ new mine infrastructure development, especially energy, to support mining;
- ¬∑ a reliable water supply; and,
- ¬∑ a decision regarding processing options and the need for beneficiation on site.

In  June 2017, Zinc One  acquired a 100% of  the MP  and  CBZP  mineral  concessions, BZ subject  to  a  2 % Net  Smelter  Return  royalty  on  production ayable  to  the  former  concession p owners.

generally

Zinc  metal  pricing  is  predominantly  established  through  major  metal  exchanges  such  as  the London  Metal  Exchange,  commonly  referred  to  as  the  ' LME '.   Like  many  metals,  the  zinc spot price quoted on the LME  has  shown  some  volatility during 2018, trading  en betwe approximately  $1.05  and  $1.64  per  pound  ($2,315  to  $3,616  per  tonne) This  information . drawn  from    the  Kitco  Website  on  29  January,  2019 ws  that  the  zinc  spot  price  most sho recently has fluctuated between 0 $1. 2 and $1.21/pound ($2,645-$2,667/tonne), (www.kitco.com ).  During the past  year,  LME  warehoused zinc  has  been  drawn  down  from approximately  220,000  tonne s to 115,300  tonne s as at  8 2 January,  201 9. Over  a 5 -year period, the current LME zinc inventory has fallen from nearly 1 million tonnes in late 2013, a remarkable decline that is continuing.  This inventory drawdown is in the face of some new -production that has  entered  the  market  and  is  partially  the  result  of  suspended  operations  at many  zinc  smelters  in  China. What  might  be  seen  as  circumstances  favouring  significantly higher zinc prices in the future is therefore balanced against shut -in production capacity and a fear of an economic slowdown and lower demand during 2019.  However, within the contxt e of a mine development timetable, the outlook for higher future zinc prices is positive.

## 4.  PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION

## 4.1 GENERAL LOCATION

north-

The BZMP, which  includes  mineralization  at  Mina Grand√© Sur, Mina Grand√© Centro, Mina Grand√©  Nort√©, Mina Chica, and Bongarita,is owned  by  Zinc One . It is situated in the Yambrasbamba  District within the Amazonas  Department  of Bongar√° Province in central Peru and is located approximately 695 km north- northwest of Lima and 190 km westnorthwest of the nearest airport at Tarapoto (see Figure 1).

The adjacent CBZP, which includes the Cristal  and Charlita Prospects, is situated on a block of concessions totalling approximately 3,115 hectares, also owned by Zinc One.  Although the CBZP  concessions  are  not central to the  ongar√°  Deposit,  they B do contain several zinc prospects that are thought to be extensions of the mineralized trend on which the main  BZMP deposit  is  situated .   It  is  WGM  opinion  that  the  technical  risk  inherent  in  any  exploration project is reduced when favourable terrane is added to the project.  Consequently, we view the Charlotte Bongar√° zinc assets as contributory.

## 4.2 PROPERTY ADMINISTRATION AND STATUS

Through a purchase agreementZinc , One has acquired the  ZMP B and CBZP mineral concessions  listed  in  Tables  5  and  6.    The ZMP  concessions  comprise  eight  concessions B totalling  approximately  8,0 009.5 ha and  the  five CBZP concessions totalling approximately 3,115.4  ha. All of these concessions are subject to a 2% NSR  to the former concession owners.

The  General Mining Law of Peru defines and regulates different categories of activities, ranging from sampling and prospecting to development, exploitation, processing (D.S.N   No. 003-1994-EM, 19941). Mining concessions are granted by Peruvian Government  using  UTM  coordinates  to  define  licensing  areas  ranging  from  100 ha to approximately 1,000 ha in size.

The Peruvian Constitution, the Civil Code and other applicable laws guarantee that the holder of  a  mining  concession  is  entitled  to  all  the  protections  available  to  all  holders  of  private property rights.   Peruvian mining concessions convey property -related rights that are distinct and  independent  from  the  ownership  of  land  on  which  they  are  located.    Surface  and  mining rights  are  distinct  from  each  other,  even  when  they  are  held  by  the  same  owner.    Thehts rig granted by a mining concession are defensible against third parties, are transferable and chargeable.  These rights may in general be the subject of any transaction or contract between two parties.

an

Mining  titles  are  irrevocable  and  perpetual  as  long  as  the  titleholder  maintains  o-date up-t payments of  the  'Derecho  Vigencia'  ( 'legal  validation' ) fees  to  the  Ministry  of  Energy  and Mines  (Ministerio  de Energia y Minas) . A  holder  must  pay  a  'vigencia', essentially annual  maintenance  fee, of  US$3/ha  (for  metallic  mineral  concessions)  for  each  concession actually acquired  or  for  a  pending  application  (petitorio)  at  the  time  of  acquisition  and  then , by 30 June of each subsequent year  to maintain the concession .  The concession holder must

<!-- image -->

sustain a minimum level of annual commercial production of greater than US$100/ha in gross sales before the end of the  6 th year of the grant of the concession; or if the concession has not been  put  into  production  within  that  period  (by  the  semester  of  the  7 1 st th year),  the  ann ual rental  increases  to US$9/ha  (a vigencia of  US$3/ha + a  US$6/ha penalty)  until such  time  as the minimum production level is met.  If by the start of the 12 th year the minimum production level  has  still  not  been  achievedthen  the  annual  rental  increases  to  US$23/ha  thereafter , (a vigencia of US$3/ha + a US$20/ha penalty).

holder

The  concession holder can be exonerated from paying the penalty if the  can demonstrate that  during  the  previous  year  it has  'invested'  an  equivalent  of  no  less  than  ten times the   penalty for the total concession . This investment, which includes explorn atio expenditures, must be documented along with the copy of the 'declaraci√≥n jurada de impuesto a la renta' (annual tax statement) and the payment  of the annual Derecho Vigencia fees .  The concession  will  terminate  if  the  annual  rental is  not  paid  for  three  years  in  total  or  for  two consecutive  years.    The  term  of  a  concession  is  indefinite  provided  it  is  properly  maintained by payment of rental fees.

The current filing and payment requirements on the Bongar√° mining and exploration licences shown in Table 5, are summarized in Table 7.  The fees owed during 2017 were paid in 2018 as Peruvian regulations allow for payments to be in arrears for 1 year, and this administrative process  is  commonplace  in  Peru.    Payments  owing  for  2018  will  be  made  during  2019  at which time the current drilling program it expected to allow Zinc One to satisfy obligations. The   Inversi√≥n Minima  represents  the  amount  of  expenditure  required  on  the concessions to meet statutory requirements.

The holder  of  a  mining  concession  is  entitled  to  all  the  protection  available  to  all  holders f o private  property  rights  under  the  Peruvian  Constitution,  the  Civil  Code,  and  otherpplicable a laws.  A Peruvian mining concession is a property-related right, distinct and independent from the ownership of land on which it is located, even when both belong to  the same person.  The rights granted by a mining concession are defensible against third  parties, are transferable and chargeable, and, in general, may be the subject of  transaction any or contract . To  be enforceable, any and all transactions and contracts pertaining to a mining concession must be entered  into  a  public  deed  and  registered  with  he  Public  Mining  Registry  (Registro  Publico t de  Mineria) .    Conversely,  the  holder  of  a  mining  concession  ust  develop  and  operate  the m concession in a progressive manner, in compliance with  applicable safety and environmental regulations and with all necessary steps to avoid  third-party damages.  The concession holder must  permit  access  to  those  mining authorities  responsible  for  assessing  that  the  concession holder is meeting all obligations.

totalling

Figure  2  shows  the  general  layut  of  the  Project  concessions  acquired  by  Zinc  One     The -o . eight acquired Bongar√° concessions totalling 8009.5 ha were part of an original 10-concession block;  the  more  southerly  concessions  numbered  9  and  10  were  not  acquired  by  Zinc  One . The adjoining Charlotte Bongar√° -block is composed of five concessions approximately  3,115.4 hectares  which  correspond  to  block  numbers  2,  3,  5,  7  and  15  ( see Table 6).

Based  on  information  provided  by  Zinc  One,  WGM's  understands  that  the  aforementioned concessions  are  in  good  standing  as  at  the  date  of  this  report.   M  examined copies  of WG various  signed and sealed documents relating to the ly  payments  of  the time required concession fees and penalties that were paid in United States Dollars as follows:

| CBZP Concessions (5)   | Fees:   | $9,346   | Penalties:   | $62,308   | 30 June, 2017   |
|------------------------|---------|----------|--------------|-----------|-----------------|
| BZMP Concessions (8)   | Fees:   | $24,029  | Penalties:   | $160,190  | 30 June, 2017   |

There  are  no  foreseeable  circumstances  that  could  result  in  the  mining  concessions  being cancelled by the Peruvian State.

On July 4, 2018,  inera M Forrester  S.A.C. was granted permission to form Unidad a Econ√≥mica Administrativa ( Administrative  Economic Unit or ' UEA '). UEAs are groups of two  or  more  mining  concessions  of  the  same  class  and  nature  which  allow  the  respective holder  to  work  only  in  one  or  some  of  the  concessions  instead  of  working  simultaneously  in all of those encompassing the UEA.  The  holder is obliged to obtain the minimum production levels corresponding to all the mining concessions comprising the UEA in those mining

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

concessions  that  are  exploited .    The  Bongar√° UEA  consists  of  seven  concessions  - Bongar√° uno,  tres,  cuatro,  cinco,  seis,  siete,  and  ocho of  the  eight  BZMP  mineral  concessions  for -penalty assessment purposes (see Table 4).  This allows credit for the total investment in any of  the  seven  concessions  to  be  applied  to  the  waiver  of  the  penalties,  which  waiver  will  be applied  if  and  only  if  the  total  amount  exceeds  approximately  10x  the  penalt for  all  seven y concessions.    The  total  penalty  assumed  and  paid  by  Zinc  One  for  the  seven  concessions  in the  UEA   was  US$171,124.    If  exploration  investments  exceed  US$1,711,235,  the  penalty would be waived for the concession penalties the following year of the investment.

## 4.3 NATURE OF ZINC ONE'S INTEREST

Through  its local wholly owned  subsidiary, Minera Forrester  .C. (' S.A Forrester  Peru '), Vena, whose named was changed to Forrester,ed sign a binding letter of intent  t tha contemplated  an option to purchase the BZMP  and CBZP  mineral  ncessions co in their entirety  from  the  private  Peruvian  companies  that  controlled  them.    On  30  September,  2016 the parties executed the option-to-purchase agreement.  This agreement granted Forrester Peru the option to purchase the mineral concessions subject to certain payments of cash and shares over a 3-year period totalling US$835,000 for the BZMP concessions and US$595,000 for the CBZP  concessions .   Under  the  terms  of  the  agreement,  the derlying  owners  retained  a un 2% net smelter royalty ('NSR') interest upon purchase.

On 1 June, 2017, Zinc One acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Forrester.  The option-to-purchase  agreement  included  a  clause  that  required  full payment  of  outstanding amounts upon a change of control.  On 27 June, 2017, Zinc One announced that it purchased a 100%  interest  in  the  subject  mineral  concessions  for  a  total  amount  of  US$1,150,000.    The BZMP and CBZP  Projects are subject to modest advance royalty payments following agreement approval and transfer of title as well as a 2% NSR on production.

## 4.4 ENVIRONMENTAL AND PERMITTING

In Peru, Environmental permits for mineral exploration programs are divided into two classes. Class I Permits allow construction and drilling for up to 20 platforms with a maximum disturbance of 10 hectares.   Class  I Permits require little more than a notif ication process for approval.  A Class II Permit provides for more than 20 drill site locations or for a disturbance area of greater than 10 hectares .  A Class II Drilling Permit requires an environmental impact declaration  ( 'DIA'), a permit  for  harvesting trees (if applicable), an  archeological  survey report (' CIRA'), a water use permit  ALA') ( ' and a Closure Plan . During 2018,  the

<!-- image -->

Government modified this permit to  now allow for the permitting of up to 40 platforms.

drilling

Permitting  requirements  for   mining  include  an  Estudio  de  Impacto  Ambiental  (IA')  that 'E describes in detail the mining plan and evaluates the impacts of the plan on environmental and social attributes of the property.  Baseline studies include air quality, surface and groundwater quality, flora and fauna surveys, archeological surveys and a study of the social conditions of the immediate property and an area of interest that includes local communities blic . Pu meetings  are  required  in  order  that  local  community  members  can  learn  abou and  comment t on the proposed operation.

On 1 March, 2017, Zinc One presented a solicitation to the Ministry of Mines and Energy to suspend  the  activities  of  Corianta  with  respect  to  the  closure  of  the  mine This  request  was . approved  for  a  period  of  one  year  on  August  18,  2017,  at  which  time ester  Peru   took Forr control of the mine closure and posted a security bond soon thereafter.  This then, along with the cooperation of the communities (see below), rendered  Forrester Peru to be the operator of the  mine. During 2018, orrester F Peru   submitted a Modified  Mine  Closure  plan, which extended the onset of such activities in 2019.  rrester Fo Peru   plans to submit another modification to the mine closure plan based on its continuing exploration identification of additional mineral resources as discussed herein with the intent of activating mining operations in the near future.

By  assuming  the  responsibilities  of  the  mine and  thus  the  mine  closure,  and  being  in  full , control of the mineral concessions,  Forrester Peru then assumed the EIA that was attached to the mine's area of influence as defined in 2007.  I fact, upon reactivation of the project and n therefore  the EIA  in  late 2018,  referred to as the AEIA,  Zinc  One d  a  permit  to  mine ha 350 tpd  at Mina Grand√© Sur,  although  various  permits  for  the  transport,  storage,  and  use  of explosives are required if blasting were to  . occur This permission was based on modification of the EIA  presented by Corianta in 2011. rthermore, Fu initial drilling by Forrester  Peru   was  permitted  under  an  Informe  T√©cnico  Susentatorio (' ITS ')  that  allowed drilling in remediated zones as well as areas with minimal vegetation w-lying and  lo vegetation in order to assess any remaining mineralization that could be potentially mined in the targeted sectors: Mina Grand√© Sur, Mina Grand√© Centro, Mina Grand√© Nort√©, Mina Chica, and Bongarita.  On December 11, 2017, the Ministry of Energy and Mines approved 124 drill platforms, each platform including three drill holes.

Currently,  Zinc  One is  applying  to  drill  583  drill  holes  from  364  platforms,  which  will  not only delineate the deposits at  Mina Grand√© Sur, Mina Grand√© Centro, Mina Grand√© Sur, and Mina Chica, but will explore various proximal areas, especially the zone between Mina and

Grand√© Nort√© and Mina Chica, as well (Figure 5).  As of the date of this report the application for drilling is being reviewed by the Ministry of Energy and Mines.

## 4.5 SOCIAL OR COMMUNITY IMPACT

Yambrasbamba is the central village among a total of 12 illages that encompass the district: v Perla Mayo, Vilcaniza, Tambillo, Shucayacu, Buenos Aires, La Esperanza, Miraflores, Santa Rosa, La Florida, San Jos√© de Yambrasbamba, and Perla de Imaza, all of which are proximal to the main highway.

On December 9, 2016, Forrester Peru signed a pre -agreement with the community that would permit  access  to  the  Project  for  certain  considerations  in  favor  of  the  community  including, but  not  limited  to  its  support  of  community  social  programs  and  the  creation  of  mployment e opportunities.

and local

other

On  July  5,  2017,  a  formal  agreement  was  signed  that  would  allow  access  to  the  Project  for five years during the exploration stage and included financial support for a planned structured reforestation project, various social programs, preferential treatment of residents for unskilled labor and prioritized consideration for skilled labor, among things.

As  a  condition  for  the  Ministry  of  Energy  and  Mines'  decision  to  suspend  the  mine  closure, Forrester Peru assumed the respons ibilities outlined in a community agreement signed by the previous  operator  in  April  2014.   his  agreement  granted  access  to  complete  the  activities T related  to  the  mine  closure .    The  agreement,  now  upheld  by  Forrester  Peru, is  valid  through 2021  and  includes  modest  quarterly  cash  payments nd maintenance  of  certain  roads  in  the a district.

## 5.  ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE AND PHYSIOGRAPHY

## 5.1 ACCESS

Terrain is the major factor controlling road access and infrastructure  development.  Access to the  Property  is  along  a  paved  highway at  runs  between  the  coastal  city  of  Chiclayo  and th Tarapoto, the  latter  being  a  major  centre  near  the  western  margin  of  the  Amazonian  jungle . Tarapoto has an airport that is serviced by daily f lights to and from Lima.  Actual driving time from Tarapoto to Yambrasbamba, a village close to the project area, is approximately 4  hours, however with fuel and lunch stops, the actual driving time is closer to 5.5 hours.  I  terms of n driving times, the centres of Rioja and Nuevo Cajamarca are near the half-way point.

Access  to  the  Bongar√°  minesite  is  provided  by  a  relatively  new  gravel  roadhere  is  no . T significant  vehicular  access  to  the  Property beyond  the  Bongar√°  mine  area.    From  this  point, access i s by foot or horse along logging trails. WGM's  conversations  with  harles Mr. C Ushela,  the  President  of  Amazonas,  confirms  that  many  trails  extend  from  the ina Grand√© M area  to  the  north  and  northwest,  eventually  connecting  with  the  Cristal  zinc  prospect  located 8 km to  the  northwest .    I n the  view  of  Mr. Ushela,  these  trails  could  easily  be  improved  to allow the use of  wheeler 4ATV's for access and the transportation of camp supplies, equipment and drill core.  Alternative access to the Cristal area may also be possible from the east  by  a  gravel  road  that  extends  northwest  along  Rio  Imaza from the town of  Esperanza to the village of Perla de Imaza east of the Cristal camp .  A small bridge of approximately 15 to 20 m would need to be constructed to cross t he Rio Imaza and gain access to the Cristal area. Alternative  temporary  crossing  techniques  might  include  the  installation  of  a  wire  rope  'rip -line' for transporting equipment and personnel across drainages.

In  the  past,  other  operators  in  the  area,  including  those  on  the  adjacent  Charlotte  Bongar√° Property to  the  east  have  staged  access  through  the  minesite  when  direct  helicopter  access  is unavailable to them.

## 5.2 CLIMATE

The elevation  at Bongar√° is  between  1,500 m and  2,200 m asl.   Below  2,000 m,  the average annual  temperature  is  between  23C  and  25¬∞C;  humidity  is  very  high     Above  2,000  m,  the ¬∞ . climate is more temperate, but strong diurnal variations are common with temperatures ranging  from  7 ¬∞C  to  29 ¬∞C.    The   average  annual  rainfall  is  approximately  1 0  cm,  most  of 0

<!-- image -->

which  falls between  November  and  April,  and  ranges  from  14.5 cm  lower  altitudes  to at 180 cm at higher elevations.

## 5.3 LOCAL RESOURCES

The towns of Chachapoyas, Jaen, Tarapoto and Pedro Ruiz are the closest major cent res and can provide all goods, services and accommodations for early stages of project development . More advanced projects  would  generally  have  to  be  serviced  from  Lima.    Local  tow, such ns as Pomacochas,  Shipasbamba  and  Yambrasbamba  may  provide  limited ources  such  as res horses  for  transportation,  fuel,  lumber  for  camp  construction,  and  fresh getables  for  the ve exploration camp kitchen.

## 5.4 INFRASTRUCTURE

Access  to  t he  Bongar√° Project  is  via  an  21 kilometre  long ,  improved  gravel  road  from  the -main  highway.    This  road  is aintained  by  Forrester   Peru. m The   exploration c amp  offers 7 bedrooms, 3 bathrooms, a kitchen, and  a meeting  room together  with  a  large  lockable  core shed with core cutting equipment.

During the late 1990s, a permanent camp was constructed by Solitario athe Cristal Prospect consisting of wooden buildings that were significantly improved during the 2008 program. This included the addition of waste atment -tre facilities, telephone and internet connectivity.

field

There  are  several  watercourses  with  year round  flow  in  the  area  of  the  roperty.   WGM's -P discussions with the original owner indicated a belief, perhaps optimistic, that the flow would be sufficient for generating sufficient electricity to support a mining operation.   However, the appropriate  hydrogeological  and  environmental  studies  would  be  required  to  determine  their suitability for process and potable needs.

Although the towns along the access highway, including Yambrasbamba have electrical service, this would only be sufficient to support  l  loca sage . u The   Olmos Hydroelectric Project located 250 km  west of the Property in the Lambayeque Region of  was Peru scheduled  for  completion  in  approximately  2020  however  the  completion  schedule  is  very uncertain  at  this  time .    The   project  is  part  of  the  3 part  Olmos  multipurpose  hydro  project, -which consists of integrated diversion and hydrogeneration projects which source water from the Huancabamba, Tabaconas and Manchara rivers.  When operational, the project will supply

<!-- image -->

100 MW  of power through the Bagua/Jaen power stations, and this will eventually upgraded to 650 MW (4,000 gigawatt-hours annually).  On completion, a high voltage power line will parallel the highway and reportedly will pass within 12 km f the Bongar√° area, but o will unlikely be completed prior to the planned development at the Project.

The nearest deep-water port facility is located at Salaverry, which is located just south of the city  of  Trujillo  or  about  670 km  by  road  southwest  of  the  Bongar√° area.    The  port  of  Eten  is located southwest near Chiclayo, approximately 465 km from the Property.

## 5.5 AGRICULTURE

the

The hills in the Bongar√° area are a combination of forest cover and cleared agricultural land . Most  of  the  agriculture  is  subsistence  farming,  mostlfor  fruit  and  vegetables  (e.gcacao, y yucca), however good quality coffee is widely grown.  attle C raising is another of principal economic activities in the area.  Informal loggers selectively remove hardwood trees throughout the area.

## 5.6 PHYSIOGRAPHY

Situated  in  the  Eastern  Cordillera  of  the  Andes,  about  240 km  nland  from  the  Pacific  coast, i the  terrain  is  mountainous  with  elevations  ranging  from  2,000 m   less  in  the  lowlands  to or more than 2,200 m along ridge tops.  The highest elevations in the immediate region are in the range of 2,500 to 2,700 m above sea level (asl).

The elevation at the BZMP is between 1,500 m and 2,200 m asl within the high jungle, or ceja de  selva , which  is  characterized  by  dense  tropical  vegetation  and  ountainous  topography . m Critical relief can exceed 500 m as the various rivers and creeks, which most likely flow along fault zones, have deeply incised the rocks forming isolated ridges whose slopes are commonly greater than 45 .  This physiography is ty pical where limestones occur; lower -relief areas are o typically comprised  of  younger  fine grained  clastic  rocks . -Despite  this terrain, all of the BZMP area is easily accessible by 4-wheel drive truck.

## 6.  HISTORY

## 6.1 EXPLORATION HISTORY

Canadian  geologist William Menges collected  samples  in  the  area  presently  known  as  ina M Grand√© in 1973 and is credited with the discovery of zinc mineralization in the area.  Noranda Explorations Co.'s work during the 1974-1984 period consisted of topographical surveys, soil and stream sediment sampling, geological mapping, pitting and trenching, geophysical surveys  and  limited  amounts  of  diamond  drilling uring  1978.   Noranda dropped  its  interest d during 1984 when the decision was made to close its exploration office in Peru.  Ownership of the Property was transferred to Maria del Pilar Sarmiento.

In  1985, Compa√±ia  Minera  Pilar del Amazonas  (' Amazonas ') was  formed  as a holding company  for  the claims and for the purpose exploring  and of developing the zinc -oxide mineralization at Mina  Grand√©. An option to purchase agreement was made  een betw Amazonas and a Canadian-based exploration company, Canper Resources, which retained the services  of  WGM  to  complete  an  independent  study  of  the  operty.   WGM's  preliminary Pr resource  estimate  in  1987   which  is  a  historical  estimate  that  is  not  compliant  with  current , CIM definitions  and  pre -dates  the  requirements  of  NI  43101, was  based  on  20  test  pits  and -resulted  in  a  resource  of  325,000  tonnes  averaging  27.8 Zn  and  1.8%  Pb.   This  estimate % provided an early indication that the area contained economically interesting mineralization.

During 1987, after additional exploration work, Canper terminated its plans for exploration at the Property due  to  a  number  of  political  events  in  Peru,  and  ole  rights  to the Property then s reverted back to Amazonas.

In 1993,  Amazonas  re -named  the  project  Bongar√°  and  an  option  on  the  Project was  secured by  a  subsidiary  of  Solitario  Resources  Corporation  ( ' Solitario ').   Between  1994  and  1996 Solitario completed exploration programs consisting of geological mapping and geochemical soil sampling in the area of Mina Grand√© and Mina Chica.

and

Solitario sub-optioned the Bongar√° Project to Cominco Ltd. (Cominco) during 1997.  Over a 3-year period Cominco completed a program of geological mapping, geochemical geophysical surveys and five diamond drill holes  alling tot 592  m  (mainly on the Cristal Project).    n  early I 1999,  Cominco  and  Solitario  relinquished  their  interest  in  the  Bongar√° claims, and the properties reverted to Amazonas.

later

Billiton  examined the Property  in 1999, however little work was completed.   2003, In Amazonas  optioned the  Bongar√°  concessions to Mauricio Hochschild &amp;  Cia which transferred the concessions to Corianta , a subsidiary of Cementos Pacasmayo .A.A. S (' Cementos ').    Corianta  mined  high -grade  zinc  oxides by  open  pit  method  at Mina Grand√© Nort√© and Centro (the Bongar√° Zinc Mine) over a period of 18 months during 2007 and 2008. The ore was trucked 540 km westward to the  Pacific coast where it was processed through a Waelz  kiln  in Pacasmayo.    The  Waelz  kiln  is  typically  used  to  fume  nn-sulphide  zinc  ores o and various types of scrap material from which zinc is electrostatically recovered as  flue dust. In this case, the kiln was used to produce  zinc calcines which were sold to smelters/refineries in  Peru  and  the  United  States     The  operation  ceased in  2008 as  a  result  of  low  zinc  prices . which prevailed in the wake of the Financial Crisis.

area

A  subsequent program executed for ementos  by C Corianta resulted in the largest single commitment for 69 diamond drill holes at Bongar√° totalling 1,974.88 m.  Corianta's work was largely focused on extending the Bongar√° mineralization in the Campo Cielo collecting 376 bedrock samples from pits and trenches over a 350 by 750   area.  Corianta's m target  was  sulphide  mineralization  at  depth,  however  no  diamond  drilling  was  completed  at Campo Cielo.

by

In late  2006, Rio  Cristal  Zinc  Corporation  was  formed  and  signed  an  option  agreement  with Pilar de Amazonas to acquire the ZP  concessions CB (not including the  ina  Grand√© M concessions).  In late 2007, the Company was listed on the TSX Venture Exchange in Toronto and  Rio  Cristal  completed  a  placement  of  shares  I n 2009,  the  name  of  the  Company  was . changed  to  Rio  Cristal  Resources  Corporation  (' Rio  Cristal ')  and  in  2010  its  shares  were listed on  the  Lima  Bolsa  de  Valores  (Lima  stock  exchange)   Between  September  2006  and . the end of 2008, Rio Cristal completed a program of geological mapping, geochemical surveys including rock chip, soil and soil gas sampling, geophysical surveys including magnetometer,  pole -dipole  induced  polarization  and  self potential,  and  forty  diamond  drill -holes  totalling  4,380.2 m concentrating  on  the  Cristal  and  Charlita  projects  of  the  Charlotte Bongar√°  Property .    The   drill  program  intersected  significant  zinc oxide  min eralization  near -surface and to depths of up to 50 m.

In support  of  a  resource  estimate  and easibility  study in  2005  (see  section  6.3),  19  samples f were initially  reviewed to develop  an  average specific  gravity value for  ina Grand√©.   After M recognizing that the 2.1 value arrived at might be influenced by the half size of the split drill -core used and that sampling bias may have occurred, 40 new pits were excavated and 55 new representative samples were collected of all rock types .  These near-surface samples included karst  (density  =  0.7  to  3.59),  gossan  (1.84  to  2.58),  dolomitic  karst  (0.97  to  2.09),  limestone karst  (2.40  to  3.53)  and  limonitic  rock  (0.71  to  3.12).    Theerage  density  value  was  1.6, av

<!-- image -->

however Kalinaj (2009) argued that the  lithology  database  was  not  and  could  not  be  entirely representative using the restricted collection methods  employed,  and  even  if the samples population was representative, the reliance of the reserves and resources on any single density value  within  a  deposit  was  inappr opriate  given  the  variations  observed  in  the  mineralization . He recommended  acquiring  specific  gravity  data  on  a  much  greater  sample  population  base, especially higher grading samples, and an overall approach using an assigned value as follows for  each  major  lithology  based  on  a  sample  population  within  which  each  sample  contains &gt;5% Zn.  [NOTE:  if values &lt;1.00 are removed, the resulting average specific gravity is 1.81, and  the  overall  average  is  1.90 T/m].    Zinc  One  and  WGM  have  no  information  concerning 3 how lithologies were  defined.    The  following list (Table 8) contains average specific  gravity values that appear  to  be  reasonable.    I WGM's  opinion,  t he  simple  weighted  average  may n over-weight the importance of karst which is not systemically mineralized, appears to be postmineralization and has a random spatial relationship with mineralization.

TABLE 8 PRELIMINARY SPECIFIC GRAVITY MEASUREMENTS FOR SELECTED ROCK TYPES

During  the  foregoing  periods,  the  adjoining  Charlotteongar√°  licences  were  also  explored -B with an initial reconnaissance program carried out at Cristal by Cementos Pacasmayo S.A A. . (2002)  which  identified  the  Charlita,  Anita,  Erika,  Marita,  Chiriaco,  Yolanda  prospects  (and possibly also the Campo Cielo prospect).  This work capitalized on earlier work by Cominco which may have included some shallow diamond drilling.

Deep drilling was carried out in the Cristal area during 2008 by Rio Cristal Zinc in a series of six holes  intended to  test  deep  geophysical  anomalies  and  geological  targets  associated  with the contact  zone  between the  Condorsinga  Formation  (' Fm.'), and  the  underlying  Chambar√° Fm., and  not  to  explore  along  strike  from  existing  mineralization  Narrow  sections  of  low . -

grade zinc mineralization were  intersected, however  in  general  deep the drilling program failed in respect to its stated goal of discovering  per de mineralization e in the  hambar√° C Fm. No explanation of the geophysical anomalies was offered he only . T interesting mineralization was found close to surface in the Condorsinga  .  confirming Fm what was already well known from the test pitting program at  Cristal.  It is evident that the distance to the top of the Chambar√° Fm. in the Cristal area is probably much greater than in the Bongar√°Camp  Cielo  area  as  the  two  are  separated  by  a  thrust  fault  with  Bongar√°  being  up -lifted relative to Cristal.

Late in 2010, Rio Cristal carried out a detailed program of geochemical bedrock sampling at Cristal  using  1.2 m  pits  and  resulting  in  704  samples.    t  this  time,  19  drill  holes  (the  CR a series) had been completed and in addition to Zn-oxide mineralization, the presence of Zn and Pb-sulphides  was  noted.    Additional  aggressive  exploration,  including  helicopterpported -su drilling, was recommended focussing on geologically linking the Florida Canyon deposit and the Cristal area.

## 6.2 MINING HISTORY

The Bongar√° deposit briefly  entered  production  during  2007- 08  when  the Project was  leased to Corianta, a subsidiary of Pacasmayo.  The mine operated successfully at an average rate of 358  tonnes/day  from  March  2007  until ugust  2008  before  circumstances  relating  to  the A international financial crisis caused the operation to cease.  During this period, high- grade ore was shipped to the coast where it was treated using a Waelz kiln to produce zinc calcine that was sold to major refineries.  Approximately 25,000 tonnes of zinc metal were produced.

The  Mina  Grand√©  deposit  at  Bongar√°  is  predominantly  composed  of  non- lphide  ( oxidesu type) zinc mineralization comprising smithsonite, hemimorphite and hydrozincite The . mineralization occurs in a number of closely  spaced bodies in a zone approximately 1,500 m in strike length and up to 400 m wide.  Mineralization extends from surface to depths of 20 to 60 metres. The   zinc oxides form  a residual cap along the crest and eastern flank  n of a anticlinal structure.

In  May 2005, Cementos  embarked on a twohase -p construction plan, comprising plant construction in Chiclayo  and  development  of  an  open  pit  on  the  Bongar√°  ect.   Plant Proj construction  was  completed  in  2007  and  the  mine  began  processingst  runs  of  oxide  ore, te reaching  full commercial  production  at  the  beginning  of  2008.    mentos  stated  that Ce the company  was  to  invest  about  US$50 m  n  the  Bongar√°  Project  to  produce  in  the  range  of i 22,000 t/a of zinc metal for at least ten years (Centura SAB, 2005a).  Ore was trucked to the

kiln in Chiclayo for processing to produce calcines that were then sold to zinc refineries.  The grade and tonnage of the ore are not known, nor is the efficiency of recovery of zinc reported. Panoramic views of the present site  are given in Plates 2, 3 and 4 which demonstrate the size and  depth  of  the  pits WGM  measured  the  circumference  of  the  two  pits  by  GPS The . . smaller  Mina  Grand√©  A  (Centro)  pit  has  an  area  of  0.42  ha  (4,220  mwhereas  the  Mina 2 ) Grand√© B (Nort√©) pit covers an area of 1.4 ha (13,980 m ). 2

Columbia

Following  18  months   of  operation,  mining  activities  ceased  due  to  low  zinc  prices.    ne Mi reconciliation tables for 2007 indicate that 46,449 tonnes of ore grading 19.3%  ere Zn  w mined  at Mina  Grand√©.    During  the  first  month  of  2008,  an  additional  750  tonnes  of  ore grading 21.9%  Zn was mined before production ceased. These production values were generated by Minconsult Exploration Services of Coldstream, British (http://www.minconsult.ca/) and were independently audited by GEOVAL (Peru).

The  mine  closure  plan  was  approved  on  1  December,  2009  d  mine  closure  was  nearly an completed  until  the   Ministry  of  Energy  and  Mines  suspended  the  activity  upon  request  by Forrester Peru.

## 6.3 HISTORICAL RESOURCES AND RESERVES

WGM's  'preliminary'  historical  resource  estimate  in  1987  was  based  on  20  test  pits  and resulted in a historical resource of 325,000 tonnes averaging 27.8% Zn and 1.8% Pb

In 1995, Solitario completed a mineral resource estimate using the data from 497 test- pits and a 7.5%  Zn+Pb  cut -off grade. A  seemingly  conservative  density  factor  of  2.15  was  used, which  appears  to  be  a  'best  guesstimate'  considering  the  high  degree  of  variability  in  the mineralization.  There is no discussion of the impact of moisture content.  Solitario estimated the resources to total approximately 1.64 Mt averaging 19.3% Zn and 2.3%  Pb for Mina Grand√© and  approximately  0 .27 Mt  averaging  19.0%  Zn  and  1.3%  Pb  for  Mina  Chica.    The resources in the Mina Grand√© A (Mina Grand√© Centro) and B (Mina Grand√© Nort√©) locations had  thicknesses  of  1.98    and  2.84  m,  respectively, m while  the  Cea  (Mina Grand√©  Sur) ar averaged 4 m in thickness.  Mina Chica was thought to be the thickest at 4.76 m.  olitario's S study included some discussion of treatment methods which seemed to focus on beneficiation (flotation) and hydrometallurgical processing.

The most  recent  (historical)  mineral  resources  estimated  at  Bongar√°  in  a  13  June  2011  letter report  by  Corianta  S.A.,  indicates  1.0 Mt t  a grade  of  21.61%  Zn.    Of  this,  approximately a 770,000  tonnes  is  reported  as  historical  'reserves',  however  neither  the  resource  or  reserve estimates are compliant with CIM standards  Like . the earlier estimates, they may indicative  of  potential,  however  t ey  are  not  being  treated  as  current  mineral  resources  or h mineral reserves and should not be relied upon for investment purposes.

Although it has not been recently worked on by Zinc One, the Cristal zinc prospect is located about  6.5  km  northwest  of  ina  Grand√©  in  a  comparable  geological  setting  During  the M . period 12- 26 September, 2011, geological consultant Miguel Zulueta completed a digital resource estimate of the Cristal Zone for Cerro la Mina    based SA ., on a 96- rill d hole (2,599 sample) information base (Zulueta, 2011). The ample s database was  reviewed  by WGM for accuracy in preparation for its previous report for Zinc One (Workman and Breede, 2017)  and  no  issues  were  identified.   enchmarking  at  2%  Zn  showed  that  a  population  of B 607 samples exceeded this threshold, averaging 9.1%  Zn over a 1.3 m interval.  Variography indicated  a  maximum projection  of  30 m from  sample  data  points.    A  1.5% zinc  cut-off  was used for block modelling using a 3x3x3 metr block e size which produced the following estimate of Mineral Resources (Table 10).  The cut-off was prefaced on a US$1,400 per tonne zinc price with no credits for lead or silver.  For comparative purposes, the resources are also shown  using  higher  cut -offs  of  3% and  4%  zinc.   It  is  important  to  note  that  this  estimate  is historical  and  insufficient  work  has  been  done  by  WGM  to  confirm  the  accuracy  of  these resources  and  whether  they  are  a  representative  expression  of  the  mineralization Certainly . the in-put (variables) used by Zulueta for Cristal differ from those which WGM has employed for estimating the current Mineral Resources on Zinc One's Bongar√° property.

WGM has not audited the foregoing historical resource estimate in any detail however we are of the opinion that reasonable care and attention to detail was taken in the overall  preparation of the estimate.  We are not certain what measures were taken, if any, to ensure that resource grades  were  not  unduly  influenced  by  high- rade  assays  (nugget  effect),  or  indeed  whether g any  form  of  assay -cutting  was  warranted .    For  this  reason  and  the  uncertainties  noted  above, WGM  is of the view that this historical resource estimate does not comply with Standards  and  should  not  be  used  as  a  guide  for  investment  purposes.    Notwithstanding  the compliance issue, WGM believes that the historica l resources are a reasonable approximation of the nature of the mineralization and that the estimate is an accurate reflection of exploration potential.  Additional exploration including drilling is certainly justified.

## 7.  GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND MINERALIZATION

## 7.1 REGIONAL GEOLOGY

The  project area is located within the car√°  Basin Pu which developed over a period approximately 30- 35 Ma  during the late Triassic to medial Jurassic  iods  in Per the zone between  the  Pacific  oceanic  plate  to  the  west  and  the Brazilian  Shield  to  the  east.    ith W incipient  collision  between  the  two  land  masses,  he basin  was  a  collecting  area  initially  for t red-bed continental sands (sandstones) and then with continuing subsidence, for deeper water sediments  in  the  form  of  muds,  silts  and  carbonates  (limestones).    The gional  geology  is re shown in Figure 3.

## 7.2 GEOLOGY OF THE BONGAR√Å AREA

The Bongar√° Property is hosted within a substantial zinc belt that extends the entire length of Peru and hosts a great many  carbonate replacement deposits including, nearby, Solitario Exploration's Florida Canyon  deposit with 12.9 Mt @ 13 % Zn-equivalent  in all resource classes  (currently  being  explored  by  Votorantim  Metais)     The  stratigraphic  sequence in  the . Bongar√° area is shown in Figure 4.  The local geology is shown in Figure 5.

Florida  Canyon,  which  is  a  more  or  less  'typical'  Mississippi  Valley ype  ('MVT')  deposit, -t occurs  within  the  Pucar√°  Basin  and  is  hosted  in  dolomitized  limestones  of  the  ambar√° Ch Formation.   It's stratigraphic setting, in the lowermost  part  of  the  car√°  stratigraphy, Pu is typical  of  such  deposits  on  a  global  basis  and  underscores  the  basic  requirements  for  such deposits:  (1) a large basin into which  metal-bearing sediments are deposited; (2) a protracted history of subsidence leading to the development of complex fault systems; (3) the evolution of metal -bearing brines as a result of compaction  and  heat flow in the deep basin; and, (4) chemically receptive host rocks  Metallogenesis . typically involves the expulsion of weakly  acidic,  metal -bearing  brines  from  deep  in  the  basin  as  a  result  of  sediment  load  and compaction.  These fluids, which are typically at the low end of the hydrothermal temperature range, typically ascend permeable faults  zones that develop during basin subsidence and base metal  sulphides  are  deposited  as  the  fluids  interact  with  the  first  permeable  and  chemically reactive rocks they encounter.  Metal sulphide deposition in some instances is attributed to the interaction  of  heated  metal -bearing  fluids  with  lower  temperature,  reduced  sulphateearing -b formational waters that trigger sulphide precipitation.

A  figure  produced  by  AMEC (Cinits,  2007) based  on  an  interpretation  by  Anglo  Peruana Terra  (2005)  shows  that  the  Bongar√°  area  is  located  in  an  area  of  intersection  between  an extensional N-trending rift (graben) and a northwest -trending structural corridor within which the basement  is  dissecte  by  block  faults. d The concept follows  similar  models  for  other basins that globally host MVT deposits.  The  actual setting may be a bit more complicated in detail,  however  the  figure  does  follow  WGM's  general  view  that  the  basement  (Maranon Complex) was rifted as part of the initial graben development.  at Th tectonic setting is extensional  (transtensional)  and  resulted  in  a  trough  with  a  general  northerly  trend.    the As basin floor subsided under the weight of accumulating sediments ( the Pucar√° Group), point to point  differences  in  the  amount  of  accumulated  sediments  produced  differential  movement, the accumulating stress being relieved by the cross -structures.  at some point, compaction and heat  resulted  in  pressure  gradients  that  drove etal-bearing  fluids  along  the  surface  of  the m Marahon  towards  the basin margins. The uids fl moved  around  impermeable  blocks  and entered permeable conduits that channeled the solutions.  Structural intersections were simply more permeable, so these have important ramifications insofar as the localization of deposits, but  deposit  formation  still  required  a  permeable  and  reactive  host  rock.    Opportune  settings , such as in the  ongar√°-Cristal B area (Figure 6) obviously included intersections  with the Chambar√° and Condorsinga Formations.

The  reality is that the geology  is much  more  complicated  when  viewed  in  detail. After formation of the Pucar√° Basin (proto-basin), the area underwent compression and this resulted in folding and reverse faulting which has greatly complicated the geological model and made more  difficult  the  predictability  of  where  favourable hambar√°  and  Condorsinga  rocks  are C located.  However, one benefit of this is that the structural complexity has created additional pathways for fluids and this is probably one of the reasons that zinc prospects are so common in the area.

The circular  features  noted  on  Anglo  Peruana  Terra's  regional  geology  map  are  interesting when viewed on Google Earth imagery .   As  compelling  as  many  of  these  features  are,  some of  them are much less visible and verge on the imaginary.  The overall circular phenomenon is unexplained.  It could be the result of doming which in itself might suggest the  presence of an intrusion, either magmatic or salt) at some depth below the surface.  However, there is no evidence of which WGM is aware of any such rock in the area.

Figure 6 illustrates the detailed geology of the Cristal Prospect showing the distribution of the upper member  of the Condorsinga Fm (pale . blue) and the mineralized middle member (orange).    The   geological  setting  is  thought  to  be  generally  comparable  with  that  of  Mina Grand√©.  High ground is found to the north and the rock formations dip down- slope 15-25¬∫ to the south.  The lowermost member of the Condorsinga Fm. is located off the figure margin to the northwest (upper-left).  The green units overlie the Condorsinga Fm.  Figure 6 also shows the location of various zinc geochemical anomalies that are related to bedrock mineralization in  this  area,  including  the  Juanita,  Gigi,  Yolanda,  Esperanza,  Nenita,  Lupita,  Marita  Kenita, Erika,  Anita,  El  Aguila,  Charlita  and  Charlita  North  prospects.    Most  of  these,  as  the  legend shows,  have  clear  indications of zinc and/or  lead mineralization  as oxides  and  sulphides . These prospects are well defined by soil geochemical anomalies as shown in Figure 7.

## 7.3 MINERALIZATION

The  original  ore  mineralogy  can  only  be  assumed  because  the  mineralization  observed  on surface is strongly oxidized and represented as:

- ¬∑ dense, redbrown, -ferruginous (hematite-goethite rich) smithsonite that pervasively replaces the limestone host rocks;
- ¬∑ white,  colloform  to  amorphous  hydrozincite  and  calamine  mineralization  that  fills late fractures in smithsonite-replacement ore;
- ¬∑ clear,  colourless  to  pale  bluemm-scale  hemimorphite  crystals  and  encrustations  that  line cavities in smithsonite-replacement ore;
- ¬∑ white  hydrozincite/calamite cemented smithsonite and goethite breccia in late structures; and

fault

- ¬∑ highly weathered, porous, light-weight smithsonite breccia mixed with hydrozincite.

This type of mineralization occurs in many  parts of the world where strongly oxidizing atmospheric  environments  have  occurred.    Many  of  these  areas  have  been  subject  to  strong up-lift  as  found  in  Peru.    Deposits  similar  to  Bongar√°  oc   in  the  Tethys  Belt  in  Greece, cur Turkey and Iran, the North American continental margin in Guatemala, on the margins of the Red  Sea  basin  in  Egypt  and  Saudi  Arabia,  in  Yemen  along  the  margin  of  the  Ramlat  as Sabatayn Graben and in the  Himalayan orogen in Bhutan.  In respect to volume, smithsonite is  the  most  important economic mineral although it may be inter related  with strong  goethite -development (as at Bongar√°).  Other secondary zinc minerals, such as hydrozincite (calamine) and hemimorphite, can be important because they commonly e  up the -grad earlier mineralization.  Only on very rare occasions are sphalerite relics preserved as remnants of the

it is

sulphide hypogene mineralization . Galena commonly occurs in most of the deposits, but volumetrically  inferior to secondary  lead  minerals  such  as  cerrusite, mimetite  and  others . Silver grades are dependent on the original silver content of the galena in the orebody.  Silver is never seen in its native form.

To date,  no  zinc  smectites  (clays)  have  been  dentified  in  the  Bongar√°  area.    These  minerals i were  found  in  the  Skorpion  deposit  where  they  proved  to  create  metallurgical  challenges, however although Skorpion is a non-sulphide zinc deposit, it is not a carbonate-hosted deposit and it has no genetic or other similarity to Bongar√°.

The individual zones within the Project area are described as follows in Table 11.

## 7.4 DISCUSSION OF METALLOGENY

Subsiding  basins,  such  as  that  which  hosts  the  Pucar√°  Group  in  Peru,  develop  in  a  dynamic manner that can  allow  profound  thickening  of  formations  in  only  a  short  distance  from  the basin margins.  This has direct implications on where best to explore for Mississippi Valley -Type deposits since favourable host rock formations may undergo significant facies variations over  short  distances.    I   general, n the  favoured  setting  for  such  mineralization  occurs  in  a permeable  limestone  member  overlying  impermeable  or  non carbonate  strata,  and  in  an  area -where  fault  structures  have  acted  as  permeable  conduits  to  allow  the  ascent  of  metal-aring be waters expelled from deep basin sources.  Generally, but not always, such deposits are found near basin margins.  Examples of oxide -type zinc deposits of which WGM is knowledgeable that are similar in setting to Bongar√° include Jabali in Yemen, Jabal Dhayran in Saudi Arabia, Tekneli  in  Turkey,  Esperanza  and  Torlon  in  Guatemala,  Accha  in  Peru  and  Mehdiabad  in Iran.

the of

A  common  theme  in  the  setting  of  all  such  deposits  is  that  most  often  the  mineralization within a district occurs within the same formation and in approximately the same stratigraphic position.    Local  factors  play  a  strong  role  in  localizing  mineralization and  within  a  mineral , district variations may occur as facies changes and structures exert influences on migration of fluids (primary and secondary permeability factors).  However, the reactivity of the country rocks, including connate and formation w aters, to mineral-bearing fluids remains the single most important factor influencing mineralization. It is somewhat surprising, therefore, that mineralization in the greater Bongar√° area occurs over a wide range stratigraphy ranging  from  the  middle  Ch bar√°  Formation  (Florida  Canyon)  to  the  upper am Chambar√° Fm. (San Jos√©), to the middle Condorsinga Formation (Mina  Grand√©, Mina Chica, Campo  Cielo  and  Cristal) . I  terms n of distance, this represents approximately50 m  of 7

| Several different types of  zinc mineralization are observed in the Mina Chica area, which are classified according to mineralogy and structure as follows: 1) hydrozincite occurs as fracture and cavity fillings, and as disseminations  in  the  dolomite  matrix  and  dolomitized  limestone;  (2)  brown  discolored  hemimorphite  and  smithsonite  with  a  lomitized  sandy-silt  texture  having  a  high  iron  content  and  a  greater  density  with  respect  to  other  mineralized  zones  (the  nes, and the degree of dolomitization is  mineralization  is  contained  in  sub rounded,  sandy  silt  textured  bodies);  and,  (3)  a  combination  of  the  first  two  he  - types,  that  is,  the  presence  of  hydrozincite,  hemimorphite   a smithsonite  nd where  the  hydrozincite  is  fractures and cavities, while the found as disseminated crystals and as massive clusters between hemimorphite and  smithsonite are scattered in the matrix of dolomitized rock.  One important feature in this zone is also the presence of remnants of Pb-sulfides (galena) in some drill holes .  No  Zn-sulfides  have  yet  been  seen  or  are  expected  due  to  the  easy  dissolution  of  sphalerite  and  the  production  of  erally  sulfuric acid solutions generated in the area under oxidizing tropical weathering conditions.  Another  feature  observed  in  this  area  is  the  presence  of  tectonic  gaps  that  in  some  cases  are  found  with  Zn  mineralization.   These  are  attributed  to  faults  that  allowed  acidic -bearing  Zn waters  to  enter  the  broken  and  permeable rocks where they reacted with the carbonate to deposit Zn-oxide and Zn-carbonate minerals. | filling  ithologies.

| The best mineralization in this area is found in the most northern part of the sector where a highly Zn-mineralized  body is located in dolomitized limestones.  These rocks have a sandy silt and clayey silt texture with abundant Fe- oxides.  The minerals observed consist mainly of hydrozincite that fills cavities and fractures, and smithsonite  which is disseminated in the rock.  Another important feature of this mineralization is the presence of hydrozincite  in fractures within fresh gray limestone.  This occurrence is mainly observed at the end of the mineralized zones or  on their margins.  Areas south of this zone are typically mantos, generally <10 metres thick,   The footwall of the mineralized zone is well defined by a sharp change to massive gray mudstone-type limestone  (micrite).  The footwall shows no indications of zinc mineralization but it does contain calcite veining as well as  patches of calcite.  This is thought to represent the product of calcium depletion in the overlying dolomitized host  rocks by acidic solutions created during the oxidation of sphalerite.                                                                                                                                                 | The host lithology in this area is mainly  the dolomitized limestone and silty clays.               | Dolomitization  of  host  rock  with  peripheral calcite |

| Mineralogy: in this zone the zinc mineralization is mostly in silty clays that are in filling possible karst cavities and  forming small zinc-bearing bodies that maintain a NW-SE direction.  The main zinc mineral in this area is  smithsonite which occurs in silt-clay bodies and hydrozincite that occurs as open space fillings in dolomitized  limestones.  This particular area is characterized by the presence of an uppermost zone of iron oxides (gossan) that  overlies the zinc mineralization as well as small iron oxide-rich bodies that are interspersed with the siltstone,  dolomitized clay and limestone.  These iron-oxide bodies generally do not contain Zn mineralization.  The presence of bodies of iron oxides (gossan) in this area is the result of the oxidation and dissolution of pyrite  that originally existed in the limestone.  The sulphuric acid generated during this process was a fundamental by- product that resulted in the dissolution of zinc sulphides, and to a lesser extent lead sulphides.  These metals were  carried short distances in solution that deposited zinc and lead-carbonate and other oxidized mineral species as a  result of the buffering effects of the host limestones which were dolomitized in the process. | The mineralization is mainly found in  silty clays and in small zones in  dolomitized limestones.   | Dolomitization                                           |

| Zinc mineralization in this area occurs in silty brown clays, as well as in strongly fractured and dolomitized  limestone with continuously mineralized sections over many metres.  The area may be unique in the presence of a  porous gray limestone that may be part of the roof of a karst cavity system containing clay-silt material with  slightly dolomitized gray limestone clasts and smithsonite mineralization as veins in fractures and as cavity  fillings.  Smithsonite also occurs as a fine grained replacement with interspersed grains of oxidized sandy-silt  textured material and rock fragments.  The main zinc-bearing section is underlain by less mineralized and  dolomitized limestone that transitions downwards into slightly dolomitized gray limestone containing calcite  veinlets and patches that show no evidence of zinc mineralization.  The main Zn mineral in this zone is smithsonite in silt-clay material and hydrozincite that occurs as fracture  fillings and replacements of the dolomitized limestone host rocks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | The mineralization is mainly found in  silty clays and intensely weathered  dolomitized limestones. | Dolomitization                                           |

stratigraphic  section,  or  nearly  the  entirety  of  the  ucar√°  Group  and  probably  in  excess  of P 25 Ma of sedimentation (Figure 8). The Aramachay Formation lacks recognized mineralization because its rocks were evidently less reactive and less permeable to the metal -bearing brines.

It  may  be  important  that  some  members  of  the  ucar√° Group,  notably  the  upper  Chambar√° P Fm. and  the  Aramachay  Fm.,  are  bituminous  as  these  hydrocarbons  have  the  potential  to generate  the  sulphur  required  for  sulphide  precipitation.    This  may  have  been  a  factor  in  the development of mineralization higher in the carbonate sequence than might normally be expected, especially at Bongar√° and Cristal.  On a global basis, many other MVT deposits are in  sequences or basins that are producers of oil and gas  e.g. Jabali) or include hydrocarbon -( bearing strata (e.g. Gays River, Nova Scotia, Canada).

Structural conduits are vital to the mineralizing process A . conceptual model for the development of the Bongar√° area is shown in Figure 8.   A similar cross section for the Cristal prospect  area  is  given  in  Figure  9.   ven  in  deep  basins  where  evidence  of  such  structures E may not  be  visible  on  surface  due  to  the  masking  effects  of  over lying or  younger  units,  the -faults that delineate horst and grabens (sub-basins) in the basement and lower basin strata play an  irreplaceable  role  in  the  mineralizing  process  such  as  at  Nanisivik  (Canada)  and  Oued Mekta (Morocco).  Fault movement in most cases was protracted beginning with initial basin development and continuing in lockstep with sedimentation and basinal subsidence . Movement on the faults that were conduits may continue long after mineralization such as at Navan (Ireland) where reactivation of pre-existing basement structures resulted in the orebody being  broken  into  several  individual  sulphide  bodies.    Many  deposits,  such  as  Jabali,  are localized  where  multiple  fault  structures  intersect  favourable  host  rocks,  in  this  case  a  reef facies limestone.

The Bongar√° area is marked by moderate folding of the stratigraphic section and strong northwesterly  striking,  basin -parallel  fault  development  (listric  faults)    These  faults  tend  to  have . great lateral continuity and control the course of many of the rivers in this area.  Taken to their logical roots, these faults mark the boundaries of impermeable blocks of basement (grabens  and  horsts)  that  were  probably  instrumental  in annelling  evolved  metal -bearing ch formational  fluids.    The   Alto  Cristal  area  is  on  such  up- lifted  block  of  Maranon  Complex e basement.    Strong  basin- normal,  north  to  northeast  faulting  is  present  in  the  Bongar√° ristal -C area.  These faults are younger than and offset the northwest -trending structures, and tend not to  have  the  same  lateral  continuity  as  those  other  faults .   With  waning  movement  over  time, many of these terminate in the rocks overlying the Condorsinga  Fm. The Bongar√° and Cristal areas  are  cut  by  many  such  faults  which  likely  provided  ample  conduits  for  mineralization. WGM  observed  several  faults  cutting  the  mine  workings  at ina  Grand√©  including  a  073 M o (ENE) fault in the centre of Mina Grand√© B (Plate 5) and a possible NW-trending mineralized fault in the colluvium area southeast of  Mina Grand√© A near the base of the slope also known as Mina Grand√© C (Plate 6).

Aside from chemical and structural traps represented by reactive limestone formations, sulphur-bearing  formational  waters  and  permeable  structures,  other  important  local  factors that  may  govern the apparent distribution of mineralization are consequences of the complex folding and  faulting patterns in the greater Bongar√°  area.    While  the  Condorsinga  is Fm. widely exposed, and all or nearly all of its stratigraphic section is revealed, several important factors  are  made  clear  in  a  detailed  geological  map  of  the  Cristal  Prospect  (Anglo  Peruana SA).    The  lowermost  member  of  the  Condorsinga  Fm  is  not  well  exposed  as  it  wedges  out . against  the  ESE -trending  South  Farallon  Fault  (ee Figure  3).    The  Chambar√°  Fm. does not s outcrop  in  the  area  although  it  presumably  underlies  the  Aramachay . Mineralization  is Fm confined to the middle member of the Condorsinga Fm . and is apparently absent in the upper member.  This stratigraphic control explains the discontinuous distribution of zinc anomalies in  pits  and  trenches  distributed  along  the  trend  of  the  Cristal  Prospect these  showings  are -located in windows (inliers) through the upper member  of the Condorsinga iven . G the shallow to moderate dips of the host rocks, it is clear that topography exerts a strong control on the distribution of geochemical anomalies and the interpretation of geochemical data must take  this  into  account  in  the  wider  area  including ina  Grand√©.   Hence,  the  apparent  NW M alignment  of  prospects  is  in  partue  to  the  combined  effects  of  topography  and  bedding d orientation.

## 8.  DEPOSIT TYPES

Although sulphide mineralization is absent in the Bongar√° area ue d to weathering and oxidation effects, zinc ead-silver -l mineralization is thought to conform to the general provisions of the Mississippi Valley -Type (' MVT ') model for stratabound, carbonate -hosted deposits.  These epigenetic deposits occur in all regio ns of the earth , and in many  areas they occur in clusters that define significant mineralized districts ogene . Hyp slphide u mineralization typically occurs in platform sequence rocks associated with extensional basins . Major MTV  districts include the Sile sia of eastern Europe,  he  Viburnum  Trend t in SE Missouri,  the  Pine  Point  area  in  Canada's  Northwest  Territories  and  the  Tri tate  area  in  the -S United  States.    According  to  the  US  Geological  Survey,  the  median  deposit  size  of  7.0 Mt grading 6% zinc, 1.9% lead, 0.23% copper and 32.5 g silver per tonne.  The main ore minerals comprising  these  deposits  are  sphalerite  and  galena,  and  they  are  associated  with  pyrite  and marcasite. Gangue minerals include dolomite and calcite, the former being intimately associated  with  the  mineralizing  process .   Calcite  may  occur  in  the  form  of  aragonite  veins . Barite may be present in some deposits although it is typically minor.

In many parts of the world, MVT deposits in whole or in part have been subject to oxidation due to the effects of oxygenated groundwaters.  This commonly occurs in areas that have been significantly  up-lifted.    For  example,  the  Jabal  Dhaylan  deposit  on  Saudi  Arabia's  Red  Sea coast has been elevated by several hundred  metres (or more) as a result of t he opening of the Red  Sea  during  the  Miocene.   plift  in  the  Bongar√°  area,  situated  near  the  margin  of  the U Pucar√° Basin in Peru, and the effects of oxidation  of the sulphide mineralization, has resulted in the destruction of all hypogene sulphides.   particular, I n the oxidation of sphalerite generated acidic solutionsthat  allowed zinc to be  ransported t and redeposited as zinc -carbonate and associated mineralization in dolomitized limestones, probably only a very short distance  from  the  original  mineralization   I n  some  cases,  the  non sulphide  mineralization . -may replace  pre- existing  sulphides  virtually  in -situ.   Galena  is  also  affected  by  the  oxidation process, and very little evidence is found of the original  -sulphide lead mineralization   at Bongar√°.

Florida  Canyon,  which  is  a  more  or  less  'typical'  M  deposit,  occurs  within  the  Pucar√° VT Basin and is hosted in dolomitized limestones of the  hambar√° Formation.  It's stratigraphic C setting, in the lowermost part of the Pucar√° stratigraphy, is typical of such deposits on a global basis  and  underscores  the  basic  requirements  for  such  deposits:    (1)  a  large  basin  into  which metal-bearing sediments  are  deposited;  (2)  deep  burial  resulting  in  Eh,  pH,  temperature  and salinity  conditions  favourable  for  metal  enrichmnt  in  interstitial  fluids,  (3)  load  compaction e leading  to  the  expulsion  of  pore  fluids;  (4)  a  protracted  history  of  subsidence  leading  to  the development of complex fault systems; and, (5) permeable and chemically reactive host rocks into which the expelled fluids infiltrated.

The deposit forming (metallogenic) process typically involves the expulsion of weakly acidic, metal-bearing  brines  from  deep  in  the  basin  as  a  result  of  sediment  load  and  compaction. These fluids,  which  are  ty pically  at  the  low  end  of  the  hydrothermal  temperature  range,  ay m ascend permeable faults zones that develop during basin subsidence and base metal sulphides are deposited as the fluids interact with the first permeable and chemically reactive rocks they encounter.   Metal  sulphide  deposition  in  some  instances  is  attributed  to  the  interaction  of heated metal -bearing fluids with lower temperature, reduced sulphatearing -b formational waters that trigger sulphide precipitation . Subsequent changes in the oxida tion state to transform the mineralization from sulphideminated -do species to non-lphide su minerals (carbonates, hydroxides, oxides and silicates) may occur if the sulphide-bearing strata are uplifted and subjected to a long period of weathering under acid-oxidizing conditions.

## 9.  EXPLORATION

During  the  period  23  September,  2017  until  30  September,  2018,  Zinc  One  carried  out  a comprehensive  exploration  program  on  its  Bongar√°  Zinc  Mine  project  in  Peru.    Thenitial i phase of work was completed at the end of January, 2018 and comprised topographic surveying,  and a  search  to  locate  and  record  the  co-ordinates f  historical  exploration  drill o hole  collars,  a  task  that  necessarily  included  reconciling  old  grid  co- inates  with  an  upord dated and more reliable GPS  tum  (WGS da 84) . This exploration program included systematically  resampling existing trenches and excavating new trenchesBongarita at followed  by  sampling  and  test  pitting rograms at Mina  Chica, Mina Grand√© Sur  and Mina p Grand√© Nort√©.  In particular, the work at Mina Chica was significant as this area had not been sampled  previously  and the  initial surface  exploration  focused in  an  area  where  WGM  had previously identified the existence of stressed vegetation cover.  High zinc and iron values in soils can result in a degree of toxicity that impedes the growth of plants and trees .  WGM had observed  this  previously  around  high-rade  prospects in  the  Cuchumatanes  zinc  belt   near g Huehuetenango, Guatemala and saw similarities in the Bongar√° area.

The pitting  and  trenching  completed  by  Zinc  One  totalled  102  excavations,  with  continuous sampling  over  distances  of  1.0 m  to  51.2 m.  Typical  pit  profiles  in  the  Bongarita  and  Mina Chica prospect areas are shown in Table 12.

The development of a surface topographic model commenced on 1 July, 2018 with the use of a  differential  GPS and Total Station instrumentation  and was completed two weeks later .   I n addition to surveying the locations of historical drill holes and test pits, this work established control points for the subsequent creation of a digital elevation model (' ') DEM for the project area by PhotoSat of Vancouver, Canada using  stereo WorldSat satellite imagery.  The DEM was synthesized with one-metre contour intervals.

## 10.  DRILLING

As stated in the foregoing section, as an integral component of its recent exploration program, Zinc One  completed  263  diamond  drill  holes , (excluding  two  abandoned  holes) , totalling 7,931 m during the  period  7  February  to  12  July,  2018.    Therilling  was  completed  in  three d target  areas: Mina  Grand√©,  Mina  Chica  and  Bongarita.    The ield  work  component  of  the f exploration program was completed when the last holes were logged and sampled 30 September, 2018.  The drilling was carried out for the purpose of confirming known areas of zinc mineralization in the three  Mina Grand√© sub-areas (Centro, Nort√© and Sur), as well as exploring  new  areas  (Mina  Chica  and  Bongarita)  that  had  not  been  previously  drilled, nd a where Zinc One's recent near-surface sampling in test pits showed strong evidence for highgrade  zinc  mineralization.    Th e  zones  were  drilled  with  HQ- sized  drill  core  on  a  nominal 35 metre  spacing  which  defined  each  deposit  in  three  of  the  cardinal  directions t  Mina . a Grand√©  Centro,  part  of  the  area  drilled  was  mined  previously  and  then  remediated  by  the previous  operator,  and  consequently  the  delineation  of  mined  mineralization  was  vital  to  the size and geometry of the remaining zinc deposit today for resource estimate and development purposes.    The   drilling  program  is  summarized  in  Table 13.   Selected  results  indicative  of some of the better intersections from the drilling programs are given in Table 14.

A  detailed  map  titled  'Drilling  and  Pit/Surface  Sampling  at  ina  Grand√©  Centro'  can  be M found on the Zinc One website at www.zincone.com.  Mina Grand√© Centro is a part of one of the  three  zones  of  high-rade,  near -surface  zinc- oxide  mineralization  along  a  1.4 kilom tre g e mineralized  trend extending  from  Mina  Gran Grand√©  de  Sur  to Mina Grand√© Nort√© that  was tested by the recent drilling program.  Currently, an application to delineate the mineralization encountered by this overall drill program as well as explore proximal areas is being revi wed e by the Ministry of Mines.

WGM agrees with Zinc One that these results are extremely encouraging and collectively they define a highly  mineralized  NW trending  zone  that  extends  to  the  aforementioned  Cristal -prospect  and  beyond.    WGM  previously  used  Google  Earth  imagery  to  identify  the  presence of  stressed  vegetation  in  the  Mina  Chica  area  which  Zinc  One  subsequently  confirmed  and used as a guide in discovering high-grade mineralization at Mina Chica.

## 11.  SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSIS AND SECURITY

The sampling  method  employed  during  the  historical  exploration  work  is  not  well  described in  the  available  literature .    From  various  photographs  and  references  WGM  understand  that the procedures were conventional in all respects.

The drill core returned from each core run is placed in a 60centimetre long, plastic core box -that has five columns  Core . recovery, rock quality designation (' RQD '), and geologic features are logged.  Each core box is photographed and then sampled with a spatula, if soil or heavily-weathered rock, or cut with a core saw.

During  the  geological  logging  process,  sections  of  drill  core  that  were  identified  as  being potentially mineralized were identified by marking the beginning and end of each sample and by  marking  a  cutting  lin e  along  the  core  axis .    I n general, sample  intervals  are  1.5  metres  in length, however sample intervals do not cross geological contacts or major changes alteration style or mineralization and therefore some samples may be greater or less than this length.   to ensure  that  the  sample  taken  was  representative  of  the  core,  t   cutting  line  was he generally positioned such  that  it  was  along  the  axial  plane  or  normal  to  any  structure  in  the core.  A pre-numbered sample tag was affixed to the core tray at the end  point of each sample. In intervals where the drill core was broken, a cutting line was drawn on only those fragments of core that were sufficiently large to justify cutting   On completion of the logging, the drill . core was sawn in half with a diamond saw.  One half of the core was returned to the core tray and retained as archival core.  The  other half was placed in a plastic sample bag together with a duplicate pre-numbered sample tag, and sealed with tape.  Sets of consecutive samples were placed in rice bags for transport to the project laboratory  analysis. for While awaiting shipment to the laboratory, the samples were stored on site in a secure locked location.

To  monitor sample preparation and analytical quality, c Zin One independently inserts certified  reference  materials  (' CRM 's)  as  quality  control  standards, as  well  as  blanks,  and duplicate  samples,  that  together  comprise at least 20%  of  the  sample  batch No . sample identification  or  source  information  (drill  hole  number  or  interval),  or  quality  control  sample identification  information  is  given  to  the  lab  The   early  project samples  were  shipped  for . preparation and analysis to the ISO 9001 certified CERTIMIN laboratory in Lima  where they were assigned lab tracking (bar code) numbers, weighed and the registration data was entered in  the  laboratory  information  management  system  (' LIMS '). For  internal  quality  control purposes, CERTIMIN  inserts its own blanks and standards as well as lab duplicates monitor its performance and instrumental accuracy and report such to its technicians and Zinc One.    The   ALS  Chemex  laboratory  in  Lima  follows  the  same  protocols  in  respect  to  bar coding and logging each sample into its LIMS.

The analysis of soil and rock samples for base metals and silver poses no technical challenges that require special preparation procedures.  Drill core of this mineralization type in a climatic zone  line  the  Bongar√°  area  typically  carries  a  substantial  water  content  which  necessitates drying  of  the  sample  in  the  laboratory.   he need  for  drying is especially  acute  for  samples T collected in trenches and from exposed bedrock.  Drying at excessively high temperatures can lead to loss of certain volatile elements, however these are of no  s  concern the from perspective of quantifying zinc, lead and silver contents  in a representative manner .  Samples sent to Certimin were dried at 100¬∞C  ¬±10¬∞C.  at the ALS Chemex laboratory, the samples are dried at a moderate temperature of 80¬∞C.

At  Certimin, the dried samples  were  placed  in the hopper  to the crusher and  reduced  to -1/4 inch (6.3 mm) . A secondary crusher was used to further reduce the sample -10# (2 mm).  The crusher plates were cleaned with compressed air between each sample and barren  quartz  wash  rock  was  used  after  every  set  of  10  samples.    After  crushing,  the  sample was  passed  through  a  Jones  sample  divider  up  to  three  times  to  reduce  the  sample  mass  and produce a minimum  200 g  sub- ample s for pulverizing. The sample was  pulve rized to a nominal 200 mesh   using a ring and puck pulverizerat  was th cleaned with a brush and compressed  air  between  each  sample.    The pulp  was  stored  in  a  prenumbered  Kraft  sample -bag according to the LIMS record and the remaining coarse (2 mm) fraction was returned to -the original sample bag as reject.

the

At the  ALS  facility,  the  samples  were  crushed  n  one  stage  to  70%  passing 2 mm.   Of  this i crusher  product,  250 g rams  was  pulverized  to  90%  passing  75  microns  (200  mesh)  using  a ring and puck pulverizer. The ulp p was placed in a standard kraft paper bag and remaining  crusher  fraction was  returned  to  the  original numbered  sample  bag  and  stored  in case it is required at some later date.

As the samples are non -sulphide, a number of analytical options are available however all of these  involve  the  selection  of  a  dissolution option that may  be aqua  regia,  or  a  3-  or  4- acid solution.    Zinc  One  has  optioned  for  a  4acid  digestion  which  is  more  robust  given  that  the -samples are acid-consuming due to high carbonate contents, and the presence of hydrofluoric acid (HF) ensures the complete dissolution of zinc-silicate (hemimorphite) mineralization.

For  routine  analysis ,  a 0.4 gram  charge of  pulp  was  digested  in  solution  of  nitric-perchlorichydrofluoric-hydrochloric digestion, and geochemically analysed using the uctively ind coupled  plasma -atomic  emission  spectroscopy  ( CP-AES)  instrumental  technique  for  zinc, I lead  and  silver   which  represent  the  elements  of  greatest  economic  interest,  plus  aluminum, antimony, arsenic, barium, beryllium, bismuth, cadmium, calcium, chromium, cobalt, copper, gallium, iron, lanthanum, magnesium, manganese, molybdenum, nickel, phosphorus, to

and potassium,  scandium,  strontium,  sulphur,  thallium,  thorium,  titanium,  tungsten,  uranium  and vanadium.    This  method  was used  to  determine  zinc  contents  up  to  a  maximum  of  20%. If zinc  values  exceed ed  20%,  then  a  0.4  to  1  gram  ample  of  the  pulp  wa s  re -analyzed  after s evaporation  of  the  initial  analyte,  redissolution  of  the  dried  sample  in  hydrochloric  acid  and analysed by ICP AES -in the usual manner, but providing an upper detection 30% zinc, 20% lead and 1500 ppm silver.  For zinc contents between 30% and 100%, a 0.4 to 1.0 gram  subsample  was  digested  in  a  4cid  solution  of  nitric,  hydrochloric,  sulphuric  and -a hydrofluoric acids and then analysed using a titration method with EDTA  solution Xylenol orange used as an indicator.

For  quality  control  purposes,  Zinc  One's  geologists  i sert  a quality  control  sample  in  every n batch  of  10  samples  such  that  10%  of  all  samples  submitted  to  the  lab  are  controls,  either  a blank, a field duplicate or a project standard.     medium-grade Zn-Pb-Ag certified  reference A material  (' CRM ') was  purchased  from  Ore  Research  &amp;  Exploration  P/L  of  Australia  for quality  control  purposes.    Rather  than  using  only  RM from  a  commercial  source  produced C using unknown source material, Zinc One followed the advice of WGM and produced its own standards from locally sourced mineralization, thus most closely representing the actual sample media being analysed .  Zinc One selected out crop material to produce standards with three distinct zinc contents, and the material was crushed and homogenized in a geochemical laboratory.  Sub-sets of each of the three standards were submitted to multiple laboratories for repetitive analysis and the results were compared in such a manner as to ascertain and assign a metal  content to  each  of  the  Zinc  One  standards    Zinc  One  also  employed  CRMs  purchased . from  Ore  Research  &amp;  Exploration  P/L  of  Australia  which  constituted  two  blanks  and  one medium-grade  Zn -Pb-Ag  standard. The blanks constituted quartz vein material (CRM  # OREAS 21e) and soil  material  (CR M # OREAS  25a),  both  of  which  contained  trace  to  very low levels  of  economic  and  indicator  elements.    The Zn-Pb-Ag  standard  had  certified  values for  various  digestion  methods  ranging  from  fusion,  a  very  robust  oxidation,  to  a  moderate aqua regia digestion. The ertified c values ranged for the aggressive cid 4 -a digestion employed by Zinc One's labs were 11.35% Zn, 5.06% Pb and 104 ppm  Ag.  Thes e standards were  than  stored  on  sitefor  future  use .   When  submitting  a  quality  control  sample  into  the sample stream, Zinc One ensured that the nature of the control sample was blind to the lab.

The ALS Chemex and Certimin laboratories employed an internal quality control system that inserted  approximately  2  standards  (CRMs),  1  blank  sample  and  two  lab  duplicate  samples into every batch of 10 project samples. ALS  Chemex  reported  the  results of eck the ch analyses in a separate document that accompanied the certificate of analysis that was reported for each batch of samples submitted by Zinc One.  Certimin reported the QA/QC results in the same  document  as  that  which  reported  the  analytical  data  to  Zi c  One.    The  precise  ratio  of n quality control samples inserted by the labs to field samples varied somewhat with the number of samples in a given batch submitted for analysis.

To maintain  an  acceptable  level  of  security  on  site,  all  core  trays  remained  pen  on  the  drill o site  only  until  they  were  inspected  by  the  drill  geologist  after  which  they  were  wired  closed and delivered daily to the core logging facility.   Zinc One's logging facility was a structure of core  racks  and  benches  surrounded  by  a  high  wifence  enclosure  that  extended  from  the re ground to the  roof .   Access  was  through  a  gate  that  was  padlocked  in  the  absence  of  project personnel.    Once  samples  were  cut  and  bagged,  they  remained  in  the  enclosure  in  containers until  such  time  as  they  were  tr cked  to  the  laboratory  for  analysis    Zinc  One  maintained  a u . regularly up-dated record of the samples to be cut, the samples cut and stored and the samples sent to the laboratory.  On arrival at the laboratory, the sample submission sheet was checked against the sample actually received and any discrepancies were reported back to Zinc One.

WGM  is  satisfied  with  Zinc  One's  choice  of  laboratories  in  that  both  Certimin  and  ALS Chemex  are  well  recognized  and  accredited  facilities  for  geochemical  analysis GM  is . W satisfied that the laboratory procedures for sample preparation and analysis conform to normal industry practices and are capable of reporting accurate results with a high level of precision, and  that  these  techniques  are  appropriate  for  the  type  of  milization  that  occurs  in  the nera Bongar√° area.  WGM is also satisfied that Zinc One's sample security provisions and chain of custody protocols are reasonable and meet industry best practices.

## 12.  DATA VERIFICATION

## 12.1 OVERVIEW

were or

During its previous visit to the Bongar√° and Bongarita sites in September, 2014, senior WGM geologist, Al Workman carried out independent sampling of the mineralization and confirmed the location of selected pits, trenches and drill sites.  The Mina Grand√© A, B and C workings, Bongarita  and  Mina  Chica Prospect s  were  examined  and  sampled  over  a  3 -day  period.    The Bongar√° A and B workings and  Mina Chica were outlined in detail by GPS track at the time they  were  sampled .   All  track  and  sample  location  (waypoint)  data  was  collected  using  the PSAD-56  datum  used  by  the  project  and  imported  into  Google  Earth  software.    sites All measured by WGM reported an estimated precision error of less than 3 metres.  Descriptions of the WGM  samples  collected  during the site visit e  provided wer in a previous WGM technical report.  A total of 16 bedrock samples were collected for mult i-element analysis by ICP, quantitative ore-grade analysis for Zn, Pb and Ag, and a determination of major elements (oxides) by fusion XRF. Water content data and specific gravity determinations requested  on  all  samples     The   samples  were  delivered  by  WGM  to  the  SGS  laboratory  in . Lakefield, Ontario   and  produced assay result that generally replicated reported values, certainly the range of zinc values .  WGM's corroboration of drill sites and other features was impeded  by  sur vey  datum  issues   relating to the use  of  the  SAD-56  datum.    TheWGM P geologist had a similar experience with a former client on a drill site in southern Peru, so the problem was not surprising and corrective action required the adoption of the WGS-84 datum.

historical

Zinc One  was fully informed of the surveying problem affecting some of the surveying  in  the  Bongar√°  area  and  took  corrective  action  immediately  by  resurveying  the terrain, test pits and trenches, and historical drill sites using the WGS-84 datum.  As originally believed  by  WGM,  Zinc  One's  recent  verification  work  confirmed  that e  co-ordinates  for th historical drill holes, pits and trenches within individual prospects or deposits had  a reasonable degree of internal (geometric) precision.   Consequently, WGM sees no reason for concern insofar as existing resource estimates are made for in dividual prospects/deposits such as Mina Grand√©, Mina Chica or elsewhere.

Unfortunately,  WGM  was  unable  to  review  mineralized  drill  core  from  any  of  the  storical hi sampling programs during its visit in 2014.  Following the suspension of the mining project as a result of the financial crisis in 2008, most of the drill core was ransacked by local villagers in the mistaken belief that it contained gold.  The core that was available to WGM was in poor condition and was not mineralized.

WGM's  subsequent  site  visits  during ebruary  2018 by  senior  geologist  Al  Workman nd F a during  September,  2018  by  resource  modelling  specialist  John  Reddick allowed  WGM  to inspect all aspects of the Zinc One exploration project including:

- ¬∑ confirming new drill hole locations in respect to their relationship with historical pits and trenches;
- ¬∑ confirming drilling specifications and techniques;
- ¬∑ confirming geological core logging and sampling practices;
- ¬∑ confirming site security and shipping / chain-of-custody practices; and,
- ¬∑ collecting a set of check samples for independent analysis.

The site visits also provided an excellent opportunity for a discussion of all technical a pects s of the project including but not limited to rock type identification and  coding, alteration patterns, styles of mineralization in the various Bongara subzones, geological models relevant to 3-imensional d modelling and resource estimation, infrastrucavailability ture and requirements and future project plans.

## 12.2 GEOLOGY

variably and

The  Bongar√°  deposit  (A  and  B  faces)  is hosted  in  a  variety of rocks  in  the Condorsinga Fm. which are generally very fine grained, grey limestones that have been dolomitized.   They  are  described  in  the  literature  as  being  micritic,  i.e thified  carbonate .  li muds  and  ooze.    The shallowly dipping (10-30 ) o o bedding  is typically  metre a o r  less in thickness.  No clear evidence was seen of fossils in the mine workings ho wever a few 1-5 cm brachiopods  were  observed  along  the  Bongar√°  access  road Some  mineralized  limestone  in . the ' Mina  Grand√©  C' area had features reminiscent of coral  .  reef o N mineralization is apparent  in  the  upper  Condorsinga  Fm. or  in  the  Aramachay  Fm. which  other  workers  have concluded is unfavourable for mineralization, however  as these rocks are limestones calcareous mudstones, and are locally carbonaceous as well as having reasonably permeability, no convincing reason is given for their lack  of mineralization.  The reason may involve the efficient stripping of metals from up-welling solution by the underlying Chambar√° or Condorsinga formations.

The  mineralization  in  MVT  deposits  is  typically  accompanied  by  a  substantial  amount  of pyrite  formation commonly making it the most abundant sulphide mineral.  The  oxidation of MVT deposits therefore releases a large amount of Fe-oxides and this iron pervasively colours the host  rocks  in  a  large volume  within  which  the  base  metal  mineralization  is  enclosed .

Bongar√°  is  no  exception  to  this  rule.    All  carbonates  in  and  around  the ina Grand√© Centro M and  Nort√©  zones are buff to yellow rown -b coloured due to the tropical weathering Fe-bearing rocks.  Mina Grand√© Nort√© is partially overlain by a goethite-rich ferricrete the age of which  is uncertain. Angular,  -scale cm fragments  of goethite are locally cemented  by hydrozincite creating a mosaic-style breccia that may be genetically related to late movement on  easterly  t rending  faults  that  cut  the  deposit  (Plate  7).    This  iron  may  be  an  anomaly  as  it was not observed at Mina Chica (also known as Bongarita), and no specific mention is made of such ferricrete mineralization elsewhere in the Bongar√°-Cristal mineral belt.

The  D Face  Bongarita), ( is on or under a small knob  northwest  Mina  Grand√©  Nort√©. of Trenches in this area are in massive grey, aphanitic limestone containing some breccia that is probably  syn- sedimentary  or  diagenetic  rather  than  tectonic.    Interestingly,  boulders  on  the road  to Mina  Chica contain  brachiopod  fossils  up  to  5 cm  n size  suggesting  shallow  water i deposition.  A weak pervasive reaction to zinc zap is seen locally in the trenches that typically indicates a zinc content of ¬±500 ppm.  Some of these rocks contain vuggy calcite veinlets that give a moderate reaction.  The local geologist reported that such rocks are typical of the lower Chambar√° Fm., however the rocks in the area are reportedly Condorsinga Fm. the Mina Chica area has been trenched in many areas and strong zinc zap reactions are noted   Some of these . rocks are thinly laminated limestones that contain hemimorphite in tight fractures.  In general,

hemimorphite was more abundant in this area that at Mina Grand√© Centro and Nort√©.  A photo of  WGM's  Mina  Chica  BON 2-1  sample  site  visited  in  2014  is  shown  in  P te  8.    Thinly -la laminated calcareous siltstone from a location 14 m to the southwest is shown in Plate 9.

Although few outcrops on the top of the Mina Chica hill exhibit significant zinc zap reactions, two  boulders  were  found  by  WGMthat did  show  strong  reactions.    Both  were  sampled and gave  values  of  42.6%  Zn  and  0.29%  Pb,  and  41.6%  Zn  and  0.10%  Pb,  respectively.    The former contained some fossil evidence on the weathered surface   The latter was a limestone . breccia.  The rocks may have originated from pits on the top of the hill that were inaccessible to WGM as a ladder was not available.

Unlike the Mina Grand√© A and B areas, bedrock exposures in the C area are present near the crest  of  the  slope,  but  become  progressively  less  identifiable  down-slope Soil  cover  is  very . thin in this area as evidenced at several shaft locations that are in solid bedrock.  However, the surface of the ground is commonly chaotic and the area has the appearance of being affected by  slope  movement.    It  is  possible  that  large  areas  of  Mina Grand√© C  are  colluvium .  Metrescale boulders are common.  The 'soil' that is present contains a high percentage of limestone and  dolostone  fragments  and  the  finer  fractions  give  a  strong  zinc ap  reaction.   Taken  as  a -z whole,  the  nature  of  the  C  zone  defies  a  single  descriptor  such  as  bedrock  or  alluvium.   is It probably both.  Various aspects of this zone are shown in Plates 10 and 11.

The  depth  to  the  Chambar√°  Formation,  which  is  considered  especially  prospective  on  the basis of the nearby Florida Canyon deposit, is an unknown in the Bongar√° area .  Stratigraphic drilling  at  Cristal  proved  the  top  of the  Chabara  to  be  at  a  depth  of  more  than  400 m  This . information, while useful, is not directly transferrable to the Bongar√° area because the Cristal and  Bongar√°  sites  are  located  in  separate  structural  blocks  separated  by  the  Chiriaco  Thrust Fault that has  moved  the  Bongar√°  Block  higher  relative  to  the  Cristal  Block.    onsequently, C the Chambar√°   Fm. outcrops northwest of Campo Cielo.   is Th is an area, essentially representing the back (apex) of the Bongar√° Anticline, along which the Chambar√° Fm. either

the

Time did not permit WGM to complete an extensive on- ite review of the geological setting s of  all  zones  during  2014   however  the  return  visits  in  2017  and  2018  did  allow  for  a  more , complete  review  of  the  mineralization  in  the  Mina  Chica,  ina  Grand√©  Centro  and  Mina M Grand√© Sur areas.  At the time of its original 2014 site visit, WGM had predicted the existence of  a  major  zone  of  mineralization  at  Mina  Chica,  and  Zinc  One's  exploration  has  confirmed this.  A good understanding of the local geology, including the differences between the thr e e zones is fundamental to understanding the metallogeny ut , b it is also vital to assessing exploration  potential.   Mineralization  is hosted  in  the  Condorsinga  Fm.,  the  highest  member of the Pucar√° Group.  Torres (2010) depicts the BB' cross-section wherein the host rocks and the  Mina  Grand√©  anticline  are  up -lifted and  eroded  exposing  the  Condorsingam. Torres F believes  that  the  mineralization  should  continue  on  the  limbs  of  the  anticline,  especially  the north-eastern limb, below the overlying Sarayaquillo Formation and that this mineralization is more likely to be primary sul phides.  Torres believes that the 'Yambrasbamba reverse fault', shown  as  the  Chiriaco  Fault  on  the  drawings  included  in  this  report,  may  have  influenced mineralization. Torres  concluded that the prospectivity of this belt is upheld by occurrence  of  multiple  zinc  occurrences  to  the  northwest  at  Campo  Cielo,  Cristal  and  Alto Cristal. Thus  far, Zinc  One  has  found  no  evidence  to  dispute  Torres'  assessment  of  the exploration potential.

A second section in the Torres report, named A -A', shows the stratigraphic sequence from the Chambar√° Fm. through the Aramachay Fm. as exposed in a 500 by 3,000 metre area along the axial  trace (core)  of  the  eroded  anticline.  orres  believes  that   Chambar√°  limestone  is  an T important host to mineralization and has potential for primary ide  mineralization. sulph Previous  grass -roots  exploration  work  by  Votorantim  in  the  Florida  area  returned  positive results confirming the presence of sulphides in the Chambar√°.

In  checking  some  of  the  historical  summary  files  relating  to  the  Bongar√°  test  pits,  WGM noted that the reported average grades reported by Corianta for a total of 130 P -series test pits were simple arithmetic averages that ignored sample  lengths.  WGM's weighted averages for the  130  sites  were  as  much  as  48% lower  to  +59% higher  than  the  original  zinc  values  and -from -50% lower to +83% higher than the original lead values .  The average WGM variance was  +1% for  zinc  and  0% for  lead    A  few examples  follow  in  Table  15.   While  the  overall .

effect of the lack of conformity of industry standards appears to be negligible insofar as global averages  are  concerned,  the  implications  of  this  error  are  more  important  as  they  relate  to someone's failure   to follow a simple industry tandard -s procedure for calculating average grades.   However, WGM checked other averages and the error  was  not  repeated    Since  that . time, Zinc One has recalculated and corrected the average grades reported.

## 12.3 WGM CHECK SAMPLING

As  mentioned  in  the  foregoing  text,  WGM's historical  check samples collected  during  2014 were  taken  from the Mina  Grand√©  pits and the Bongarita (Mina Chica) trenches were collected  in  areas  where  the  previous  work  was  obvious.    The nalytical  results  were  in  the a range  of  what  had  been  reported  earlier     Due  to  the  tropical  weathering,  WGM  did  not  find . clear indications of the exact locations of previous samples, for example, numbered aluminum tags  marking  sample  end  points.      total  of  16  samples  were  collected  by  WGM  for  multiA element analysis.  There are no technical challenges  that impact the accuracy of results when analysing  samples  from  non- ulphide  zinc  deposits  for  zinc,  lead  and  silver,  the  principal s metals  of  economic  interest     Knowing  this,  WGM  nevertheless  chose  moderately  strong . a 3-acid digestion and analysis by ICP -OES to provide quantitative ore-grade analysis for zinc, lead  and  silver  and  a  determination  of  major  elements  (oxides)  by  onventional fusion  XRF c (Table  16).   Water  content  data  and  specific  gravity  determinations  were  requested  on  all samples.  The samples were delivered by WGM to the SGS laborato ry in Lakefield, Ontario . Unfortunately,  the  laboratory  sample  preparation  crew  dried,  crushed  and  prepared  pulps  for

<!-- image -->

the samples without reading the special instructions contained on the SGS Sample Submission Form.    As  a  result,  it  was  not  possible  to  deine  meaningful  specific  gravities  for  the term samples.  Two hand specimens were subsequently submitted for specific gravity measurement however  these  do  not  represent  the complete  range  of  mineralization  present  at Bongar√° . Additionally,  the  samples  were  not  weighed  following  drying,  so  moisture  content  had  to  be back-calculated from the combined weights of the pulps and rejects.

The  WGM  check  sampling  reported  grades  that  were  predominantly,  but  not  exclusively, higher grad ing mineralization than expected although the nalytical a results were not surprising in any manner based on a visual inspection of the mineralization and the experience of  the  WGM  geologist    No  sulphide  mineralization  was  observed.    Ithe  higher  grading . n population, zinc values ranged from 31.6% to 50.3% in a rock consisting primarily hydrozincite. Lead values were generally low (&lt;1%) in keeping with the conspicuous absence of secondary lead minerals such as cerussite, mimetite or anglesite .  The highest lead value, 3.37%, occurred in a tan siltstone to silty limestone that also carried  zinc. 41.5 % Several samples with very slow zinc zap reactions  and estimated on site to contain less than , 1% zinc, gave values of 0.61% to 0.65% zinc .  Zinc mineralization was accompanied by  low

<!-- image -->

silver  values,  the  highest  being  3.05 ppm    This  result  was  not  surprising  given  the  low  lead . values with which silver is commonly associated.

Many  of  the  samples  collected  by  WGM uring  2014 were  gossanous.    Iron  contents  were d unsurprising although there was no systemic relationship between iron and zinc.  Iron content averaged 4.4% and exceeded 15% in three samples.  Expressed as Fe2O3, the highest contents were 26.4%, 34.9% d an 52.5% and these samples were generally l wel mineralized: 6.46% Zn, 31.6% and 13%, respectively.  Calcium and magnesium contents, as determined by ICP were also variable and tended to have an antipathetic relationship with zinc.  No sample with  &gt;10% Ca (15.8% CaO) or 7 % Mg  (10% MgO) contained more than  6.5% Zn .  Samples containing  high -grade  mineralization  tended  to  have  less  than  0.5% Ca  (or  CaO)  and  Mg (0.3% MgO), an important factor affecting the  onsuming acid -c character of the mineralization.    However,  one  composite  sample  of  strongly  oxidized  and  porous  rock  from outcrop and an ore stockpile carried 37.3% Zn, 0.44% Pb, 8.2% Ca and 0.8% Mg.

In reviewing the SiO2 data, WGM notes there is one area that has especially high silica values in  the  mineralization .    The   Bongarita  area,  which  is  only   a  few  hundred  metres  west  of  the Mina Grand√© Centro pits, produced SiO2 values of 24.6% to 30.9% and only one value in the 5-sample group was low at 1.6%  -  the average was 22.1% SiO2.  These high silicas are quite different  from  the  values  obtained  from Mina Grand√© Centro pits that ranged  from  0.5% to 6.4% averaging  3.0% SiO2. Mina  Grand√©  Sur  values from various test pits ranged from 1.3% to 11.8% SiO2 and averaged 5.0%.  Bongarita, seems to have slightly different geology and may contain a shallower water facies  that has more detrital silt.   Some brachiopod fossils were seen in rocks in this area which also suggests shallower water .  One mineralized sample of thinly laminated silty  imestone l (or calcareous siltstone) ran 37.7  Zn, % 1.23% Pb  and 24.6% SiO2.    The  single  sample  at Mina Grand√© Sur that  contained  11.8 % SiO2,  by  far  the highest  value  present  at  Mine  Grand√©,  was  a  7  metre chip  channel  sample  in  an  area  where WGM  recognized  reef -type  (coral)  textures, and  therefore the presence  of fine silt in carbonates would be expected.  This sample ran 43.1% Zn and 1.13% Pb.

Manganese contents, ranging from 310 ppm to 5,660 ppm (average 2,198 ppm tended ) to move counter to zinc contents and were generally lower in high-grade mineralization although the most manganiferous sample carried 37.7n. % Z Cadmium contents were extremely variable, ranging from 25.5 ppm to 4,190 ppm and averaging   ppm, 990 and no systemic relationship  with  zinc  was  apparent  although  the  sample  with  the  highest  zinc  content  also showed the highest cadmium content.

As  mentioned,  the  laboratory  pre-emptively crushed  the  samples  and  thereby  prevented  any further effort to determine the specific gravities .  The two replacement samples submitted by

<!-- image -->

WGM  from  its  group  of  hand  samples  produced  specific  gravity  values  of  1.40  and  2.38. These are certainly within the range of values previously reported for Bongar√° mineralization, however the replacement samples submitted by WGM were only two of 16 originally selected and were not representative of WGM  entire  16-ple  population. sam At  that time, WGM recommended  additional test  work  to  document  specific  gravities  for ach  of  the  major  rock e and mineralization types.

During  its  February,  2018  site  visit,  the  WGM  geologist  collected  10  samples  of  half e -cor from  the  current  drilling  program.    These  samples  were  also  analysed  by  Zinc  One sing  its u conventional  approach  of  a  robust  4- cid  'near  total'  digestion  coupled  with  an  ICPES a -O instrumental finish.  For comparative purposes, t he WGM samples were analysed at the SGS Lakefield  (Ontario)  laboratory  for  a n  initial suite  of  32-e lements  including  Zn,  Pb  and  Ag using ICP-OES instrumentation.  Sample digestion was achieved using aqua regia, a relatively moderate digestion but effective for nonlphide -su mineralization . To determine the effectiveness of this approach, the samples  were  reanalysed  for zinc using an aggressive 4-acid 'total' digestion which is comparable to the Zinc One approach   A comparison of the . WGM and Zinc One results is shown in the Table 17.

Most WGM results using the SGS laboratory in Lakefield, Ontario were higher for zinc than the  Zinc  One  results  for  the  same  samples,  but  WGM  results  were  generally  comparable  for silver and lead (with one exception each) .  The reason for this variance is unknown, however in cutting the core, hard lumps were encountered within intensely ltered, clay -a highly mineralized rock. These 'nuggets' may have introduced some randomness distribution  of  zinc  in  the  core.    If  this  is  the  case,  a  larger  sample  would  be  preferable  to  a the

smaller sample, and  homogenization  of  the crushed sample  would  be  vital to ensuring representative  result.    WGM  notes  that  the  laboratory  duplicates  produced  internally  by  Zinc One's  chosen  lab  show  a  variation  as  high  as  3 %  however  the  variance  seen  in  the  WGM -4 results are almost certainly due to noted variations in the drill core.

A comparison of the results based on WGM's comparative digestion study for zinc is shown in Table 18.  It can be seen that the use of a robust 4-cid digestion, as universally employed a by Zinc One,results in a small incremental increase  .5-7.2%)  in (0 the amount of zinc reporting to the leach solution. Theson rea for this is uncertain, however it may attributable  to  irregularities  in  the  amount  of  the  inc-silicate  hemimorphite for  which  aqua z regia provides a 'near total' digestion.

## 12.4

During its initial site visit in 2014, WGM attempted to confirm the locations of historical drill holes (Workman and Breede, 2017).  Many of these collar locations were in the area occupied at that time by the Mina Grand√© pits.  Consequently, they could not be confirmed.  A series of holes  and  several  short  shafts  on  the  hillside  southeast  of  the  pits  was  available  for  review, however  the  aforementioned  datum  issue  prevented  any  meaningful  confirmation  of  specific drill  hole  locations .   Hole  numbers  were  inscribed  in  cement  pads  or  on  drill  pipe  at some locations, however at many locations no identifier for the historical holes could be found.

In  preparation for the recent Zinc One  drilling program, c  One Zin geologists used GPS instruments and the WGS  84  datum  to  locate and measure the location of many  of historical holes.  At the same time, a topographic map with 1 metre contours was prepared for the  project area by PhotoSat (Vancouver) using Worldview 3 satellite  .  datainc  One Z established 11 surveyed benchmarks on the ground using differential GPS instruments.  These provided corrective points for the satellite surveying program  such that the s urvey  points are considered  to  be accurate  ¬±50  cm.    This  approach  to  surveying  has  en abled  the  data  from these  confirmed historical holes  to  be  incorporated  into  the  project  database  subject only to ( an  audit  of  the  analytical  data  from  such  drill  holes  samples  against  laboratory  certificates ). WGM visited  and randomly checked  some  of  the  Zinc  One drill  sites  during  its  site  visit  in February, 2018 and found the hole locations to be well marked and the specifications to agree with that reported by Zinc One.

## 12.5 AUDIT OF HISTORICAL AND CURRENT ANALYTICAL DATA

drilling

WGM completed an audit  of  the  historical  (2004 2005)  BO-series  drill  holes  that  have  been -used by Zinc One as a guide in planning and executing portions of its current program.  In addition to having original analytical certificates from the project lab, WGM also acquired photographic records for these holes.  I n total the zinc values in the project database were audited for 611 samples or 34% of the original 1,779 samples from BO series holes.   f O the  15  certificates  checked,  only  7  samples  were  found  to  have  errors  in  the orted  zinc rep content (1% error rate) .  Five of these errors were simple typographical (data entry) mistakes and the difference between the entered value and the actual value was 1.5.6%.   In general, -5 the outcome  was  excellent, with only 2 samples  havingnificant sig 'errors'. They were posted as having 30% Zn which was actually reported initially at &gt;30% Zn in the certificate, however after routine re-assaying of over-range samples, the true values for these were much higher.  The errors are summarized in Table 19.

<!-- image -->

It is worth noting that Zinc One only incorporated those historical drill holes into its database for  which  the  hole  locations  could  be  found  in  the  field  and  certified  by  GPS  measurements . Several holes containing high grade intersections were not audited and were not incorporated into  the  Zinc  One  geological  and  resource  model  because  the  locations  were  not  certifiable (e.g.  BO-DH-31 and BO-DH-35).

WGM also audited the assay database for drill core samples derived from the current drilling program.  In total 67 certificates out of the 72 total.  Of a total of 4,235 recent samples in the project database, 1,498 samples (35%) were checked against the original certificates in PDF format.  In auditing the project's Excel-format database, WGM focused on zinc, lead and silver values.  WGM found no errors, largely we believe the result of Zinc One compiling the lab's Excel format output directly into its own project database and avoiding  any  potential  for  data  re entry  errors.   Whereas  samples  that  initially  exceeded  the -zinc detection limit were -assayed, re sometimes twice using progressive techniques establish  the  true  zinc  content,  no  such  reanalysis  was  carried  out  for  leadonsequently, . C sections that are higher grading for lead are commonly represented by assays simply reported as &gt;10,000 ppm and the data is entered as 10,000 ppm (or 1%).  As a consequence of this, the

## 12.6 EVALUATION OF LABORATORY PERFORMANCE

WGM had  no  involvement  in  the  ore  early historical  exploration  other  than  as  an  early m participant retained to complete an independent review .  Consequently, we have no ability to properly  assess  the  accuracy  and  precision  of istorical laboratory  performance.   Insofar  as h the  samples  collected  during  the  2004005  drilling  program  are  concered,  these  samples -2 n were analysed at a respected commercial laboratory that maintained an internal quality control program that generally complied with internationally accepted best practices   WGM  audited . the analytical data entered into the project database against original laboratory certificates and found no irregularities although its audit was not intended to investigate performance,  nor  could  it.    Subsequent  recent  drilling  by  Zinc  One  in  the  vicinity  of  the historical holes has intersected mineralization of a comparable nature, therefore WGM has no reason to doubt the veracity of this historical data.

labs visit

WGM's recent audit of the current drill core analysis , which found no data input errors,  gave no reasons for concern in respect  to the performance of the project laboratories, Certimin and ALS  Chemex . WGM's  review  of sample preparation and analytical specification sheets indicates that conventional protocols and  procedures  are followed  to ensure that the deliver representative, accurate and precise analytical data. WGM did not laboratories during its visits to Peru.

As part of its review for this report, WGM recently checked internal lab QA/QC sample data for  approximately  half  of  the  certificates  audited  and  found  no  out  of eptance  range  for acc CRMs, blanks or duplicate samples.  One barium analysis did significantly exceed the acceptable  limit  in  a  control  sample,  but  no  such  variations  were  found  in  the  elements  of economic interest.  Chart 1 shows the results of duplicate zinc analysis of Bongar√° samples on the  next  page.    High-grade  and  low -grade  samples  are  plotted  separately.    The  central  trend line is flanked by reen  lines g showing an acceptance range within which the results of duplicate  analysis  would  be  considered  ac eptable,  generally  equal  to  a  variance  of  plus  or c minus 10%. Some samples, especially lower grading samples,  l fal outside this range, however  WGM's  own  experience  at  Bongar proves  that  the  mineralization  in  the  drill  core √° can  be  coarse  and  nuggety,  and  herefore  we  are  prepared  to  accept    small  population  of t a variance beyond what might normally be considered acceptable.

## BONGAR√Å HISTORICAL MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATE

There are no historical Mineral Resources in the Bongar√° area that comply fully with current CIM Standards and Definitions. n   a  I feasibility study report for Cementos 15 June, 2005,  Kalinaj  reported  historical  Mineral  Resources  for  the  ina Grand√© and  Mina M Chica zones as follows in Table 20.  Based on the open pit mine plan developed by Cementos, the estimated historical Mineral Reserves were summarized as presented in Table 21.

The  near-surface character of the mineralization allowed the zones to be traced combination  of  very  shallow  drill  holes  and  excavated  pits  and  trenches.    Continuity  within zones  was  well  established  and  mineralized  blocks  were  defined  using  a  10% c  cut-off. zin

The correlation between original geochemical sampling data and drill hole data was shown to be excellent over distances of 10-15 m which was the block size used for modelling purposes . The use of smaller blocks introduced some issues of variabil ity due to localized irregularities in the mineralization.  Diamond drilling did extend the mineralization to a depth of 27 m from surface,  well  below  what  could  be  trenched  manually.    However  some  of  this  mineralization was stacked and excluded from the urces r eso due to intervening horizons of mineralization.    I n some  cases,  the  trenches  and  pits  terminated  in  low  grade  mineralization directly above levels that were well mineralized.  The genetic model essentially indicated in situ oxidation of a sulphide deposit with very little lateral migration of zinc and lead.  Kalinaj concluded  that 'the pr sent e knowledge  of  the geometry,  morphology  and  controls  of  the mineralization  can  be  considered  as  sufficient  for  decision  making  [and],  the  mineralization model used for the  construction  of  solids  is  probably  the  most  complex  and  precise  that  was used  so  far  in  economic  evaluation  of  the  deposit.    WGM  agrees  with  these  conclusions  but underscores  the substantial geochemical evidence indicating excellent potential for deposits along strike, particularly to the northwest.

The foregoing historical resources and reserves have not been confirmed by WGM.  The Mina Grand√© historical resources were partially mined in two pits during 2008.

The most  recent  (historical)  mineral  resources  estimated  at  Bongar√°  in  a  13  June  2011  letter report  by  Corianta  S.A.,  indicates  1.0 Mt t  a  grade  of  21.61% n.    Of  this,  approximately a Z 770,000  tonnes  is  reported  as  historical  'reserves',  however  neither  the  resource  or  reserve estimates are compliant with CIM standards .  There is no other data to support this historical estimate, and it cannot be relied upon for investment purposes.

Prior to this estimate, the next most recent estimate of (historical) resources was completed in February 2008 by Geoval and published in a technical report of the same date.  The results of the estimate are summarized  as follows in Table  . 22 A  Qualified Person has not done sufficient work  to  classify  this  or any  other  historical  resource  estimate  cited  herein  as  a current  mineral  resource  estimate  and  therefore  none  of  the  historical  estimates  cited  herein are considered current mineral resource estimates nevertheless , it is interesting that the average reported zinc grade is somewhat similar to that of the current resources estimated by Zinc One.

2011

WGM  reviewed  this  2008  historical  Mineral  Resource  estimate  in  detail  because  it  can  be viewed as a basis from which a known tonnage was mined, and therefore it provides insight as to the resource that might remain below the remediated landscape. Although the historical resource estimate was post -mining and the more recent, the 2008 resource estimate

provides transparency in the procedures sed u and the digital files were accessible and provided  a  good  basis  for  its  review,  whereas  very  little  guidance  existed  regarding  how  the 2011 estimate was produced.  The  modelling was also carried out by Geoval Peru (authors of the resource estimate in Corianta S.A.'s report)  using  Gemcom ¬Æ software which is also WGM's  main  resource  modelling  platform,  and  therefore  it  is  well  understood  by  WGM personnel.   All  data  was  imported  by  WGM  and  validated  using  Dassault  Syst√®mes  GEMS ¬Æ (version 6) software.  Basic statistics for the dataset, organized by rock code are presented in Table  23.    Basic  statistics  for  the  dataset,  organized  by  rock  code  are  presented  in  Table  24 . The  following  is  a  description  of  the  process  and  a  summary  of  WGM's  findings t  are tha presented in more detail in Workman and Breede (2017).

WGM's  review of the database show   that ed grade -compositing was done on a 1 metr e interval basis, measured from the collar downward however lithological boundaries were not preserved in this process, resulting in composites crossing over these contacts.  WGM's block model review comprised the following analysis:

- ¬∑ Visual inspection of wireframes and block values (grade, categorization, rock codes, etc.) on plan and using 21 longitudinal vertical sections;
- ¬∑ Review of block interpolation parameters; and
- ¬∑ Review of block volumetric reporting parameters.

<!-- image -->

A topographic wireframe surface constructed from 2 metre elevation contours existed for the Property. Geoval  and  WGM   noted  discrepancies  requiring  manual correction and  WGM recommended that  the  topography  be  resurveyed  to  produce  a  more  representative  surface (which  has  now  been  done  by  PhotoSat  using  Worldview  satellite  data) .   WGM  also  found triangulation errors in the ragmented  wireframes  representing f the three main  lithological domains (Dolomite, Karst and Mudstone) however since these were not used for volumetrics reporting, these errors were deemed to be immaterial to  its review.  WGM concluded that t he wireframes were a reasonable representation of the various lithological domains of deposit. Geoval's  broad-brushed approach to geological modelling was thought be to acceptable for a bulk tonnage pit application, but WGM concluded that it could pose problems for  mine  planning  since  there  is  less  detail  regarding  geological  continuity  for  grade  control . WGM  recommend ed  that future updates of the geological model  empt att to seamlessly correlate interpretations across multiple sections an , approach that has been used geological modelling for the current Mineral Resource estimate.

WGM  found  the  grade interpolation parameters as described in Geoval's report be of to questionable  validity.    Geoval  established  a  single  block  model  th  block  dimensions  of wi 10 m length, 10 m width and 4 m height on a regular grid covering the entire extents of both Mina Grand√© deposits.  Blocks were interpolated using Inverse Distance Squared (ID ) which 2 is generally  acceptable  for  estimation  where  little  to  no  anisotropy  exists owever  WGM , h believed  that  the  degree  of  homogeneity  in  the  deposit  was  less  than  forecast  by  Geoval  and WGM recommended verification by other means of interpolation (i.e. Kriging).

resource

The  "Standard" block model contains values for various attributes including category, Zn%, density and rock type amongst others. oval Ge categorized it s mineral resources as follows:

- ¬∑ Measured (501) - blocks interpolated using 4 or more samples whose average distance to the block centre is less than half the variogram range;
- ¬∑ Indicated (502) - blocks interpolated using 2 or more samples whose average distance to the block centre is within the variogram range; and,
- ¬∑ Inferred (503) - blocks interpolated using 2 or more samples whose average distances to the block centre is up to twice the variogram range.

WGM cautioned that the lack of a limit  on the number of samples  reporting for interpolation from any one drill  hole  would  likely  result  in  a  localized  bias,  and WGM recommended that any  future  resource  estimations  impose  a  limit.   r  tonnage  calculations,  a  single  'global' Fo specific gravity (" S.G. ") of 1.57 was applied to all mineralized blocks. underlying The limestone (waste) was assigned a S.G . of 2.0.  During its 2014 site visit, the  WGM geologist observed considerable variances in rock density, and recommended further study on the

subject of bulk density to provide representative data for each major rock type. Zinc One has since followed WGM's recommendations in acquiring new data to support the resource modelling although the evidence shows that considerable variability exists .

current

In completing its previous audit, WGM recreated a volumetrics profile in GEMS  and reported block  volumes,  tonnage,  and  grade.    No new wireframes  were  used  to  constrain  the  reported volumes.  The resulting volumetrics reports summarized in Table  25 show tonnes that are on average 17.4% lower than that reported by Geoval  (1.22 Mt in all classes), although grades in each of the three categories are within ¬±5% ee (s Table 22  for compar ison). Within the context  of  its audit, which  did  not  constitute  an  exhaustive  review, M  was unable  to WG explain  the  reason  for  the  discrepancy  in  volume  and  tonnes.    The erification  of  grade  did v lend credence to the treatment of analytical data, and it is important to note that the historical estimate was not carried out to meet NI 43-101 standards.

## 13.  MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING

Zinc One has not carried out any  ecific sp programs of detailed metallurgical testing Bongar√° to develop a detailed spreadsheet for processing.  However, smaller historical studies have been carried out to identify the mineralogy of the mineralization as well features.

at as

other

During 1987, laboratory scale testwork was completed on Bongar√° ores (known then as Eduardo zinc  ores)  supplied  by  WGM  (Lightfoot  and  Floyd,  1987).    These  tests  demonstrated  that  high recoveries of zinc (97.4%) and lead (98.1%) to relatively clean oxide fumes were achievable in a process  involving  continuous  feeding  of  ores  to  a  Sirosmelt  reactor.    Higher  recoveries  for  zinc and  lead  (99.9 % and  99.6%,  respectively)  could  also  be  achieved  using  a  batch  smelting  and fuming  flowsheet.    The  fumes  produced  would  be  suitable  for  sale  to  either  an  electrolytic  zinc refinery or to an Imperial Smelting Furnace type of zinc/lead smelter.

Research

Several programs of mineral identification and testing were completed  in support of feasibility studies.  During 2000-2003, Cementos Pacasmayo S.A.A. completed the laboratory testing  of  rotary  kiln  volatilization  of  Bongar√°  zinc  oxide  ore,  and  the  ot  testing  of  zinc pil oxide  ore  by  direct  leaching .   To save  construction  cost  and  shorten  the  construction  period, Cementos decided to pursue rotary kiln volatilization of Bongar√° mineralization with the goal of producing a saleable Zn- xide o dust. Under  commission to the Liaoning International Economic and Technology Cooperation Group  Corp. of the Beijing General Institute  of  Mining  and  Metallurgy,  basic  design  work  was  completed  to  develop  a  process flowsheet  based  on  the  use  of  a  Waelz  kiln  and   electrostatic  dust  collector     The   circuit an . included a magnetic-separator to recover reduced iron-rich slag.

The  Cementos feasibility study report by Kalinaj (2005)  monstrated  that de the Bongar√° mineralization has the compositions shown in Table 26.

The foregoing mineral balance reported by Kalinaj is unusual according to the experience of the WGM geologist.  The high composition of hemimorphite in the samples, with smithsonite being  absent  in  80%  of  the  test  pits,  suggests  that  the  samples  were  somewhat  subjectively acquired or that the samples were collected from a highly weathered zone in smithsonite was largely replaced by hydrozincite and hemimorphite.  ior Pr to site remediation, WGM observed good evidence for smithsonite in the Mina Grand√© pit walls, and this appears to be the least weathered type of zinc mineralization.

which host

Kalinaj notes that hemimorphite commonly presents itself as prismatic aggregates and as mmscale bands (veinlets) intercalated with hydrozincite.  A suggestion is made that hemimorphite replaces wurtzite however this is doubtful in the opinion of WGM as no wurtzite is observed or  report ed  at  Bongar√°.    The habit  of  hemimorphites  at  Bongar√°  is  similar  to  that  in  many other locations in both tropical and arid environments imply , s that it ppears a late in the paragenesis  as  a  void -filling  phase,  commonly  growing  as  spectacular  fine-grained sprays  of crystals lining dissolution cavities that  are found along fractures and shears in the limestone.

According  to  Kalinaj,  hydrozincite  occurs  as  powdery  white  aggregates  and  this  observation was supported by  WGM.    It  occurs  as  bright  white,  amorphous  to  very  fine  grained  filling along bedding features, fractures and occasionally cementing limestone and goethite breccia. It is certainly younger (later) than smithsonite.

Smithsonite  is described  as colloform  aggregates  and  concentrations  and  crocrystalline. mi While this is true, it is volumetrically more important as a pervasive replacement of limestone in which original bedding features can be preserved.  This mode of occurrence is common in all non-sulphide zinc deposits, and it is arguably  the most important 'oxide-type' zinc ore.  It is uncertain why smithsonite is so poorly represented in the Bongar√° sample suite.

Minor amounts of organic material and cerrusite were also observed in the samples.

Kalinaj showed  that the mineralization   zoned is with an upper 2 m  hick t layer assaying approximately  2.68 % Zn  and  2.37% Pb  underlain  by  a  2.8 m ick  layer  assaying  7.7%  n th Z and  3.2% Pb.    Both  of  these  layers  are  highly  oxidized.    Theird  horizon  is  4 m  thick  and th assays  21.2% Zn  with  3.4% Pb .   The  lowermost  layer  is  leach,  porous  calcareous  rock  and recrystallized dolomite with residual galena (average % Zn 28 and 1.8  Pb). % Thethree lowermost horizons have an average composition of 20.7%  Zn and 2.7% Pb over a thickness of 11.6 m.

At this  time, there  is  nothing  in  the  data  or  in  the  observations  of  WGM  that  would  indicate that  exploitation  of  the  mineralization  from  ina  Grand√©,  Bongarita  or  Mina  Chica  would M face  technical  hurdles  that  could  negatively  impact  zinc  recovery     Given  the  variability  of . mineralization,  however,  additional  metallurgical  testing  is  warranted,  especially  for  those mineralization types (e.g. soils) that have not previously been tested.

Specific gravity determinations were made of various types of mineralization as follows:

| Dolomite Karst                  |   1.56 |
|---------------------------------|--------|
| Gossan                          |   2.14 |
| Karst                           |   1.35 |
| Limestone                       |   2.9  |
| Clay-Loam                       |   1.55 |
| Mineralization at 5% Zn Cut-Off |   1.5  |

Smallvill

SRK (2014) reported that Votorantim retained a metallurgical consultant, S.A.C. (' Smallvill ') to perform metallurgical studies on mineralization from the Florida Canyon  deposit  in  2010  and  2011.    his deposit is  similar  in  some  respects  to  Bongar√°,  but T contains  a  greater  amount  of  original  sulphide  mineralization Nevertheless,  something  can . be learned from the Votorantim experience.  AMEC was retained during 2013 to evaluate the project  at  the  scoping  level,  now  referred  to  as  a  'Preliminary  Economic  Assessment'.    The Florida Canyon sulfide resource was shown to consist of zinc and lead sulfide s in a limestone matrix  where  zinc  is  in  higher  proportions  than  lead.    Theneficiation  testing  focused  on b conventional lead-zinc flotation.  The oxide resource contains zinc in much higher proportion than  lead,  and  consists  of  zinc  carbonates  and  zinc  s icates  in  a  dolomitic  limestone  matrix il . In  contrast to the work  by alinaj K at Bongar√°, he t zinc -oxide material was  found to be predominately  smithsonite  and  hemimorphite  together  with  a  lead oxide  material  (cerussite) . -The oxide recovery process Smallvill  investigated  focused  on  a  combination  of  heavy  media separation (HMS) followed by conventional zinc -oxide flotation.  The two concentrates were then up-graded to marketable products through calcination and Waelz roasting processes.  The recovery estimates for the mineralization were  based  on  preliminary  metallurgical testing utilizing  conventional  sulfide  and  oxide  flotation  processes    Table 27 provides  the  recovery . estimates by mineralization type.

For  the  sulfide,  the  conventional  selective  lead inc  flotation  process  and  treatment  of  the -z concentrate  in  lead  and  zinc  smelters  was  utilized  to  estimate  metal  recovery,  concentrate grades  and  processing  costs    Oxide  recovery,  concentrate  grade  and  operating  costs  were . based on conventional zinc oxide flotation, calcining the flotation concentrate and treating the calcined concentrate at a zinc smelter .  Recovery and processing costs for the mixed material was based on a tonnes weighted average 9:41 : 5 percent sulfide to oxide tio. ra Other processing options were investigated by Votorantim/Smallvill for the oxide material, but were not utilized due to process un-conventionality and higher operating costs.

In comparison with the high (97%) recoveries achieved previously in 1987 using a  Sirosmelt reactor,  the  testing  of  oxide  flotation  for  Florida  Canyon  mineralization  offers  guidance  that  this form of beneficiation may yield no measurable benefits over a simply pyrometallurgical approach.

## 14.  MINERAL RESOURCE AND ESTIMATES

## 14.1 MINERAL RESOURCES SUMMARY

The Mineral Resource estimates have been prepared by John Reddick, M.Sc., P.Geo., who is a Senior Associate Resource Geologist of WGM.  Mr. Reddick is a Consulting Geologist and is independent of Zinc One Resources Inc. and Forrester Metals S.A.C.

The Mineral  Resource  estimates  presented  in  this  report  provide  an  update  to  and/or  replace all previous resource estimates for five of the deposits on the BZMP.  From south to north the deposits with Mineral Resource estimates in this report are:

- ¬∑ Mina Grand√© Sur (' MGS ');
- ¬∑ Mina Grand√© Centro (' MGC ');
- ¬∑ Mina Grand√© Nort√© (' MGN ');
- ¬∑ Mina Chica (' MC '); and
- ¬∑ Bongarita.

All  of  the  estimated  Mineral  Resources  occur  in  zones  of  oxidized  polymetallic  carbonatehosted mineralization that have the potential for economic extraction of zinc.   Relative to the high-grade zinc mineralization commonly present, much lesser amounts of lead and silver coexist with the zinc, however these are found in amounts that may not significantly impact the economic value of the zinc mineralization .  The estimates presented here are considered to be effective as of January 30, 2019.

The minimum  cut-off  grade  and  the  block  sizeused  for  the  resource  estimates  were  applied with  the  assumption  that  resources  with  potential  bulk  mineable  characteristics  have  been appropriately  estimated  using  these  parameters.   A  minimum  cut- off  value  of  10%  Zn  was established for resource  estimates which is similar to that used for previous historical estimates  and  when  the  property  was  in  production  during  2007-2008.   was  also  used  in It order  to  determine  the  amount  of  higherrading  mineral  resources  approaching  20%  zinc. -g WGM's  sensitiv ity  analysis  included  additional estimates using  cut- f of grades  of 5%  and 15% zinc.    There  are  no  current  metallurgical  studies  for  the  property  and  WGM  makes  no assumptions with respect to recovery of zinc for the Mineral Resource estimates.

WGM's  Minera l  Resources  estimates  as  of  January  20,  2019  and  the  contained  metal  are summarised in Tables 28 and 29.

Notes::

- 1. Resources  were  estimated  using  composites  within  constrained  block  models  with  block  dimensions  of  5x5x5m  and using ordinary kriging grade interpolation methods.
- 2. Top cuts at a grade of 40% Zn were applied to Zn grades of assays before compositing.  A cutoff grade of 10% Zn was -applied which incorporates 3 year average metal prices and approximates the cut -off used during past mining operations. Zn% grades can be converted by applying a conversion factor of 22.046 pounds per Zn% to obtain lbs of Zn per etric m tonne.
- 3. A Bulk Density of 1.90 was applied using the geological block model density field.
- 4. Mineral Resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability   The estimate of mineral . resources may be materially affected by commodity prices, environmental, permitting, legal, title,  olitical, socio -p marketing, or other relevant issues.
- 5. The quantity  and  grade  of  estimated  Inferred  Mineral  Resources  is  uncertain  in  nature  as  there    been  insufficient has exploration to define these resources as an Indicated or Measured  Mineral  Resource,  and  it  is  uncertain if exploration will result in up-grading the confidence level of Inferred Resources.

- 6. The Mineral Resources were estimated using the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum Standards on Mineral  Resources  and  Reserves,  Definitions  and  Guidelines  prepared  by  the  CIM  Standing  Committee  on  Reserve Definitions and adopted by CIM Council May 10, 2014; and further mandated by National Instrument 43-101.

The estimates  for  the Mina Grand√© Centro and Mina Grand√© Nort√© deposits  have  taken  into account the removal of previously mined material extracted during 2008 2007-as data provided  by  Zinc  One  reflects  the  current  topography  (post ining  and  reclamation) .   Drill -m holes from the mined areas were removed from the database .  Previous mining was by means of  open  pit  mining  on  two  shallow  benches  at  Mina rand√© Centro  and  Mina Grand√© North G (see  photographic  plates  3  and  4  in  this  report)  No  detailed  record  of  mined  ore  or  waste . material was available to allow WGM to reconcile past production.

## 14.2 SOFTWARE

WGM  estimated  the  Mineral  Resources  for  all  the  zones  on  the  property  using  the  block model estimation tools available in version 6.7.4 of Geovia GEMS software.

## 14.3 DATA

## 14.3.1 DRILL HOLE AND SURFACE SAMPLING DATABASE

the

The  Bongar√°  Mineral  Resource  estimates  are  based  on  data  from  Zinc  One's  recent  2018 exploration  program  of  diamond  drilling  as  well  as  both  recent  and  historical  pit  and  trench sampling, augmented by historical 2004-05 20 surface diamond drilling where the collar co-ordinates of the  BO series drill holes were confirmed by Zinc One. The abases dat provided to WGM  were  subdivided  into  sets  to allow for the separate estimation of Mineral  Resources  in  the  five  zones  listed  below   The   constraining  wireframes  and  block . model limits define a unique area for each zone.   Filters were created to ensure that data from the  filtered  drill  holes  targeted  only  the  wireframes  identified  for  the  zone  that  was  being estimated.  As described later, only drill holes were used to estimate Indicated Resources; drill holes  and  surface  sampling  were  used  to  estimate  Inferred  Resources   The  surface  samples . are described as pits, check pits or channels in the database used for estimation   The pits and . check  pits  are excavated  to  various  depths,  often  several metres  deep  and  in  rare  cases  over 10 m deep.

The co-ordinates of each zone are given in Table  30.  The co-ordinate system is based on the UTM WGS 84 datum.

Zinc One's surface sampling was completed during 2017-2018.   Zinc One's drilling program was  all  completed  during  2018  using  N W  thin-wall,  wire -line  drilling  and  the  core  has  a T diameter of 54.8 mm.  The BO series of drilling was done in 2005-2005 with NTW-sized drill core (approx. 48-50 mm), however the specific diameter is uncertain.

Table 31 presents the total numbers of drill  holes and surface samples within the constrained areas  for  each  zone  estimated     If  the  assays  for  a  hole  or  pit  occurred  entirely  outside  the . modelled  wireframes,  the  data  were  not  used  for  grade  interpolation.    The  for Mina data Grand√© Sur and Mina Grand√© Centro  are  combined  due  to  the  proximity  of  the  supporting drill hole and surface sampling data used to model these zones.

Diamond drilling has been generally directed  at defining zones of better grade mineralization identified  by  previous  recent  and  historical  surface  sampling    There  was  some  recent  check . sampling of historic surface sampling by Zinc One to confirm sample grades from older pits . In  instances  where  Zin c  One  surface  sample  data  existed  to  check  against  older  sampling, only  the  older  samples  were  used  for  resource  estimation  as  not  all  of  the  Zinc  One  samples

extended as far below surface as the historical pits .  Only diamond drill samples were used to estimate  Indicated  Mineral  Resources  whereas  both  diamond  drill  and  surface  samples  were used for estimation of Inferred Mineral Resources.

The drilling  pattern  for  all  zones  is  irregular;  recent  drilling  by  Zinc  One  has  been  entirely from surface and generally consists of fans of two or more holes from a single pad  nd in so a doing  has  capitalized  on  the  efficiency  of  drilling  multiple  holes  from ingle  site.    This a  s targeting  approach  is  possible  due  to  the  flayying  to  very  shallowly  dipping  orientation  of -l the mineralized bodies.  Vertical and angled drill holes from surface vary greatly in direction, and consequently drill holes from different  drill pads often converge at depth.  The  Zinc One drilling is on a better defined grid pattern than the older surface drilling and surface sampling . Drilling on each of the zones extends from surface to depths of up to 50 m  below surface, but the majority of drilling tests areas less than 35 m below surface.

Collar  co-ordinates  are  recorded  in  the  WGS 84  datum.   Zinc  One initially located  all  of  its -drill  hole  collars  and  surface  samples sing  GPS  instruments .    Co-ordinates  from  previous u work  were  originally  measured  by  hand- held  GPS  using  the  PSAD56  survey  datum .   Zinc -One  located  many  of  the  historical data  points  and  recorded  those  points  using  the  WGS  84 datum that is  significantly  less  prone  to  error .   Historical  locations  that  could  not  be  verified by  Zinc  One  w ere  transformed  from  PSAD -56  coordinates  to  WGS -84  co-ordinates  by  Zinc One.  Subsequent to GPS surveying, all collars  and sample sites were resurveyed with a high level of accuracy relative to established survey monuments using a Total Station instrument.

Zinc One's drill hole collars are from 20 -30 m apart for the Mina Chica and Bongarita zones and  25-35 m apart  for  the  Mina  Grand√©  Sur,  Mina Grand√© Centro  and  Mina Grand√© Nort√© zones.  The result is that in areas where  Indicated Resources are reported,  samples from drill holes are spaced on a scale that is generally less than 25  m apart and as a consequence, blocks estimated as Indicated Resources in the block models have average distances of between 12  m and 16 m for all the samples that inform those blocks.

Drilling  and  surface  samples  were  projected  on  vertical  sections  on  25 centres  oriented m north-south and east-west, and also on additional sets of vertical sections on 25 m  centres that are oriented southwest-northeast.  I n addition, drill holes and surface samples were projected on plan views at 5 m elevations that conformed to the elevations of the block models.

Figure 10 is a 3D view of the drill hole traces for the Mina  rand√© Sur deposit (red) and the G Mina Grand√© Centro  deposit  (blue).    Figure  11 shows  the  drill  hole  traces  for  Mina  rand√© G Nort√© deposit  (orange)  and  Figure  12  shows  the  drill  hole  traces  for  the  Mina  Chica  deposit (green) as well as the Bongarita deposit (cyan).

## 14.3.2 ASSAYS, GEOLOGICAL INFORMATION AND OTHER DRILL HOLE AND SURFACE SAMPLING DATA

were

Drill hole  data  were  provided  to  WGM  in  the  form  of  spreadsheets  with  drill  hole  collar locations, hole orientations, lithological, sample location and analytical data that imported into a Gems database. The ta da from earlier surface sampling often lacked lithological data but contained data for all other fields similar to that of the drill holes Rock . Quality Determinant (' RQD ') and core recovery data for all of the  historical drill holes were not  systematically  recorded  in  the  digital  database,  owever  WGM  recommends  those  data h available be entered into the digital database for future drilling and modelling purposes.

The drill  hole  databases  were  filtered  by  WGM  to  limit  the  holes  being  used  to  those  in  the immediate  vicinity  of  each  of  the  zones  as  there  were  a  number  of  holes  that  were  some distance away from the areas included in the estimates .  The filtered drill hole databases used by WGM for resource estimation were produced using a series of filters that defined holes by areal distribution and sample type (drill hole, pit, channel, trench and check pits by Zinc One). Only data passing these filters were utilised for the resource estimates.

WGM  is satisfied that the filtered data used for the Mineral Resources estimates sufficiently  free  of  error  to  be  adequate  for  resource  estimation  WGM's  audit  of  historical . and  current  assay  data  is  presented  in  chapter  12, 'Data  Verification'. WGM  made  some minor  corrections  to  the  drill  hole  assay  database  after  consultation  with  Zinc  One.   se The corrections  were  related  to  modifying  some  high  grade  zinc  assays  entries,  where  multiple analyses had been done on the same sample.

## 14.3.3 TOPOGRAPHY

A  digital  topographic  surface  with  a  one etre  contour  interval  was  provided  by  Zinc  One m from  satellite  imagery  and  that  was  used  as  the  surface  for  all  of  the  resource  estimations . WGM is of the opinion that the digital data reasonably reflects the actual topographic surface . This is discussed in Chapter 9, 'Exploration'.

## 14.3.4 SAMPLE RECOVERY

Zinc  One  recorded  core  recovery  for  sample  intervals  for  much  of  the  2018  drilling  and reports  a  value  of  84%  recovery  from  3,821  samples  with  an  average  grade  of  9.95%  Zn. WGM recommends that these data continue to be entered into the digital  database  for  future drill holes.  Some of the mineralized core is quite friable, and RQD's from the core examined during the site visit was from 0 to 20%.

## 14.3.5 BULK DENSITY

A bulk density of 1.90 T/m  was used for the purpose of calculating tonnages for the Mineral 3 Resources estimates.

Zinc One geologists weighed 296 core boxes with 957 m of core from mineralized zones from the 2018 drilling and arrived at a bulk density of 1.86 T/m 3 by calculating the density from the weight of the core and the volume of the core based on diameter of the hole and length of the intervals.   WGM  notes  that  when  the  same  data  set  is  filtered  for  core  boxes  with  grades  of 5%  Zn  or  greater,  there  are  253  core  boxes  averaging  14.5%  Zn  that  provide  a  mean  bulk density of 1.80 T/m .  Mr. Reddick participated in a portion of this exercise as part of the site 3 visit. The   bulk density  of  unmineralized  limestone,  which  is  not  as  easily  altered  by  the intense  weathering  as  the  rock  containing  Zn  mineralization,  and  therefore  is  not  as  vuggy, was 2.36 T/m 3 based on 48 core box measurements.

In addition, Zinc One derived 72 density measurements on individual centimetre to decimetresized  core  samples  from  the  2018  drilling.    hese  samples  averaged  about  20 g  (dry)  and T were weighed dry and in water and the volume determined from the amount  ter  of displaced.  The bulk density derived from this exercise was 1.91 T/m . 3

wa

In 2005 Pacasmayo, the mine operators during past production, determined bulk density by an undetermined  method  from  55  samples.    These  were  divided  into  a  suite  of  five  rock  typ es and included specimens from surface samples and core samples.  The bulk density Pacasmayo derived for the average of the five rock types was 1.90 T/m .  However, it should be noted the 3 average bulk density of their 55 samples is 1.55 T/m .  It is assumed that they did not consider 3 the lower bulk density to be representative of the mineralized rock as they list 23 samples that are  described  as 'Karst' with  a  bulk  density  of  1.35  T/m    While  karst  is  present  in  the 3 . Bongar√° area, WGM  views  its relationship to mineralization as being random and post -mineralization.

As  described  above,  the  bulk  density  clearly  indicates  a  significant  loss  of  mass  relative  to what might be expected from a sulphide -rich, unweathered, MVT deposit.  Potential losses in mass from the mineralized rock could be due to:

- ¬∑ a  significant  amount  of  porosity  due  to  numerous m-cm  scale  vugs  in  the  weathered m rock;
- ¬∑ large scale (up to metre scale) voids from post-mineral karsting;
- ¬∑ remobilisation of soluble mineral material due to chemical transportation; and,

<!-- image -->

- ¬∑ loss  of  recovered  material  in  core  from  washing  of  friable  material  during  the  drilling process.

WGM  strongly  recommends  that  as  exploration  and  development  work  progresses  on  the project,  additional  work  in  the  form  of  excavating  representative  bulk  samples  is  done  to better determine the bulk density for each zone.

## 14.4 DATA ANALYSIS

## 14.4.1 GENERAL

Although  sampling  and  assay  protocols  have  varied  over  time,  all  the  mineralized  drill  hole and surface sample intervals have  een b sampled  and  analysed for Zn  and Pb, and some analyses  from  the  2004-005  drilling  program  contain  Ag  analyses  as  well.    ore  recent 2 M sampling, including the Zinc One surface and drill hole samples, determined Zn, Pb and Ag as part of a multi- lement e IC P package  for all samples, followed by additional quantitative analyses,  repeated  if  necessary,  to  determine  zinc  contents  in  those  samples  for  which  the initial  results  exceeded  the  detection  limit.    IAppendix  1,  the  results  of  Exploratory  Data n Analyses (' EDA ')  include  results  for  Pb  and  Ag  but  those  elements  are  not  included  in  the resource estimates . I  addition n to the fact that some  holes  contained  many  samples  that exceeded the detection limit for lead and a few samples exceeded that for silver, Zinc One has indicated  to  WGM  that  in  its  opinion  the  economic  recovery  of  lead  and  silver  is  doubtful given  the  anticipated  ore  processing  route.    For  these  reasons,  WGM  moved  forward  with  a zinc-only Mineral Resource estimate.

## 14.4.2 SAMPLING AND SAMPLE LENGTHS

The diamond drill  holes  were  sampled  continuously  through  mineralized  zones  and  into  the shoulders  of  adjacent  unmineralized  rock.    Drill  core  in  mineralization  is  often  too  friable  to cut  with  a  saw  so  it  was  manually  divided  into  half  with  the  rchived  portion  retained  in  the a core  box .    The   average  length  of  surface  samples  and  that  of  the  BO  series  core  samples drilled in 2005-2005 is approximately 1 m.  The average length of Zinc One drill core samples is 1.56 m.

<!-- image -->

## 14.4.3 SAMPLE BIAS

WGM  analysed  the  sample  data  to  determine  if  there  were  differences  in  Zn  grades  as  a function of the drilling programs, or differences between diamond drilling and surface sampling. There are some  differences between  phases  of diamond  drilling, and between drilling results compared to surface sample results .  WGM determined that the surface sample averages were sufficiently similar to those of the drilling to allow their inclusion for Inferred Resource estimates.  One of the limiting characteristics of the surface sampling is that not all pits  were  deep  enough  to  reach  the  bottom  of  mineralization  whereas  the  drill  holes  for  the most part penetrated through to barren rock in the footwall below the mineralization.

As  the  analyses  done  for  sample  bias  differentiated  data  by  the  wireframes  for  each  deposit, those data also serve to assist with additional EDA as described below.   ppendix 1 presents A detailed sample statistics for all of the zones estimated, including a breakdown of statistics by sample  type.    A  sum mary  of  sample  statistics  by  type  for  all  of  the  zones  on  the  Bongar√° property is presented in Table . 32 Thesamples described below are all within the constraining  wireframes  used  for  the  resource  estimates  As  the  surface  sampling  and  BO . series drilling appear to have been targeted more specifically to test mineralized areas, and as the  Zinc  One  drilling  was  more  systematically  done  on  a  grid  to  test  known  mineralization and  to  potentially  enlarge  the  outer  margins  of  these  zones,  the  apparent  bias  may   due  to be hole  location  and  target  selection .    Only  the  BO  and  Zinc  One  diamond  drill  hole  data  were used  to  support  the Indicated  Resource  estimates.    All  the  data  were  used  to  support  the Inferred Resource estimates.

## SUMMARY STATISTICS BY SAMPLE TYPE

## 14.4.4 CONSTRAINING DOMAINS

The  Mineral  Resources  in  all  of  the  mineralized  zones  were  estimated  through  the  use  of constraining wireframes generated by WGM using digital modelling methods in GEMS 6.7.4 software.  The wireframes were based on polylines interpreted on a series of vertical sections at various orientations, as well as on plan views using 5 m elevation separations.  The polyline interpretations  were  based  on  both  Zn  assay  grades  and  lithology An  approximate  grade . boundary  of  5%  Zn  was  used  as  that  represented  a  level  of  mi ralization  below  the  cut -off ne grade used for the block model resource estimates.  Zinc One provided manual interpretations of  both  lithology  and  Zn  mineralization  on  hard  copy  prints  of  drill  and  surface  sample  data projected to vertical sections to be us ed as a guide to assist WGM with its modelling .  Due to the relatively shallow depths of mineralisation, a lower bounding surface was not used to limit the resource estimates.

The polylines  that  were  used  to  create  the  wireframes  were  snapped  to  the  assay ntervals  to i honour  the  position  of  the  samples  in  3D.    The ireframes  were  clipped  by  the  topographic w surface provided by Zinc One.

Notes on the modelling  of  each  domain  follow  below.    Some  of  the  zones  were  divided  into smaller  sub -domains  based  on  l thological  features  such  as  unmineralized  limestone,  faults i and post-mineral alteration.  The apparent faults identified during the logging of drill core that are considered by Zinc One to be significant include:

- ¬∑ footwall faults that generally appeared  to  be  conformable  with  the  mineralization  and stratigraphy, for example at Mina Chica; and,
- ¬∑ post-mineral,  subvertical  east -northeast  striking  faults  that  appear  to  have  had  several  to tens of metres normal, reverse and strike-slip movement.

The subvertical faults were reasonably well defined in the Mina Chica area.   Similar faults in the  Mina Grand√© zones  are  described  in  logs  and  are  apparent  as  features  in  the  topographic surface, however these are not well defined.   It also appears as though the gap between  Mina Grand√© Sur  and  Mina Grand√© Centro  is  a  function  of  displacement  along  a  significant  east -northeast striking fault termed the Ridge Fault by Zinc One.

## Mina Grand√© Sur

The Mina Grand√© Sur (' MGS ') zone was modelled by constructing a wireframe constraining the Zn values south of the Ridge Fault interpreted by Zinc  This One.  grade shell is approximately  equal  to  a  5%  Zn  cut ff -o based  on  assays  in  drill holes and  from  surface

samples.    As  most  surface  samples  collected  from  pits  and  trenches  do  not  extend  to  the bottom of the mineralization, the lower limit of the zone was defined by drill hole data where available.   I n areas  where  drilling  did  not  provide  data,  the  lower  limit of mineralization was interpreted  to be  at the bottom  of  the  surface  sampling.    This  was  done  to  prevent  large volumes of the grade shell being unconstrained by either lithology of Zn grade data .  With infill drilling, this grade shell can be up-dated to incorporate additional data.

There are internal areas within the Mina Grand√© Sur grade shell that are modelled with nested or  clipping  wireframes  that  define  volumes  of  unaltered  limestone  or  volumes  of  very  low grade, oxidised material variably described as soil or gossan. ese Th areas (limestone or gossan) are coded such that they and the assay data found within them do not contribute to the current resource estimates.

## Mina Grand√© Centro

The  Mina  Grand√©  Centro  (' MGC ')  zone  is  about  25 m orth  of  Mina  Grand√©  Sur  and  is n separated from it by the interpreted Ridge Fault   MGC was modelled in a similar fashion  as . for Mina Grand√© Sur.  Internal areas within the Mina  Grand√© Centro grade shell also contain nested or clipping wireframes that define volumes of unaltered limestone or volumes oxidised material variably described as soil or gossan that are very low grade and excluded from the Mineral Resource volume.

of were

The amount of material modelled as gossan is significantly greater in MGC than in any other area  and  it  is  quite  complex  geometrically   This  is  a  consideration  that  would  need  to  be . addressed if the project advances to the stage where mining is contemplated  as it will have an impact on dilution and ore losses.  These areas (limestone or gossan) are coded such that they and  the  assay  data  found  within  them  do  not  contribute  to  the  current  resource  estimates . There  are  a  number  of  faults  logged  in  the  drill  holes  in  MGC  that  appear  to  be  reflected  in topographical  depressions,  but  these  could  not  be  modelled  in  any  coherent  fashion  at  this time.

## Mina Grand√© Nort√©

The Mina Grand√© Nort√© (' MGN ') zone is located about 100 m north of Mina Grand√© Centro. This area was modelled in a similar fashion as the above zones, however it considerably less drilling done in it relative to surface sampling .  Only the western margin of the zone has had systematically spaced drilling and the constraints in other reas are dictated a by surface sampling.  Consequently, the majority of the tonnes reported for the MGN zone are classified as Inferred Mineral Resources.

## Mina Chica

The  Mina Chica (' MC ') zone is about 250 m  orth n of Mina  Grand√©  Nort√©. This area, characterized by stressed vegetation due to zinc toxicity, had not been previously drilled, but was intensively  drilled  by  Zinc  One  in  2018.    There  are  a  number  of  interpreted  sub-rtical ve faults that transect MC and that have resulted in vertical and horizontal displacements of up to 30 m.  An  analysis  of  assay  grades  for  the  different  fault  blocks,  such  as  mean  Zn%  grades and  median  Zn%  values,  showed  them  to  be  similar  in  statistical  properties ue  to  the . D uncertainty  regarding  the  exact  location  and  attitude f  the  interpreted  faults,  the  entire  MC o zone  was  treated  as  one  domain  for  the  purposes  of  resource  estimation  rather  than  treating each block as a separate domain.

## Bongarita

The  Bongarita (' BONG ') zone is a relatively small and shallow, -surface near ar ea of mineralization  located  40 -50 m  west  of  Mina  Chica.   t  is  characterised  by  highly  oxidised I mineralized material that is similar to weathered soil on surface, and extends to a maximum of 10 m below surface.

## 14.5 ASSAYS GRADE DISTRIBUTIONS AND STATISTICS

## 14.5.1 INTRODUCTION

Table 33 shows  summary  statistics  for  zinc  assays  from  all  sample  types  in  the  wireframes used  for  resource  modelling  of  the  various  zones.   etailed  statistics  by  sample  type  are  in D Appendix 1.  Differences in statistical parameters are attributed to:

- ¬∑ variations in the overall grade of the zones;
- ¬∑ overprinting of zinc mineralization by gossan;
- ¬∑ different contributions in terms of sample types; and,
- ¬∑ different degrees of clustering of data depending on the amount and pattern of drilling.

## 14.5.2 GRADE CAPPING

program,

On the basis of WGM's  reviews of the assay data from Zinc One's drilling including  reviews  of  the  probability  plots,  an  examination  of  the  mount  of  metal  carried  by a the  higher  grade  samples  and  an  examination  of  lognormal  histograms,  a  top-t  of  40%  Zn cu was  applied  to  all  assays  Only  the  assay  data  from  Zinc  One  drilling  was  used  for  this . determination.  The product of contained metal as determined by length multiplied by grade is from 93 to 99.5% for cut grades compared to uncut grades, depending on the deposit.

hole

Appendix  2  contains log -transformed probability plots of Zinc One's diamond  drill assays  for  the different zones. A review   of  these  plots  shows  relatively  minor  inflection points in the 0.5 to 1% Zn range, and at the 2-% Zn range, depending on the deposit.   There 4 is a significant inflection point for all deposits in the 30-40% Zn range which clearly indicates a different population of mineralization above that range.   Table 34 summarises the impact of applying top cuts on length weighted assays from each of the wireframes used .  For all of the deposits reported in the current resource estimates, there is in total a 4% reducti on in metal as a consequence of applying top cuts to 6% of the samples.

## 14.5.3 COMPOSITES

3.0 m

All  informing  drill  core  and  surface  samples  were  composited  to  3.0 m n-length  intervals. ru As many surface samples were  m f o pits that extend several tres me below surface, compositing was done in the same manner for them as for drill holes.  With the exception of a number of very short assay intervals and a few long intervals, the grades of the composites  for  surface  samples  are  not  substantially  impacted  by  variations  in  the  length  of assay  intervals .    Assay  data  were  capped  to  40%  Zn  before  compositing.    alyses  of  the An grade of residual length composites (&lt;3.0 m)at th occur at the end of holes or domain

boundaries showed there to be no impact on the estimates from these intervals   Un-sampled . intervals  were  composited  using  nil  grades.    Composites  for  Pb  (%),  Ag m)  and  uncut (pp Zn (%),  were  all  created  but  these  are  not  reported  as  they  do  not  contribute  to  the  Mine ral Resource estimates.

As  the  collars  elevations  did  not  exactly  match  the  topographic  surface,  and  to  ensure  all samples  were  correctly  flagged  for  grade  interpolation,  the  intervals  for  all  informing  drill holes  and  surface  samples  were  checked  by  intersecting  the  wireframes  with  the  holes  and surface samples.  The starting and ending points for composited intervals were then manually verified and corrected for instances where the wireframes did not exactly correspond with the hole  collars or for holes  here w the last composite  was  not  correctly  determined  from  the wireframe intercept.  The latter case occurred in rare instances where there were very closely spaced samples in  adjacent  holes  that  did  not  allow  snapping  of  the  wireframe  to  both  assay intervals in a logical manner.

Table 35 shows  summary  statistics  for  capped  zinc  composites  from  all  sample  types  in  the wireframes  for the various zones.  Wireframes were  developed  to model etre-scale m and larger  zones  of  very  low  grade  gossan  that  occurs  in  t e  Mina Grand√© Sur  and  Mina Grand√© h Centro  zones. The gossan domains  were  subsequently  interpolated using the composites within the Gossan wireframe as listed in Table  35.  However, there were no blocks within the Gossan  wireframe  with  interpolated  grades  above  the  cutf  grade  used  for  reporting  the -of mineral resource estimates.

The  slightly lower  mean  grades  and  standard  deviations  of  the  composites  relative  to  the assays reflect:

- ¬∑ the impact of including un-sampled intervals;
- ¬∑ the lessened influence of short, high grade assay intervals; and
- ¬∑ the reduced grades of the capped assays over 40% Zn.

## 14.5.4 VARIOGRAPHY

Downhole  variograms,  analysed  using  both  assay  and  composite  data,  indicated  a  nugget effect  ( 'Co' )  at  0.10  to  0.20.    The results  from  variogram  analyses  for  composites  of  Zn  in the  different  zones  on  the  Bongar√°  property  are  given  in  Table  6.    The  variogram  analyses 3 presented below were done on composited intervals within the wireframes used estimation. All variogram parameters reported are normalised, with the total variance summing to 1.0.

The variograms were all modelled as being isotropic with a nugget effect component and one or  more  spherical  structure  components.    None  of  the  variograms  displayed  any  significant anisotropy.  This is considered to be a function of substantial oxidation and remobilisation of metals  on  a  metre  to  decimetre  scale  which  has  obscured  or  obliterated  any  zoning  of  the deposit that may have present at the time of the original mineralization.

## VARIOGRAM PARAMETERS BY MINERALIZED ZONE

| Zone               | Anisotropy   |   Co |   C1* |   Range C1 | C2*   | Range C2   |

| Gossan             | Isotropic    |  0.1 |  0.9  |         15 | -     | -          |
| Mina Grand√© Nort√©  | Isotropic    |  0.1 |  0.75 |         10 | 0.15  | 25         |
| Mina Chica         | Isotropic    |  0.1 |  0.9  |         25 | -     | -          |
| Bongarita          | Isotropic    |  0.1 |  0.9  |         25 | -     | -          |

The  same  modelled  parameters  for  the  variograms  were  chosen  for  grade  interpolations  of Mina Grand√© Sur  and  Mina Grand√© Centro  due  to  the  reasonably  similar  nature  of  the  data .

for

<!-- image -->

The range  of  the  modelled  variograms  for  these  areas  are  slightly  less  than  elsewhere,  and there is more erratic difference in short range variance, perhaps due to the influence of gossan. Although  the data were  less definitive for the Gossan  wireframe, parameters the for the enclosing  Mina Grand√© Sur  and  Mina Grand√© Centro  wireframes  were  chosen  to  interpolate these  data.    The  data  for  the  Gossan  wireframe  are  characterised  by  fewer  sets  of  data  pairs, and this combined with the long distances between sampl es may account for the more erratic nature of these data. The ariograms v for the Gossan wireframe define a very irregular increase of variance with increasing distance.  There is no evidence of vertical zoning due to weathering  apparent  in  the  data  for  thGossan,  Mina  Grand√©  Sur  or  Mina  Grand√©  Centro e wireframes.

Mina Grand√© Nort√© showed  evidence  of  slightly  longer  ranges,  perhaps  due  to  less  gossan overprinting the well developed zinc oxide mineralization.

The  variograms for Mina  Chica  were  peculiar   i that n they indicated more  variance over ranges up to 10 m than were seen in downhole variograms or oriented variograms with wide search  windows.    The  overall  ranges  for  the  Mina  Chica  data  are  similar  to  those  for  Mina Grand√© Centro.

The variogram developed for Mina Chica was applied to Bongarita due to the similarities of those  data,  however  the  variograms  for  Bongarita  are  more  erratic  due  in  part  to  much  less data being available.  Appendix 3 contains plots of variograms for each zone.

## 14.6.1 COMPOSITES

any

Capped assay data were composited into 3.0 m  run-length intervals, roughly corresponding to 50%  of  the  dimensions  used  for  blocks  in  the  block  model.    l  un -assayed  intervals  were Al assigned a grade of zero, cluding in any unsampled  intervals at the top of hole, and unsampled intervals at the bottom of holes.  omposites C were assigned a domain code according to the wireframe in which the centre of the composite lies.

Composites  were  constrained  to  interval   within  the  modelled  wireframes     The   data  were s . checked to ensure composited intervals for the beginning of holes with collars slightly above or  below  the  topographic  surface  were  correct In  addition,  the  composited  intervals  were . checked  to  verify  hole s  that  did  not  intersect  the  lower  limit  of  the  wireframes,  or  to  ensure the last composite  intervals in holes were  valid  in cases where  wireframes  had  not  been

snapped  to  assay  intervals  due  to  inconsistencies  of  zinc  mineralization  relative  to  nearby holes.    Residual  composites  with  lengths  of  less  than  3.0 m the  end  of  drill  holes  were at permitted as they did not have grades that were different than the average composite grades.

Composites  were  flagged  by  drill  hole  number  and  sample  type  to  allow  filt . ering Only composites from diamond drilling were used for defining Indicated Mineral Resources.

## 14.6.2 BLOCK MODEL DOMAIN CODES

The following  codes  were  assigned  to  domains  within  the  various  block  models  (Table ). 37 Block  model  rock  types  and  bulk ensities  were  assigned  according  to  the  wireframe  they d were in.  All blocks above the topographic surface were assigned the code for 'Air' and those blocks  below  were  initially  assigned  the  code  for  'Limestone'  (waste) Blocks  within  the . wireframes  for each  zone  were  then  populated  according  to  the  wireframe.    here  were  no T overlaps  or  gaps  between  any  of  the  wireframes  or  the  topographic  surface.    I rder  for  a n o block to be assigned a code other than Air or Waste, a wireframe had to occupy at least 50% of the block by volume.

## 14.6.3 ESTIMATION APPROACH - MINA GRAND√â SUR, MINA GRAND√â CENTRO AND GOSSAN ZONES

## Block Model Configuration

Table 38 describes  the  block  model  configuration.    The vertical  and  horizontal  dimensions covered by the block model reflect the extent of regular diamond drilling and surface sampling in  these  zones.    The  block  model  setup  for  Mina  Grand√© Sur,  Mina Grand√© Centro and  Gossan  Zones  are  all  contained  in  the area defined  in the table below  but  each  was modelled and interpolated individually.

## Interpolation Using the 5% Zn Wireframe

The grade interpolation  used  the  values  as  described  previously  from  the  composited  sample data.    The  distribution  of  metals  is  not  uniform  in  any  of  these  three  zones.    The ireframes w interpreted from using Zn% values from assays and lithological units was therefore developed to  use  as  grade  shells  to  constrain  the  mineral  resource  estimates The   5%  Zn  value  was . applied  with  the  assumption  that  the  cut off  value  for  the  resources  would  be  approximately -twice the value used for the shell .  This was judged to be the best approach for developing a means  of  constraining  the  resources  due  to  the  very  irregular  distribution  of  metal,  and  the lack  of  a  clear  grade  or  geologically  efined  outer  border  to  the  mineralization  that  could  be d used as a hard boundary to constrain the resources.   Figure 14 shows the wireframes for Mina Grand√© Sur, Mina Grand√© Centro and Mina Grand√© Nort√© in plan view.

The  Gossan  wireframe  was  used  to  differentiate  areas  where  there  is  very  low de  zinc -gra mineralization  internal  to  both  the  Mina rand√©  Sur  and  Mina  Grand√©  Nort√©  wireframes. G These areas are characterised by drill holes that are either very poorly mineralized unmineralized  over  several  metres,  and  where  there  are  multiple  drill  holes  that  define  areas that display spatial continuity of very low-grade mineralization.  The grades from the intervals or

very in these  holes  average  2%  Zn  (Table  35)  and  the  Gossan  wireframe  constitutes  volumes  that therefore represent internal dilution within the hosting wireframes.  The boundary between the Gossan and its hosting wireframes is modelled as a hard boundary, however it is irregular.   Figure  1 5  depicts  the  Gossan  wireframe  as  a  green  line  nested  inside  the  Mina Grand√© Centro wireframe (red).

The grade interpolation for the Gossan and other zones utilised only composites from within their  respective  wireframes  to  populate  the  block  model.    This  prevented  smearing  of  grades between the blocks in each wireframe, but also resulted in instances where even though drill holes may have been closely spaced, there were fewer composites available within the search radius  of  a  block.    I these  instances  the  reduction  of  available  samples  in  the  search  radius n results in a reduction in the tonnage of resources  g bein classified as Indicated Mineral Resources.

## Grade Estimation Parameters

For all the blocks within the three Mina  Grand√© zones, grades were estimated using ordinary kriging (' OK ') methods. A minimum of 6 composites were needed within the ellipsoid for a block in order for that block to be included in the Indicated Mineral Resources. Additionally,  a  block  needed  to  have  composites  present  within  the  search  range  in  at  least three different octants with  a maximum  of  five  composites  per  octantbe  classified o as Indicated to limit the impact due to clustering of sample data.  Further, composites had to be available from a minimum to two drill holes in order for a block to be classified as Indicated . The  distinction between Indicated Mineral Resources and Inferred Mineral Resources explained further as follows.

## Estimation Parameters for Indicated Mineral Resources

The following search parameters were used for the estimation of Indicated Mineral Reso urces in all of the three zones:

‚Ä¢ Minimum # of composites: 6

‚Ä¢ Maximum # of composites: 24

‚Ä¢ Minimum # of holes: 2

‚Ä¢ Minimum # of octants with data: 3

‚Ä¢ Maximum # of composites per octant: 5

As the location, sampling protocol and QA/QC for the BO series and Zinc One drilling were validated by WGM's Qualified Person, those data were used to inform blocks with Indica ed t Mineral Resources. Composites were filtered by codes to indicate sample type and domain in which they were located.

the

The search  ellipsoids  used  were  isotropic  with  ranges  of  20 m nd  were  based  on  the  spatial a continuity  shown  by  the  experimental  variograms  (ee Table 36).    The  search  ellipse  for  the s Gossan  domain  which  was  extended  5 m  to  match  that  of  the  search  for  the  other  domains, however  this  had  no  impact  on  the  resource  estimates  as  there  are  no  indicated  or  inferred resources reported for that domain.  The average distance of samples for blocks classified as indicated for Mina Grand√© Sur was 12.2 m and for Mina Grand√© Centro it was 12.8 m.

## Estimation Parameters for Inferred Mineral Resources

If a block did not have enough composites within the search radius to be classified Indicated  Mineral  Resources,  a  second  interpolation  was  made  to  estimate  Inferred  Mineral Resources using an increased search ellipsoid with a range of 30  m for interpolation.  Drilling and surface samples were used to support the estimation of Inferred Mineral Resources . Approximately 94%  of the blocks in these zones meet the criteria to allow them to classified  as  Indicated  or  Inferred  Mineral  Resources,  however  there  are  peripheral  areas  in the block model with insufficient samples to support resource estimates.

## Results

Tables 39 and 40 list the resources for the Mina Grand√© Sur and Mina Grand√© Centro Zones. There are no estimates for the Gossan Zone presented as the grade was too low considered  for inclusion  in  the  resource  estimates .   A  cut-off  grade  of  10%  Zn  was  used  for the estimates.

## Interpolation Using the 5% Zn Wireframe

The grade interpolation  used  the  values  as  described  previously  from  the  composited  sample data.  The distribution of zinc is more uniform at Mina Grand√© Nort√© than in Mina Grand√© Sur or Mina Grand√©  Centro as there is no significant development of  -grade low gossan overprinting the zinc mineralization . However,  in  common  with  the  other  zones  of  zinc mineralization, there is also a very irregular distribution of metal and the lack of a clear grade or  geological  borde r  to  serve  as  a  well  defined  outer  limit  to  the  mineralization  that  could easily  be  used  as  a  hard  boundary  to  constrain  the  Mineral  Resources.    herefore  the  5%  Zn T value in assays, in conjunction with the logged lithological units, were used with the

<!-- image -->

assumption  that  the  cut -off  value  for  the  resources  would  be  approximately  twice  the  value used  for  the  shell     The   areas  to  the  north  and  east  of  Mina  rand√©  Centro  have  not  been . G sampled by drilling and are therefore the limits of mineralization in these area s not entirely  clear,  especially  at  depth .   Zinc  One  has  indicated  that  a  significant  drilling  program has  been  planned  to  explore  for  additional  mineralization  and  better  define  mineralization  in these areas.  The area to the immediate west was previously mined.

## Grade Estimation Parameters

For  all the  blocks  within  the  Mina  rand√©  Nort√©  wireframe,  grades  were  estimated  using G ordinary  kriging  (' OK ') methods . A  minimum  of  6  composites  were  needed  within  the search  ellipsoid  for  a  block  in  order  for  that  block  to  be  included  in  the  Indicated  Mineral Resources.  Additionally, a block needed to have composites present within the search range in at least three different octants with a maximum  of five composites per octant to classified as Indicated to imit l the impact due to clustering of sample  . datarther, Fu composites had to be available  from  a  minimum  to  two  drill  holes  in  order  for  a  block  to  be classified  as  Indicated  Mineral  Resources .   Details  concerning  the  classifications  of  Mineral Resources follow.

## Estimation Parameters for Indicated Resources

The following  search  parameters  were  used  for  the  estimation  of  Indicated  Resources  in  the Mina Grand√© Nort√© zone:

‚Ä¢ Minimum # of composites: 6

‚Ä¢ Maximum # of composites: 24

‚Ä¢

Minimum # of holes: 2

‚Ä¢ Minimum # of octants with data: 3

‚Ä¢ Maximum # of composites per octant:

5

As the location, sampling protocol and QA/QC for the BO series as well as Zinc One drilling were validated by a WGM Qualified Person, these data were used to inform blocks lassified c as  Indicated  Mineral  Resources .   Composites  were  filtered  by  codes  to  indicate  sample  type and the domain  in which they were located. There were considerably fewer drill relative to surface sampling in this area which in part accounts for a relatively lower tonnage of Indicated Resources relative to Inferred Resources.

The  search ellipsoids were based on the spatial continuity shown by the experimental variograms  (see Table 36).    The  search  ellipsoids  used  were  isotropic  with  ranges  of  25 m. The average distance of samples for blocks classified as indicated was 15.2 m.

## Estimation Parameters for Inferred Resources

If a  block  did  not  have  enough  composites  within  the  search  radius  to  be  classified  as  an Indicated Resource, a second interpolation was made to estimate Inferred Resources using an increased  search  ellipsoid  with  a  range  of  35 m.    I n this  case,  surface  sample  data  was  used with drill hole data to inform and support the estimate of Inferred Resources.   pproximately A 96% of the  blocks  in  the  Mina  Grand√© Nort√© wireframe  met  the  criteria  to  allow  them  to  be classified as Indicated or Inferred Mineral Resources.

## Results

## Interpolation Using the 5% Zn Wireframe

the

The grade interpolation  used  the  values  as  described  previously  from  the  composited  sample data.  All of the diamond drilling in Mina Chica was undertaken by Zinc One and in general it is  more  evenly  spaced  and  systematic  than  the  drilling  carried  out  elsewhere.    There  is  no apparent development of low-grade gossan overprinting the zinc mineralization.  However, in common with the other zones of zinc mineralization, there is also a very irregular distribution of metal  content  and  the  lack of a clear grade  or geological  border  outer controlling mineralization that could easily be used as a hard boundary to constrain the mineral resour ces. The lower boundary and eastern limit of the Mina Chica zone is marked by a regional thrust fault  that  strikes north- northwest and  dips  shallowly  to the southwest.    rther, Fu there are numerous sub-vertical faults that cut the zone and appear to have had horizontal and vertical displacements of several metres or more along them.

The  geometry  of  the  mineralized  zone,  as  a series of adjacent  -bounded  blocks,  was fault deduced  using  the  interpreted  faults  to  better  define  the  limits  of  the  zinc  mineralization. Statistical analyses showed there to be no significant differences in zinc mineralization between these blocks.  As the exact location of the faults was uncertain, they were not used as hard  boundaries  limiting  interpolation.   igure F 1 6  is a 3D  view  showing  the  Mina  Chica constraining wireframe with the four interpreted fault blocks depicted with different colours.

The 5%  Zn  value  in  assays,  in  conjunction  with  lithological  units  where  logged,  were  used with the assumption that the cut- off value for the resources would be approximately twice the value  used  for  the  shell  This  approach  is  consistent  with  that  used  for  the  Mina  and√© . Gr zones.  The areas to the north and northwest of Mina Chica have not been sampled by drilling, and  therefore  the  limits  of  mineralization  are  not  entirely  clear  in  this  areaThe  area  to  the . north  and  west  of  drill  hole  MCH8-035  is  particularly  interesting  as  this  is  the  last  hole -1 drilled in that area and it contains in excess of 20% zinc over a 30 metr e interval from 29.8 m to 59.8 m.

## Interpolation Using the 5% Zn Wireframe

The grade interpolation  used  the  values  as  described  previously  from  the  composited  sample data.   Like  in  the  Mina  Chica  area,  all  of  the  diamond  drilling  in  the  Bongarita  area  was undertaken  by  Zinc  One,  and  it  is  generally  more enly  spaced  and  systematic  than  the ev drilling elsewhere . There is no apparent development of gossan overprinting the zinc mineralization. Themineralization is slightly different here in the drill core and hand specimens in that it is very highly weath ered, fine grained and resembles a residual soil.   It is thought to be a highly decomposed carbonate rock.  There is an irregular distribution of metal at Bongarita, which is in common with the other  areas.  Figure 17 is a plan view showing the Bongarita wireframe west of the larger consolidated Mina Chica wireframe.

As  with  the  other  zones,  the  5%  Zn  value  in  assays,  in  conjunction  with  lithological  units where logged, were used with the assumption that the cut -off value for the Mineral Resources would be approximately twice the value used for the shell.

## Estimation Parameters for Indicated Resources

The following  search  parameters  were  used  for  the  estimation  of  Indicated  Resources  in  the Bongarita zone:

‚Ä¢

Minimum # of composites: 6

‚Ä¢ Maximum # of composites: 24

‚Ä¢ Minimum # of holes: 2

‚Ä¢

Minimum # of octants with data: 3

‚Ä¢

Maximum # of composites per octant: 5

As the location, sampling protocol and QA/QC for the Zinc One drilling were validated by a WGM  Qualified  Person,  those  data  were  used  to  inform  blocks  with  Indicated  Resources . Composites were filtered by codes to indicate sample type and the domain in  which they were located.    Compared  to  the  Mina rand√©  zones,  the  more  regular  pattern  of  closely  spaced G drilling  at  Bongarita  results  in  a  higher  percentage  of  the  total  resource  being  classified  as Indicated Resources relative to Inferred Resources.

The  search ellipsoids were based on the spatial continuity shown by the experimental variograms  (see Table 36).    The  search  ellipsoids  used  were  isotropic  with  ranges  of  25 m. The average distance of samples for blocks classified as indicated was 15.5 m.

## Estimation Parameters for Inferred Resources

If a  block  did  not  have  enough  composites  within  the  search  radius  to  be  classified  as  an Indicated Resource, a second interpolation was made to estimate Inferred Resources using an increased search ellipsoid with a range of 35  m.  Whereas Indicated Resources were informed only by drill hole data, both surface sample data and drill hole data were used to inform and support the estimation of Inferred Mineral Resources.

All of the blocks in the Bongarita wireframe met the criteria to allow them to be classified as Indicated or Inferred Resources.  However it is worth noting that due to the very thin vertical thickness of the mineralization, there is a thin veneer of mineralization (less than 2.5 m thick), that  extends on surface outside the wireframe  model  limits and  was  not included in estimate.

## 14.7 CUT-OFF GRADE

A cut-off grade of 10% Zn was used for the estimates for all zones .  This reflects a three-year average price for Zn of US $1.20/lb (https://economics.bmocapitalmarkets.com).  This cut-off was selected  for  the  purpose  of  examining  the  size  of  a  higher  grading  zinc  resource.   ere Th are  no  current  metallurgical  studies  for  the  Bongar√°  zic  mine  property  and  WGM makes no n assumptions with respect to recovery of zinc for the Mineral Resource estimates.

## 14.8 CLASSIFICATION

## CIM Definitions

The classification  of  the  Mineral  Resources  in  this  report  conforms  to  the  CIM  Definitions and  Standards  for  the  classification  of  Mineral  Resource  and  Mineral  Reserve  estimates  as adopted  by  CIM  Council  on  May  10,  2014  and  as  incorporated  in  Canada's  security  rule National Instrument 43-101 ('NI 43-101').

The classification  of  blocks  was  checked  manually  and  isolated  blocks,  or  small  groups  of isolated blocks, were reclassified to prevent inconsistent variations in localised classification.

Notes::

- 1. Resources  were  estimated  using  composites  within  constrained  block  models  with  block  dimensions  of  5x5x5m  and  using  ordinary kriging grade interpolation methods.

- 4. Mineral Resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability   The estimate of mineral resources may be . materially affected by commodity prices, environmental, permitting, legal, title, socio-political, marketing, or other relevant issues;
- 5. The quantity and grade of estimated Inferred Mineral Resources is uncertain in nature as there has been insufficient exploration o define t these  resources  as  an  Indicated  or  Measured  Mineral  Resource,  and  it  is  uncertain  if  further  exploration  will  result  in  up- ng  the gradi confidence level of Inferred Resources.
- 6. The Mineral Resources were estimated using the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurg and Petroleum (' y CIM ') Standards on Mineral Resources  and  Reserves,  Definitions  and  Guidelines  prepared  by  the  CIM  Standing  Committee  on  Reserve  Definitions  and  adopted by CIM Council May 10, 2014.

## 14.10   CHECKS OF RESOURCE ESTIMATES

## 14.10.1 ESTIMATION METHOD

As a means of validating the results of WGM's estimates, estimates were also done for uncut composites  and  using alternative methods (inverse distance squared  ID ) ( 2 and nearest neighbour) interpolations  for all  zones.  All  the  alternative  interpolations  matched  well  with the  Mineral  Resources  reported .    The   volumes  derived  from  the  block  model  estimates  are consistent with the independently derived volumes for the constraining wireframes.

## 14.10.2 SAMPLE GRADES AND BLOCK MODEL INTERPOLATED GRADES

Table 49 shows a compilation comparing composite grades to estimated blocks for all blocks (with no cut-off grade).  The  overall comparison is good.  The  slightly lower average sample grade  and  slightly  lower  average  block  grade  for  Inferred  Resource  blocks,  relative  to  the average grade of Indicated Resource blocks is a reflection of lower grade material in less well drilled areas  on  the  periphery  of  the  constrained  domains  as  the  limits  of  the  wireframes which were modelled at a 5% Zn cut-off grade.  The central, more densely drilled areas of the domains is generally characterised by better than average grades in drill holes.

## 14.10.3 VISUAL INSPECTION ON CROSS-SECTIONS AND PLANS

All of the block models were inspected on cross -sections and level plans.  The distribution of the  better  grade  blocks  matches  very  well  in  terms  of  location,  shape  and  grade  with  that  of the composites in drill holes.  Figure 18 is a plan view showing the grades of 3 m  composites in drill holes and the estimated block grades for the 2180 m elevation of the Mina Chica Zone.

In summary and in comparison with the base case using a 10% zinc cutoff grade, a decrease -in  the  cut -off  grade  to  5%  Zn  results  in  an  increase  in  the  total  Indicated  Resources  from 822,000  tonnes  averaging  18.9%  Zn  to  1.11 Mt eraging  15.9%  Zn.    A  similar increase av occurs  in  the Inferred  Resources  from  1.34 Mt eraging  16.8%  Zn  to  1.85 Mt veraging av a 14.4% Zn.  These increases in the  Indicated and Inferred Resources are equal to increases in the contained zinc metal of 14% and 17.5%, respectively.

These decreases in the Indicated and Inferred Resources are equal to decreases contained zinc metal of 22% and 33%, respectively.

## 14.12   RECONCILIATION

## 14.12.1 HISTORICAL PRODUCTION

Section 6.2 provides additional detail on past production.  Mine reconciliation tables for 2007 indicate  that 146,449  tonnes  of  ore  grading  19.3% Zn  were  mined  at  Mina  Grand√©.   During the first month of 2008, an additional 750 tonnes of ore grading 21.9% Zn was mined before production ceased. WGM  had insufficient data to permit a meaningful reconciliation regarding  past  production,  but  notes  that  the  average  grade  of  the  current  resource  estimates approximates the grade of the areas previously mined.

## 14.13   DISCUSSION ON OTHER MATERIAL FACTORS

any

The reader is referred to the other sections of this Technical Report for information regarding the extent to which the Mineral Resource estimates could be materially affected by known  environmental,  permitting,  legal,  title,  taxation,  socio- conomic,  marketing,  political e or  other  relevant  factors    Recovery  of  the  metals  reported,  metal  prices  and  the  impact  of . other  economic  factors  required  to  convert  the  Mineral  Reurces  to  Mineral  Reserves  may so potentially impact the current resources .  However, the author of this section is of the opinion that  the  Mineral  Resources  reported  are  consistent  with  the  2014  CIM  definitions,  viz. ' A Mineral Resource  is an inventory of mineralization that under realistically assumed  and justifiable technical and economic conditions might become economically extractable'.

## 15.  MINERAL RESERVE ESTIMATES

There  are  currently  no  Mineral  Resource  or  Mineral  Reserve  estimates  for  the  Property  at h are compliant with CIM Standards and Definitions as referenced in NI 43-101.

## 16.  MINING METHODS

Bongar√°

As  of the date of this report, no engineering work  has  been  carried out on the deposits  at Mina Grand√© and  Mina  Chica  to  ascertain  an  optimum  mining  technique.   iven G that the deposits are at or very near surface, open pit / open cut mining is envisioned.

## 17.  RECOVERY METHODS

At  this  time, no  new  metallurgical  studies  have  been  carried  out  relating  to  evaluating  ore beneficiation and metal recovery options.  Evidence suggests that an approach centred on the use of a Waelz kiln may offer the most  effective  alternative cost -as well as offering potentially the highest zinc recoveries.

## 18.  PROJECT INFRASTRUCTURE

in

Road access to the Mina Grand√© pits and the area drilled is well established by  un-improved roads that are muddy during the rainy season and best travelled using 4- heel drive vehicles, w however  access beyond this area is limited  walking  trails. to No recent investment infrastructure  has  been  made.   Electricity  is  generated  on -site  with  a  diesel  generator .   Water is delivered to the site by tanker truck.

## 19.  MARKET STUDIES AND CONTRACTS

No  market  studies  have  been  carried  out  by  the  owners  to  determine  the  future  salability  of zinc or related metals from the Property .  No contracts relating to the sale of zinc as calcined ore or more refined products have been entered into by Zinc One.

## 20.  ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES, PERMITTING AND SOCIAL OR COMMUNITY IMPACT

the

Zinc  One  has  maintained  the  Environmental  Impact  Assessment  (' EIA ')  granted  in  2007  to the operator at the time, Corianta. Over  the years that followed,  periodic environmental monitoring was carried out and when Forrester acquired the concessions in 2018, monitoring  program  has  included  monthly  sampling  of  water  at pecified  points  as  well  as s quarterly sampling of air and noise.

In  August  2018,  the  Ministry  of  Energy  and  Mining  approved  Forrester's  request  to  suspend the Mine Closure that was initiated when previous mining operations were suspended.  Within a  few months,  Forrester  posted  a  cash  bond  in  the  amount  of  approximately  US$1.7M;  this bond was reduced to approximately US$1.25M in October, 2018.

Subsequently, and with a signed community agreement, the 2018 drilling program was permitted  under  a  Technical  S ustaining  Report  (' ITS ').    The  purpose  of  this  drilling  was  to demonstrate  that  there  remained  sufficient  reserves  to  reitiate  mining.    This  permit  was -in granted  within  the  approved  second  modification  of  the  Mine  Closure  plan.    The  Company has recently applied for an extension to the end of 2020 by submitting the third modification of the Mine  Closure  plan given that the resource estimate discussed herein was  recently completed.    Once  approved,  the  Company  can  start  the  sampling  to  modify  the  EIA  in  order to sample and apply for a mine permit.

A  semi-detailed  EIA  is  presently  being  carried  out  for  the  continuing  exploration  work  that will  allow  Zinc  One  to  carry  out  exploration  in  areas  that  have  not  yet  been  disturbed.    An additional 364 platforms to drill 584 holes are planned; the application is in the final stages of review  at  this  writing.  Having  satisfied  all  regulatory  requirements  in  the  past,  there  are  no known reasons why approval of Zinc One's work program should not be expected.

of

Zinc One  signed a community  agreement  in July, 2017 and maintains the services community  engagement  representative  to  ensure  that  lines  of  communication  are  maintained with local villagers.  the responsibility for corporate social responsibility is managed directly by  Mrs.  Silvia  Dedios  who  is  the  general  manager  in  Peru  for  Zinc  One.    The  company  also has  a renewable  agreement  with  the  local  community  for  a  5 r  period  (2017  to  2022) -yea allowing the company access to the land for mineral exploration work.

## 21.  CAPITAL AND OPERATING COSTS

No  recent  studies  have  been  made  of  capital  and  operating  costs  to  develop  a  mine  on  the Bongar√° concession.

## 22.  ECONOMIC ANALYSIS

No current economic viability studies have been carried out on the Bongar√° concession.

## 23.  ADJACENT PROPERTIES

## 23.1 INTRODUCTION

Under  NI  43- 101 and in the context of this report, an 'Adjacent Property' is a mineral property with a boundary reasonably close to the boundary of the Bongar√° exploration licences.

## 23.2 FLORIDA CANYON EXPLORATION PROJECT

The adjacent Florida Canyon exploration property, located 19 km southwest of Mina Grand√©, is held by Solitario Exploration and Royalty. (' Corp Solitario ': TSX:SLR; NYSE MKT:XPL) through its wholly owned subsidiary, Votorantim.  The  Florida Canyon deposit is a  Mississippi  Valley -type  (' MVT ')  zinc -lead-silver  deposit  similar  to  Bongar√°  It  also  is . hosted in the carbonate formations of the  car√°  Group. Pu However, unlike the Bongar√° deposit which is hosted in the middle Condorsinga Fm., Florida Canyon is hosted in the lower part  of  the Chambar√° Fm. much  closer  to  the  base  of  the ucar√° Group.    The  San  Jos√©  zinc P prospect,  located  about  mid- way  between  Bongar √°  and  Florida  Canyon  is  hosted  in  the  midupper part of the hambar√°  Fm., C probably indicating potential for zinc mineralization throughout the Chambar√° and Condorsinga formations.

Florida Canyon is located along a valley at an elevation of 2660 m, about 500 m  igher than h Bongar√°.    Due  to  higher  rates  of  erosion,  both  sulphide  and  oxide  mineralization  is  found  at Florida Canyon, and it seems that as much as 50% of the mineralization remains in sulphides. The  mineralization is described as being hosted in  gently a folded and  faulted carbonate sequence with sulphide mineralization preferentially occurring in dolomitized mbar√° Cha

limestone between the fossiliferous Coquina and Intact Bivalve marker beds .  Diagenetic and mineralizing  fluids  migrated  along  structures  and  stratigraphic  units  with  favorable  porosity and  permeability.    The  deposit  consists  of  multiple  ellipsoidshaped  mineralized  bodies  that -are  stacked  within  a  vertical  interval  of  more  than  100 metres.   Manto  zones  are  1 -9 m thick and occur over an area of about 1 km y b 3  km. Unmineralized gaps exist within the mineralized manto zones, as is typical for hydrothermal replacement deposits regular . Ir steeply dipping replacement bodies also occur frequently at the intersection of  like veinfeeder  structures and in karstontrolled -c mineralization . The   deposit has been drilled at depths of up to 450 m  elow b surface. Zinc mineralization occurs as massive sphalerite, locally oxidized to smithsonite and hemimorphite whereas lead occurs as galena  is that oxidized to cerussite and anglesite.

Solitario filed a technical  report  dated  June  18,  2014  (prepared  by K)  on  the  Bongar√° SR Project,  as  Florida  Canyon  was  known  at  the  time,  states  that  the  consultants  audited  the earlier  Solitario  resource  estimate  fr  Florida  Canyon.    SRK  used  historical  information  to o develop  informed  assumptions  and  technical  in-ts  for  its pu own  3D  block  modelling  and resource estimate.  The project information base comprised drilling programs completed over a 15-year period including:

- ¬∑ 82 drill holes completed by Cominco totalling 24,781.19 m drilled from 1997 to 2000; and,
- ¬∑ 404 drill holes completed by Votorantim including 92,499.15 m of drilling completed from 2006 to 2013.

For  estimation  purposes,  no  assay  capping  was  justified  and  the  following  specific  gravity determinations were assigned to resource blocks:

‚Ä¢ Oxide Mineralization = 2.65 + ( 0.008 * ZN )

‚Ä¢ Sulphide Mineralization   = 2.786 + ( 0.016 * ZN ) + ( 0.037 * PB )

‚Ä¢ Mixed Mineralization = 2.685 + ( 0.016 * ZN ) + ( 0.042 * PB )

The  SRK  mineral  resources  for  the  Florida  Canyon  deposit  were  classified  as  follows  in Table 54.

The  metal  price  assumptions  used  by  SRK  for the calculation  of metal  equivalent  grades were:  Zinc  (US$/lb  0.95),  Lead  (US$/lb  0.95)  and  Silver  (US$/oz  20.00) Cut-off  grade 1 . calculations  assumed  variable  metallurgical  recoveries  as  a  function  of  grade  and  relative metal distribution.  Average metallurgical recoveries for sulfide and oxide respectively were: Zinc  (93.1%,  73%),  Lead  (84.8,  0%)  and  Silver  (55.6%,  0%)  based  on  a  p metallurgical yro approach to processing oxide-type mineralization.  NSR factors for calculating cut- off grades were: ZnEq% = Zn% * 1 + Pb% * 0.74 + Ag g/t * 0.02.  The  resulting cut-off grades used in this resource statement were 4.1% ZnEq for sulfide, 5.0% ZnEq for oxide, and 4.5% ZnEq for mixed material types.

Based  on  preliminary  metallurgical  testwork,  it  was  concluded  that  the  processing  of  sulfide mineralization  (zinc-lead-silver)  from  Florida  Canyon  would  use  conventional  flotation  to  a concentrate.  Potential processing scenarios were considered to optimize zinc extraction from oxide-type  resources  including  conventional  flotation  of  zinc  in  oxide  followed  by  onsite calcining and off-site smelting.  Other oxide process options include Heavy Media S eparation and  on-site  leaching  of  flotation  products  with  solvent  extraction  to  produce  zinc  cathode  on site. Theoperators planned additional testork -w to delineate the most costctive -effe processing methods for oxide-type zinc.  A site plan has been prepared by Solitario, however low zinc prices in recent years have stalled project development.  Capital costs were estimated at  $140  million  and  operating  costs  are  estimated  to  be  in  the  second  quartile  of  world  zinc production  costs.    Solitario's  current plans,  based  on  a  16 March,  2016  presentation,  is  to move the project forward with the knowledge that improved zinc markets will feed interest in the project.  No specific schedule has been announced for construction to begin or production to  commence.  It is  worth  noting  that  Solitario  refers  to  the  project  as  'Bongar√°'  and  not  by the name of the deposit as previously reported ('Florida Canyon').

## 25.  INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS

## 25.1 GEOLOGY

Zinc mineralization in the Bongar√° area is hosted within the Pucar√° Basin of western Peru, an elongate trough that extends more than 1,000 km and the entire length of the country along a NNW  trend.    The  basin  evolved  during  the  Mesozoic  associated  with  NW striking  sinistral -shearing  that controlled the development of internal structure, basin depth acies and f distributions.  The basin is host to a large number of zinc deposits and prospects that conform to the Mississippi Valley-type ('MVT') model.  Badoux et al (2001) relate the mineralization to metal-enriched basinal brines that were expelled from the deeper basin during late Andean orogenesis.    These  fluids  preferentially  circulated  in  permeable  zones  along  bedding  planes and brittle fracture/fault conduits, and deposited base metals sulphides  permeable in and reactive carbonate host strata.  Badoux specifically studied the San Vicente deposit in entral c Peru, however his fundamental findings are also applicable to the Bongar√° area.

The Bongar√° mineralization conforms in most respects to a carbonate ent -replacem mechanism  and  the  M VT model  is  seemingly  the  most  appropriate    However,  this  type  of . mineralization almost always is located at or near the base of the host limestone formation and yet the mineralization identified to date in the  Bongar√° area is located well above the base of the Pucar√° Group.  Local evidence suggests potential for mineral ization at lower levels in the stratigraphic  column.    Much  of  this  could  be  in  the  form  of  sulphide  ore  located  below  the limit of surface weathering (oxidation).

The geological and metallogenic model for the Bongar√° area is well enunciated in many of the project  reports,  and  supports  the  potential  for  additional  zinc  deposits  in  the  Bongar√°  area, both oxide-type and sulphide-type, near surface and at depth.  A wide range of formations are potential  hosts  including  the  Condorsinga  Fm. in  the  upper  part  of  the  Pucar√° Group  and  the Chambar√° Fm. in  its  lower  part.    Mineralization  is  associated  with  strong  dolomitization  of the host rocks.

the

The nearby Florida  Canyon  deposit  is  a  signi ficant  undeveloped  zinc  deposit  with  an initial resource  of  approximately  2.8 Mt  (Measured  and  Indicated)  plus  9.8 Mt Inferred)  with  an ( estimated grade in excess of  % Zn-equivalent. 12 While there is no guarantee that Bongar√°  area  will  exhi bit  similar  mineral  potential,  it  is  noteworthy  given  its  proximity  and shared  geological  characteristics,  and  especially  since  VT-type  deposit s  tend  to  occur  in M open  clusters.   Other  occurrences  in  the  area,  many  of  which  are  no  more  than  geochemical anomalies are thus highly prospective exploration targets.

## 25.2 EXPLORATION ON THE ZINC ONE CONCESSIONS

With the exception of a historical drilling program carried out during 2011 in the Cristal area, no  recent  exploration  has  been  completed  on the Charlotte Bongar√° concessions  since  2005. Until  the  recent  work  by  Zinc  One  that  is  the  subject  of  this  report,  no  exploration  had  been carried  out  on  the  Bongar√°  concessions  since  he  previous  limited mining  operation  during t 2007-08.   There  is  clear evidence for  zones  of  additional  mineralization  extending  to  the northwest through  Mina  Chica  and  Campo  Cielo,  and  extending  at  least  as  far  as  the ristal C prospects,  a  distance  of  as  least  7  km.   There  are  also  opportunities  for  additional  zones  of mineralization to be found at depth.  Additional exploration is clearly justified beginning with the major centres of mineralization as noted above.

initial

In  the past, the exploration  of the Bongar√°,  Mina  Chica,  Campo  Cielo,  Cristal  and  other prospects has relied on surface sampling (stream sediments, soils, rocks) for prospecting purposes to identify target areas.  I n the March 2011 report on Campo Cielo, the authors concluded that the recent exploration work (292 pit samples, 15 channel samples and 69 trench samples) identified the limestone horizon and the dolomitic alteration within it that could be used as a guide to future exploration.  The  goal of the proposed follow-up work was to  extend  the  mineralized  zone  on  the  eastern  end  of  Mina  Chica  towards ina Grand√©.    I n M the  Campo  Cielo  area,  the  hosting  role  of  the  upper  limestone  member  of  the  Condorsinga Formation  was  recognized,  a  unit  that  dips  70  NE  on  the  north -eastern  flank  of  the  eroded o Bongar√° Anticline . Theprinciple economic minerals were described as smithsonite, hemimorphite and 'a complex mixture of zinc oxides'.

The identification of targets for follow -up  exploration has been reasonably simple due to the strength of the zinc and lead anomalies detected .  Examples include Campo Cielo, Cristal and San  Jos√©.    Thefollow-up  exploration  tends  to  consist  of  hand-g  pits,  usually  about  one du square metre  in  area,  but  occasionally  much  larger  (2x3 m) where  deeper  surficial  cover  is &gt; present.  These pits, and more extensive trenches that have followed on some anomalies, have provided multiple samples over a vertical or horizontal profile, and when closely spaced have allowed the continuity of mineralization in both vertical and horizontal planes to be assessed, even  providing  for  preliminary  volumetric  calculations  of  Mineral  Resources.    is  worth It noting that not all anomalies have been attributed to bedrock sources on some of the Charlotte Bongar√° licenses (eg. at Alto Nort√©), and additional follow -up geochemical work needs to be done to vector towards the bedrock source.

Following the initial geochemical surveying, including bedrock sampling, some workers have recommended  geophysical  survey ing  as  a  means  of  isolating  targets  for  drilling Various . surveys  have  been  proposed  typically  employing  a  100 metr ine  (profile)  spacing e  l . The

<!-- image -->

surveying  under  consideration  has  included  magnetic,  electromagnetic  (' '),  resistivity EM induced  polarization (' IP ') and gravity surveying. However,  the  relatively unresponsive character of non-sulphide zinc-lead mineralization means that the anomalies detected, if any, will  be  very  subtle  with  the  possible  exception  of  gravity  anomalies Given  the  depth  of . weathering in the Bongar√° area, the presence of sulphides within 100 m  of surface is unlikely except in river valleys where  the rate of erosion is sufficiently high to remove  oxidized mineralization. Even here, however, the major ore minerals sphalerite alena and g are nonmagnetic  and  nonpolarizable,  and  so  no  not  respond  well  to  conventional  geophysical techniques. Pyrite, which  is  ubiquitous  in MVT pe  deposits  does  produce  excellent  IP -ty chargeability anomalies, however no such mineralization has been seen  at Bongar√°.  Whether oxide-type  or  sulphide,  larger  deposits  also  produce  strong,  if  localized,  gravity  anomalies however  this  surveying  technique  tends  to  be  very  expensive  as  it  requires  very  precise  3D topographic control.  Gravity surveying is rarely a technique of first choice to be applied over a large rugged area.

From a pragmatic perspective, diamond drilling has been the followup method of choice for -exploring  targets  based  on  geochemical  anomalies Given  the  largely   in-situ  nature  of  the . anomalies associated with mineralization, definitive geochemical surveys have led directly to diamond  drilling.   Given  the  near -surface  setting  of  the  mineralization  at Mina Grand√© and Cristal,  the  drilling  programs  have  utilized  a  srt-hole  approach,  typically  drilling  vertical ho holes to a depth of less than 100 m.

During a site visit in 2011, Anglo Peruana Terra S.A.  ollected 8 samples that demonstrated c very  low  levels  of  'contaminants'  in  high-rade  zinc  mineralization  as  shown  as  follows  in g Table 55 (David Davila, July 2011).  Notably, sulphur contents were very low at 0.04%, and average contents for selected indicator elements were m As, 7 pp 3  ppm Co, 4 ppm Cr, 32 ppm Cu, &lt;10 ppm Ga, 4 ppm Hg, 4  ppm Mo, 26 ppm Ni and 2 ppm b.    The  author S concluded that  the  mineralization  was  typical  MVTtype  and  that  its  samples  compared  well -with previously reported Corianta samples.

Despite a lack of drilling, a letter dated 13 June, 2011 from Engineer J.R  Torres of Corianta . S.A.  to Amazonas  includes  attachments  indicating (or reiterating?) resource estimates for Mina  Grand√©, Mina Chica, Bongarita and Campo  ielo, C the latter estimated   to 2 contain 450,000 tonnes averaging 15 m wide and 30 m deep over a strike of 500 m (S.G. = 2.0 t/m ). 3 Further  exploration  is  proposed  in  a  1 km ng  and  250 m  wide  SE -trending  zone  on  the lo eastern limb of the anticline along the trend and just north of Mina Chica and  Mina Grand√© to locate  the  possible  extension  of  the  mineralized  zone  that  was  located  in  the  po  Cielo Cam area. Further diamond  drilling to discover potential primary  Pb Znsulphides -below the oxidized  zone  is  also  recommended,  these  holes  to  be  put  down  in  a  500 m  ion  of  the sect Campo Cielo prospect.  These holes were expected to add another approximately 1,000,000 tonnes  of  new  oxide  resources  to  the  existing  resource  including  some  potential sulphide resources . 3

Interestingly,  this  letter  contains  an  estimate  of  the  Mina  Chica  mineral  reserves,  known  as 'Pit D', which is not reported in any other source reviewed by WGM.  The historical estimate follows (note the lack of CIM standard compliance in terminology):

| Classification   | Zone   | Tonnes   |   Zn (%) |
|------------------|--------|----------|----------|
| Proven           | Pit  D | 16,740   |     19.9 |
| Probable         | Pit  D | 22,940   |     18.6 |
| Possible         | Pit  D | 1,860    |     15.2 |

Similar  speculative  'reserves '  that  were  not  based  on  drill  holeata  and  therefore  cannot d meet NI 43-101 requirements, were noted at Mina Chica as follows:

| Classification   | Zone   | Tonnes   | Zn (%)   |
|------------------|--------|----------|----------|
| Proven           | Pit  B | none     | ------   |
| Probable         | Pit  B | 26,580   | 23.40    |
| Possible         | Pit  B | 19,220   | 21.10    |

It  is  interesting  to  note  that  the  aforementioned  historical  gradesven  though  they  are  not , e compliant with current  CIM standards,  do  approximate  the  grades  of  WGM's current (2019) Mineral Resource estimate.

During its first site visit in 2014, WGM noted that some more recently established points were measured using the WGS 84 -datum as compared to the PSAD -56 (Peru) datum more pervasively  used  for  all  projects   this  contribut ed  to  some  co -ordinate  conversion  issues . -Zinc  One has  put  in  place  a  digital  topographic  model  that  corrects  these  past  errors,  at  least insofar  as  correcting  the  location  of  pits,  trenches  and  drill  holes  collars  that  can  be  clearly identified and associated with historical data.

A  high  degree  of  block  faulting  has  developed  in  the  Bongar√° istal  area,  probably  as  a -Cr result  of  long -lived  growth  faults  during  basinal  subsidence.    These  are  represented,  together with  circular  lineament  features,  by  green  lines  in  the  following  figure  igure  19) extracted (F from  the  Corianta  S.A . report  entitled  ' Informe  de  Exploraciones  del  Sector  'Campo  Cielo' Bongar√°'  (J.R .  Torres  and  S.E .  Basilio,  March  2011) .    Many  of  the  photos  in  this  report record loosely consolidated mineralization  at th the authors describe as arst-type' 'k mineralization. However,  the  photos  show  no  evidence  of  dissolution cavities, aragonite formation  or  other  features  that  might  normally  be  associated  with  such  cavities   Given  the . prevalence of axial-parallel (NW-trending) and axial normal (NE-trending) faults in this area, this broken style of mineralization may  be  occurring in fault zones and more  accurately described as breccia-style.  Similar mineralization is seen at Mina Grand√© although one small karst feature was noted in association with aragonite development.

The authors of the Campo Cielo report concluded that the longitudinal extension of the known mineralized  'mantle'  is  500  m,  within  which  many  mineralized  outcrops  are  p ent.    The res mineralization was well documented in seven trenches with a profile spacing of 50 m to 75 m. The authors recommended that follow -up work be carried out to extend the mineralization to the southeast approximately 1,000 metres using pits, trenches and follow-up diamond drilling

of to delineate additional bodies of non- phide sul zinc mineralization and test for primary sulphide mineralization. WGM  believes  this  is a reasonable approach given the lack exploration in this and other areas.

As part of the previous feasibility study, 19 samples were selected of six different rock types to  develop  an  average  specific  gravity  value  for  the  deposit  which  was  1.6  g/cm ased  on 3 b weighting  individual  results  by  the  abundance  of  each  rock  type  in  the  sample  population. Kalinaj  objected  to  this  approach  saying  that  the  lithology  database  was  not  representative given  the  collection  methods  used,  and  that  the  use  of  a  universal  tonnage  conversion  factor within  such  a  deposit  was  inappropriate  given  the  variations  observed  in  the  mineralization. WGM agrees  with  this  and  furthermore  agrees  with alinaj's  solution  of acquiring  specific K gravity  data  on  a  much  larger  sample  population  base     The   data  should  be  collected  from . representative  lithologies  in  each  drill  hole  before  the  core  is  chemically  analysed . WGM believes  that  the  best  method  to  model  the  deposit  is  to  use  such  data  to  assign  a  specific gravity  (density  factor)  t  every  sample  in  each  hole,  and  to  effectively  produce  a  density o model for the deposit.  The  S.G. database must contain data on the full range of assay values in  the  deposit  and  in  all  lithologies     This  approach  will  ensure  that  the  effects  of  anomalous . samples are adequately controlled, whether more or less dense or higher or lower grade.

Iassessing  the  potential  of n Campo Cielo, the author concluded that it should have much of the same (dimensions  and  grade)  as  Mina  Grand√©  (and  Cristal),  but  that  local  topogphical  factors ra (terrain) would influence the ultimate resource present Thecompany . recommended an exploration program of diamond drilling to explore below the known areas of mineralization and to cautiously extend these zones outwards through contouring the zinc values, features, dolomitization etc., as isolines to guide the planning of future exploration drill holes . WGM  strongly  recommends  the  use  of  metal  content  contouring,  for  example  as  grade -thickness isolines, as a means of detecting trends in the mineralization   A low cut-off should . be tried, for example 1% Zn, to ensure the contours reflect the total metal 'budget' in the host formation. Caution should be used in combining zinc plus lead as the characteristics differ and the distribution of lead may be dissimilar from that of zinc.

The resource implications of karst are not  insignificant since karst-fill mineralization is likely to  have  limited  point -to-point  (triaxial)  continuity  whereas  mineralization  occurring  in  fault zones should have excellent continuity along the plane of the structure.

## 25.3 HISTORICAL MINERAL RESOURCES

In WGM's opinion, the Geoval historical resource estimate suffers from sufficient procedural issues that it should not be relied upon for future mine planning purposes   Based on WGM's . review  of  the  interpolation  procedures  and  inputs,  we  believe  that  the  gre  of  the  resources ad are potentially overstated since no limits were placed on the number of samples derived from a  single  drill  hole .    Although  we  were  unable  to  duplicate  the  reported  tonnages,  the  tonnage estimates  seem  reasonable  given  the  reported olume.    An  answer  to  grade  issues  may  be v gained  by  comparing  the  predicted  and  recovered  grades  from  the  mining  and  processing  of Bongar√°  ore.    This  information  was  not  available  as  part  of  the  information  base  for  this review.

On  the  basis  of  WGM's  exploratory  data  analysis  and  he  grade  distribution  of  zinc ssay t a data, a 40% zinc top cut grade was applied to assay values before compositing. difference  in  contained  metal  between  the  uncut  and  cut  grades  for  the  resource  est es imat ranges from about 0.5% to 7% depending on the domain.

A  5x5x5m  block  model  was  used  for  each  zone  with  grades  interpolated  into  constrained domains using ordinary kriging.

The 10%  Zn  cut -off  value  used  for  the  2019  resource  estimates  is  based  on  tthree  year he average metal price US $1.20/lb for Zn.  This grade also approximates the cut -off used during past mining operations.  There are no current metallurgical studies for the property and WGM makes no assumptions with respect to recovery of zinc for the Mineral Resource estimates.

The  following notes are important to the understanding of the aforementioned report Mineral Resources:

- 1. Resources  were  estimated  using  composites  within  constrained  block  models  with  block dimensions of 5x5x5m and using ordinary kriging grade interpolation methods.
- 2. Top cuts at a grade of 40% Zn were applied to Zn grades of assays before compositing.
- 3. Zn% grades can be converted by applying a conversion factor of 22.046 pounds per Zn% to obtain lbs of Zn per metric tonne.
- 4. A Bulk Density of 1.90 was applied using the geological block model density field.
- 5. The quantity  and  grade  of  estimated  Inferred  Mineral  Resources  is  uncertain  in  nature  as there has been insufficient exploration to define these resources as an Indicated Measured  Mineral  Resource,  and  it  is  uncertain  if  further  exploration  will  result  in  upgrading the confidence level of Inferred Resources.

- 6. The Mineral Resources were estimated using the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum Standards on Mineral Resources and Reserves, Definitions and Guidelines prepared  by  the  CIM  Standing  Committee  on  Reserve  Definitions  and  adopted  by  CIM Council May 10, 2014; and mandated in National Instrument 43-101/

Exploration  drilling  along  the  trend  between  Mina  Chica  and  Campo  ielo and C 6 kilometres  farther  to  the  Cristal  zinc  prospect  area  should  be  considered  in  future lling dri programs.

## 25.5 MINERAL PROCESSING

The recovery  of  zinc  from  Bongar√°  ore  has  been  demonstrated  Great  advances  have  been . and are being made  in the treatment of  -sulphide non or oxide -type zinc -lead-silver ores . Additional  work  is  justified  to  update  and  refine  the  Bongar√°  flowsheet  working  from  the information already available from previous studies in combination with data from new studies planned by Zinc One.

## 26.  RECOMMENDATIONS

## 26.1 BONGAR√Å EXPLORATION

WGM recommends that Zinc One execute its plan to continue exploring along the 8-kilometre long mineralized trend passing through Mina  and√© Gr and Mina Chica and extending 6 kilometres to the north- orthwest n into the Cristal area . The   mineralization in pits and trenches  at  Campo  Cielo  lies  within  this  gap.    Equal  importance  should  be  given  to  in l -fil drilling  the  areas  of  the  high -grade  zinc  deposits  at  Mina  Grand√©,  Mina  Chica  and  Bongarita to  up-grade  the  confidence  level  of  the  Inferred  Mineral  Resources  as  well  as  to  extend  the boundaries  of  such  mineralization.    o  this t end, Zinc  One  has  applied  to  the  Ministry  of Energy and Mining for approval to drill 583 holes from 364 platforms along the 1.4 kilom etre long ridge from Mina Grand√© Sur to and beyond Mina Chica.  WGM believes this approach to be  in  the  best  interests  of  the  project  in  providing  for  some  flexibility  in  approach  when  the actual drilling is done.

Indicated

WGM  believes  that  the  drilling  plan,  which  allows  for  in ll  drilling  of  282  diamond  drill -fi holes  from  141  platforms  using  a  nominal  30- etre  grid  spacing,  should  be  adequate  for  the m purpose of up- rading g portions of the deposits from Inferred Resources to Resources in anticipation of a Feasibility Study at some future date.

Zinc One's plan to drill from 223 platforms in other areas is also warranted on the basis of the demonstrated occurrence of high grade zinc mineralization in the Bongar√° area.  Those holes that  explore  for  new  mineralization  are  planned  on  a  nominal  50-tre  drilling  grid.    Zinc me One and WGM have discussed ways of selecting targets, and WGM agrees that historical test pit data is useful even if the precise location of the test it cannot be found due to vegetation p overgrowth.  Old test pits were commonly shallow and ended in zinc mineralization.  Areas of stunted vegetation are also prospective due to the toxicity effects of  ade high- inc gr z mineralization.

WGM  believes  that  Z nc i One  should consider a conventional soil geochemical  sampling program  in  the  gap  area  between  Mina  Chica  and  the  Cristal  area  with  profile  lines  on  a 100 m spacing and sample stations 25 m apart on each profile.  Covering the 6-ilometre gap k would require approximately 60 profiles each approximately 1,000 m in length (or 40 samples per profile = 2,400 samples).  The estimated additional cost to the exploration program would be approximately $75,000 in operating and laboratory costs.

best any

Zinc One has develop d e quality control protocols that are consistent with industry practices. These protocols must be continued to ensure data quality and to detect potential data that may not be representative.

Zinc  One  has  established  a  digital  elevation  model  ovr  the  Bongar√°  area  and  this  should  be e sufficient for the planned drilling, however if necessary it should be extended and confirmed through instrumental (Total Station or similar) surveying.  GM W also recommends that survey  control  be  improved  by  means  of stablishing  additional  permanent  monuments  in e each deposit area to be used for more precise measurements of drill hole  inates. co -ord Establishing  the  co -ordinates of these  monuments  by  means  of  otal  Station  instrumental T surveying from known points, or by differential GPS, would provide the precision needed for more advanced exploration or potential development work.

There  is  a  need  for  the  project  information  base  to  have  more  detailed  lithology  and  bulk density  data  for  the  major  lithologies  in  the  deposits,  including  mineralization  types.    As  a component  of  its  proposed  metallurgical  testing  program,  WGM  recommends  that  Zinc  One continue its on-going work to establish a truly representative specific gravity model for each type  of  mineralization.    With  respect  to  improving  the  data  available  for  Mineral  Resource estimation, two recommendations are made:

- 1) RQD  and  core  recovery  data  should  continue  to  be easured  and  entered  ino  the  drill m t hole database in a consistent manner for all future drill holes.

typical

- 2) The measurement of specific gravity in core samples should be increased together with the collection of bulk density measurements from large volume pit samples in mineralization  to  be  used  to  provide  better  data  for  modelling  the  density  of  the  zones comprising the Bongar√° zinc mine project.

## 26.2 ECONOMIC STUDIES

In the  near  future,  Zinc  One  should  complete  a  Preliminary  Economic  Assessment  (' PEA ') which  is  allowed  under  NI  4301  rules  to  include  the  use  of  both  Indicated  and  Inferred -1 Mineral Resources.    The  costs  for  this  are  included  in  the  proposed  budget.    Theurpose  of p the  PEA  should  be  to  assess  the  potential  outcomes  of  mining  the  Bongar√°  deposits  under various mining and processing models.  The results of such studies are indicative only and are not  definitive  in  terms  of  final  outcomes,  however  PEAs  are  very  useful  at  any  stage  of  a project to answer such questions as:

- ¬∑ What grade - tonnage threshold is needed for an economically viable operation?

<!-- image -->

- ¬∑ Does the project  require  additional  re sources  (tonnes)  at  the  same  (average)  grade,  or does the project require additional resources at a higher grade?
- ¬∑ What mining rates would the current resource base support?
- ¬∑ What might the financial model deliver to owners at this time in terms of profits?

In support of a PEA, Zinc One should review any historical production and metallurgical test data that is available. Zinc One should undertake benchscale testing of representative mineralization from each of the major mineralized zones at Bongar√°.

## 26.3 COMMUNITY OUTREACH

Zinc  One  should  continue  its  program  of  addressing  environmental  and  logistical  questions posed  by  the  Ministry  of  Energy  and  Mining,  which  will  confirm  that  its  proposals  comply with existing regulations and allow the Ministry to grant future permits.

Zinc One should continue with its community outreach and engagement programs, and when possible, the employment  of  local  labour to allow the community  at  large  to observe operations and to avoid potential misunderstandings.

its

## 26.4 LICENCE ACQUISITION

The Pucar√° Basin in western Peru is a major zinc provenance that extends virtually the entire length of the country.  The MVT deposits that have been identified, in sulphide or in oxidized form,  are  of  a  class  that  is  known  to  cluster.    As  such,  the  up-   exploration  potential  is side obvious. WGM  recommends that nc Zi One be mindful of and give consideration to opportunities to acquire additional licences in the Bongar√°  area,  including  any  that  cover high-grade zinc prospects such as San Jos√© and Florida (formerly known as the Camboca NW prospect) which seem to be located on the main trend that passes through the Florida Canyon deposit  3.5  km  farther  to  the  south.    Although  access  is  not  easy,  staged  exploration  out  of prospect-specific  camps  offers  the  benefits  of  cost control  and  time -efficient  work  programs -in  a  manner  very  similar  to  the  use  of  fly amps  in  Canada's  remote  regions     The  existing -c . trails will need to be brushed out to allow access by ATV.

Beginning with Bongar√°, Miroslav Kalinaj recommended continuing with  systematic the study of  specific weights  of high-grade  ore and increasing  the  proportion of  lithologies  and samples represented with greater than 5% Zn as these are likely to have the greatest impact on

resource  modelling.    He  also  recommended  detailed  modelling  of  the  various  zones  using more closely spaced sections to facilitate resource modelling, a detailed topographic survey of the mineralized trend was also recommended and continuous surveying to ensure pit and drill hole locations are precisely known.  Challenges involving the use of the PSAD 56 datum need to  be  resolved.  Continued exploration  and  diamond drilling was  recommended in areas  near Mina  Grand√©  and Mina Chica for the purpose discovering of continuations of the mineralization in untested areas.  WGM concurs will all of these recommendations.

It  is  clear  that  both  the  Condorsinga  Fm.  and  the  underlying  Chambar√°  Fm.  are  viable  hosts for MVT -type deposits. n  respect I to exploration targeting, however, it is important recognize that no mineralization has been observed in strata above the middle member of the Condorsinga  even  in  areas  where  the  middle  member  is  well  mineralized,  such  as  at  ristal. C The  Aramachay Fm. is not apparently mineralized although little if any work has specifically  directed  at  testing  it  (the  Aramachay  was  drilled  in  several  deep  holes  that  were directed  at  testing  the  upper  to  middle  Chambar√°)  The  Chambar√°  Fm.  exists  at  a  depth  of . somewhat greater than 400 m below the Mina  Grand√© workings.

This G area represents an opportunity to explore the Chambar √° for sulphide and oxide mineralization hosted similarly to Florida Canyon.  More specifically, the NE dipping limb of this fold will -intersect  the  Chiriaco  thrust  fault  in  the  area  between  Campo  Cielo  and  Cristal  providing  a setting suitable for mineralization.  Other areas of outcropping Chambar√° Fm. located west of Cristal  where  the  favourable  sequence  rests  unconformably  on  basement  represent  eas  of ar zinc potential that should be explored.

Using the  rdinates coo provided that  are reportedly referenced to the 'SAM56' datum, the site is located in an area of Sarayaquillo Formation or possibly  even  the  Goyllarisquizga  Formation  in  the  down-dropped  fault  block  opposite  from Bongar√°, that is, across the Chiriaco Thrust Fault.  This setting seems unlikely for carbonate -replacement  mineralization,  especially  given  the  description  of  limestone  in  this  areaThe . most reasonable explanation for the conflict probably lies in the co-ordinates given, either as a measuring error or through the use of a datum other than PSAD 56 (Peru).  Using the SAM --56 datum versus the PSAD -56 datum results in a shift of only 7 m on the ground.  It is clear therefore  that  the  coordinates  were  not  measured  using  either  of  these  datums  or  WGS 4 --8 (which would place the point even farther to the northwest).  Given the geology, the reported presence  of  pyrite,  sphalerite  and  galena  mineralization,  and  the  high  grades  reported,  this

Strong st ream-sediment and soil anomalies at  e th Florida and San Jose  inc z prospects demonstrate the presence of economically interesting mineralization, and unlike at Cristal and Bongar√°,  zinc  is  hosted  in  the  Chambar√°  Formation  in  a  setting  potentially  the  same  as  the Florida  Canyon  deposit  a  few  kilometres  farther  to  the  south.    If  these  areas  can  be  acquired by Zinc One, additional exploration should be based on conventional soil and stream sediment sampling.  WGM recommends the use of an auger to sample consistently at 1-metre depths on a  grid  using  50- metre  stations  on  100metre  spaced  profile  lines  normal  to  the  trend  o the f zone.    The   samples  should  be  collected  consistently  from  the  lower  10 cm  of  the  holes  and analysed using and ICP -based multi-element geochemical package that includes base metals, silver and the major indicator elements.   All anomalies should be followed up with test pits to allow  sampling  to  be  carried  out  to  identify  vertical  geochemical  profiles   I n the  extensive . area  surrounding  San  Jose,  stream  sediment  sampling  is  probably  a  more  practical  and  cost -effective means of initial geochemical covera ge.  All tributaries irrespective of size should be sampled to ensure a sample density of at least 5 samples per square kilometre.

to of

WGM  encourages on- oing g testing of mineralization to identify processing options maximize  th e  value  of  the  ore.    The ow  lead  and  silver  grades  seen  to  date  may  not  be l indicative of the mineralization in new  zones. Therefore Zinc One  should be aware alternative processing techniques.  Processing considerations must also take into consideration current and future infrastructure availability in the Bongar√° area.

## 26.6 PUBLIC DIALOGUE

Yambrasbamba is the central village among a total of 12 villages that encompass the district: Perla Mayo, Vilcaniza, Tambillo, Shucayacu, Buenos Aires, La Esperana, Miraflores, Santa z Rosa, La Florida, San Jos√© de Yambrasbamba, and Perla de Imaza, all of which are proximal to the main highway.

In the context of community e ngagement, the local residents in the Yambrasbamba area have been involved with the project over a long period of time.  Groupo Amazonas engaged several societal  specialists  to  ensure  its  operations  were  conflict  free.    WGM  had  the  opportunity  to meet with one of these individuals during its first site visit in 2015.

A formal agreement was signed on July 5, 2017, to allow access to the Project for  five  years  during  the  exploration  stage  and  included  financial  support  for  a  planned  and structured reforestatio n project, various social programs, preferential treatment of residents for unskilled labor and prioritized consideration for skilled labor, among things.

Zinc  One has  retained  the  services  of  a  community  engagement  representative  to  ensure  that lines  of communication  are  maintained  with  local  villagers .    The  responsibility  for  corporate social responsibility is managed directly by Mrs. Silvia Dedios who is the gene ral manager in Peru for Zinc One.  The  company is also engaged directly with the Government in acquiring approvals for the construction of pads for drill sites. This requires the approval of an environmental  instrument  called  a  Technical  Sustaining  nstrument  (' I ITS ')  that  includes  a mine closure plan.  A modification to this plan was required to give the company approval to explore in the previously disturbed and now remediated terrain.

Many

Zinc One has been proactive in engaging with local residents and should continue to do so to ensure that Zinc One and local inhabitants and their representatives are aware of each other's concerns and that Zinc One has the opportunity to mitigate adverse impacts. exploration companies have found a ready and willing workforce in the local villages close to exploration  sites.    As  Zinc  One's  work  is  mainly  drilling  in  brownfields  areas  that  are  not treaty  land  or  land  subject  to  a  land  claim,  WGM  understands  that  very  little  consultative work may actually be required.

Zinc One should develop an open dialogue with other companies working in the area that may be  in  the  same  situation  in  respect  to  its  nearby  project.    Future  development  planning  will require  that  Zinc  One  study  the  implications  of  new  legislation  and,  deemed  necessary, if engage suitable counsel to give it guidance relevant to its planning process.

the local

or of

The proposed exploration program covers a 12- month period and is considered a single phase of  exploration as the PEA will be carried out as an integral component of the work program. Diamond drilling in the Campo ielo  area C (3,000 m) is optional and dependent on availability of adequate funds to cover the cost of this drilling. No  additional overhead costs are associated with this drilling as these will be incurred irrespective whether the Campo Cielo work is completed or not.

WGM is  in  general  agreement  with  Zinc  One  in  respect  to  its  proposed  exploration  drilling program.  The estimated cost base used for the proposed budget is reasonable in our opinion and well justified buy the results to date.
