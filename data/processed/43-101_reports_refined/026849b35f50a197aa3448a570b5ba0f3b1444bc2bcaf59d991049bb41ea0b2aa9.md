## 1 Summary

This  report  was  prepared  as  a  Canadian  National  Instrument  43- 01  (NI  43- 101)  Technical  Report, 1 Updated Preliminary  Economic  Assessment  (PEA)  for  NioCorp  Developments Ltd. (NioCorp or  the Company) by SRK Consulting (U.S.), Inc. (SRK), nd  Roche a Ltd, Consulting Group  Roche), ( (collectively  referred  to  as  the  Consultants)  on  the  Elk  Creek  Niobium  ject  (Elk  Creek  or  the Pro Project) located in southeast Nebraska. ioCorp  was N formerly known as Quantum Rare Earth Developments Corp. (Quantum), but changed its name to NioCorp effective March 3, 2014.

## 1.1 Property Description and Ownership

Elk  Creek  is  an  early  stage  exploration  project  located  in  southeast  Nebraska,  USA.  It  is  located approximately  75  kilometers  (km)  southeast  of  Lincoln,  Nebraska  he  state  capital ),  and  110  km (t south of Omaha, Nebraska. The mineralization is centered about  6'0.3.5' 40¬∞ 1 N latitude and 96¬∞11'08.5'  E  longitude.  The  area  is  well  developed  with  direct  access  to  roads,  rail,  supply  and distribution companies, and a local work force including heavy equipment operators. Geologist s can be sourced from local universities. An experienced mining related workforce can be found in Denver Colorado  (eight -hour  drive  west  of  the  Project).  The  deposit  is  located  within   U.S.  Geological the Survey (USGS) Tecumseh Quadrangle Nebraska SE (7.5 minute series) mapsheet in Sections 1- , 6 9-11; Township 3N; Range 11 and Sections 19-23, 25-36; Township 4N, Range 11.

The Property consists of 21 option agreements covering approximately 1,796 hectares (ha), of which the Company currently hold 15 active agreements (1,216 ha), with the remaining 7 agreements currently undergoing re- gotiation. ne Option agreements are between  ioCorp's N subsidiary Elk Creek Resources Corp. (ECRC) and the individual land owners. ECRC is a Nebraska based wholly owned subsidiary of NioCorp. NioCorp retains 100% of the mineral rights to the Project and is the operator. The agreements are in the form of ear  pre-paid five y Exploration Lease Agreements (ELAs), with an Option to Purchase (OTP) the mineral rights and/or the surface rights  at any time during the term of the  agreement. The individual land owners have title to the surface and subsurface  rights,  and  the  agreements  are  primarily  with  respect  to  only  the  mineral  and  surface interest of each property. The agreements convey to the Company adequate surface rights to access the  land  and  to  complete  the  exploration  work. The  options  agreements  that  the  company  currently holds include all of the indicated and inferred resources described in this report.

option

## 1.2 Geology and Mineralization

The  Project  includes  the  Elk  Creek  Carbonatite  (the  Carbonatite)  that  intruded  older  Precambrian granitic and low to medium grade metamorphic basement rocks. Both the Carbonatite Precambrian rocks are interpreted to be unconformably overlain by approximately 200 meters ( m) of Paleozoic marine sedimentary rocks of Pennsylvanian age. As a result of this thick cover, there is no surface outcrop within the Project area of the Carbonatite, which was identified and targeted through magnetic surveys and confirmed through subsequent  drilling. The available magnetic data indicates dominant northeast, west-northwest striking lineaments, and secondary northwest and north oriented features that mimic the position of regional faults parallel and/or perpendicular to the Nemaha Uplift.

The  Carbonatite  hosts significant niobium (reported as Nb5), 2 O titanium (reported as TiO 2 ) and scandium (Sc) and is composed predominantly of dolomite, calcite and ankerite, with lesser chlorite, and

the economic

barite, phlogopite, pyrochlore, serpentine, fluorite, sulfides and quartz. Niobium is contained primarily within  the  mineral  pyrochlore,  and  rare  earth  element  (REE)  mineralization  is  reported  to  occur  as b√§stnasite, parisite, synchysite and monazite. Niobium has been the main element of interest for the current study, but recent developments since the November 2014 Technical Report within metallurgical  testwork  indicates  the  potential  to  recover  TiOnd  Sc O3  as  part  of  the  proposed 2 a 2 process flowsheet. Work remains on-going to optimize and further test this at a pilot stage, but based on the work completed to date SRK  considers these elements to have potential for extraction and therefore are discussed in the Technical Report, and included in the Mineral Resource Estimate.

## 1.3 Status of Exploration, Development and Operations

Drilling at the Project was conducted in three phases. The first was during the 1970's and 1980's by the Molybdenum  Company  of  America  (Molycorp),  the  second  in  2011  by  Quantum,  and  the  third and latest program in 2014 by NioCorp. To date, 129 diamond core holes have been completed for a total  of  64,981  m  over  the  entire  geological  complexOf these a  total  of  48  holes  (33,909  m) have . been completed to date in the mineralized area and used in the current Mineral Resource Estimate.

Five  holes  for  a  total  length  3,353.1  m,  of  additional  drilling  been  drilled  since  the  completion  of  the April 28, 2015 Mineral Resource Estimate. This drilling has been for the purpose of Hydrogeological and  Geotechnical  studies.  No  sampling  has  been  completed  ofese  holes  to  date  and  therefore th they have not been considered for the Mineral Resource.

All drilling has been completed using a combination of Tricone, Reverse Circulation (RC) or Diamond Drilling (DDH) in the upper portion of the hole within the Pennsylvanian sediments. All drilling within the underlying Carbonatite has been completed using DDH methods.

practices

SRK  reviewed  and  validated  the  electronic database  provided  and  concludes  that  the  sampling methods, Quality Assurance/Quality Control (QA/QC), and database management employed  by  NioCorp  are  all  at  or  above  industry  standards,  and  are  suitable  for  use  in  resource estimation.

## 1.4 Mineral Processing and Metallurgical Testing

## 1.4.1 Mineral Processing and Metallurgical Testing

Comminution testwork performed at SGS Canada Inc. (SGS) indicated that the mineralized material is considered relatively hard giving a Bond Ball Mill Work Index of 14.5 kWh/t and not very abrasive giving an abrasion index of 0.066.

Developmental flotation testwork with mechanical flotation cells was performed y  Hazen Research b Inc.  (Hazen)  at  SGS  in  Lakefield,  Ontario  in  2014  and  early  2015.  To  achieve  proper  liberation  with direct pyrochlore flotation, the flotation feed was ground to a P0 of 20 ¬µm. Flotation column testwork 8 was subsequently performed at Eriez and, with the use of wash water, provided superior results than that achieved using conventional flotation techniques conducted without froth washing. A combined  concentrate  of  5.6%  niobium  pentoxide  (b2O5) at  a  mass  yield  of  11.2%,  with a  Nb2O5 N recovery  of  72.6%  was  achieved  at  Eriez.  COREM  subsequently  per med  an  intensive  column for flotation pilot plant testwork program during the first half of 2015. The cleaning flotation stage did not provide the desired metallurgical results in terms of mass pull versus recovery; more time, effort, and final

optimization  would  have  been  required.  The  difference  between  Eriez  results  and  COREM  results may be explained due to the fact that all the conditioning and flotation steps at  COREM  were  done on a continuous basis and the mineralized materialery is v sensitive to reagent dosages. Hydrometallurgy  testwork  showed  that  direct  leaching  of  the  ground  ineralized  material   (without m flotation) significantly increased the recoveries associated with the process. As a result, the flotation testwork was put on hold in pursuit of whole ore direct leaching.

## 1.4.2 Hydrometallurgy and Metallurgical Testing

Metallurgical testwork were first conducted at SGS throughout 2014 and 2015 to properly design the required process units for the conversion of the flotation concentrate into a niobium product suitable for  further  treatment  into  ferroniobium.  Testwork  consisted  of  an  exploratory  bench  and  pilot  scale hydrometallurgical  test  program  aimed  at  defining  an  appropriate  flowsheet  using  different  reagents and technologies. Upon further consideration of the recoveries and in particular the scandium recovery being very low in the flotation, leach test work was conducted on coarse whole ore material. A leach using  hydrochloric  acid  was  introduced  followed  by  the  original  sulfation.  Coarse  whole  ore leach  testwork  showed  that  a  high  recovery  of  the  scandium  could  be  achieved  without  any  added losses of titanium or niobium. A preliminary flowsheet was  then established based  on  testwork performed in leaching, sulfation, purification and precipitation. Recoveries of 92% Nb2O5, 87.6% TiO2 and 90% Sc2O3 have been demonstrated by the testwork performed to date.

## 1.4.3 Pyrometallurgy and Metallurgical Testing

Testwork

Preliminary pyrometallurgical testwork has been carried out at XPS Consulting and Services  in  Sudbury , Ontario, Canada,  with  subsequent  alumino- thermic  reduction  tests  performed at Kingston  Process  Metallurgy  (KPM)  in  Kingston,  Ontario,  Canada.  Successful  alumino- mic ther reduction  of  Nb  concentrates  produced  FeNb  alloy  metal. our  preliminary  bench  scale  tests  were F performed; demonstrating the successful conversion of the niobium oxide  in the  niobium precipitate into a ferroniobium metal product. Though 85% Nb recovery was measured, a higher Nb  recovery of over 95% to the FeNb alloy  is to be expected based on literature and existing operations.  Given the low P levels in the Nb concentrate feedstock, the % P in alloy is likely to be low at 0.1%, and would meet sales specifications.

## 1.5 Mineral Resource Estimate

Mineral Resources have been estimated in conformity with generally accepted Canadian Institute of Mining (CIM) Estimation  of  Mineral  Resource  and  Mineral  Reserves  Best  Practices guidelines, and are reported in accordance with the  CIM Definition Standards - For Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves, May 10, 2014.

The drillhole  database  used  in  the  estimation  is  of  high  quality  and  has  been  independently  verified by SRK.  A  three dimensional -geologic model was  constructed using ARANZ  Leapfrog¬Æ  ning Mi Software  (Leapfrog¬Æ).  Modeling was  based  on gged  geology  in  the  drilling lo database,  using  a combination of geological controls and niobium grade shells. The grade estimation was confined to a hard  boundary  of  thre  grade  shell   domains  defined  at  0.3%,0.4%  and  0.5%  niobium  pentoxide (Nb2O5%), with the estimation using only the composited samples from the same domain.

Developments in the metallurgical testwork indicated the potential to recover TiO2 and Sc based on a revised  flowsheet.  Further,  the  Company  completed  a  e-assay  program  of  historical  pulps,  which r

the

Mineral were  not  included  in  the  original  2011/2012 -assay  programs.  The  updated  database  has  been re provided to SRK  who  completed  a  review of the database and the QA/QC  information for additional  elements  to  ensure  their  inclusion  in  the  estimation  process.  External  laboratory  cks he showed  a  bias  between  SGS  and  Actlabs  boratories, la with Actlabsreturning higher values for Nb2O5.  The  slight  high   bias  confirms  the  slight  over  reporting  noted  in  the  routine  submissions  of standard  reference  materials  (SRMs),  which  SRK  estimates  to  be  in  the  order  of  4.0%  to  4.4% (based on the SRMs). The bias in the external duplicates report a slight increase in th e bias to 8.7%. SRK  considers the level of bias to be within acceptable levels for use in the current Resource.  SRK  noted  some  gaps  for  TiO2 and  Sc  still  remain  within  the  database.  The  gaps  in  the database are a result of the current  re-assay program being limited to pulp material collected during the  2011  reanalysis  program.  Based  on  established  relationships  and  statistical  analysis,  SRK  is comfortable to use the revised database for the current Mineral Resource Estimation.

Mineral  Resources utilized  all  the  assay  information  from  historical  drilling  and  the  oCorp  2014 Ni drilling program. Search distances were determined from directional variograms calculated using the capped  and  composited  samples.  A  nested  search  ellipse  estimation  method  consisting  of  three passes was used. The search ellipse has been rotated into the main dip and strike orientation of the deposit.

The grade estimation  (Nb2 O5%,  TiO2%, Sc\_ppm)   utilized an Ordinary Kriging (OK) algorithm supported  by 5 m sample composites for  all  the  mineralized  units,  with  Inverse  Distance  Weighting (IDW) to a power of 2, and a nearest neighbor estimate completed as cross   Search checks. distances were determined from directional variograms calculated using the capped and composited samples.  A  nested  search  ellipse estimation method  consisting  of three passes  was  used. The search  ellipse  has  been  rotated  into  the  main  dip  and  strike  orientation  of  the  deposit.  Density  has been  assigned  based  on  mean  density  per  major  geological  unit  from  density  determination  values taken during the 2014 estimation program, using a combination of weight in air/weight in water, and volumetric analysis. Resources are reported as Nb2O5, TiO2 and Sc (ppm).

Density  has  been  estimated  based  on  density  determination  values  taken  during  the  2014  resource estimation  program,  using  a  combination  of  weight  in  air/weight  in  water,  and  volumetric  analysis. Based on a statistical review of the density measurements and the assay results from the whole rock analysis,  which  including  FeO3%  and TiO2%, a  general  trend  of  higher  density  with  higher  grade 2 was  identified  and  therefore  an  Ordinary  Kriged  estimate  of  density  was  chosen  as  the  preferred option.

SRK has validated the Mineral Resource Estimates using a number of different techniques:

validation

- ¬∑ Inspection of block grades in plan and section and comparison with drillhole grades;
- ¬∑ Comparative statistical study vs. composite data and alternative estimation methods; and
- ¬∑ Sectional interpretation of the mean block and sample grades (swath plots).

In the opinion of SRK, the Mineral Resource Estimate reported herein is a reasonable representation of the  global  Nb O5  grades  and  the  location  of  higher  grade  zones,  which  provide  a  reasonable 2 underground mining target at the Project.

The  Mineral  Resources  are  classified  under  the  categories  of  Indicated  and  Inferred  according  to CIM guidelines. Due  to  a  lack  of  dense  drilling  (in  the  order  of  35  m  x  35  m),  no  Measured  Mineral Resources have been assigned at this stage.

Classification of the resources reflect he t relative confidence of the grade estimates. classification  is  bas ed  on  several  factors  including ample  spacing  relative  to  geological  and  geos statistical observations regarding the continuity of mineralization, data verification to original sources, specific gravity determinations, accuracy of drill collar locations, accuracy of the topographic surface, quality of the assay data, and many other factors.

This

For  the Indicated  resource  classification, a solid shape  was  constructed  around  the  core  of  the deposit  where  most  drillholes  are  spaced  approximately  0  to  70 m  apart,  and  blocks  have  been 6 estimated with a minimum of two boreholes.

on via

The  Mineral  Resources  have  been  confined  to  estimated  blocks  within  the  Carbonatite.  In  order  to determine  the  quantities  of  material  offering  'reasonable  prospects  for  economic  extraction'  by  an underground mining method, SRK has defined an underground mining cut-off grade (CoG) based on metal  pricing,  assumed costs   and metallurgical recoveries. Costs and recoveries are based bench  mark  studies  completed  for similar  projects,  and  application  of possible  local  variations.  The blocks  above  the  mining  CoG form contiguous mining  targets without isolated  blocks that  would  be unlikely  to  warrant  the  cost  of  development.  All  material  within  the  geological  wireframes  above  a CoG  of 0.3% Nb2O5  has been considered to have reasonable prospects of being mined underground methods.

The Mineral Resource for the Project is summarized in Table 1.5.1, with a summary of the sensitivity of the tonnage and grade to CoG shown in Table 1.5.2.

PEA

The Mineral Resource presented has been reported following CIM guidelines. The preliminary  in  nature,  that  it  includes  a  level  of  engineering  precision  and  assumptions  which  are currently considered too speculative to have the economic considerations applied to them that would enable Mineral Resources to be categorized as Mineral Reserves.

is

Inferred  Mineral  Resources  are  not  included  in  the  mine  plan  for  this  PEA.  Mineral  Resources  that are not Mineral Reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability.

The PEA includes price and market assumptions concerning an expanded demand in the scandium market. There is no certainty that the PEA will be realized.

## 1.6 Recovery Methods

mineral

The ferroniobium processing facility is designed with three distinct operation units: a processing plant including a grinding circuit, designed to reduce the particle size prior to leaching; a hydrometallurgical  plant  (hydromet),  which  is  designed  o produce Nb2O5,  scandium  oxide  (ScO3), t 2 and titanium oxide (TiO2); and a pyrometallurgical plant (pyromet), designed to produce ferroniobium, an iron-niobium alloy.

The  selected  processing  method  for  the  mineral  processing  plant  includes  one  crushing  stage,  one grinding stage, and  one  thickening  stage.  These  three  stages  combined  will  deliver  feed  of  the correct particle size and moisture content to the hydrometallurgy plant. Direct leaching of the ground mineralized  material   showed  significantly  increased  recoveries,  thus  flotation  is  not  present  in  the flowsheet.

The  hydromet  plant  consists  of  eleven  production  units:  Hydrochloric Cl)  Acid  Leach,  HCl  Acid (H Scandium Extraction, Sulfuric Acid Bake and Water Leach, Iron Reduction and Crystallization, Sulfuric Acid Scandium Extraction, Niobium Precipitation and Phosphorus Removal, Titanium Precipitation,  Sulfate  Calcining, HCl Acid  Regeneration,  Tailings  Neutralization,  and  a  Sulfuric  Acid Plant. Combined, these units will convert the ground  eralized min mat erial  into three products: niobium oxide concentrate, scandium oxide, and titanium oxide.

The  pyrometallurgical  plant  will  take  the  niobium  oxide  and  convert  it  via  alumino- ermic  reduction th to  ferroniobium.  This  reduction  is  performed  in  a  single  FeNb  furnace,  to  produce  a  saleable  FeNb metal alloy. The pyrometallurgical plant includes a niobium concentrate dryer, a furnace preparation  area,  a  batch  weighing  and  charging  system,  the  FeNb  furnace,  a  tapping  and  casting system, a slag granulation system, and a crusher and screen for the final FeNb product.

## 1.7 Underground Mining

Based on geomechanical information and mineralization geometry an underground longhole stoping (LHS) method with paste backfill is suitable for the deposit. The production rate  0 is /d 2,70 t producing about 7,500 t ferroniobium product (FeNb)  per annum,  at average f-mine life-o ( LoM) grades of 0.80% Nb2O5, 2.84% TiO2 and 73 ppm Sc. The deposit is divided into  three blocks where the blocks are mined top down but the levels within a block are mined bottom up. Sill pillars are left in situ between blocks. Stopes are 15 m wide, 25 m tall, and vary in length based on the mineralization grade.

Mine design using Vulcan ‚Ñ¢  software was completed based on an estimated net smelter return (NSR) cut-off  grade  ( CoG)  of  US$180/t.  Stope  optimization  using  elevated  CoGs  was  used  to  determine mine plan resource areas and achieve the desired average grade for each level.

Table  1.7.1  summarizes  the  mine  plan  resource.  This  estimate  is  based  on  a  mine  design  using elevated CoGs and applying the US$ 180/t NSR CoG to material within the design. These numbers include a 95% to 100% mining recovery based on type of opening (stope, development, etc.) to the designed wireframes in addition to a 0% to  5% unplanned waste dilution. An additional development allowance  of  26%  was  applied  to  main  ramps nd  19%  to  level  accesses  to  account  for  detail a currently  not  in  the  design.A  7%  additional  allowance  was  applied  to  stopes  where  arched  backs were  not  designed  at  the  average  grade  of  the  stope. his  percentage  was  determined  based  on T percentage of stopes within the design where there is no stope above. Waste dilution for stopes was applied with grade, slightly lower than the cutoff grade, based on an analysis of the material around stopes in a representative area.

PEA

The Mineral Resource presented has been reported following CIM guidelines. The preliminary  in  nature,  that  it  includes  a  level  of  engineering  precision  and  assumptions  which  are currently considered too speculative to have the economic considerations applied to them that would enable Mineral Resources to be categorized as Mineral Reserves.

Inferred  Mineral  Resources  are  not  included  in  the  mine  plan  for  this  PEA.  Mineral  Resources  that are not Mineral Reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability.

The PEA includes price and market assumptions concerning an expanded demand in the scandium market. There is no certainty that the PEA will be realized.

The design was  then scheduled using iGantt software to generate a LoM  production summarized in Table 1.7.2.

Mining  operations  within  a  stope  include  establishing op  and   bottom  access es,  developing  a  slot t raise  at  the  far  end  of  the  stope  (hangingwall  side)  and  using  a  fan  shaped  drilling  pattern  to  blast rings on retreat toward the vel le access. Drifting development such as main ramps and accesses are sized as 5  m x 5 m openings with an arched back.  Drifting top/bottom stope accesses are sized as 4.5 m x 4.5 m flat back openings. All drifting work is developed using two boom jumbos. Ramps are designed at a maximum gradient of 15% with a 40 m turning radius which is suitable for any underground  truck.  Stope and  development  material  is  mucked  using  14 t LHD's  into underground trucks for haulage.

The mine is accessed through a shaft system. The surface facilities include a hoist headframe  structure,  hoisting  system,  and  compressor  room.  The  underground  system  includes  a shaft, cages, skips, skip loader, and muck handling system at the bottom of the shaft. An emergency escape system is included in the exhaust (return air raise) air raise.

A paste backfill plant will be located on surface and the paste backfill product will be made of fly ash from  a  local  (74  km  away)  coal  power  plant.  Sand  will  be  used  as  an  aggregate  source  to  regulate

the  strength  gain  characteristics  of  the  paste.  The  paste  will  be  fed  by  gravity  via  boreholes  from surface.

The main ventilation during production will consist of main fans located underground near dedicated  5.5  m  exhaust  raise.  Fresh  air  will  be  taken  down  the  shaft  and  be  directed  across  the levels  through  the  active  workings  and  development  faces  and  then  exhaust  through  the  exhaust vent  raise.  An  auxiliary  ventilation  system  moves  air  to  the  working  faces  and  consists  of  fans  d an ducting.  Air  refrigeration  is  not  necessary;  however  heating  is  required  during  some  months  of  the year.

A surface well dewatering system will be used. After dewatering from the surface the mine expected to produce approximately 18.9 L/sec of water and a mine dewatering system will required.  The  dewatering  system  will  be  installed  during  development  at  the  first  sill  level  and  will consist of a sump and pump system capable of pumping 63 L/sec.

The mine will operate on a 12 hour shift basis, 365 days per year, and the quantity of personnel and equipment are based on the production schedule.

## 1.8 Infrastructure

support

The Project will incorporate urface  and s underground infrastructure as well    tailings as storage facilities. The  off-site  infrastructure  includes  a  new 29  km 161 kV  high  voltage  line  from  a  delivery point  on  the  existing  regional  power  system,  constructed  by  the  local  power  utility  9  km natural .  A gas  pipeline  connecting  the  site  with  a  locl  utility's  existing  system  will  be  constructed  by  the  local a gas utility. Telecommunications in the form of an optic line will be connected to a hub approximately 1.5 km from the site. A 7 km railway and rail unloading/loading/transfer facilities will movement of chemicals and product to and from the site.

The on-site surface infrastructure will include an electrical substation and distribution system, on- site telecommunications, fuel storage and delivery system, process water system, water treatment, potable water system  supplied by a nearby community,  fire  tection p o system, sewage  system, natural  gas  distribution  to  site  loads,  access  roads  to  the  site  with  parking,  fencing  and  security, laboratory, mine and process administrative and services buildings,  warehouse, paste backfill plant, and maintenance sho.  The p mining related facilities will include lined  mine a waste rockand mineralized  material storage  area, growth  media  storage  area,  surface  water  control  facilities,  and explosives storage area. The  mine  surface  facilities include a headframe,  hoist, and  associated facilities.  The  underground  will  be  serviced  by  a  shaft  and  ventilation  raise.  The  return  air  raise  will have a fan system underground with an emergency hoist located at the surface.

offices, system,

The  underground  facilities will include a shop, warehouse,  fuel  storage  and  filling area, explosives storage areas, electrical distribution system, water pumping and discharge service water, compressed air distribution, paste backfill distribution system, and ventilation system. The underground material handling system includes a grizzly, feeder, crusher, storage bin, conveyor, and skip loader system that loads skips in order to move the mined material to the surface facility.

Active mine dewatering will be utilized beginning before mine production and will include a series of surface  wells  that  will  dewater  the  mine  and  discharge  into  a  lined  collection  pond.  The  water  will then  be  pumped  via  a  50  km  discharge  pipeline  to  a  diffuser  at  the  discharge  point  at  the  Missouri River.

The  two tailings storage facilities (TSF) will be constructed  to contain the water leach residue, gypsum  residue,  neutralization  residue,  and  iron  oxide  tailings,  the  first  in  Area  7,  later  in  the  mine life  Area  1.  Both  TSFs  will  be  constructed   phases.  Area  7  will  be  constructed  in  three  phases, in storing approximately 26.2 Mt of tailings. Area 1 will be constructed in two phases, storing an additional  29.6  Mt  to meet  the  LoM  requirements.  The  tailings facilities have  been  designed  to incorporate two independent areas: a composite -lined tailings solids storage area; and an area with double lined containment including a leak collection and recovery system for management of stormwater runoff and drainage from the tailings solids.  The TSFs will  store predominantly dry (i.e., not  in a slurry consistency) tailings from the plant with embankment construction based on a 'downstream' construction method. Facility closure is considered in the design.

## 1.9 Environmental Studies and Permitting

## 1.9.1 Required Permits

The Project will be subject to the permitting requirements of Johnson County, the State of Nebraska, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' (USACE) national policies, such as the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C 4321, the Clean Air Act ( 42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq .), and  the  Clean  Water  Act WA)  (33  U.S.C.  1251 (C et seq .). The list permits  and authorizations required (or likely to be required) for the Project are presented in Section 20.1.

Project  permitting  commenced  in  January  2015 ith  the  submission  of  a  urisdictional  delineation w j report  to  the  USACE.  In  addition,  several  high- evel  meetings  with  local,  state  and  federal  agencies l have been held in order to introduce the Project to the regulatory community.

the federal

formal

One  of the most  critical of the required permits and/or authorizations for Elk Creek  will be approvals  to  construct  the  mine,  plant  and  tailings  disposal  facilities,  as  they  cover  considerable area, and cross various water features that fall under the jurisdiction of the state and governments. At the time of this report, all  wetlands  and  waters/drainages in  the  Project  study  area have been assumed  to be jurisdictional and subject to USACE  regulation; however, no determination  has  yet  been  made  by  the  agency. his  conservative  approach  is  being  used  by  the T various  engineering  groups  to  design  the  operations  with  as  minimal  potential  impacts  to  federally jurisdictional  features  as  possible.  However,  at  this  time,  the  delineation  of  the  proposed  rail  and discharge pipeline corridors is still pending.

to

Section  404  of  the  federal CWA  establishes  a  program  to  regulate  the  discharge  of  dredged  or  fill material into waters of the U.S. (WOUS), including wetlands and jurisdictional drainages/waterways. The USACE could require either a General Permit  or an Individual Permit if the potential impact s to jurisdictional areas are deemed  significant. Regardless, those potential impacts will need evaluated and disclosed through the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) process. The NEPA process generally involves one of two levels of analysis:

be

- ¬∑ Preparation  of  an Environmental  Assessment  (EA)  and Finding of No  Significant Impact (FONSI) where no significant impacts are expected or the potential impacts are unknown; or
- ¬∑ Preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) where there is a potential significant impacts.

It  is  important  to  remember  that  both  EAs  and  EISs  are  public  disclosure  documents,  not  permit  or approval  documents.  They  are  intended  to  disclose  what,  if any,  environmental  impacts  may  occur for

from the Project and guide the decisions of federal agencies.  In the end, both NEPA processes are likely to  result  in  the  development  of  compensatory  mitigation  for  the  loss  of  wetlands  and  other jurisdictional features.

accepted the

The time to review and evaluate the actual  404 Permit application  is typically overshadowed by the NEPA review of the Project impacts. The time to complete an EA (generally approximately  12  months)  is  usually  less  than  an  EIS  (3  to  5  years),  as  there  are  no  statutory  time frames  and  fewer  bureaucratic  procedures  involved.  Both  include  public  scoping  and  public  review processes. NioCorp's current understanding is that the simpler EA  is likely  the route to be  taken by the  USACE  with  respect  to  Elk  Creek  given  the  design  emphasis  that  has  been  placed  on  limiting impacts  to  wetlands  and  riparian  resources. NioCorp  has  initiated  mitigation  discussions  with  the USACE  and  commenced  preparation  of  the  formal  permit  application.  However,  inclusion  of the dewatering  water  pipeline  and  discharge  to  the  Missour  River,  as  well  as  several  of  the  alternative i discharge options are still under consideration and study, and are pending discussion with USACE.

The  other  important  permitting  challenge  will  be  dealing  with  the  trace  amounts  of  uranium  and thorium that occur in the mineralized materials, and  may  ultimately be deposited  in the tailings disposal  facility. Preliminary  discussions  with  the  State  of  Nebraska  have  indicated  that  a  Broad Scope  Radioacti ve  Materials  License,  issued  by  the  Nebraska  Department  of  Health  and  Human Services  (DHHS),  may  likely  be  necessary  for  dealing  with  these  Naturally  Occurring  Radioactive Materials (NORM). NioCorp estimates that a Broad Scope License for Elk Creek will take  six to nine months to obtain, and will involve several months of discussions and negotiations related engineering, design, monitoring, and terms and conditions.

to quality

Because  the  Project  includes a primary sulfuric acid production plantregulated [a facility under 40 CFR ¬ß52.21(b)], and since Nebraska is classified as 'attainment' of all ambient air standards , a federal Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) air quality construction permit will be required. The entire permit process is expected to take at least 190 days, provided that there are no  significant  technical  issues  or  problems  in  obtaining  information  and  the  facility  has  submitted  a complete  application  (including  detailed  air  dispersion  modeling).  Typically,  however,  PSD  per ts mi require over one year in order to complete. A federal operating permit will also be required; however, the application for the operating permit need only be submitted within 12 months after the emissions unit(s) begin operation.

Other important permit requirements prior to construction and operations include:

- ¬∑ National  Pollutant  Discharge  Elimination  System  (NPDES)  permit  for  the  surface  discharge of excess waters generated from mine dewatering and possibly mineral processing;
- ¬∑ Dam Safety permitting  for  the  proposed  tailings  disposal  facility  and  possible  water  storage reservoirs; and
- ¬∑ Greenhouse Gas (GHG) permitting if carbon dioxide thresholds are exceeded.

## 1.9.2 Engineering Design Criteria

The  State of Nebraska  does  not  have  regulatory environmental protection requirements for the design and operation of hardrock mines, especially underground hardrock mines with chemical beneficiation circuits. As such, ioCorp  has N engaged in a conservative approach to minimize environmental  risk  and  liability  by  adopting  relevant  Environmental  Design  Criteria  (EDC).  Without at

state  or  federal  guidance  in  this  matter,  the  EDCs  for  Elk  Creek  were  fashioned  after  those  from  a jurisdiction  dedicated  to  sustainable  hardrock  mining;  the  State  of  Nevada  and  the  U.S.  Bureau  of Land  Management. However,  Nebraska  does  have  regulations ertaining  to  the  management  of p solid wastes, including mining wastes.

## 1.9.3 Environmental Studies

Preliminary information on various environmental resources has been collected from literature as well as previous studies in the area of the Elk Creek Project. These include:

- ¬∑ Soils;
- ¬∑ Climate/Meteorology/Air Quality - a meteorological station has been erected at the site;
- ¬∑ Cultural and Archeological Resources;
- ¬∑ Vegetation;
- ¬∑ Wildlife;
- ¬∑ Threatened, Endangered, and Special Status Species;
- ¬∑ Land Use;
- ¬∑ Hydrogeology (groundwater);
- ¬∑ Hydrology (surface water);
- ¬∑ Wetlands/Riparian Zones; and
- ¬∑ Geochemistry.

## 1.9.4 Health and Safety

Occupational  health  and  safety  at  the  Project  will  be  strictly  regulated  by  the  U.S.  Department  of Labor, Mine Safety &amp; Health Administration (MSHA), including the possible implementation of radon exposure and monitoring requirements on all workers.

## 1.9.5 Reclamation and Closure

Without specific hardrock mining regulations, there are limited obligatory requirements for reclamation and closure of mining properties in Nebraska. There are provisions, however, within the applicable  regulatory  framework  which  are  likely  to  be  applied  to  the  Project  during  the  permit  and licensing processes, including, but not limited to requirements for the closure of the tailings disposal facility under the Nebraska Integrated Solid Waste Management Regulations .

In addition to lacking hardrock mining regulations for reclamation and closure, there are also limited requirements  for  the  provision  of  financial  sureties  with  respect  to  hardrock  mining  operations  in Nebraska.  One  possible  exception  would  be  under  the  scenario  in  which  the  facility  falls  under  a broad scope radiological license, which will likely have financial assurance requirements reclamation and closure. At this time, the type and amount of financial surety for the Project has not yet been established.

Current  closure  costs  for  the  Project  have  been  estimated  at  just  over  US$60  million,  the  bulk  of which  (US$40 million)  is  intended  for  reclamation  and  closure  of  the  tailings  disposal  facility.  These costs  will  be  refined  as  part  of  the  easibility  study,  and  may  need  to  be  adjusted  based  on  specific f regulatory agency requirements, particularly those associated with any radioactive material licensing of the plant and tailings facility.

## 1.9.6 Community Relations and Social Responsibilities

NioCorp is committed to ensuring that a proper Social License is garnered from the community and stakeholders. Thus far, support for the Project has been positive from those who have been engaged and  notified  of  the  pending  Project,  which  includes  local  landowners,  county  representatives,  and several state and federal regulatory agencies.

## 1.9.7 International Standards and Guidelines

Even  though  the  United  States  is  a  'Designated  Country'  with  respect  to  the  Equator  Principles, NioCorp has committed to ensuring that Elk Creek is in compliance with international standards and guidelines, to the extent practicable, given the potential for international investment in the Project.

## Operating Cost Estimates

The operating costs are based on processing 2,700 t of mineralized material per day to produce  n a average  of 7,500 t/y  of  ferroniobium  (rounded).  The  operating  costs  are  based  on  Q1- 015  costs, 2 and  the  estimate  has  been  broken  down  into  three  main  areas:  mining  costs  (mine),  processing costs (process), and general &amp; administration (G&amp;A).

The mine operating  cost  is  estimated  at  US$3.00/t  of  the  mineralized  material  milled  and  includes 5 the manpower, energy, spares and maintenance supplies required for the un derground development and  production of the mineralized material as well  the as  paste  backfill  plant and  underground distribution system, underground pumping systems, and ventilation.

The process operating cost is estimated at US$135.75/t of the mineralized material milled consists  of  the  manpower,  energy,  consumables,  reagents,  acid,  spares  and  maintenance  suppli s e required for the operation of the mineral processing, hydrometallurgical,  lant and acid p pyrometallurgical  plants  as  well  as  the  operating sts  of  the  fresh  water  supply  and  treatment, co surface dewatering wells and pumps, and tailings disposal.

and

The  general  &amp;  administration  operating  cost  is  estimated  at  US$8.11/t  of  the  mineralized  material milled.  This  includes  all  of  the  project's  operating  costs  which  are  not  related  to  the  mining  and processing plants. The G&amp;A costs include the following subsections  administration manpower, and : general costs for operations.

The overall LoM operating cost for the Project is estimated $ 6.1  billion, at US US$196.86/t mineralized  material  milled  or  US$39.28 kg  of  Nb  (excluding  benefit  from  the  production  of  Sc / 2 O3 and  TiO 2).

PEA

The Mineral Resource presented has been reported following CIM guidelines. The preliminary  in  nature,  that  it  includes  a  level  of  engineering  precision  and  assumptions  which  are currently considered too speculative to have the economic considerations applied to them that would enable Mineral Resources to be categorized as Mineral Reserves.

Inferred  Mineral  Resources  are  not  included  in  the  mine  plan  for  this  PEA.  Mineral  Resources  that are not Mineral Reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability.

The PEA includes price and market assumptions concerning an expanded demand in the scandium market. There is no certainty that the PEA will be realized.

## 1.10.2 Conclusions and Recommendations

## Geology and Resources

SRK has no further recommendations for additional drilling needed to support the Mineral Resource for  the  impending  feasibility -level  study.  SRK  notes  that  the  current  understanding  of  the  extents  of the deposit, while sufficient for the current level of study, are still limited by the extents of the drilling, and that the deposit is locally open along strike and at depth. SRK is of the opinion that there may be an opportunity to further refine and improve the understanding of the mineralization, particular ly near the  top  of  the  deposit  where  mining  is  scheduled  to  begin.  This  may  be  considered  in  planning  for future exploration and mining, as a matter of course in the development of the project.

## Recovery Methods

In order to improve process efficiency and minimize the potential risks of operating a full scale plant, -testing  programs  need  to  be  carried  out  during  the  different  phases  of  engineering  studies.  While some small-scale test methods provide adequate information for scoping or prefeasibility studies, it is suggested  that pilot plant testing be  conducted  to provide sufficient information for the process development  during  the  feasibility  study  at  the  15%  accuracy  levels.  At  the  current  stage  of  the ¬± study, a bench scale laboratory testing program including some pilot mini-testing has been conducted for understanding the mineralized material sample characteristics and its behavior under controlled conditions. During this program testing, sufficient data has been collected from the hydromet  circuit  to  produce  a  PEA and  has  justified  the  need  for  a  more  detailed  evaluation  with  a pilot plant program. Implementation of such testwork will provide additional key information to confirm bench test results and enable development of mass and energy balances, equipment selection  and  plant  design.  As  process  safety  risk  is  an  important  factor,  a  pilot  plant  program  will help  to  reduce  possible  risks  associated  with  the  construction  and  operation  of  the  new  full le -sca process plant.

## Mining and Reserves

that mine

No  Mineral Reserves   have been estimated for the Project. The available data indicate underground operations using longhole stoping methods are viable for the Project. The maintains  the  target  FeNb  production  for  a  32  ear  period.  An  elevated  NSR  cutff  was  used  to y -o minimize plant and capital requirements and to meet NioCorp forecasted  needs. market Development  of  the  shaft,  initial  ramp  and  accesses  is  imperative  to  achieving  production  in  early years.  Further  optimization  during  a  feasibility  study  would  include  overall  optimization  of  mining system  to  minimize  up  front  capital  cost,  accelerate  initial  development,  optimize  ventilation,  further develop  water  handling  systems  as  more  data  on  water  becomes  available,d  refine  the  paste an backfill system.

## Tailings Storage Facility

design

The  Area  7  and  Area  1  TSFs  are  capable  of  storing  the  tailings  material  generated  for  the  life  of mine. Further development of the design of the facility includes further characterization of the  tailings material,  construction  material  characterization  including  confirmation  of  the  engineering  properties of the materials, geochemical property review, and further developing a feasibility level including appropriate geotechnical, water balance, and seismic characteristics.

## Environmental Studies and Permitting

Initiation of formal  permitting  will  commence  upon mpletion  of  this  PEA.  While  not  necessarily co complex, the timing required to complete permitting through the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (404 Permit),  the  Nebraska  Department  of  Environmental  Quality  (NPDES  Discharge  Permit),  and  the Nebraska  Department  of  Health and  Human  Services  (Radiological License), necessitates early engagement with all three agencies. Documentation of existing baseline environmental conditions at the  site  was  initiated  in  2014  and  should  continue  throughout  the  permitting  process.  Geochemical programs for  the  characterization  of  the  mineralized  material  (potential mineralized  material),  waste rock, and tailings (including radiological characterization) has been collected based on a preliminary PEA mine plan needs to be expanded for the feasibility study. Post-metallurgical geochemical testing of  the  tailings  material  is  necessary  to  obtain  solids  and  supernatant  cmistry,  and  generate  data he

needed to evaluate the closure alternatives for the underground workings and tailings impoundment, and the potential requirements for postsure -clo water management, if necessary. Additionally, development of project-specific environmental and social management plans based on the potential impacts identified during the permitting process will need to be initiated.

## Capital, Operating Costs, and Economic Analysis

through

The Project  as  modeled  provides  a  positive  after tax  NPV  of  US$2.3  billion  at  an  8%  discount  rate -with  free  cash  flow  of  US$9.6  billion  after  taxes.  The  Project  generates  approximately  7,500  t/y  of FeNb, 97 t/y Sc2O3 and a by-product of TiO2 that offset substantial cost s at current commodity price estimates. The upfront capital is US$978.7 million. The Project is net NPV positive sensitivities  of  +/ -25%  on  operating  cost,  capital  cost,  and  recovery. arket  pricing  for  FeNb  and M Sc2O3 was based on reputable market studies developed for the Project.

## 2.4 Sources of Information

The  sources  of  information include data and  reports supplied NioCorp  personnel by as well as documents cited throughout the report and referenced in Section 27.

## 2.5 Effective Date

The effective date of the report is August 4, 2015.

## 2.6 Units of Measure

The metric system has been used throughout this report. Tonnes are metric of  kg, 1,000 or 2,204.6 lb. All currency is in United States dollars (US$) unless otherwise stated.

## 3 Reliance on Other Experts

other

The  Consultant's  opinion  contained  herein  is  based  on  information  provided  to  the  Consultants  by NioCorp  throughout the course of the investigations. SRK has relied upon the work of consultants in the Project areas in support of this Technical Report.

review

SRK  was  reliant  upon  information  and  data  provided  by  ioCorp  including  historic  data  inherited N from  previous  owners.  NioCorp have  utilized  the  services  of  Dahrouge  eological  Consulting  Ltd. G (Dahrouge) for the capture and databasing of the historical data,  -site plus  eological on g management  for  the  2011  and  2014  exploration  programs.  SRK  has  been  provided  with  adequate copies in digital format of the historical logs and provided full access to the Dahrouge dataroom. SRK has, where  possible, verified data provided independently, and  completed a site visit to physical evidence for the Project.

SRK  has  relied  upon  information  supplied  by  ioCorp (Mr.  Scott  Honan)  during  this  current  study. N Land titles and mineral rights for the Project have not been independently reviewed in detail by SRK and SRK did not seek an independent legal opinion of these items.

reports the

SRK  has  relied  upon  market  studies  provided  by  NioCorp.  The  confidential  marketing  studies  for ferroniobium  were  developed  by  Roskill  (June  2015),  a  leader  in  international  metals  and  minerals research for market reports. The confidential scandium study entitled 'Scandium:  ket A Mar Assessment'  was  developed  by  OnG  Commodities  LLC  (July  2015)  and  authored  by  Dr.  Andrew Matheson. Dr. Matheson has extensive experience in specialty metals and consulted to global firms in the metals, materials and energy industries. The companies that provided the information have specific knowledge of the specific commodity  market and pricing. ing Pric for titanium  dioxide  was  estimated  based  on  a  lower  quality  product  and  in- se  knowledge  of  the hou titanium market. Potential upgrade to the quality of the titanium dioxide produced to a pigment grade product  could  have  a  positive  impact  on  market  price.e  scandium  pricing  includes  price  and Th market assumptions concerning an expanded demand in the scandium market. Based on marketing study a slower uptake in demand in the scandium market will likely result in a lower initial price. SRK presented an alternative scenario to provide an indication of the sensitivity for the Project to  scandium pricing. SRK  has,  where  possible,  verified  data  provided  independently through  review of available public documents.

and

The  Consultants  used  their  experience  to  determine  if  the  information  from  previous  reports  was suitable  for  inclusion  in  this  technical  report  and  adjusted  information  that  required  amending.  This report  includes  technical  information,  which  required  subsequent  calculations  to  derive  subtotals, totals and weighted averages. Such calculations inherently involve a degree of rounding consequently introduce a margin of error. Where these occur, the Consultants do not consider them to be material.

These items have not been independently reviewed by SRK and SRK did not seek an independent legal opinion of these items.

## 4.2 Property Description

The Project is a niobium aring -be carbonatite deposit located in Johnson County, southeast Nebraska.  In addition to niobium, other elements  of economic  significance  include titanium and scandium.

## 4.3 Mineral Titles

At the time of the previous PEA the Property consisted of 65 option agreements covering approximately 3,834 ha, of which the Company currently held 33 active agreements (1,879 ha).

As  of  the  effective  date  of  this  Technical  Report,  t   Company  has  reviewed  the  required  option he agreements to advance the Project and has chosen not to enter into an extension agreement on 44 agreements. These agreements covered mainly the larger area targeted in previous campaigns. The Company current holds 15 of 21 targeted Land Option agreements and are in activ e negotiations  with  the  remaining  land  holders.  The  current  optioned  land  package  covers  an  area  of 1,215.96 ha, with the targeted package at 1,796.05 ha.

SRK notes that at the time of  writing a  number of the agreements included  within Table 4.3.1  have expired but these do not directly influence the current Mineral Resource. NioCorp  rently is  cur negotiating with owners to obtain mineral and surface rights as appropriate. At the time of writing this report negotiations for the mineral rights are ongoing rsonal (pe communication, August, 2015 ). Surface rights only have been obtained for the 'Woltemath\_80S' option, located immediately north of the current Mineral Resource in an agreement dated December 4, 2014 with the surface owner, and are included in Table 4.3.1 as agreement Woltemath\_80S.

The status of these agreements  remains a current focus of the Company.  SRK  discussed  the renewal process with  NioCorp  and understands thatthe Company is  targeted  all agreements covering  potential  Mineral  Resource  and  any  potential  infrastructure.  In  areas  outside  of  this  the Company has made the decision to allow the Option agreements to expire.

The  current  Mineral  Resource  is  wholly  contained  within  parcels  Woltemath\_003  and  Beethe\_008, and  extension  agreements  covering  both  of  these  properties  have  been  secured.  Negotiations  for additional  lands  to  support  various  configurations  of  the  surface  operations  are  underway,  and  the affected landowners are currently considering NioCorp's offers to either extend the agreements or enter into new agreements for these lands.

Discussion  with NioCorp  and  review  of  the  previous  NI  43-1  completed  in  2012,describe  the 10 option agreements and acquisition of the property by Quantum.  Below is an excerpt from 'Resource Estimate  and  Technical  Report  for  the  Elk  Creek  NbEE  Project,  Nebraska,  USA',  completed  by -R Tetra Tech Waldrop (Tetra Tech) for Quantum and dated April 23, 2012.

'The  Property  was  acquired  through  65]  agreements  between  ECRC  and  individual  land [ owners that are  in  the  form  of  five-ear  pre-paid  Exploration  Lease  Agreements  (ELA),  with y an Option to Purchase (OTP) the mineral rights at the end of the lease (or for clarification at any point during the term) . The individual land owners have title to the surface subsurface rights, and the agreements are primarily with respect to only the mineral interest of each property.

and

The property boundaries are set out in a written descripti f on o each individual lease agreement.  This  property  description  is  based  on  the  Public  Land  Survey  System  (PLSS), descriptions of lots, and written descriptions of surface features (rivers, fences, roads, etc.).

The  acquisition  of  the  Elk  Creek  Property  by  Quantum  involves  the  purchase  of  all  of  the issued  and  outstanding  common  shares  of  859404  BC  Ltd.,  ('859404')  a  private  British Columbia company (Quantum News Release, Dec. 2010). 859404 holds 100% of the issued and  outstanding  shares  of  ECRC,  the  Nebraskan  corporation  that  has  secured  individual agreements to acquire the mineral rights to the Elk Creek carbonatite. The property was held under a similar type of option agreement by Molycorp in the 1970's and 1980's.

In consideration for the common shares of 859404, Quantum will pay a total of US$500,000 and  issue  one  common  share  of  the  Company  for  each  common  share  of  859404  issued and  outstanding.  Of  the  total, US$200,000  has  been  paid  by  Quantum  on  signing  of  the agreement with 859404 and the balance of  cash and shares is payable upon acceptance by the TSX Exchange.'

It is SRK's opinion that ECRC's ability to securing the long term rights to land above and surrounding the Project will be key to completing a feasibility study.

## 4.3.1 Nature and Extent of Issuer's Interest

As part of the exploration option agreements where required the Company has also secured surface rights, which allow for access to the land for drilling activities and associated mineral exploration and Project development work.

Some of the agreements include a 2% Net Smelter Return (NSR) royalty attached with the OTP. The agreements grant the operator an exclusive right to explore and evaluate the property for a period of 60 months, with an OTP the mineral interest and in some cases the surface  rights at any time during the term.

## 4.4 Royalties, Agreements and Encumbrances

The leases covering the Project are 100% owned by  NioCorp and, with the exception of a  2% NSR royalty  attached with some of the OTP ,  have s no other outstanding royalties, agreements encumbrances.

## 4.5 Environmental Liabilities and Permitting

## 4.5.1 Environmental Liabilities

Existing environmental liabilities at the Project site are related to the exploration and hydrogeological and  geotechnical investigation activities  that  have  been  undertaken  to  date.  The  roject consists  of P

or

undeveloped (in terms of mining)  farm land with no previous mineral development, mining or milling history. There are no existing liabilities associated with the utility rights -of-way or the highway (State Highway 50) in the Project area,  which come under the responsibility of the  company. A  number of the option agreements, described above, provide for the establishment of an escrow account, where funds  are  deposited  against  the  need  to  reclaim  exploration  areas  once  drilling  is  complete.  At  the time  of  writing,  all  reclamation  work  from  the  2014  drilling  programs  has  been  completed,  and  all escrow  monies  have  been  released  back  to  NioCorp.  Five  holes  have  been  drilled  in  2015,  and escrow remains in place for three holes as the reclamation activity is ongoing at the time of writing.

Baseline  environmental  studies  have  been  initiated  and  are  discussed  in  Section  20  of  the  current report.

## 4.5.2 Required Permits and Status

The  exploration  work  conducted  to  date  on  the  Project  has een  completed  under  an  Exploration b Permit  NE0211001  issued  by  the  State  of  Nebraska,  Department  of  Environmental  Quality,  which provided  the  Company  with  the  right  to  have  en open  boreholes  active  at  the  Project  at  any  given t time. In addition to the exploration permit, the Company  acquired  an  exemption  letter  from  the Department of Health and Human Services for the use of a handheld held Niton X Ray Florescence -Analyzer (Niton), used in 2014 on drill core for preliminary analysis onsite.

Corps

Subsequently, the proposed Project will be held to permitting requirements that are determined to be necessary by Johnson County, the State of Nebraska, and possibly the U.S. Army Engineers and Environmental Protection Agency, as is further detailed in Section 20 of this report.

## 4.6 Other Significant Factors and Risks

SRK notes that a potential risk for the development of the Project relates to the issue of renewing the current option agreements. SRK  understands that the Company is currently in the process renegotiating key options and agrees with the priority focusing on those directly above mineralization  and  the  surrounding  leases,  which  may  be  required  for  surface  infrastructure  should the  Project  advance  to  more  detailed  levels  of  study.  During  this  proces SRK  highlights  that  the s, deposit  remains  open  to  the  north  of  the  current  mineralization  and  there  is  potential  to  expand  the deposit in that direction. No exploration has been completed into this area but it is known that main strike of the mineralization enters into the southwest corner of this parcel of land.

With  the  exception  of  the  points  raised  above,  there  are  no  known  other  significant  factors  or  risks which  could  have  a  material  impact  on  the  ability  to  affect  access,  titles  or  the  right  to    perfor m exploration work on the property.

From Lincoln Municipal Airport, the Property is accessed via paved roads on the main network and a secondary network of gravel roads by following:

- ¬∑ Interstate Highway 80 south for approximately 3.5 km to the Beatrice exit;
- ¬∑ Then join Highway 77 south for approximately 41 km;
- ¬∑ Then join Highway 41 south for approximately 47 km; and,
- ¬∑ Then join Highway 50 south for approximately 16  to km  the approximate center of Elk Creek deposit.

the

The  drive  from  the  Lincoln  Municipal  Airport  to  the  property  is  typically  1  hour  and  15  minutes,  and from Omaha's Eppley Airport the drive is approximately 1 hour and 45 minutes.

Geologists can be sourced from local universities.  An experienced mining related  workforce can be found in Denver Colorado (eight hours drive west of the Project).

## 5.2 Climate and Length of Operating Season

Southeast Nebraska is situated in a Humid Continental Climate (Dfa) on the K√∂ppen classification system. In eastern Nebraska  this climate is generally characterized by hot summers  and  cold  winters.  Average  winter  temperatures  vary  between 0.4¬∞C  to  1.6¬∞C.  Average -1 summer temperatures vary between 18¬∞C to 32¬∞C. Exploration may be conducted all year round.

climate humid

Average  monthly  precipitation  (rain  and  snowfall)  varies  between  22  and  127  mm.  Average  yearly precipitation  is  between  800  and  850  mm  with  an  average  yearly  snowfall  of  approximately  72 cm (Table 5.2.1). Nebraska is located within an area known for tornados which runs through  the central U.S. where  thunderstorms  are  common  in  the  spring  and  summer  months.  Tornadoes  primarily  occur during the spring and summer and may occur into the autumn months.

## 5.3 Sufficiency of Surface Rights

The  Company  has  negotiated  surface  rights  as  needed  as  part  of  the As (discussed  in  Section EL 4.3). It  is expected that  with appropriate studies and negotiations with land owners that land access and  provision  of  land  for  infrastructure  development  will  be  achievable.  There  is  sufficient  suitable land  area  available  within  the  mineral  claims  for  mine  waste  disposal,  for  future  tailings  disposal ,  a processing plant, and related mine infrastructure.

## 5.4 Infrastructure Availability and Sources

people.

supplies.

Elk Creek is the nearest town to the Project, with a population of approximately 100 Tecumseh, with roughly  1,700  inh abitants,  is  the  nearest  town  of  any  size to  the Project  site  and  is situated  approximately 11 km  north  of  the  Property.  Tecumseh  is  welluited  as  a  staging  base  for -s future exploration work at the Project with available accommodations, fuel, and Contractors, bulk supplies, and skilled labor (engineering, surveying) may be sourced locally or from the  cities  of Lincoln or  Omaha. Mining  activities  currently  taking  place  in  the  area  e  limited  to ar limestone  and  aggregate  operations,  to  support  the  local  cement  manufacturing  and  construction industries.  The  Company  has  links  to  the  University  of  Nebraska  Lincoln  which  operates    geology a department.

The  Project  is  situated  in  a  rural  agricultural  area  that  is  covered  b  well -developed  network  of y  a paved highways and secondary gravel roads.

There are three electrical power generating stations within a 50 km radius of the Project that include the Beatrice and Sheldon coal generating stations, and the Cooper nuclear power generating station.

The  nearest  railway  heads  are  found  in  both  Tecumseh  and  Elk  Creek.  The  Burlington  Northern Santa Fe (BNSF) railway runs parallel to the Nemaha River connecting Kansas City to Omaha and Lincoln.

The nearest major airports are located in Lincoln and Omaha, Nebraska, and Kansas City, Kansas.

Water  sources  are  available  near  the  Property  from  local  rivers  and  from  groundwater  wells  for drilling requirements.

## 5.4.1 Potential Tailings Storage Areas

A TSF area required to support milling will need to be  defined within the current mineral leases held by NioCorp. Further detail on the size and nature of this facility are discussed in Section 18.2 of the current report.

## 5.4.2 Potential Waste Rock Disposal Areas

economic

A  temporary disposal facility for waste rock (i.e., mined rock that does not contain concentrations  of  niobium,  titanium  or  scandium)  may  be  required  to  support  mining  and  has  been defined within the current land position held by NioCorp. Further detail is provided in Section 18.1 of this report.

## 5.4.3 Potential Processing Plant Sites

The  Company  holds  sufficient  surface  rights to locate processing  facilities at or near access  to mineralization. The current options agreements contain sufficient land for the processing facilities.

## 5.5 Physiography

The local topography of eastern Nebraska is relatively low relief with shallow rolling hills intersected -by  shallow  river  valleys.  Elevation  varies  from  about  325  to  390  meters  above  sea  level  ( . masl) Bedrock outcrop exposure is nonexistent in the Project area.

The  majority  of  the  Project  area  is  used  for  cultivation  of  corn  and  soybeans,  along  with  uses  as grazing  land.  Native  vegetation  typical  of  eastern  Nebraska  is  upland  tall- ass,  prairie  and  upland gr deciduous forests.

## 6 History

The following section provides a brief summary of the history of the Project and SRK has relied upon information provided in the 2012 NI 43-101 Technical Report produced by Tetra Tech for Quantum, entitled 'Resource  Estimate  and  Technical  Report  for  the  Elk  Creek  Nb-  Project,  Nebrask a, REE USA', effective date April 23, 2012.

## 6.1 Ownership History

Initial  regional  geological  work  was  completed  by  the SGS.  The  details  of  the  initial  ownership  of U the complete Project area are not clear, but it is reported that land packages were initially contlled ro by Cominco American Inc. (Cominco American) and Molycorp during the early 1970's.

The majority of exploration over the Project area was completed by Molycorp prior to 1984. Between 1984 and 2010, at an unknown date, the title of the Project was hel by Elk Creek Resources Corp. d (ECRC).  On  May  4,  2010  Quantum  announced  the  acquisition  of  ECRC  and  acquired  the  mineral rights to the Project. On March 3, 2013 Quantum announced an official name change from  Quantum Rare  Earth  Developments  Corp.to  NioCorp  Developments  Ltd.  ( NioCorp).  NioCorp's  focus  is  to develop the Project.

## 6.2 Exploration History

## 6.2.1 USGS, 1964

Between  November  1963  and  January  1964,  the  USGS  flew  three  airborne  magnetic  surveys  over southeast Nebraska. A total of 6,590 line km were flown (836, 209, and 5,544 line miles respectively) along east-west direction at a flight line spacing of  2 miles and at altitude of 305 m (1,000 ft) above ground  (USGS  website:  OFR  99- 557).  Figure  6.2.1.1 0 shows  the  area  covered  by  the  airborne survey.

## 6.2.2 Discovery, 1970-1971

Further investigation of the Project was not completed until  0,  when  the 197 Elk Creek gravity anomaly  was  initially identified during   reconnaissance  gravity  geophysical  survey  of  southeast a Nebraska  by  the  Conservation  and  Survey  Division  ( D)  of  the  University  of  Nebraska- incoln CS L (UNL).  During  the  same  time  period  he  UNL  geology  department (operating  independently ),  was t mapping the magnetic expression of the Nemaha Arch and the Humboldt Fault.

anomaly

A comparison of the two geophysical survey results showed a positive anomly that was coincident a with a positive gravity anomaly over the area now defined as the Elk Creek gravity (Anzman,  1976). The  geophysical ravity g survey outlined a nearircular  anomaly, -c along with a concurrent  magnetic  anomaly,  approximately  7  km n  diameter.  Analysis  of  the  geophysical  data i provided a model of a cylindrical mass of indefinite length with a radius of 1,700 m (5,500 ft; Burfeind et al. 1971). Figure 6.2.2.1 and Figure 6.2.2.2 illustrate the results of the two surveys.

In  1971,  the  Nebraska  Geological  Survey  ( GS) commissioned  a  test  drillhole  2-B- 71  to  determine N the source of the near circular gravity anomaly. With some support from the United States Bureau of Mines (USBM) the test hole was deepened. The test hole 2-B- 71, later renamed NN-1 by Molycorp, encountered 191 m (628 ft) of marine sediments, followed by  a carbonate- ich rock (carbonatite)  to r the  end  of  the  hole  at  290  m  (952  ft)  (Brookins  et  al. 975)  in  what  is  n ow referred  to as  the  Elk ,  1 Creek Carbonatite.

## 6.2.3 Cominco American, 1974

The  earliest  known  reference  to  Cominco  American  operating  within  the  Elk  Creek  gravity  anomaly area is from 1974. It is unclear precisely when Cominco American first acquired the mineral rights in the Elk Creek anomaly area. It is believed  that between 1971 and 1973 both Cominco American and Molycorp held mineral rights over selected portions of the Elk Creek gravity anomaly.

In  1974,  Cominco  American  completed  five  drillholes  (CA-to  CA -5)  within  the  Elk  Creek  gravity 1 anomaly.  Details  of  the  Cominco  American  drillholes  and  exploration  activities  within  the  property were  not  available.  The  information  on  drilling  activities  stated  here s  taken  from  the  Molycorp wa database. SRK has not reviewed or included any information  from Cominco American as part of the current study.

## 6.2.4 Molycorp, 1973-1986

The  earliest  known  reference  to  Molycorp  operating  within  the  Elk  Creek  gravity  anomaly  area is from  1973.  It  is  unclear  precisely  when  Molycorp  first  acquired  the  mineral  rights  in  the  Elk  Creek anomaly  area.   Molycorp  completed  a  number  of  phases  of  exploration  on  the  Project  during  this period including more detailed geophysical surveys, regional drilling (mineralization limits) and focused drilling on the Project area. The exploration program focused on understanding the potential for rare earth elements  of  economic  significance  at  the  Project, with results showing  a  niobium anomaly at Elk Creek.

Between 1986 and 2011, no further exploration had been recorded on the property.

## 6.2.5 Geophysical Surveys

In  1973,  a  detailed  aeromagnetic  survey  was  flown  by  Olympus  Aerial  Surveys  Inc.  (Olympic  Aerial Surveys),  of  Salt  Lake  City,  Utah,  US ,  for  Molycorp,  with  the  aim  of  locating  drill  sites.  Flight  lines A within the Elk Creek anomaly area were spaced at 200  m, and outside the anomaly at 400 m. A total of  50,764 ha  were  covered  by  2,090  line  km  (Anzman,  976).  The  altitude  of  the  survey  was  not 1 stated in Anzman 1976.

In  1980,  an  extensive  regional  geophysical  program  was  made  in  southeastern ebraska  including N the Elk Creek anomaly. The program consisted of 6,437 line km of aeromagnetics and approximately 4,000 gravity station readings. The aeromagnetic survey was contracted by Olympus Aerial Surveys.

The  gravity  geophysical  survey  was  conducted  by  the  CSD NL,  which  undertook  approximately  a -U quarter of the station readings,  and  by  Molycorp's  in-se  Geophysical  Services  Group,  which hou undertook the remaining three quarters of the gravity station readings.

## 6.2.6 Drilling

Between  1973  and  1974,  Molycorp  completed  six  drillholes:  EC  to  EC -4,  targeting  the  Elk  Creek -1 anomaly  and  two  other  holes  outside  the  Elk  Creek  anomaly  area  (Anzman,  1976).  Drillholes  were typically carried  out  by  RC  drilling  through  the  overlying  sedimentary  rocks  and  diamond  drill ing through the Ordovician-Cambrian basement rocks.

Molycorp continued their drill program from 1977 and, in May 1978, Molycorp made  ts discovery of i the current  Project with  drillhole  EC -11.  EC-11  is  located  on  Section  33,  Township  4N,  and  Range 11. The Carbonatite hosting the Project was intersected at a vertical depth of 203.61 m (668 ft).

Molycorp continued its drilling program through to 1984, which  mainly centered on the Project within a radius of roughly 2 km. By 1984, Molycorp had completed 57 drillholes within the Elk Creek gravity anomaly area, which included 25 drillholes over the Project area.

From 1984 to 1986, drilling was focused on the Elk Creek gravity anomaly area. The anomaly area is roughly 7 km in diameter and drilling was conducted on a grid pattern of approximately 610 by 610 m (roughly 2,000 by 2,000 ft.) with some closer spaced drillholes in selected areas.

By 1986, a total of 106 drillholes were completed for a  otal of approximately 46,797 m (153,532 ft). t The deepest hole reached a depth of 1,038 m (3,406 ft) and bottomed in carbonatite.

## 6.2.7 Molycorp Data Verification, 1973-1986

Verification work on the historical database has been completed by Dahrouge Geological  Consulting Ltd  (Dahrouge),  who  were  contracted  by  Quantum  to  compile  and  verify  the  historical  database between 2010 and 2011. Work included data capture from historical drilling  logs, verification drilling and reanalysis of historical samples.

The  follo wing  excerpt  was  taken  from  McCallum  and  Cathro  (Technical  Report  on  the  Elk  Creek Property, 2010).

'In some  of  the  analytical log sheets  available to the Authors, it appears  that Molycorp analyzed  niobium  through  their  exploration  division  laboratory  at  Louviers,  Colorado.  They also analyzed the same interval at another, unspecified, commercial laboratory. It is unclear to the Authors what material the duplicate analyses were derived from (coarse reject

duplicate,  pulp  duplicate,  or  ¬º  core  duplicate).  As  discussed  in  Section  15,  Molycorp  Inc. utilized some standards to establish the calibration curve of the   x refraction -ray (XRF) instruments. It is unclear if Molycorp also utilized inserted standard reference samples to test the analytical accuracy of their own laboratory or external commercial laboratories.

unknown

UNL,

Molycorp  utilized  the  commercial  laboratory,  Skyline  Labs  Inc.,  of  Wheat  Ridge,  Colorado between 1980 and 1986, with analysis by ICP spectrographic methods and preparation methods. According to analytical reports and certificates available at values  of  lanthanum,  cerium,  neodymium,  barium,  sodium,  thorium,  lead,  thorium,  uranium, potassium, titanium, zinc, vanadium, niobium, phosphorous, beryllium, zircon, strontium, lithium,  yttrium,  silver,   chromium,  copper,  iron,  manganese,  nickel  and  cobalt  were  tested. The  intervals  tested  are  comprised  of  commonly  100  ft  intervals,  presumably  composited from the pulverized material of the 10 ft intervals.

and other

In the 'Niobium Analytical Standardization' report, dated June 1983, by Sisneros Yernberg,  it  was  noted  that  the  routine  XRF  analysis  performed  by  Molycorp's  exploration division laboratory at Louviers generated niobium values that were higher than analytical techniques. This difference in niobium values was concluded not to be a product of preparation techniques, but a result of the standardization errors in the XRF  analytical technique.  A  set  of  fifteen  composites  was  prepared  from  Elk  Creek  drillore  samples  and -c analyzed  with  varying  methods  including  XRF,  ICP  emission  spectrometry  and  DC  plasma emission spectrometry at  ten  laboratories.  It  was  concluded  that  the  difference  was  caused by high barium and iron within the matrix of the sample, with the largest deviations found in the coarse-grained material. The deviation of Molycorp's routine analytical method compared to  the  recommended  value  ranges  from  20%  to  just  below  50%  (with  the  exception  of  one sample  deviating  1%).  The  recommended  value  was  based  on  a  statistical  analysis  of  the round-robin results.

The  correction  for  the  effect  of  barium  and  iron  on  the  given  Louviers  niobium  value  was calibrated  with  the  XRF  instrument  at  Molycorp's  Louviers,  Colorado  exploration  laboratory, and  many  of  the  previously  analyzed  samples  were  re-sted  with  the  new  calibration.  The te samples that have received the Ba+Fe correction have been noted on the historic Molycorp analytical logs; however in the later series of holes, it is not identified on the assay log. It is expected that all holes drilled after 1983 were analyzed with the newer calibration.

Subsequent  to  the  1983  'Niobium  Analytical  Standardization'  report,  Molycorp  had  100  ft composite intervals of the  majority  of  the  drillholes  (EC 1  to  EC -105)  sent  to  Metric  Labs  of -Ste-Marthe-Sur-Le-Lac, Quebec for check analysis of niobium.'

## 6.3 Historic Resource Estimates

## 6.3.1 Molycorp Internal Estimates

nor

During  the  review  of  historical  documentation  and  the  previous  NI  43-1  Technical  Report,  it  has 10 been noted that Molycorp produced an internal estimate of the tonnage and grade within the  Project. This estimate is not considered to be compliant with CIM terms and conditions, it documented  to  an  NI  43- 01  standard.  The  estimate  is 1 based  on say  analysis conducted  by as was

Molycorp  at  i ts own laboratory  at Louviers,   Colorado,  USA  and other analytical work  at  several commercial laboratories.

On  February 5, 1986, in an internal Molycorp memo  (Cook  and  Shearer, 1986),  the from wo t principle project geologists, Cook and Shearer, states:

'Niobium Resource Lands (Elk Creek Section 33)

These  lands  include  the  Section  33  niobium  resource  and  adjacent  untested  lands.  The resource  contains  39.4  million  tons  of  0.82%  Nb 2 O5 and  is  open  to  the  north,  west  and  at depth.'

Tetra  Tech  commented  in  its  NI  43 -101  Technical  Report  (April   2012)  that  the  memo  is  the  only evidence  of  an  historic  resource  conducted  on  the  roperty.  There  are  no  documents  available  to p explain  or  support  how  this  resource  was  estimated.  Tetra  Tech  concluded  during  its  investigation that it was apparent that the historic resource may have been estimated by a polygonal method.

## 6.3.2 Tetra Tech Wardrop Estimate (April 2012)

Mineral and

In  April  2012,  Tetra  Tech  produced  an  NI  43- 1  Technical  Report  for  the  Project  based  on  the 10 results of verification work completed by Quantum through Dahrouge. The Tetra Tech Resource  Estimate for the Project was prepared in accordance with CIM Best Practices disclosed in accordance with NI 43-101, with an effective date of March 21, 2012.

The  Mineral  Resource  was  estimated  by  the  OK  interpolation  method  using  capped  grade  values. The  Mineral  Resource  for  the  roject  was  classified  as  having  Indicated  and  Inferred  Resources P based on drillhole spacing, drillhole location and sample data population.

The Mineral Resource Estimate for the deposit, at 0.4 Nb2O5% CoG, reported an Indicated Resource of 19.3 Mt at 0.67 Nb2O5%; and an Inferred Resource of 83.3 Mt at 0.63 Nb2O55%.

Table  6.3.2.1  and  Table  6.3.2.2  present  the  Tetra  Tech  Indicated  and  Inferred  Resource  estimates for the Project at various Nb2O5% cut-offs between 0.35 and 0.70 Nb2O5%.

Tetra Tech concluded that the Project warranted further investigation and development.

## 6.3.3 SRK Estimate (September 2014)

In  September  2014,  SRK  produced  an  NI  43-1  Technical  Report  for  the  Project  based  on  the 10 historical drillhole information and the results from Phase I of the 2014  NioCorp drilling program. The Mineral Resource Estimate for the Project was prepared in accordance with CIM Best Practices and disclosed in accordance with NI 43-101, with an effective date of September 9, 2014.

The  Mineral  Resource  was  estimated  by  the  OK  interpolation  method  using  capped  grade  values. The  Mineral  Resource  for  the  roject  was  classified  as  having  Indicated  and  Inferred  Resources P based on drillhole spacing, drillhole location and sample data population.

The  Mineral  Resource Estimate  for  the  deposit,  at  0.3  Nb 2 O5%  CoG,  is  an  Indicated  Resource  of 28.2 Mt at 0.63 Nb2O5%; and an Inferred Resource of 132.8 Mt at 0.55 Nb2O55%.

Table 6.3.3.1 present s the Indicated and Inferred Resource estimates for Proj the  ct, and Table 6.3.3.2 shows the grade tonnage sensitivity at various Nb2O5% cut-offs between 0.35 and 0.70 Nb2O5%.

SRK  concluded that the roject  warranted P further infill drilling to increase the current level of confidence, and commencement of other technical disciplines such as geotechnical hydrogeological to improve the investigation and development of the Project.

## 7 Geological Setting and Mineralization

## 7.1 Regional Geology

The Nebraska Precambrian  basement  predominantly  comprises  granite,  diorite, basalt,  anorthosite, gneiss,  schist  and  clastic  sediments.  A  series  of  island  arcs tured  onto  the  Archean  continent su created the basic framework of the area. This  suture left a north-trending intervening boundary zone ancestral to the Nemaha  Uplift, providing a pre-xisting e tectonic framework  which  controlled  the trend of the later Midcontinent Rift System (1.0 to 1.2 Ga) (Carlson &amp; Treves, 2005). The Carbonatite is located at the northeast extremity of the Nemaha Uplift.

The Midcontinent Rift System, or Keweenawan Rift,  comprises mafic igneous rocks and forms a belt over  2,000  km  long  and  55  km  wide  that  is  exposed  at  surface  in  the  Lake  Superior  Region  and extends southwards through the states of Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, Nebraska and into Kansas (Carlson,  1992).  Both  basalt  and  associated  red  clastic  sedimentary rocks  are  found  in  the Precambrian basement of southeastern Nebraska. These rocks are very similar to those found in the Lake  Superior  region  and  are  thus  considered  to  be  a  product  of  the  Keweenawan  rifting  (Burchett and Reed, 1967;Treves et al. 1983). , Figure 7.1.1  illustrates the major rock types of the Midcontinental Rift system.

The  Nemaha  Uplift (300 Ma)  extends  southward  as a narrow belt from southeastern ska Nebra across Kansas along the midcontinent rift system (King, 1969) (Figure 7.1.1). Along the northern and eastern margins  are  complex  fault zones  and  steeply pping di units.   Regional north- northeast to northeast striking faults are locally transected by northwest  trending ones, including  Central the Plains mega shear (Central Missouri Fault)  to the north and the Oklahoma  mega shear to the south (McBee, 2003). The Carbonatite body intruded near to the axis of the Nemaha uplift and has similar dates  to  a  cluster  of  carbonatites  north  of  Lake  Superior  that  are  in  the  range  of  560  to  580  Ma. (Woolley, 1989;  Erdosh, 1979).  Temporally  the  Carbonatite  occurs  near  the  boundary  between  the Penokean Orogen (approximately 1,840 Ma) and the Dawes terrane (1,780 Ma) of the Central Pl ains Orogen (Carlson and Treves, 2005).

Figure 7.1.2 shows a merged airborne magnetic anomaly map of Nebraska, Kansas and Oklahoma states (USGS, 2004) showing the Midcontinent Rift and Nemaha Uplift systems.

Showing the Midcontinental Rift and Nemaha Uplift.

Regional geophysical data and drilling have confirmed the presence of  kimberlitic intrusive bodies in northern Kansas to the southwest of the Carbonatite. These kimberlites  were emplaced along the rift system during Cretaceous time (Berendsen and Weis, 2001).

The  Paleozoic  rocks  overlying  the  Carbonatite  region  are  dominated  by  approximately  200  m  of essentially  flat-lying  Pennsylvanian  marine  strata  consisting  of  carbonats,  sandstones and  shales. e The  eastern portion of Nebraska was glaciated several times throughout the early Pleistocene (Wayne, 1981), resulting in the deposition of approximately 50 m of unconsolidated till.

## 7.2 Property Geology

The  property  includes  the Carbonatite that has intruded older Precambrian  granitic and  -  to low medium-grade metamorphic basement rocks. The  Carbonatite  and  Precambrian  rocks  are elieved b to  be unconformably  overlain  by  approximately  200  m  of  Paleozoic  marine  sedimentary  rocks  of Pennsylvanian age (ca. 299 to 318 Ma).

As a result of this thick cover, there is no surface outcrop within the Project area of the Carbonatite, which  was  identified  and  targeted  through  magnetic  surveys  and  confirmed  through  subsequent drilling. The available magnetic data  icates ind dominant northeast, west rthwest -no striking lineaments and secondary northwest and north oriented features that mimic the position of regional faults parallel and/or perpendicular to the Nemaha Uplift.

## 7.3 Elk Creek Carbonatite

The Elk Creek Carbonatite is an elliptical magmatic body with northwest trending long perpendicular  to  the  strike  of  the  1.1  Ga  Midcontinent  Rift  System,  near  the  northern  part  of  the Nemaha  uplift (Burchett, 1982; Carlson, 1997). It was first discovered by drilling in 1971 tentatively identified as  a  carbonatite  on the  basis  that  it resembled  rocks  of  the  Fen  District  of Norway (Treves et al., 1972a and 1972b) . The definitive confirmation  of carbonatite  was completed using  Rare  Earth  Element  (REE), P205 and 87 Sr/ 86 Sr  isotope  analysis  (Brookins  et  al.1975).  The , Carbonatite has also been compared to the Iron Hill carbonatite stock in Gunnison County, Colorado on the basis of similar mineralogy (Xu, 1996).

axis and

The Carbonatite consists predominantly of dolomite, calcite and ankerite,  with lesser chlorite, barite, phlogopite,  pyrochlore,  serpentine,  fluorite,  sulfides  and  quartz  (Xu,  1996). It  is,  however, believed from  stratigraphic  reconstruction  based  on  drill  core  observation  in  the  area  ththe  carbonatite  is at unconformably overlain by approximately 200 m of essentially  ng flat Palaeozoic -lyi marine sedimentary  rocks,  including  carbonates,  sandstones  and  shales  of  Pennsylvanian  age  (ca.  299  to 318 Ma).

Current  studies  suggest  that  the  Carbonatite  was  emplaced  a. 500  Ma  (Xu, 1996) in  response to c stress  along  the  Nemaha  Uplift  boundary  predating  deposition  of  the  Pennsylvanian  sedimentary sequence (ca. 299 to 318 Ma).  However, observations on drill cores from the Project site show that the contact between the  arbonatite C body and the Pennsylvanian sediments is a sheared but oxidized contact suggesting that the rbonatite Ca is intrusive in the Pennsylvanian sequence (Figures 7.3.1 and 7.3.2). Furthermore, both rock types appear to have been affected by at least one main brittle -ductile deformation event resulting in formation of fault structures. Microstructures including sub-vertical and sub-horizontal tension veins, together with related sheared veins and fault planes displaying sub-vertical and sub-horizontal slickensides along drill cores are indications for the presence of extensional and oblique to strike- slip faults (Figures 7.3.1 and 7.3.2). These faults could correspond to the magnetic  lineaments present in the area. Investigations aiming to define the location, as well as the orientation and kinematics of these structures are discussed in more detail in Section 7.6.

Microstructures  presented  in  Figure  7.3.1  suggest  the  presence  of  extensional  and  strike- to sl p oblique  faults  in  the  area  as  follows:  A)  Spaced  foliation  and  breccia  in  the  contact  zone  between ( the Carbonatite  and  the  Pennsylvanian  sequence;  Subvertical   (B) and  subhorizontal  (C)  tension veins  and  associated  sheared  veins  in  the  carbonatite;  Fault  planes  showing  subvertical  (D)  and oblique (E) slickensides in the carbonatite. Note that observations were made on cores subvertical holes (about 70¬∞ plunge).

## 7.3.1 Age Dating

An original hypothesis suggested that the Elk Creek Carbonatite was of Keweenawan age (Treves et al., 1983) or ca. 1,100 Ma. However, in 1985, Paterman, of the USGS Isotope Laboratory, provided a K-Ar age of 544 ( ¬±7) Ma (Cambrian) from biotite within the  Carbonatite. Two more K- Ar dates were provided  by  Georgia  State  University  (M.  Ghazi date  unknown) )  which  also  provided  dates  from ( biotite  samples.  The  ages  of  464  ¬±5) Ma  and  484 (¬±5) Ma,  respectively,  are  Ordovician  and  thus ( much younger than the Midcontinent Rift System. Whilst these radiometric provide dates  a generalized  time  range  for  the  Carbonatite  intrusion, additional  age  dating  is  needed  to  establish  a more precise date.

## 7.4 Carbonatite Lithological Units

The  lithological  units  present  in  the  carbonatite  complex  were  defined by  Molycorp  during  their  drill programs  and  simplified  by  Dahrouge  for  interpretation  purposes  during  each  stage  of  the  Project (2011  and  2014).  The  units  in  Table  7. 4.1  (youngest  at  the  top)  represent  the  data  captured  during the original data capture in 2011. The information  compiled was from the drill logs and the corresponding geology reports for each drillhole

A  study  of s ix Molycorp  drillholes  by  Xu  (1996)  identified  two  main  phases  within  the  area,  a carbonate phase and a silicate phase. The study was based on drillholes 2-B-71 (also known as 'NN1'), EC-40, EC-42, EC-50, EC-70 and EC- 82.

The carbonate phase was classified into two main units (defined by texture,  massive  or  brecciated) and several sub-units (defined by mineralogy as presented below).

## Massive Carbonatite

- ¬∑ Dolomite carbonatite;
- ¬∑ Apatite-bearing dolomite carbonatite and pyrochlore-bearing carbonatite;
- ¬∑ Apatite-dolomite carbonatite;
- ¬∑ Hematite-dolomite carbonatite; and
- ¬∑ Magnetite-dolomite carbonatite.

## Brecciated Carbonatite

The silicate phase was also classified into several units as follows:

- ¬∑ Altered basalt;
- ¬∑ Altered lamprophyre; and
- ¬∑ Altered syenite.

In the 2014 drilling, the Dahrouge geologists have split the dolCarb units down into a umber of key n units  using  the  information  of  the  different  phases  of  carbonatite.  The  main  Carbonatite  lithologies used are:

- ¬∑ Dolomite Carbonatite - dolCarb;
- ¬∑ Dolomite Carbonatite Breccia - dolCarbBc;
- ¬∑ Hematite-dolomite Carbonatite - hemdolCarb;
- ¬∑ Magnetite-dolomite Carbonatite - mdolCarb; and
- ¬∑ Magnetite-dolomite Carbonatite Breccia - mdolCarbBc.

SRK  considers  the  more  detailed  split  of  the  Carbonatite  units  to  be  relevant  to  determining  the distribution of different grade populations as supported by statistics ( discussed in Section 14.3). The most  significant  difference  is  the  change  in  the  logging  codes  between  dolCarb  and  mdolCarb,  in terms of the major rock types.

## 7.5 Marine Sedimentary Rocks

The State of Nebraska-wide test hole database contains information for about 5,500 test holes drilled since 1930 by the CSD, School of Natural Resources (SNR), UNL (UNL-CSD/SNR), and cooperating agencies.  Test  hole  location  data,  as  well  as  lithological  descriptions,  stratigraphic  interpretations and geophysical log records are included in the database. In addition, UN -CSD/SNR maintains an L extensive collection of geologic samples obtained from the drilling process (UNL-CSD/SNR website).

The overlying sedimentary units on the Project are of Pennsylvanian age. The CSD's  1971 test hole 2-B-71,  also  labelled  NN -1  by  Molycorp,  intersected  several  formations  of  overlying  Pennsylvanian strata (Table 7.5.1).

## 7.6 Structural Geology

On  the  basis  of  data  provided  to  carry  out  this  structural  study,  SRK  concludes  that  the  ct Proje contains  five  main  sets  of  brittle  faults  variably  cutting  through  the  Pennsylvanian  rocks  and  the carbonatite boundary which appears to be tectonic. The orientations of the faults were determined by comparing  Acoustic  Televiewer  (ATV)  logs  with  specific  SRK  customized  structural  core  logging data, and by undertaking a preliminary interpretation of the provided geophysics images.

model

SRK has used this  data  to  model  the  fault  pattern  in  3-   for  use  in  further  resource  estimation  and D geotechnical studies. The overall fault model included approximately 28 structures with the vicinity of the  Project  with  varying  levels  of  confidence.  Based n  a  review  within  the  mineralization  at  least o three key northeast trending faults have been identified and used during the geological process

The  joints  and  veins  define  orientation  sets  comparable  to  the  fault  trends.  Hematite  veins,  which may  be  up  to  a  meter  thick,  represent  the  weakest  fault  and  joint  infilling  material  which  may  be problematic for mining  and should therefore be given  more attention during any future  geotechnical studies.

## 7.7 Mineralization

The  property  hosts  niobium,  titanium,  and  scandium mineralization as well as  EE R and barium mineralization  that occurs within  the  Elk  Creek  Carbonatite. The current known extents of the Carbonatite unit are approximately  950 m along strike, 300 m wide, and 750 m in dip extent, below the unconformity. For the purposes of this report, niobium, titanium and scandium are considered the main elements of interests, within additional background REE  mineralization  included on and discussed below.

In the Molycorp database, nearly every drillhole contains a separate geological report  summarizing rock  types, assay results  and  associated  petrographic  descriptions  identifying  niobium  and/or REE minerals.  Niobium is reported to be hosted in pyrochlore and REE mineralization is reported to occur as  b√§stnasite,  parisite,  synchysite  and  monazite.  SRK highlighted during the 2014 NI 101 43Technical Report that the level of detail shown in the geological reports has not been transferred to the electronic database in completeness, this has been improved in the revised database Dahrouge geologist familiar with the current logging codes, conducting a review of the historical logs, reports and available drill core to provide an updated geological database.

## 7.7.1 Niobium Mineralization

mineral

The  deposit  contains  significant  concentrations  of  niobium. Based  on  the metallurgical testwork completed to date at a number of laboratories QEMSCAN¬Æ  analysis, using the niobium mineralization is known  to be fine grained, and  that 77%  of  the niobium occurs in the pyrochlore, while the balance occurs in  iron-titanium-niobium an oxide mineral of varying composition.

## 7.7.2 Additional Elements of Economic Interest

Within the Elk Creek Carbonatite a host of other elements exist with varying degrees of concentration. The Company has completed both whole rock analysis and multi element  analysis  on  all  samples  for -the 2014 program, plus resampling of selected historical core/pulps between 2011 and 2014.

As the metallurgical testwork advanced (discussed in Section 13 of this report) during 2014 and 2015 the  ability  to  obtain  a  titanium  dioxide  (TiO and  scandium  (Sc)  product,  became pparent.  TiO   is 2 ) a 2 typically found to be related to the niobium grades with a range of between 3:1 to 4:1 found within the core of the deposit. The scandium mineralization does not directly correlate to niobium mineralization, but does show a grade increase with increasing niobium at low grades, but then a scatter of grades (on average considered higher grades 60 to 80 ppm, within the mdolCarb units.

## 7.7.3 Rare Earth Element Mineralization

Within  the  Elk  Creek  Carbonatite  complex  there  are  several oc currences  of  REE  mineralization, including the Project.  REE mineralization within the Carbonatite occurs within the following minerals:

- ¬∑ B√§stnasite ([Ce,La,Y]CO3F);
- ¬∑ Parisite  (Ca[Ce,La]2[CO3]3F2);
- ¬∑ Synchysite  (Ca(Ce,La)[F|CO3]2); and
- ¬∑ Monazite ([Ce,La]PO4).

A review of historic documents for drillhole EC-93, and part of Quantum's re-sampling program due to the high grade REE mineralization as noted in the Molycorp drill logs includes an excerpt as follows:.

'Barite beforsite is the predominant lithology from 149.4 to 304.8 m. It contains  xenoliths of syenite, older  mafic  rocks,  and  apatite  beforsite  I,  and  is  intruded  by  youn ger  mafic  rocks. Intervals  33  m (100 ft) long contain 2.13% to 2.75% LnO from 149.4 to 274.3 ft.  An interval 18.3 m long at 179.8 to 198.1 ft contains 3.89% LnO. The highest grade mineralization intercepted was 3.0 m at 4.72% LnO at  155.4  to  158.5 m. Lanthanide  minerals  occur  as  radial pa tches  and  random aggre gates  of needles, irregular patches and vein-like aggregates.  The aggregates occur with and without quartz. The aggregates appear as light-gray patches in reddish-brown, hematite-altered beforsite.  Although individual  lanthanide  mineral g rains  are  in  the  micrometer  size  range,  aggregates  of  lanthanide minerals range from 0.23 to 8.0  mm.  in  maximum dimension.  Monazite and b√§stnasite have been identified in the aggregates, and EDX spectra show Ce &gt; La.'

It  should  be  noted  that  Molycorp  term's  LnO,  or  rare-earth  oxides  (REO)  incorporates  lanthanum, cerium and neodymium along with the other 12 rare earth elements.

Present day nomenclature for REE is shown in Table 7.7.3.1.

## 8 Deposit Type

The Project is hosted within the Elk Creek Carbonatite.  By definition a carbonatite is an igneous rock body  with  greater  than  50%  modal ca rbonate  minerals,  mainly  in  the  form of calcite,  dolomite, ankerite, or sodium- and  potassium-bearing carbonates.  Carbonatites commonly occur as intrusive bodies, such   as  isolated  sills,  dikes,  or  plugs,  although  rarely  occur  as  extrusive  rocks. Many carbonatites are associated with alkali  silicate rocks (for  example, syenite, nepheline syenite, ijolite, urtite,  pyroxenite,  etc.). Carbonatites  are  usually  surrounded  by  an  aureole  of  metasomatically altered  rocks  called  fenites. Carbonatite-associated  deposits  can  be c lassified  as  magmatic  or metasomatic types (Richardson and Birkett, 1996).

Carbonatites have  been classified based  on chemical  c lassification  into  four  classes  (Woolley and Kempe, 1989; Wyllie  and  Lee,  1998),  and  further  subdivided  based  on  mineralogical  and  textural characteristics:

- ¬∑ Calcio-carbonatite coarse-grained: s√∂vite , and finer-grained: alvikite;
- ¬∑ Magnesio-carbonatite dolomite-rich: beforsite , and ankerite-rich: rauhaugite;
- ¬∑ Ferro-carbonatite (iron rich carbonates); and
- ¬∑ Natro-carbonatite (sodium-potassium-calcium carbonates).

The use of  a chemical  classification of carbonatites should be used with caution when replacement, or  metasomatic,  processes  have  altered  the  primary  composition  of the  carbonatite  rock  (Mitchell, 2005).

The majority of carbonatite deposits are located within stable, intra-plate crustal units, although some are linked with orogenic activity, or plate separation.  It is also important to note that carbonatites tend to  occur  in  clusters,  and  in  many  places  there  has  been  repetition  of  ac tivity  over  time  (Woolley, 1989).

Worldwide,  carbonatite  deposits  are  mined  for  niobium,  REE,  iron,  copper, phos phate  (apatite), vermiculite and fluorite; with barite, zircon/baddeleyite, tantalum and uranium as common by-products (Richardson and Birkett, 1996).

## 9 Exploration

the

The Carbonatite is covered by approximately 190 to  200 m of Pennsylvanian sedimentary rocks. No surface exploration  has  been  completed  with  the  2014  exploration  program  focusing  on  infill  drilling of  the  existing  Mineral  Resource  using  diamond  drilling  methods.  The  following  section  provides  a summary of the 2012 NI 43- 1 10 Technical Report for the exploration work completed by Company since acquiring the Project in 2010.

## 9.1 Quantum, 2010-2011

## 9.1.1 Data Compilation, 2010-2011

During  2010, the  Company   contracted  Dahrouge  to  undertake  a  compilation  of  all  Molycorp  hard copy  data  and  digitize  all paper  files, including  drill logs  and  accompanying  drill  core  geological reports, internal memos and other historic reports.

The  historic drill core logs feature almost all the 106  Molycorp  drillholes, and  four (out  )  of ve Cominco  American  drillholes. Eight historic Molycorp  drill logs were  not available in the database.

fi historic

The  information  gathered  by  Dahrouge  has  been  compiled  into  a  ntral  database  (or Elk  Creek ce Database) using CAE Mining Fusion software.

## 9.1.2 Quantum Re-sampling Program, 2010

Commencing in November 2010, the  Company contracted Dahrouge to undertake a re- sampling of the historic drill core pulps as part of a QA/QC program to ascertain the reliability of the historic drill core  assay  results  and  to  obtain  more  detailed  analysis  of  the  REE  content  of  the  samples. The samples were re- nalyzed a separately by XRF. The  2O5  assay Nb results were validated and incorporated into the Project database.

SRK  has  reviewed  the  results  of  the  program  and  confirms  that  it  has  followed  current  industry standards in the preparation and correlation of the database.

## 9.2 Quantum, 2011-2012

## 9.2.1 Airborne Gravity and Magnetic Geophysical Survey, 2011

In April 2011, Quantum commissioned Fugro of Ottawa, ON, to conduct high- resolution FALCONTM airborne gravity gradiometer (gD) and total magnetic intensity (TMI) geophysical surveys. The results of the gravity and magnetic geophysical surveys are shown in Figures 9.2.1.1 and 9.2.1.2 below.

The  survey  area  was  centered  on  the roject and  covered  a  total  area  of  approximately  110  km P 2 (approximately  10  by  11  km)  around  the  deposit.  A  total  of  1,176  line  km  were  flown.  Flight  lines were  oriented  000/180¬∞  azimuth  on  a  nominal  line  spacing  of  100  m.  Five  tie  lines  were  flown, oriented at 090¬∞/270¬∞ azimuth, spaced 2,750 m  apart. All    lines flight were flown at a nominal clearance of 100 m (Fugro, 2011).

## 9.3 Significant Results and Interpretation

It has been noted that the 2011-2012 geophysical surveys closely match the results of the CSD and UNL geophysical surveys in the early 1970's confirming the original gravity anomaly.

Subsequently,  in  October  2011,  Colorado-ased  Condor  Consulting  Inc.  (Condor)  was  retained  by b the Company to process and analyze the FALCON ‚Ñ¢ gravity and magnetic geophysical survey data. Condor  noted  coincident  gravity  and  magnetic  anomalies  traversing  1,200  m  to  the  east  from  the known  Project. Several anomalies of higher relative density and magnetization have also identified outside of the drilled prospect area (Condor, 2011).

No further geophysical studies targeting  the  Elk  Creek Carbonatite  have  been  completed  as  part  of the current phase of exploration. SRK considers the exploration programs completed Elk Creek deposit to date to be appropriate for the style of mineralization.

## 10 Drilling

## 10.1  Type and Extent

Mineral  Resource  definition  drilling  at  the Projectas  conducted  in  three  phases.  The  first  was w during the 1970's and 1980's by Molycorp, the second in 2011 by Quantum, and the third and latest program  in  2014  by  NioCorp.  To  date,  129  diamond  core  holes  have  been  completed  for  a  total f o 64,981 m  (Figure  10.1.1). All  drilling  has  been  completed  using  a  combination  of  Tricone,  Reverse Circulation (RC) or  Diamond  Drillling  (DDH)  core  in the upper portion of the hole within the Pennsylvanian  sediments.  All  drilling within the Carbonatite has  been  completed  using  diamond coring methods.

To  date,  local   labor  has been  used  by  drilling  contractors  when  preparing  the  drillhole  pads.  All drilling has been completed using standardized procedures which are in line with international standards  of  best  practice.  The  drilling  completed  by  Molycorp  was  completed  by  using  company owned  equipment  and  sampling  procedures.  The  drilling  companies  used  by  the  Company  during the 2011 and 2014 drilling programs are detailed below:

- ¬∑ 2011:  Black  Rock  Drilling,  LLC  (BRD  Personnel  and  Leasing  Corp.),  17525  E  Euclid  Ave, Spokane Valley, WA 99216;
- ¬∑ 2014: Envirotech Drilling LLC, 900 East 4 th Street, Winnemucca, NV 89445
- ¬∑ 2014: West-Core Drilling, LLC (561 W Main Elko, NV 89801 USA); and
- ¬∑ 2014: Idea Drilling, 1997 9th Avenue North, Virginia, MN 55792.

The drilling has been completed using conventional techniques, using experienced contractors. A portion of the 2014 drillholes used RC drilling within the Pennsylvanian sediments, to increase the efficiency in drilling through the cover material, within areas of strong confidence.

This drilling has been for the purpose of Hydrogeological  and Geotechnical  studies.  The  drilling  has  been  completed  by  Idea  Drilling  and Envirotech Drilling LLC. No sampling of these holes have been completed to date and therefore they have  not  been  considered  in  the  Mineral  Resource,  and  are  excluded  from  Table  10. above. 1.1 Inclusive of these holes the total drilling on the Project is 134 holes for 68,334.1 m.

Not all of the drillholes within the Project were used in the Mineral Resource Estimation accompanies this report, as many do not intersect Nb2O5  anomaly  and the are located at a significant distance away from the deposit. Of the 129 total drillholes within the Project, 48 drillholes are  within  the  Elk  Creek  deposit  area.  Table  10.1.2  summarizes e drillholes used for the  Mineral th Resource Estimation.

## 10.2  Molycorp, 1973-1986

Between 1973 and 1986, Molycorp completed a regional scale drill program over approximately 7 by 7 km  gravity anomaly  that includes the Elk Creek  deposit. The  total program  consisted  6 of 10 drillholes for a total of approximately 46 ,078 m. Outside the Elk Creek deposit area, the regional drill that

this program  was  conducted  on  a  regular  grid  of  610  by  610  m  (2,000  by  2,000  ft)  with  some  closely spaced  holes in selected areas within the gravity anomaly. A more  detailed description of program may be found in Section 6.2.4 in this report.

Included in  this  total,  some  27  holes  for  16,108    were  drilled  over  the  deposit.  Drilling  orientations m varied considerably.

The Molycorp drillhole locations  centered over the Elk Creek  deposit are presented in Figure 10.1.1 (shown in blue).

## 10.3  Quantum, 2011

In April 2011, Quantum conducted a preliminary drill program (three holes) on the Elk Creek deposit and  two  REE  exploration  targets  (two  holes),  which  have  been  excluded  from  the  current  Mineral Resource  Estimation,  as  they  do  notintersect  the  Nb O5 anomaly  and  are  located  to  the  east.  The 2 objectives  of  the  drill  program  over  the  Project  were  to  verify  the  presence  of  higher  grade  niobium mineralization at depth, and to infill drill the known niobium deposit in order to upgrade the resource category of the  previous  resource  estimate  and  expand  the  known  resource.  The  drill  program  was also  established  to  collect  sufficient  sample  material  for  metallurgical  characterization  and  process development studies of the niobium mineralization.

The  2011  program  consisted  of  five  inclined  drillholes,  totaling  3,420  m  of  NQ  size  diameter  core. Inclusive of this total, three drillholes, totaling 2,318 m were drilled into the known Elk Creek deposit. The summary of the 2011 drill program is listed in Table 10.3.1.

Hole NEC11- 001 targeted the eastern portion of the deposit below historic drillhole 1 EC and -1 between vertical holes EC-27 and EC-30. Hole NEC11-002 was drilled into the northwestern portion of  the  deposit.  Hole  NEC11-03  was  drilled  into  the  southeastern ortion  of  the  deposit.  Drillholes 0 p NEC11-004  and  005  drilled  into  regional  REE  targets  nd are  not  subject  to  this  report  and  have a been excluded from the Mineral Resource Estimate.

The  Quantum 2011 drillhole locations   centered over the Elk Creek deposit e ar presented Figure 10.1.1 (shown in green).

Results  from  the  2011  drilling  program  provided  additional  information  on  areas  of  the  deposit  at depth  where  limited  information  was  previously  available.  The  drillholes  confirmed  the  high- de gra potential of the niobium mineralization, as indicated by previous drilling completed by Molycorp.

## 10.4  NioCorp 2014 Program

No new drilling for the purpose of Mineral Resource definition has been completed February 20, 2015 Mineral Resource Estimate.

NioCorp commenced drilling on the Project using a three phased program with the aim of increasing the confidence in the 2012 Mineral Resource Estimate from Inferred to Indicated. The three phased program was  originally   based  on  14  drillholes  for  approximately  12,150  m  (announced  in  a  press release  on  April  29  2014),  but  was  subsequently  expanded  during  the  program  to  18  drillholes  for approximately  15, 482  m.  Three  of the 18  drillholes were  drilled for the purpose  of  metallurgical characterization and  process  development  studies. Two  of  these drillholes, NEC14- T-01 ME and NEC14-MET-02 were not assayed, while NEC14- MET-03 was quarter cored with one quarter being assayed  and the remainder used  for etallurgical m testwork.   The drilling has been  orientated to intersect  the  geological  model  from  the  southwest  and  northeast  (perpendicular  to  the  strike),  with the exception of NEC14- 11 0 and NEC14-12, 0 which were oriented southeast and northwest, respectively.

The NioCorp 2014 drillhole locations (shown in Table 10.4.1) are presented in Figure 10.4.1 (shown in red). The grey lines in Figure 10.4.1 are the mineral lease boundaries.

## 10.5  Procedures (NioCorp 2014 Program)

Detailed descriptions of Molycorp's drilling, sample procedures, analyses and security have not been documented and reviewed by SRK. Given Molycorp's position as a leader in the rare earth industry at  the  time,  it  is  likely  Molycorp  applied  industry  best  practice  for  the  time  period.  The  2011  drilling campaign was managed by Dahrouge and SRK under the same quality and procedures used in the current study. The 2014 drilling program includes a quality control program to ensure the result can s be  used  to verify earlier drilling results and  add  confidence  to  the overall understanding  of deposit.

the handheld

For the 2014 drilling program planned drillhole collars were initially located using a GarminTM Global  Positioning  System  (GPS)  and  marked  with  wooden  stakes.  A  tracked  excavator was  used  to  construct  the  drill  pad  and  collars  were  then  relocated  using  the  GPS  with  wooden stakes  after  pad  construction.  A  geological  compass  and  an  azimuth  pointing  system  (APS)  was used to sight in the drill to the planned azimuth and inclination.

The  2014  core  drilling was  conducted  by  both  Westre  Drilling  and  Idea  Drilling,  both  private -Co contractors. West-Core used both  an  AVD R40 track -mounted core drill  and an  Atlas Copco  CS 14 -track-mounted core drill, while Idea used an Atlas Copco CT-20 truck-mounted core drill. Overburden was  cased  in  all  drillholes  to  depths  ranging  from  18  to  37  m.  The  Pennsylvanian  limestones  and mudstones overlying the target carbonatite were drilled  -sized PQ core and HQ sized  core -for drillholes NEC14- 020 to NEC14- 023. The Carbonatite was drilled with HQ ized -s core, with the

exception  of  the  three  metallurgical  holes  (NEC14-ET-01,  NEC14-MET-02  and  NEC -14MET-03), M which  were drilled  completely  using  PQ -sized  core.  Core  size  reduction  took  place  just  beneath  the Pennsylvanian-carbonatite contact at depths ranging from 206 to 238 m. The core drilling operated 24 hours/day and 7 days/week, with typical progress of 40 m/day.

rigs

During  the  drilling  operation,  the  core  is  retrieved  from  the  core  barrel  and  laid  sequentially  into wooden core boxes by the drilling contractor. Interval blocks are then placed at all run breaks. Once the box is full, the ends and top of the box are labeled with drillhole identification and the sequential box number. Upon completing a box, it is stacked on a pallet or on a truck bed at the drill rig. At the end of each drilling shift, the boxes of core are transported by the drilling contractor in a pickup truck to the NioCorp field office. At this point, the core is in the custody of Dahrouge Geological Consulting Ltd.  (Dahrouge).  Eight  of  the  2014  drillholes  had  piezometers  installed  in  them  after  drilling  was complete. For these drillholes, surface completion consisted of surface casing capped with a lock ng i steel cover, a 1.2 m  cement pad around the surface casing and a steel name plate attached to the 2 casing.  Surface  completion  for  the  drillholes  that  did  not  have  piezometers  installed  consisted  of  a steel marker post and attached name plate. All name plates include drillhole number, total depth and orientation.  Abandonment  of  the  drillholes  consisted  of  cementing  from  total  depth  to  surface  in  the non-piezometer drillholes and from total depth to the bottom of the piezometers in the other drillholes with piezometer installations.

## 10.5.1 Collar Surveys

All  hole  collars were initially  surveyed  prior  to  drilling  using  a  handheld  GPS.  On  completion  of  the hole an external contractor ESP INC. (Engineering/Surveying/Planning), based in Lincoln, Nebraska, has been used to provide a detailed survey of the collar location using a using a Sokkia GS2700 IS GPS, which has 10 mm horizontal and 20 mm vertical accuracy. Data has been provided to SRK in digital format in UTM (NADS83 Zone 14) grid coordinates.

The  location  of  24  of  the  29  Molycorp  drill  collars,  re- cavated  if  required  to  locate  the  drillholes ex from  2011  over  Elk  Creek,  were  surveyed  using  the  same  UTM  coordinate  system  by  CES  Group P.A. Engineers &amp; Surveyors (CES), based in Kansas City, Missouri.

## 10.5.2 Downhole Surveys

Initial collar surveys of dip and azimuth have been taken using compass measurements for all holes (RC  and  DD).  Downhole  surveying  has  been  undertaken  on  historical  Molycorp  holes  drilled  into below the Pennsylvanian sediments at an interval of 30.48 m (100 ft).

The 2011 drilling program was surveyed at 3.05 m (10 ft) intervals, based on the drilling rod lengths used  at  the  time.  All  drillholes were  surveyed  immediately  after  completion  of  drilling.  Downhole deviations, subsurface azimuth and dip, were m apped using a Devico DeviFlex survey tool, which is a nonmagnetic, electronic, multi -shot tool. The DeviFlex tool consists of two independent measuring systems, while three accelerometers and four strain gauges used to calculate inclination and change in azimuth.

The  DeviFlex  tool  communicates  with  a  PDA  and  the  survey  results  can  be  viewed  on  the  PDA immediately  after  completion  of  the  survey.  Dahrouge  geologists  checked  the  downloaded  data  for possible  errors  and  inconsistencies  and  some  readings  were  removed  for  quality  control  purposes.

The  DeviFlex  output  contains  a  column  for  possible  tool  movement  during  surveying.  In  the  event there was potential tool movement, that particular reading was removed from the dataset.

The  DeviFlex  tool  records  changes  in  zimuth,  as  opposed  to  absolute  azimuth  measurements. a Because  of  this  an  initial  (surface)  survey  azimuth  is  required  to  calibrate  the  DeviFlex  downhole azimuth readings. CES surveyed all initial drillhole azimuths by surveying the azimuth of the drill rods extruding  from  the  ground  during  drilling.  These  initial  azimuth  readings  were  used  to  calibrate  the DeviFlex downhole change in azimuth readings and calculate absolute azimuth measurements.

deviations, metal

the

The 2014 drilling program was surveyed at 6.1 m (20 ft) intervals using a Reflex GYRO survey tool. Dahrouge geologists operated the GYRO and collected the surveys. Downhole subsurface azimuth and dip, were mapped with the GYRO, which utilizes a digital MEMS gyro non--magnetic assemblage. The Gyro tool is used to mitigate magnetic deviation caused by equipment,  or naturally occurring minerals such  as magnetite  and  pyrrhotite which  occur  in deposit.

These surveys are synchronized electronically with a receiver at surface, and recordings collected every 30 seconds, after the tool has had a chance to equilibrate. The Reflex GYRO has an integrated  Azimuth  Pointing  System  (APS)  that  is  used  to  orientate  the  True  North  azimuth,  a  GPS position and degree of inclination. Downhole surveys are completed ugh thro the drill rods and location data points are collected every 6.1 m (~20 ft).

are

SRK considers the methods used for the downhole surveying during the 2011 and 2014 campaigns to be in line with industry best practice. Given the long hole lengths of over  700 m, the Company has used  suitable  techniques  to  provide  a  continuous  (ranging  from  3  to  6  m),  measure  of  the  drillhole trace  from  the  base  of  the  hole.  The  use  of  a  Gyro  has  avoided  any  potential  issues  due  to  the magnetic nature of the rocks. The confidence in the hole location of the Molycorp drilling considered  lower  due  to  their  historic nature and  the  wider  measurement  spacing.  Overall  SRK consider  the  level  of  confidence  in  the  downhole  urveys  to  be  sufficient  for  the  declaration  of  an s Indicated level of Mineral Resource.

## 10.6  Interpretation and Relevant Results

The  drilling  has  been  conducted  by  reputable  contractor using  industry  standard  techniques  and s procedures. This work has confirmed the presence of niobium, titanium and scandium mineralization hosted in dolomite-arbonatite  and c lamprophyre rocks. In general, the Lamprophyre is niobium depleted, but contacts between Lamprophyre and Carbonatite may be enriched.

The historic drillholes within the deposit and Mineral Resource area were not conducted systematic grid and  drill spacing  varies from  25  to 225  m.  The  major  drilling direction NioCorp has  been  towards  the  northeast  (Figure  10.6.1).  Two  sets  of  scissor  holes  were  drilled  to the southwest on separate drilling lines within the central portion of the deposit, to confirm that there is no directional bias in the selected hole orientation.

The majority  of  the  holes  have  inclinations  in  the  order  of  60¬∞   70¬∞. The  use  of  scissor  holes  has to confirmed the sub vertical nature of the southwest contact (Figure 10.6.1)

SRK is of the opinion that the drilling operations were conducted by professionals using industry best practice  that the  core  was  handled,  logged  and  sampled  in  an  acceptable  manner  by  professional geologists, and the results are suitable for support of a NI 43-101 compliant resource estimation.

## 11 Sample Preparation, Analysis and Security

The  following  section  summarizes  the  sampling  methodology  used  by olycorp and the  Company M during the historic drilling, the 2011 and the 2014 drill programs.

been sampling

Detailed descriptions of Molycorp's sample procedures, analyses and security have not documented and reviewed by SRK. However, given the detailed ature of the historic drill logs and n reports  for  the  individual  drillholes,  and  Molycorp's  position  as  a  leader  in  the  rare  earth  industry  at the time, it is considered likely that Molycorp applied the same standards to their procedures.

A  revie w  of  previous  Technical  Reports  details  by  Ms.  Beverly  Beethe,  a  sampling  technician  for Molycorp, recalled the following procedures:

- ¬∑ The drill core was photographed;
- ¬∑ The drill core was split with a hydraulic core splitter;
- ¬∑ The  core  was  crushed  on- site,  before  sending  samples  to  the  lab  (the  crusher  is  no  longer on site); and
- ¬∑ The core crusher was cleaned between samples by using limestone blank material.

Complete details of the sampling procedures were unclear as to whether the procedures changed  over  the  period  of the drill programs.  Photographs  of  the  core  were  not  included Molycorp's available historic records.

Molycorp built two well-insulated, steel buildings, located on the property of Ms. Elda Beethe (Lease Agreement  Beethe\_008),  within  100  m of the known  deposit.  The  buildings were  ceded  to Ms. Beethe when Molycorp abandoned the Project. The following italicized text is excerpted McCallum  and  Cathro  2010,  which  provides  the  best  detail  on  the  known  and  assumed  methods used during Molycorp drilling:

'It  is  also  uncertain  what  methods  were  used  to  crush,  pulverize,  blend  and  split  any  of  the  original 10' intervals and composite intervals. In order to confirm some of the analyses of Molycorp's internal laboratory, some of the 10' intervals were split and combined into either 50' or 100' composites and sent to commercial laboratories for independent assays. The procedure of creating the composites is unknown at this time.'

Drill core samples collected were sent to Molycorp's exploration  laboratory at Louviers, Colorado for niobium  and  LnO  analysis.  The  analytical  methods  are  described  in  an  internal  memo  by  Sis ros ne and  Yernberg,  1983,  where  '‚Ä¶Niobium  was  analyzed  by  wavelength  dispersive  XRF  on  pressed powder  pellets, following pulverization to  25 -3 mesh.  Molycorp  did include some  quality control methods.  Standardization  was  provided  by  using  a  variety  of  Elk  Creek  samples,  which  had  been analyzed  by  alternative  methods  at  other  internal  Molycorp  laboratory  facilities.  Over  the  ect Proj duration, the number and/or identification of the standards used changed several times. In 1981, the instrumentation changed from a Philips PW1212 to a PW1400.' (Sisernos and Yernberg, 1983)

The  assay  tables  from  some  of  the  holes  (EC  and  EC -30)  indicate a  'tentative  test'  (XRF)  of -27 niobium  value  from  Louviers  laboratory,  and  a  'commercial  lab  test'  (XRF)  of  niobium  values.  It  is

utilized one

unclear  which  commercial  laboratory  conducted  these  tests,  although  the  1983  Niobium  Analytical Standardization report mentions that the Molycorp exploration department occasionally Bondar-Clegg. Notes on the assay tables indicate that the commercial laboratory utilized standard  (from  hole  EC -11)  for  its  XRF  analysis,  whereas  Louviers  utilized  19  standards  from  hole EC-11.

The drill core, crushed (coarse reject), and pulverized material are currently being stored at a facility managed by the University of Nebraska- Lincoln (UNL). This facility  is located approximately  8.5 km south of the town of Mead, Nebraska, and approximately 63  km northeast of Lincoln, Nebraska. The core was stored at two other storage facilities on UNL property, prior to  its current location.  Prior  to the acquisition of the core by UNL in the  early 2000's, the core was stored in the steel sheds on th e property of Elda Beethe.

SRK  completed  a  site  visit  to  the  Mead  Core  facility  by  Mr.  Cody  Bramwell  on  April  15,  2014. An inventory  of  the  core  was  spot  checked  against  a  2011  core  inventory  list  originally  compiled  by Dahrouge  and  no  discrepancies  were  found.  The  core  investigation  concentrated  on  27  lholes dril within the resource area. Table  11.1.1, is an inventory of core at the Mead facility filtered to include only the 26 drillholes within the resource area.

An  investigation  of  the  drillholes  within  the  resource  area  at  the  Mead  facility  led  to  the  following conclusions:

- ¬∑ Core boxes were generally in good condition and labeled well;

- ¬∑ Not all of the historical core made it to the Mead facility with most drillholes missing between six and 26 of the first core boxes (Table 11.1.1);
- ¬∑ No  drill core  of  the  Pennsylvanian  strata  exists,  hence  no  information  on  the  strata  was gathered;
- ¬∑ Drill core is typically NQ and some noted as being BQ;
- ¬∑ All  drill  core  had  been  hydraulically  split,  removing  the  option  of  sampling  for  geotechnical purposes;
- ¬∑ Accurate  geotechnical  and  hydrogeological  parameters  were  difficult  to  estimate  due  to  the core appearing to have been hydraulically split; and
- ¬∑ Identifying mineralization was difficult due to the fine grained nature of the rock and a lack of differences between mineralized and non-mineralized rock.

In addition to the drill core, there also exists an unknown inventory of sample pulps and rejects at the Mead facility.

## 11.2  Quantum Re-Sampling, 2010

The 2010/2011 re-sampling program utilized a total of 1, 861 samples of pulverized material from the Molycorp drillholes that were prepared by the analytical division of Molycorp. Samples were derived from 1.52 m (5 ft) or 3.05 m (10 ft) intervals of split NQ or HQ diameter size core. The samples were selected  based  on  the  geological  interpretation  at  the  time  and  in  areas  of  elevated  Nb values. 2 O5 Not  all  samples  have  been  selected  continuously  within  each  drillhole.  SRK  confirmed  evidence  of the resampling during the site inspection to the Mead Core facility.

A rigorous QA/QC protocol was used, and included the routine insertion of field laboratory pulp duplicates, blanks and niobium certified reference standards. Samples transported to the ALS Chemex (ALS) facility in Reno, Nevada, and prepared for analysis at the ALS testing facility in North Vancouver, B.C., using method XE-XRF10, whereby samples are prepared by pulverizing to 90% passing -70 ¬µm, then decomposed utilizing a lithium  borate flux, and analysis by XRF.  A  portion  of  niobium  results  were  checked  with  Hazen  of  Golden,  Colorado  (Quantum  news release February 22, 2011).

For the 2011 sampling program, a rigorous quality assurance and quality control protocol established.  It  involved  the  routine  insertion  of  field  duplicates,  laboratory  pulp  duplicates,  blanks, and certified reference standards. All samples were shipped to, and analyzed by Laboratories (Actlabs) of Ancaster, ON. An  ght-major ei oxides, rare earths, and trace element package was selected and samples were analyzed via fusion inductively coupled plasma (ICP) and inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) in addition to niobium by XRF, and fluorine by method 4F-F (news release, September 21, 2011).

## 11.4  NioCorp Drilling Program, 2014

Different drilling techniques,  such  as  DDH,  RC  and  tricone  drilling,  have  been  employed  to  drill through the overlying geological rock units (limestone &amp; mudstone), but all carbonatite intervals have been diamond cored. All drilling contractors at  Elk  Creek utilized  DDH  utilized  conventional  wireline drilling techniques. Two drilling diameters have been used during the program with the upper

portions  of  each  cored  hole  drilled  using  PQ  diameter  (85  mm)  for  geotechnical  testing  and  HQ diameter (63.5 mm) through the Carbonatite, with the exception of NEC14- MET-01, NEC14-MET-02 and  NEC14- MET-03,  which  were  drilled  entirely  with  PQ.  Geological  and  geotechnical  logging  is completed  prior  to  mar-up  and  splitting  of  the  core  and  completed  by  onsite  geologists  with  the k number of geologists used limited to ensure consistency in the logging codes used.

SRK is responsible  for  the  geotechnical  logging.Rock  quality  was  determined  using  the  Q system -(Q=(RQD/ Jn )* ( Jr/  Ja)*  (J w/SRF), where RQD= Rock quality designation; J= Joint set  number; J= n r Roughness of the most unfavorable joint or discontinuity; J= Degree of alteration or filling along the a weakest joint; JW= Water inflow; SRF= Stress reduction factor. SRK personnel also record hardness and weathering to aid in geotechnical parameters for the future mine design.

## 11.4.1 Core Recovery

Core recovery and RQD were generally good for most drill core. Core recovery has been recorded in the  data  base  and  is  measured  in  the  field  at  the  drilling  rig  by  the  geologist.  The  borehole  name  is noted  and  the  drilling  interval,  this  is  compared  to  the  actual  core  recovered  to  back  calculate  the recovery. The recovery information is then loaded into the sample database.

SRK  has  reviewed  the  drill  core  recovery  results  and  comments  that  while  the  recoveries  per  hole vary  from  a  low  as  2% the  typical  minimum  recovery  is  in  the  order  of  47%  to  100%,  with  the , average recovery per hole ranging from 93% to 99%.

Drill core was digitally photographed under natural outdoor or fluorescent indoor lighting prior to core cutting. All digital photos are of high resolution and stored in a digital archive format. The geological logging included observations of color, lithology, texture, structure, mineralization, and alteration. All geological information is collected at sample interval scale and recorded in a digital logging program that  has  been  custom  formatted  for  carbonatite  deposits.  Detailed  geological  core  logging  of  the Carbonatite  intervals,  alteration  zones  and  its  relationship  to  other  intrusions  allows  sampling  to  be restricted by unique geological boundaries.

## 11.4.2 Sample Preparation for Analysis

Trained staff was involved at all stages of the sampling, sample packaging le and p transportation  process.  Day  to  day  logging  tasks  were  split  between  Dahrouge  and  SRK,  whereby Dahrouge completed all geological and sampling related tasks, while  SRK focused on geotechnical logging  requirements.  During  the  diamond  drilling  program  (incing  the  RC  pre-ollar  drilling  of lud c RC/DD holes), staff members were based full time at the drill Project site to supervise the drilling and data collection including geological and geotechnical properties. Geological sampling was completed by  geologists (Dahrouge),  under  the  supervision  of  qualified  professional  geologists.  Between  four and six trained geologists acted as samplers.

Core sampling method and approach has been consistent through the 2011 and 2014 drill programs. Core was boxed on site and delivered each day to a core facility on the roject site where the core P was  logged  and  split. For the 2014  diamond  drilling program,  up  to three coring drill rigs monitored by two qualified professional geologists, one drill supervisor and an geological  team.  Drill  core  was  boxed  and  transported  from  each  drill  rig  to  the  core  processing facility  (distances  up  to  800  m),  at  the  end  of  each  12  hour  shift.  Core  logging  involved  detailed geotechnical and geological information. All key geological features have been

lithology comprehensively. A Project database which contains the relevant rock codes and descriptions has been created. A total of 22 detailed rock codes have been used during the logging, which  is  reduced  to  10  codes  under  a  simplified  logging  code  defined  as  'MAJOR'  in  the  database (Table 11.4.2.1). DDH core was sampled and assayed at predominantly 1 m intervals.

The  drill  core  within  each  core  box  was  marked  up  and  then  lit  along  orientation  marks.  Cutting sp was  completed  using  one  of  three  electric powered,  water-cooled  diamond-bladed  BD  3003E  core -saws at the Project sample preparation and storage facility. HQ and minor intervals of  PQ core were halved  for  assay. Drillhole  NEC14-MET-03,  a  PQ -sized  hole,  was  quartered  with  one  quarter  being assayed, and the remaining core packaged for metallurgical testing.

Infrequent  broken  or  soft  sections  of  the  core  (typically  the  iron  oxide  altered  zones)  were  sampled by the geologists and an equal sample split was taken from this material. These intervals account for a  significantly  small  portion  of  the  sampled  material.  Core  not  used  for  assaying  or llurgical meta testing is stored at the Project site.

A summary of the sampling procedure used to collect core samples at the Project is as follows:

- ¬∑ The entire carbonatite intersection was sampled, including the geologically logged low -grade niobium carbonatite intervals of the footwall or hangingwall, for all holes with the exception of NEC14-020 to NEC14-023 where approximately 10 m of the hangingwall was sampled;
- ¬∑ Sample  intervals,  generally  1  m  in  length,  were  marked  on  the  core  and  recorded  in  the geological database (Fusion Database);
- ¬∑ Sample intervals were assigned a unique sample number;
- ¬∑ Specific gravity measurements were performed at approximately 6 m spacing;
- ¬∑ Hand-held  Niton- XRF  measurements  were  collected  on  the  core  to  assist  geological  and sample divisions;
- ¬∑ Magnetic  susceptibility  measurements  were  performed  on  the  core  to  assist  geological  and sample divisions;
- ¬∑ Clearly marked sample intervals were split in half by a wet diamond saw;
- ¬∑ Split intervals were cleaned prior to bagging and cutting equipment was regularly cleaned;
- ¬∑ Sampled  intervals  were  placed  in  durable  barcoded  sample  bags  that  were  clearly  labelled and contain back up sample tags within each bag;

- ¬∑ Sample bags containing original core sections and field inserted control samples barcode scanned and secured in 5 gallon plastic shipping pails;

were

- ¬∑ Detailed  shipping  logs  and  preparation  requests  were  sent  in  hard  copy  and  digitally  to  the primary analytical laboratory;
- ¬∑ Sampled core sections and blind control samples  were shipped for analysis in secured pails and transferred using a bonded trucking company; and
- ¬∑ The unsampled half of the core is stored in labelled wooden core boxes at the Project site for reference or further sampling.

Core samples and the core library are securely stored at the  Project facility work area. This material is stored inside locked metal buildings when the Project is not operating.

## 11.4.3 Security Measures

NioCorp has  rigorous  security  measures  in  place  to  prevent  any  tampering  of  the  core  or  samples before  and  during  the  transport  process.  These  measures  include  redundant  sample  identification, appropriate  sample  bag  closures  and  shipment  of  sample  bags  inside  pails  with  lids.  SRK  is  of  the opinion  that  these  measures  are  consistent  with  or  in  excess  of  current  industry  best  practices  for projects at this scale of exploration.

The 2011 and 2014 sawn core samples were shipped to Activation Laboratories Ltd. (Actlabs) 1336 Sandhill  drive,  Ancaster,  Ontario  Canada.  Actlabs  is  the  primary  laboratory  for  sample  preparation and for analysis of the 2011 and 2014 drill core samples.  Actlabs regularly participates in proficiency testing and maintains formal approval of CAN 578, -P-1 CAN -P-1579, CAN -P-1585, CAN -P-4E (ISO/IEC 17025:2005) accreditation from Standards Council of Canada and maintains current certification issued March 5, 2014 through February 27, 2018. Actlabs maintains ISO standards, which is obtained through experienced peer audits that ensure they conform recognized analytical standards and that the accredited method  validation verifies a number  of analytical variables designed  to ensures  that data obtained from  these  methods  are  defensible. Actlabs  maintain  a custom  Laboratory  Information  Management  System  (LIMS) ystem to  provide s the traceability necessary for today's stringent reporting requirements.

The  2014  sampling  program  employed  SGS  as  an  external  check  laboratory.  SGS  is  an  integrated geochemistry, mineralogy and metallurgy laboratory in Lakefield,  which ON,  has extensive experience with Nb205 and REE analysis for both exploration and metallurgy projects. SGS Lakefield is ISO17025 accredited for the analysis methods used on this Project (GO\_XRF76V &amp; GE\_ICP90A).

Core samples were shipped to Actlabs, where they were received, weighed, prepared, and assayed. Sample preparation is completed using Actlabs' RX1 preparation package that has been modified to meet the Project requirements. A summary of the process is detailed below:

- ¬∑ Samples were received and cataloged;
- ¬∑ Collect as received sample weight (kg);
- ¬∑ Drying of the whole sample at 60¬∞C for 12 hours, in a customized high air flow drying room;
- ¬∑ Collect dry sample weight (kg);
- ¬∑ Crushed  in  a  jaw  crusher  (Boyd  crushers)  to  90%  passing  0  mesh  (2  mm),  with  quartz -1 cleaner between each sample;

- ¬∑ Riffle split (RSD splitters or option of Jones Riffle split) coarse crushed sample and extract a 250 g sample;
- ¬∑ Pulverized  250  g  sample  using  ESSA  pulverizers  with  ring  and  puck  bowls  to  95% -200 mesh (75 ¬µm), with quartz cleaner between each sample;
- ¬∑ Laboratory internal coarse-reject duplicates (1 in 50 ) and Pulp duplicates (1 in 30) are also routinely prepared; and
- ¬∑ Quality of the rejects and pulps are routinely monitored to ensure proper preparation procedures are performed.

During  the  preparation  procedure  coarse- reject  splits  and  pulp- splits  are  extracted  from  the  original core sections for primary laboratory and secondary (external) laboratory check analysis. se The samples  are then inserted into the sampled sequence and/or shipped to the external laboratory, SGS (Lakefield), for analysis.

Actlabs'

Core samples were systematically assayed at Actlabs for niobium (Nb O5) and tantalum (Ta 2O5)  by 2 XRF analysis, using a  Panalytical Axios -mAX, following a  lithium metaborate/tetraborate fusion of a 2 g sample. All XRF analysis followed procedures outlined in Actlabs '8-XRF' package, with selected analytical results provided for NbO5 and Ta2O5. Whole Rock analysis and 43 Major Elements were 2 completed using ICP and ICP/MS (by a Perkin Elmer Sciex ELAN 6000, 6100, 9000 ICP/MS) finish following a Lithium metaborate/tetraborate fusion preparation as defined by analytical '8-REE Major Elements Fusion ICP(WRA)/Trace Elements Fusion ICP/MS(WRA4B2)' package.

Additional  analysis  was  performed  for  fluoride,  using  analytical  package  '4F'.  Fluoride  content  is -quantified  using  a  fluoride  ion  electrode  to  directly  measure  fluoride-  activity,  when  a  prepared ion fuseate  is  dissolved  in  dilute  nitric  acid  and  its  ionic  strength  adjusted  in  ammonium  citrate  fer. buf Prior  to  analysis  sample  is  prepped  using  a  combined  fusion  with  lithium  metaborate  and  lithium tetraborate  in  induction  furnace.  Fluoride  analysis  was  completed  for  2014  drillholes,  NEC14-, 006 NEC14-007, and NEC14-008.

All QC data are registered in the LIMS system and Assay results have been returned to  NioCorp and the overseeing professional geologists in electronic format and loaded into the sample database with the batch number and date of assay recorded after review for QA/QC.

External  pulp  check  samples  were  submitted  to  SGS  (Lakefield)  Labs,  as  a  third  party  analytical result confirmation. Pulp samples and their control samples were prepared by Actlabs and shipped to SGS (Lakefield),  where  they  were  received,  evaluated  for  sample  quality  and -homogenized,  and re assayed.  SGS  (Lakefield)  prepared  and  re- omogenized  samples  prior  to  analysis  using  MISC80 h package prior to analysis. During preparation SGS completed a 10% sieve check (SCR32 package) to  ensure  95%  sample  pulverization  passes  200  mesh  (75  ¬µm)  preparation  requirements.  Samples were assayed using an XRF analysis for Nb 2O5 and 13 major Whole Rock oxides, following a borate fusion  as  defined  under  SGS  package  'GO  XRF76V  ORE  GRADE'  (Table  11.4.4.1).  Scandium -analysis  has  been  completed  at  SGS  laboratory  using  GE\_ICP90A  package  which  has  a  detection limit of 5 ppm.

## 11.5  Quality Assurance/Quality Control Procedures

The  Company  has  integrated  a  series  of  routine  QA/ C  procedures  throughout  the  sampling  and Q analytical  analysis  for  both  the  2011  and  2014  drilling  programs,  to  ensure  a  high  level  of  quality  is maintained throughout the process. SRK has not reviewed any QA /QC data for the Molycorp drilling program,  as  no  information  has  been  detailed  in  the  database.  Definition  of  quality  of  the  historical assays has been based on resampling/verification work completed by Dahrouge during 2010 - 2011. A  total  of  1,861  samples  (approximately  44%  of  the  original  assays)  were  selected  for  reanalysis during  the  program  and  subjected  to  the  current  QA/QC  protocols.  The  selection  for  -assay was re based on available material and proximity to the mineralization wireframe used during that study.

The  following  control  measures  were  used  to  monitor  both  the  precision  and  accuracy  of  sampling, sub-sampling,  preparation  and  assaying.  For  the  2011  and  2014  sampling  the  QA/QC  consisted  of the insertion of duplicate  samples  taken  from  various  stages  of  the  process,  insertion  of  known control samples (Standards Reference Material (SRM) and Blanks), plus an external check at a SGS laboratory. A summary of the type of samples, source and level of insertion is included Table 11.5.1  and  Table  11.5.2.  Note  percentages  are  reported  as  proportion  of  samples  vs.  the original submissions, unless otherwise noted.

In  addition  to  the  QA/QC  Program  which  accompanied  the  2014  drilling  program,  there  was  also  a QA/QC Program which accompanied the 2014  re-assay program which was undertaken to increase the database size for both titanium and scandium analysis. The 2014  re-assay program consisted of submitting  1,335  historic  Molycorp  pulps  for  scandium  analysis.  QA/QC  for  the  assay  program reconsisted of the  insertion  of  pulp  duplicate  samples  and  SRMs.  A  summary  of  the  type  of  samples, source and level of insertion for the re-assay program is included in Table 11.5.3.

SRK  highlights  that  due  to  the  timing  of  the  relatively  recent  developments  within  the  metallurgical database the routine submission of 2014 pulps did not include a scandium CRM. For the purpose of the current exercise SRK has relied heavily on the analysis of duplicate results to assign confidence, however  SRK  recommends the  Company  complete  further  verification  using  external  checks  and  a suite of scandium SRM to increase the confidence further, provided such SRMs can be obtained.

SRK  understands  the  Company  has  initiated  these  programs  at  the  time  of  writing  this  report  and data is expected to be available for review during the next Mineral Resource update.

The following section provides details of the types of samples used at each section of the sampling process,  followed  by  a  discussion  of  the  results.  The  QA/QC  data  was  analyzed  by  the  Project geologist on a routine basis prior to entering the data into the central database. Failures reported directly back  to the laboratory with systems  (described in Section 11.5.1) in  for place reanalysis (e.g. 10 samples before and after a failed standard).

SRK has been supplied with all the raw QA/QC data and has completed an independent check of the results.

## 11.5.1 Actions

The Company has a defined list of action  points to review  all A/QC results. To review field quartz Q blanks a limit of 20 x ICP-MS detection limits and 2 x XRF detection limits, depending on the element being analyzed are  applied. Results  which report above this value are reported to the laboratory as having potential contamination.

therefore

The  SRM  has  been  sourced  from  Dillinger  Hutte  Laboratory ermany).  SRK  has  reviewed  the (G certificates for each of the SRM's and notes that no standard deviation has been supplied and only a confidence interval of 95%  is shown  on  the certificatesbased ( on three laboratory round robin testwork). Due to a lack of information in the certificate the Company has elected to use a 5%  rror e as a caution limit, and a 10% error as a failure. While this is not generally accepted as best practice, which  would  be  based  on  2x  or  3x  standard  deviations  for  caution  or  failure,  SRK  agrees  that  the limits applied are reasonably tight which provide a reasonable level of control in confidence to the assay results. SRK noted no significant difference in the potential decisions  using either the 10%  or 3x 95%  confidence limits from the certificate, and considers the current limits to be acceptable.

In  terms  of  the  duplicate  samples,  no  e-assay are  requested  based  on  the  field  duplicates,  which r are monitored for sample fluctuations and local variability. The reject and pulp duplicates reviewed and re-assay s requested on values in excess of 20% difference using the equation:

When Duplicates  or  SRM's  fail  the  10  sequential  samples  on  either  side  of he QC  Sample are ret analyzed  or  re- analysis  of  the  entire  batch  is requested,  depending  on  the  fail  type,  location,  and sample range.

## 11.5.2 Field Sample Collection, Identification, Labeling, Insertion of Field Controls and Shipment

Sample tickets were assigned initially  at  the  core  shed  using barcodes  with duplicate  tickets placed in  the  bag  and  on  the  outside  of  the  bag,   addition  to  the  routine  samples  a  number  of  check In samples  (QC) were  routinely  inserted.  Trained  staff  was  involved at all stages  of  the sampling, sample packaging and sample transportation process.

Sample  identification was  confirmed  using  barcode  labeling  and  visual  sample  type  comparisons prior to sample shipment. Utilization of barcoded samples ensured both shipment forms and analytical  labs  us ed accurate  information.  Two  types  of  QC  samples  ere inserted  at  this  stage  of w the process which includes the following:

- ¬∑ Field ¬º- core duplicates -  1 in 20 (5%), inserted to test mineralization and variability;

sampling

- ¬∑ Field quartz blanks - 1 in 20 (5%) Blanks were inserted within or immediately after samples collected from mineralized intervals, targeting zones of elevated visual mineralization, where possible; and
- ¬∑ SRM material - 1 in 20 (5%) is inserted in the field with the sample sequence.

## 11.5.3 Sample Preparation and Insertion of Pre-Selected and Quality Control Samples: Actlabs

Samples were dispatched  to  the  laboratory  via  commercial  transport.  The  laboratory  receive and d weighed  the  samples.  Receiving logs were  monitored  by  Dahrouge, which were  then checked against original sample lists to ensure accuracy.

The  standard  sample  preparation  at  the  laboratory  targeting  the  criteria  of  95% ssing  200  mesh pa (-200  mesh).  The  high  passing  rate  and  the  fine  mesh  are  required  to  ensure  the  obium  minerals ni are sufficiently liberated for sub-sampling due to the fine size fractions known from metallurgical and petrographical studies.

To  ensure  quality  throughout  the  sample  preparation  phase,  ioCorp  (via  Dahrouge) utilized  the N insertion  and  splitting  of  pre-elected  control  and  duplicate  samples,  based  on  the  insertion  rates s shown in Table 11.5.1.

## 11.5.4 Results

## Standards (SRMs)

The  2014  Program  included  496  SRMs  inserted  in  Actlabs  batches  as  part  of  the  routine  sample submissions.  The  material  was  sourced  from  Dillinger  Haute  laboratory  (Germany).  A  summary  of the defined limits and results for Nb 2 O5 and TiO 2 are shown in Tables 11.5.4.1 and 11.5.4.2, respectively.  The  tables  show  the  mean  assay  grades  vs.  the  assigned,  plus  a  summary  of  the number of samples returned outside of the warning and acceptable limits.

The  results  for  Nb O5 2 (Figure  11.5.4.1)  from  the  SRM  submissions  have  been  within  acceptable limits, with results generally reporting slightly above the assigned grades (between 2.4% and 4.4%). This  can  be  seen  in  SX18-2  with  the  assay  values  typically  reporting  above  the  assigned  value  of 0 the SRM. In general these range between the assigned value and the 5% caution line. Statistically ¬± the results indicate a slight high bias across all grade ranges with the differences between the mean and  assigned  grades  ranging  from  2.4%  to  4.4%.  A  total  of  six  samples  have  reported  outside  the failure level of ¬±10%.

Analysis of the selected SRM used for Nb2O5 assay certificates also provides an expected value and associated range for TiO2, for all four SRM's selected (Figure 11.5.4.2). The most significant issue to note  is  that  the  grade  range  of  the  TiO  in  the  SRM  is  in  the  order  of  0.25%  to  0.30%,  which  is  an 2 order  of  magnitude  lower  than  the  typical  grade  ranges  at  e  Project   of  2.0%  to  3.5%  within  the th geological wireframe. The results from the low grade analysis shows the analyses are typically below the assigned grade within 5% to 10%. The lowest performance is noted in SX-18-04 where a number of the assays report less than 10% low.

Given the low grade nature of the assays in the SRM's SRK has relied more heavily on the duplicat e assays  and  external  checks  by  SGS.  SRK  recommends  the  Company  define  a  program  where  a small  proportion  of  the  assays  across  all  grade  ranges  (1%  to  2%)  are  sent  for  reanalysis  with  new SRMs that cover the full range of expected grades to add to the confidence in the assay database.

the

Only  67  scandium  SRM  submissions  have  been  analyzed  to  date  (Figure  11.5.4.3).  The  routine submissions to Actlabs (which were analyzed for Sc) were completed prior to changes in metallurgical flowsheet. With the revised focus on titanium and scandium the company conducted a re-assay program  of  2011  sample  pulps  which  had  not  previously  been  analyzed  for  TiO or  Sc.  A 2 scandium SRM was included within these batches. The results indicate good correlation between the laboratory  scandium  values  and  the  expected  grade  with  a  difference  in  the  mean  of  0.36  ppm  or 0.4%. A total of three samples have reported above the guideline line of 3 standard deviations during the study.

Overall SRK  considers  that  the  SRM's  have  performed  within  acceptable  levels  of  error  for  the reporting of Mineral Resources. SRK has discussed the slight high bias in the NbO5 assays with the 2 Project  geologist  who  has  raised  the  issue  with  the  laboratory,  as  review  of  the  laboratory  internal SRM  values  indicated  the  assays  are  performing  within  the  laboratory  defined  limit The  external s. CRM values however show the laboratory has over reported based on routine submitted SRM in the order of 2% to 4%.

## Blanks

Coarse natural clear quartz blanks (sourced from an optical quality quartz quarry) were also included in order to:

- ¬∑ Pass  through  the  same  sample  preparation  system  as  the  real  samples  and  highlight  any potential contamination; and
- ¬∑ Be indistinguishable from real samples and prevent these samples being treated different manner to real samples at the laboratory.

in

The following certified natural blanks were inserted within batches of samples sent to the laboratory. In  total, 454  natural  blanks   (4.7%  total  submissions)  were  inserted  at  regular  intervals  within  the sample suite which represents 4.7% of total sample submissions from the 2014 drilling program. The detection limits for Nb O5 and TiO2 are 0.003% and 0.001% respectively. SRK has assigned control 2 limits (approximately 10x detection) at 0.01% and 0.03% for both Nb2O5 and TiO2.

Mineral

SRK  notes that  cluster assays  (Figure  11.5.4.4),  during  the  early  stages  of  the  drilling,  splayed di potential  sample contaminations but SRK  does  not consider this to be material to the Resource Estimate.

a

SRK  notes for the TiO data 2 (Figure 11.5.4.5) more variability is noted than within the Nb 2 O5 database,  but  overall  the majority of the samples  are  less  than  0.01%  rol cont line which  is the equivalent  of  10x  the  detection  limit,  above  which  potential  contamination  maybe  identified.  Overall SRK  considers  that  the  blank  material has performed  within  acceptable  levels  of  error  and  there  is limited evidence of any major contamination issues at the laboratory.

## Duplicates

and

A  total  of  419  field  duplicate  samples,  comprised  of ¬º  core,  were resubmitted to  Actlabs as  part  of the routine sample submission from H  samples, DD which represent .3% 4 of total sample submissions from the  2014 drilling program. The results are shown in Figure 11.5.4.6 Figure 11.5.4.7, and  indicate  a  reasonable  comparison  between  the  original  and  duplicate  assays. SRK has also compared the base statistics for the two datasets and found the difference in the mean grades to be 1.3% for Nb2O5 and 1.0% for TiO 2, which indicates an  acceptable  level of precision  at the laboratory.

260  reject  duplicate  samples,  comprising  a  second  riffled  sample  splitken  after  crushing ,  were ta submitted  to Actlabs for reanalysis (blind) as part of the routine sample  submission  from DDH samples, which represent 2.7% of the total sample submissions from the 2014 drilling program. The results  are  shown  in  Figure  11.5.4.8  and  igure  11.5.4.9,   and  indicate  a  reasonable  comparison F between  the  original  and  duplicate  assays.  SRK  has  also  compared  the  base  statistics  for  the  two datasets and found the difference in the mean grades to be 0.0% for Nb2O5 and 0.3% for TiO2, which indicates an acceptable level of precision at the laboratory.

There were 468  pulp  duplicate samples, comprising a second riffled sample split, taken pulverization,  were  submitted  as  part  of  the  routine  sample  submission  from  H samples,  which DD represent 4.9% of total sample submissions from the 2014 drilling program. The results are shown in Figure  11.5.4.10 and Figure  11.5.4.11,  and indicate  a  reasonable  comparison  between  the  original and duplicate assays. SRK has also compared the base statistics for the two datasets and found the difference in the mean grades to be  %  for 0.4 Nb 2 O5  and 0.3% for TiO   which 2 , indicates an acceptable level of precision at the laboratory.

(laboratory

SRK has reviewed all the data available using XY Scatter Plots, QQ Plots and ARD vs. percentage -rank charts. Based on the review SRK concludes that no significant issues in terms of the precision exists from the Actlabs assays in the database, with all phases of the sample preparation displaying strong  correlations between  the  original  and  duplicate  assays.  The  results  confirm  the  expected trend  of  greater  precision  within  pulp  duplicates  vs.  field  duplicates which  are  have  more  potential , variability from the sample itself (geology), through the entire sampling process precision).

## 11.5.5 Check Analysis SGS vs. Actlabs

the

A total of 462 pulp duplicate samples, comprising a second riffled sample split of pulverized material, taken  at  the  same  time  of  extraction  as  the  primary  pulps,  were  submitted  as  part  of  the  routine sample submission to a check laboratory (SGS). The total number of samples represents equivalent of approximately 5% of the original submissions.

The  SRM  material  submitted  to  SGS  returned  assays  which  werery  close  to  the  SRM  values v indicating slightly better accuracy than Actlabs for both Nb igure 2 O5 (F 11.5.5.1) and TiO 2 (Figure 11.5.5.2). The charts indicate that similar to Actlabs the SRM's return values at or above the assigned  grades  for  NbO5 and  values  at  or  below  the  assigned  grades  for  TiO   In  SRK's  opinion 2 2 . both laboratories provide sufficient accuracy for Indicated Mineral Resources.

A  review  of  the  XY  Scatter  plot  (Figure  11.5.5.3)  for  Nb   shows  Actlabs  reporting  consistently 2 O5 higher across all grade ranges. SRK assumes this indicates some difference either in the method or equipment accuracy at one of the laboratories. A comparison of the mean Nb 2O5 grades indicates an 8.7%high bias at Actlabs compared to SGS.

The bias is consistent with higher values reporting larger differences. SRK recommends Company follow-up with both Laboratories to understand the fundamental difference in the sampling methods and identify the source of the bias. The results of the insertion of SRM  material to the tw o laboratories  indicate  that  SGS  in  general  reports  better  accuracy  than  Actlabs,  but  the  dataset  is limited  to  49  submissions  vs.  492  submissions  at  SGS  and  Actlabs  respectively.  The  results  from SGS  are  assumed  to  present  more  accurate  results  SRK  recommend  that  a  more  comprehensive set of samples are submitted to SGS with SRMs, specifically focusing on mid to high grades, so that a correction can be built into the Actlabs assays for future estimates. SRK does not suspect this will have a material impact on the overall Mineral Resource and the difference will be within acceptable level of errors of the current classification system. K SR understands that the Company has undertaken  a  supplemental  assay  program  to  address  the  bias  as  of  the  time  of  writing  this  report. The results of such analysis will be integrated into any future technical studies.

the

A review of the XY Scatter plot (Figure 11.5.5.4) for TiO shows a slight low bias exists between the 2 two  datasets  with  Actlabs  reporting  consistently  lower  across  all  grade  ranges.  SRK  assumes  this indicates  some  difference  in  the  either  method  or  equipment  accuracy  at  one  of  the  laboratories.  A comparison of the mean grades indicates a low bias towards the Actlabs results in the order of -4.6% on the mean grades (Actlabs reporting lower grades).

A  review  of  the  XY  Scatter  plot  (Figure  11.5.5.5)  for  Sc  shows  good  correlation  between  the  two datasets  with  Actlabs  reporting  slightly  lower  grades  across  all  grade  ranges.  A  comparison  of  the mean grades indicates good correlation with Actlabs results in the order of -0.5% of the mean grades (Actlabs reporting lower grades).

In addition to the pulp duplicates a further 44 samples were submitted which were further duplicates of  the  external  laboratory  pulp  submissions.  SRK  has  reviewed  this  information  and  does  not  note any significant bias.

After considering the performance of the two laboratories for SRM material submitted, concludes that a slight high bias exists in Nb2O5 assays for the 2014 database, with Actlabs returning higher assays  than SGS.The  bias  has been  reported to the laboratory and  investigations

SRK

into

probable  cause  are  ongoing.  N  conclusion  on  the  source  of  the  bias  is  available  at  the  time  of o writing.

SRK concludes that while a bias exists it is currently  within  acceptable  levels  of  error  and  therefore will not materially impact on the Mineral Resource. SRK has accepted the database as presented by Actlabs, and not made any adjustments to the assay information provided.

## 11.6  Specific Gravity

NioCorp  collected  specific gravity (SG)  measurements  in  2011  and  2014  program,  covering  the spatial  and  temporal  aspect  of  all  drill  campaigns  and  considering  the  various  lithologies  present. Two methodologies have been implemented, (1) water immersion specific gravity measurement and (2) volumetric dry density measurement. Initially only the water immersion measurements were taken but  during  the  site  inspection  by  SRK  it  was  recommended  that  a  volumetric  wet  and  dry  density

measurements should also be taken, due to the porous or vuggy nature of some of the core causing possible errors in the water immersion method. The two methods used are described below:

Water immersion method determines the specific gravity by the following formula:

SG = (weight in air) / (weight in air - weight in water)

A 10 to 20 cm piece of whole, dry, HQ core  was weighed dry on an Ohaus Scout Pro scale and the weight recorded. The weight in water is determined by attaching the core by a long nylon fishing line to the Ohaus balance, lowering the core piece into a large plastic tub located immediately below the scale  and  filled  with  purified  water.  The  weight  of  the ore  while  immersed  is  then  recorded,  and c applied to the formula for determining the SG. Porous core samples of altered carbonatite cannot be accurately measured using this method and are better represented by using the dry measurement.

Dry Volumetric method determines the Density by the following formula:

## SG= [(weight in air)]/ [(œÄ) (core length) (core radius) ] 2

for

A  10  to  15  cm  piece  of  whole,  HQ  or  PQ  core,  were  dried  in  a  convection  oven  for  60  minutes  at 200¬∞F.  If  the  core  still  has  moisture,  it  was  left  in  the  oven  for  a  longer  period  of  time.  The  exact length of the core was measured with a caliper and recorded. The sample was then weighed dry in air  by  suspending  the  core  by  a  long  nylon  fishing  line  from  an  Ohaus  Scout  Pro  balance  and  the weight  of  the  core  recorded.  It  is  assumed  the  radius  remains  constant  for  each  size  of  drill  core: 31.75 mm  for  HQ  and  41.50  mm  for  PQ.  These  measurements  are  applied to the formula determining the SG. Calibration weights were occasionally used to verify  accuracy the of the balance. The table used to complete the measurements is made of wood construction and tested for level by the technician.

A total of 1,225 samples have been analyzed using both method and a comparison between the two methods  (Figure  11.6.1)  shows  that  the  water  immersion  method  returns  higher  density  values.  A statistical analysis of the mean  grades  of the two populations where both methods  have  been recorded show a difference of approximately 1%. The correlation shown on the XY scatter  ndicates i a strong correlation for the majority of cases, but for some samples there are significant differences with the volumetric density returning higher grades. This may be a result of voids, porous material.

SRK does not consider the difference to have a material impact.

## 11.7  Opinion on Adequacy

SRK  comments  that  the  decision  for  e-assay s  of  the  SRMs/standards  is  based  on  a  percentage r and not the typical 2 x standard deviation, or 3 x standard deviation  which is generally  accepted as industry  best  practice.  SRK  has  reviewed  the  original  certificates  for  the  SRMs  submitted  as  part  of the  2014  program  and  notes  that  no  standard  deviation  is  shown  on  the  certificate.  The  limits  have been requested from the supplier by Dahrouge but not supplied. The current method of using a 5% ¬± and ¬±10% limit, while not ideal provides a reasonable level of confidence in the control samples, and the  Company  has  addressed  this  issue  by  including  an  additional  certified  reference  sample  GRE -04, which provides certified standard deviations which form the basis of control lines.

SRK is  of  the  opinion  that  these  measures  are  consistent  with  or  in  excess  of  current  industry  best practices for projects at this scale of exploration.

## 12 Data Verification

The geological database has been provided to SRK by Dahrouge who have been involved with the Project  since  the  Company  acquired  the  Project,  under  its  former  name  of  Quantum.  In  addition  to the  digital database  SRK  has  been  provided  access  to  historical  copies  of  the  data  captured  in scanned format for the drilling logs.

During the period of ownership by the Company  a number of validation exercises have completed on the database to provide a high level of confidence in the data available geological modelling and associated Mineral Resource Estimate.

the

The following Section provides a summary of the previous verification exercises completed Dahrouge  and  Tetra  Tech  (as  part  of  the  previous  NI  43-   Technical  Report),  plus  additional 101 verification work completed by SRK as part of the current study.

## 12.1  Tetra Tech Data Verification, 2012

Tetra Tech reviewed the database of drillholes within the Project area and found:

- ¬∑ The  database  consist ed of  29  drillholes,  totaling  18,159.15  m.  Twenty seven  of  the  twenty --nine drillholes, totaling 17,057 m, were used in the interpretation of the Project;
- ¬∑ Tetra  Tech  performed  an  internal  verification  process  of  the oject  database  against  the Pr original logs, surveyor reports, and laboratory-issued assay certificates;
- ¬∑ The  data  verification  process  examined  the  collars  (easting,  northing,  elevation),  lithologies (interval, rock type), and assays (sample number, Nb2O5% value);
- ¬∑ No errors were found in the collar, lithology, and assay files;
- ¬∑ A number of holes (EC, -25 EC -33, EC -34, EC -35, EC -36 and EC 37) -were missing downhole survey information; however, these holes appear on the southwestern  limit of the deposit and were only used in the interpretation of the deposit, not in the resource estimate;
- ¬∑ Quantum's  2010  to  2011  re-ampling  data  compared  to  historic  values as less  than  1% s w different in all cases except for one where the tolerance was less than 2%;
- ¬∑ REE assay  values  were  not  included  in  the  2012  Mineral  Resource stimate  and  therefore E were excluded from the verification analysis;
- ¬∑ The  results of the verification study found  the following: During  Quantum's  2011  drilling program, seven historic Molycorp drill collars were uncovered to survey the collar locations. The entries in the survey reports were recorded in imperial units (feet) and a factor of 0.3048 was  used  to  convert  the  values  into  a  metric  system  (meters).  The  database  entries  were verified against these converted values from the survey reports, and no inconsistencies were found;
- ¬∑ Completed  verification  of  the  digital  database  against  the  assay  certificates  for  the  three holes  drilled  within  the  Project  (NEC11-001,  NEC11-002,  and  NEC11- 003),  accounting  for 1,195  of  the  total  6,078  samples,  or  19.66%  of  the  entire  sample  dataset.,  and  no  errors were observed;
- ¬∑ It  was noted that when assaying yielded results below detection limit, half the detection limit (i.e. less than 0.003 Nb 2O5%) was entered in the database for samples from 2011 drillholes, whereas a value of 0 was entered for all such occurrences in  holes drilled prior to 2011. SRK has utilized a value of half the detection limit for all such occurrences;

by

- ¬∑ Completed verification on the lithological logging for potential transcription errors for NEC11001,  NEC11-002,  and  NEC11- 003. It  was  noted  that  overburden  depths  were  not  recorded  in the logs but were, however, entered in the database;
- ¬∑ Sixteen  of  the  historic  Molycorp  drillholes  were  attributed  with  a  negative  azimuth  value  in the  survey  file.  All  drillholes  were  vertical  therefore  rendering  the  azimuth  insignificant,  and all such negative values were corrected to zero;
- ¬∑ Tetra Tech identified a number of cases where minor intervals where logged in the field but were not transcribed into the database;
- ¬∑ All errors were correct by Tetra Tech prior to importing into technical software;
- ¬∑ The  header, lithology, survey, and  assays  tables from the database  were  imported Gemcom GEMS‚Ñ¢ software, which has a routine that checks for duplicate overlapping intervals, and intervals beyond the length of the hole. No errors were identified; and

into intervals,

- ¬∑ Completion  of  a  site  inspection  on  February  8  to  9,  2012,  which  cluded  the  inspection  of in Quantum's 2011 drillhole locations and of the core logging, sampling and storage facility.

Independent check samples were collected during the site visit by Tetra Tech. Four ¬º core samples were  collected  from  the  available  drill ore  at  the  core  storage  site  at  Quantum's  core  logging  and c sampling facility.

- ¬∑ The samples were sent to Actlabs in Ancaster, ON for analysis. The sample preparation was carried  out  by  crushing  the  sample  with  the  entire  sample  passing  a  10  Mesh  (1.7  mm) screen. The sample was then split and 250 g pulverized with hardened steel to 95% passing a 150 Mesh (106 ¬µm) screen (Actlabs code RX1). Analysis for niobium was conducted using XRF analysis;
- ¬∑ The Tetra Tech check sample analysis correlates well with Quantum's assay results for the same sample intervals in three of the four cases; and
- ¬∑ Tetra  Tech  concluded  that  the  analytical  results  for  Nb 2 O5%  have  been  confirmed  and  that they are adequate for purposes of the 2012 Technical Report.

## 12.2  SRK Validation

SRK  geologi sts  under  the  guidance  of  Cody  Bramwell  and  David  MacDonnell  were  on  site  on  a rotational basis during the 2014 drilling program conducted by NioCorp.

## 12.2.1 Site Inspection

In accordance with  NI  43-101 guidelines, Martin Pittuck (Qualified Person) visited the  oject Pr between June 17 and 19, 2014. The main purpose of the site visit was to:

- ¬∑ Ascertain the geological and geographical setting of the Project;
- ¬∑ Witness the extent of the exploration work completed to date;
- ¬∑ Inspect the drilling rig(s);
- ¬∑ Review the sample preparation methodology;
- ¬∑ Inspect core logging and sample storage facilities;
- ¬∑ Discuss geological interpretation and inspect drill core; and
- ¬∑ Assess logistical aspects and other practicalities relating to the exploration property.

an also

SRK was able to verify the lity qua of geological and sampling information and develop interpretation  of  niobium  grade  distributions  appropriate  to  use  in  the  Mineral  Resource  model.  A basic review of the electronic database against a number of drillhole intersections was completed.

In  addition  to  the  site  inspection  by  Martin  Pittuck  SRK  has  had  a  continual  involvement  reviewing data, interpretation and modelling outcomes.

## 12.2.2 Procedures

To  verify the database  SRK  has  looked  at  all  aspects  of  the  data  collection.  SRK  checked  the coordinates of all drillholes via handheld GPS  for Corp  2014 Nio drillholes. SRK  notes  that the drillholes  are  well -located  and  have  been  surveyed  by  an  external  company  using  high  precision equipment.

## Survey Information

During  the  review  of  the  historical  database  a  number  of  potential  transcription  errors  between  the historical locations and the captured information have been identified. This in part has attributed to the collars co- ordinates being captured from detailed historical maps during the original data capture,  which may potentially  have had a different  datum. Where possible historic collars 24 ( drillholes) were re-surveyed, but given the agricultural nature of the land were not always located at surface.  Where  this  occurred,  holes  were  re -located  using  metal detectors  and  dug  out  using a backhoe, and re-surveyed. The results showed a consistent shift between the historical collars used in the 2014 estimates. The difference in the UTM  coordinates is consistently 4.7 m in coordinate and approximately 7.85 m in the Y coordinate (as shown in Table 12.2.2.1).

Based  on  the  investigation  SRK  has  adjusted  the  collar  locations  accordingly  to  account  for  the higher confidence in the differential global positioning satellite (DGPS) measurements.

## Historical Assay Information (Adjustments in Molycorp Assays)

During  a  review  of  the  historical  assays  against  the  raw  Molycorp  database  btained  by  Dahrouge o since SRK's  2014  estimate, an issue was  noted where  by a proportion of the Molycorp database  had  been  factored (original assays  factored by 80%). No  clear explanation has defined within these cases as to the reason for the factored assay results.

assay been

The  latest  database  export  provided  to  SRK  included  information  for  the  historical  assays  broken down into the following categories:

- ¬∑ Nb2O5\_%\_Orig-XRF (Molycorp data, not always reported)
- ¬∑ Nb2O5\_%\_Corr-XRF (Molycorp laboratory corrected data, not always reported)
- ¬∑ Nb2O5\_%\_ALS (2010 re-assay)

Within the 2012 data compilation the general format has been to adjust any results which contained only  the  original   Molycorp XRF  data  by  the  aforementioned  80%.  SRK  estimates  this  has  been completed for approximately 10% of the assays within the 0.3% grade shell limit, and decreasing to &lt;4%  within  the  0.4%  grade  shell.  Based  on  a  study  of  the  mean  grade  using  the  original  vs.  the adjusted values the influence on the mean grade is negligible (&lt;0.5%). As no defined reason for the adjustment has been noted, SRK has used the original data where assays no re- during the 2011/2012 verification program has been completed. SRK does not anticipate the use of the factored or unfactored historical assays will have a material impact on the current Mineral Resource Estimate. To ensure best practice and sufficient QA/QC is completed on the database SRK would recommend re-assaying  the  10%  of  samples  from  the  historical  holes  which  lie  within  the  0.3%  grade  she ll, where  available  in  pulp  or  core  is  in  sufficient  quality  to  obtain  a  sample  using  the  current  QA/QC protocol. SRK  understands  that  the  Company  has  initiated  this  re- ay  program  at  the  time  of ass writing.

## Database Information

The  database  used  for  the  resource  estimate  was  constructed  by  Dahrouge  and  is  stored  in  CAE Mining Fusion Database, and is considered to be of good quality. The use of a commercial database is considered industry best practice with the following key advantages:

- ¬∑ The system facilitates fast and accurate data collection and can be configured (via pick -lists) to meet all specific data schemes and logging standards relevant to each site;
- ¬∑ Drillhole  related  data  can  be  recorded  directly  at  the  worksite  on  a  touch-reen  tablet  or  a sc notebook computer;
- ¬∑ Data  is  stored  locally  and  synchronized  to  a  single  central  database  for  the  Project  via  a network  connection.  Transfer  to  and  from  the  Central  Database  provides  an  audit  trail  for any edits made to the database;

logging

- ¬∑ The  QA/QC  system  allows  users  to  achieve  immediate  data  validation  as  information  is captured. Only valid field values and labels are accepted, ensuring consistent standards are applied across multiple staff or sites;
- ¬∑ Importing  laboratory  results  can  be  done  directly  to  avoid  potential  transcription  errors.  The import function can proactively detect problems with analytical results; and

- ¬∑ Export routines can be created to provide the required data for use in technical software in a consistent format.

SRK  has  been  supplied  with  exports  from  the  database  covering,  collar,  survey,  lithology,  assay, alteration  and  key  structural  indicators.  SRK  has  used  importing  routines  within  Datamine  Mining Software  (Datamine)  and  Leapfrog¬Æ   During  the  importing  routine  the  following  errors  have  been . noted:

- ¬∑ Assay  values  in  the  Molycorp  database  where  Nb 5%  values  are  set  to  zero.  These  are 2 O assumed by SRK to represent values below detection limits and so SRK reset the values to half of the respective half detection limit;
- ¬∑ A  search  for  sample  overlaps  or  significant  gaps  in  the  interval  tables,  duplicate  samples, errors in the length field, anomalous  assay  and  survey  results s  been  completed.  No ha material issues were noted in the final sample database;
- ¬∑ The original signed electronic copies of the laboratory certificates were also spot verified for selected holes in the final electronic assay database and no errors were found; and

for

- ¬∑ Within the multi-element database a number of cases exist in the Molycorp assays have yet to be re-assayed for TiO2 or Sc, as they were not included in the 2010 verification program. SRK has assumed that this is due to the original samples not being located submission.  SRK  has  ignored  all  cases  where  this  occurs  and  inserted  a  default  'NNS'  for use in Leapfrog¬Æ during the geological modelling process.

## Absent TiO2 and Sc assays

In total 6.0% and 7.1% of the Nb 2O5 assays within the mineralized wireframes contain absent values for TiO2 and Sc respectively. The average Nb 2O5 grade for the absent values is approximately 0. 3% Nb2O5.  These  samples  were  not  included  within  the  2010  e-assay program,  and  therefore  no  pulp r material  was  available  for  inclusion  in  the  2014  assay  program.  SRK  has  investigated  alternative methods of how the absent values should be treated within the database.

Within the geological wireframes where multi-ment ele data was absent, SRK  has completed a regression  analysis  for  absent  TiO   and  Sc  values  in  the  database.  The  sample  regression  was 2 established  by  plotting  XY  Scatter  charts  of  each  element  vs.  the  Nb5.  SRK  notes  a  very  strong 2 O positive  correlation  between  NbO5  and  TiO 2  although  a  portion  of  the  population  where  the  TiO 2 2 grades are elevated shows a lesser corresponding increase in the NbO5 (Figure 12.2.2.1). In SRK's 2 opinion,  these  may  relate  to  more  Lamprophyric  material  which  tends  to  have  lower  Nb5 grades. 2 O Based on the analysis SRK elected to use an equation to derive missing values for TiO2:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

In  addition  to  the  assigned  values  SRK  has  also  flagged  the  database  with  an  indicator  for  quality where true assays equal 1 and assigned values equal 0. This allows SRK to review the quality of the original sampling data during the classification process.

In contrast there is no linear trend which can be established between the Sc and Nb O5 grades (left 2 Figure 12.2.2.2). To establish a relationship SRK has created an average for the Sc values based on 0.05% interval  bands  of  NbO5.  The  resultant  chart  shown  on  the  right  in  Figure  12.2.2.2  shows  a 2 more  defined  model  which  has  been  used  to  assign  values  with  missing  Sc  assays.  To  model  the trend  SRK  has  used  linear  trends  at  lower  grades  and  then  capped  the  Sc  values  aboveiven a  g threshold. An example of the criteria used for estimation domain (KZONE) 15 is shown below:

- ¬∑ IF(KZONE==15 AND SC\_PPM==absent() AND Nb2O5&lt;0.55)
- o SC\_PPM=(Nb2O5*110)+20 END
- ¬∑ IF(KZONE==15 AND SC\_PPM==absent() AND Nb2O5&gt;=0.55)
- o SC\_PPM=80 END

The equations have been optimized per estimation domain with validation being completed testing actual raw values to ensure the results remain within the plotted population. Additional checks have  been  completed  to  confirm  the  Nb O5 population  for  the  absent  Sc  values  remains  consistent 2 with the sample population within Nb2O5 and Sc values, via histograms.

To test the potential impact on the resultant Mineral ource  Estimate  SRK R es completed three estimates as follows:

- ¬∑ Missing values reset to the detection limit and assumed to be waste;
- ¬∑ Missing values ignored and hence estimates rely only on neighboring values; and
- ¬∑ Missing values assigned based on Nb2O5 assays using regression formulae given above.

SRK compared the results using visual analysis via key cross -sections (10 in total per element), plus production  of  a global grade  tonnage  curve  (not  classified)  for each  scenario.  The  results  were tabulated and compared to assess the level of risk in using each scenario.

SRK preference has been to use the regression methodology in the current estimate as it is known from  reviewing  the  2014  assays  that  relationships  exist  between  both  the  TiOnd  Sc  values  with 2 a the Nb2O5 mineralization. Therefore by ignoring assigning a value of half detection limit would result in an underestimate, and ignoring the samples could potentially overstate the grade.

In  comparison  for  the  regression  analysis  the  increase  in  the  mean  grade  from  2.37%    2.48% for to TiO2, and 59.5 ppm to 67 ppm for Sc at a cut -off of 0.3% Nb2O5. SRK considers these differences to be within acceptable levels of error, with the error reducing further at higher cut -offs. The reduction in the  differences  at  higher  cut offs  is  due  to  samples  having  already  been  sent  for  either  primary  or -reanalysis to obtain TiO2 and Sc values.

geological

SRK  would  recommend  that  the  historical  database  which  has  not  been  submitted  for  reanalysis previously, be sent for TiO2 and Sc assays to confirm the numbers used in the current estimate. SRK understands  that  the  Company  have  put  a  program  in  place  to  locate  and  re- mple  the  historical sa pulps,  which  should  be  completed  prior  to  any  future  updated  Mineral  Resources.  SRK  does  not consider that this will make  a material impact, but having absent assays within the wireframe  is  not  considered  industry  best  practice.  Work  programs  will  be  required  to  increase  the level of confidence for assay database further with the focus on two main areas:

- ¬∑ Assaying values which have not currently been assayed for TiO and Sc which fall within or 2 in close proximity to the current geological/mineralization wireframes; and

duplicate

- ¬∑ Conducting a QA/QC program which includes submission of a low, medium and high grade TiO2 and Sc SRM (if one can be purchased), along with the submission of a range of grades from  returned  pulps  to  the  primary  laboratory.  The  aim  of  this  exercise  would  be  to  confirm the accuracy of the laboratory as the precision is well established from the program.

## 12.2.3 Limitations

SRK was not limited in its  access to any  of the supporting  data used for the resource estimation or describing the geology and mineralization in this report.

The  database  verification  is  limited  to  the  procedures  described  above.  All  Mineral  Resource  ta da relies on the industry professionalism and integrity of those who collected and handled the database.

SRK  is of the opinion that appropriate scientific methods  and  best  professional judgment were utilized  in  the  collection  and  interpretation  of  the  data  used  in  this  report.  However,  users  of  this report are cautioned that the evaluation methods employed herein are subject to uncertainties.

In  summary,  SRK  has  accepted  the  sample  database  as  provided  by  the  Company  and  concludes that  the  data  is  sufficiently  reliable  to  support  Mineral Resource Estimation. SRK  recommends  that the issues raised previously between the umpire laboratory checks should be further reviewed. SRK would  consider  the  work  programs  laid  out  above,  in  conjunction  with  further  infill  drilling  will  be required to gain confidence in the database to possibly delineate a Measured Mineral Resource.

## 13 Mineral Processing and Metallurgical Testing

Metallurgical testwork has been carried out in order to properly design processing facilities at a PEA level.  In  2014  and  2015,  comminution,  magnetic  and  gravity  separation,  and  flotation  testwork  was performed at multiple laboratories including Hazen Research Inc. (Hazen) in 2014, SGS Canada Inc. (SGS) in 2014 and early 2015, and at Eriez Flotation Division (Eriez) in 2014 and early 2015.  During the first half of 2015, column flotation pilot plant testing was carried out at COREM.

The results of the flotation pilot testwork obtained at  COREM demonstrated acceptable metallurgical recoveries  but  higher  than  targeted  mass  pullnd  thus, direct  leaching  of  the  ground  mineralized a material  without  a  flotation  circuit  was  selected  as  the  most  favorable  process  for  treating  the  Elk Creek mineralized material.

The metallurgical, hdrometallurgical  and  pyrometallurgical y testwork   performed is described Sections 13.1, 13.2, and 13.3, respectively.

## 13.1.1 Metallurgical Testwork Summary

## Samples

Metallurgical composite samples were selected throughout the 2014 core drilling program, to provide 'representative'  feed to  the  testwork  program.  As  the  project  progressed  and  additional  drilling  was completed on the defined resource,  the composite selection  was extended vertically and laterally to encompass the proposed  mine  plan.  Composite  samples  for  metallurgical  testing  were  designed  to target the primary niobium nriched -e rock unit, magnetite-lomite do carbonatite, using collected geological  details,  multi- element  geochemistry,  and  the  strongly  correlated  Nb O5 analytical  results. 2 All composite samples, except 'Nb Comp' and COMP -1 to COMP  identified -5 below in Table 13.1.1.1,  were  continuously  selected  across  targeted  drillhole  intervals,  with  the  inclusion  of internal dilution (low grade or waste rock) zones equal to or less than 3  m continuous interval length. Composite intervals selected for Nb Comp did not use a continuous interval selection and excluded the minor zones of internal dilution, potentially reducing  representativeness  of the the deposit. COMP-1  to  COMP -5  were  each  selected  by  different  rock  type  and  depth  within  the  deposit.  e Th general  composite  details  are  summarized  in  Table  13.1.1.1  with  their  selection  criteria  defined  in Table 13.1.1.2.

Selected  composites  were  extracted  and  shipped  to  SGSriez,  and  COREM,  directly  from  the ,  E Project  site for all quartered HQ core -material, or from the certified analytical laboratory for all coarse-crush (coarse-reject) material. Shipments were completed using bonded trucking companies and  recorded  as  received  in good  order  at their final destination. SGS  received  three  separate composite  shipments,  including  Nb  Comp  (SGS 2014-03-24\_QTR-COMP),  Nb  2 -nd Drill  Core  Comp (SGS-2014-07-15\_QTR-COMP), and Mini lot -Pi Comp (SGS 014-08-20\_REJ-COMP). -2 Eriez received a single composite shipment, SAN# 18805  -2014-11-05\_REJ-Comp).  COREM (Eriez received  one shipment that included five composite samples, COMPto  COMP -5.  Composite -1 preparation and homogenization was completed independently at SGS and Eriez preparation facilities.

## Mineralogy 1

The two composite samples used for metallurgical testing at SGS, ' Nb Comp' and ' 2 nd Nb Drill Core Comp' ,  were submitted for quantitative analysis using QEMSCAN once received on- site at the SGS facility in Lakefield, Ontario ('Lakefield'). The following is a summary of observations:

- ¬∑ Both samples  were  stage- ground  to  K0   of 106 Œºm. The analysis  was conducted on three 8 size fractions (+106 Œºm, -106/+25 Œºm, and -25 Œºm).
- ¬∑ The  Nb  Comp  and  the  2  Nb  Drill  Core  Head  consist  of  similar  mineralogy  although  minor nd differences are recorded:
- o Carbonates 51% and 62%, respectively, Fe oxides (10% and 5%), quartz/feldspars (7% and 11%), biotite (3% and  4%), Fe- (Ti)-oxides  (2%),  barite  (15%  to  10%),  sulfides  (2% to  1%),  and  trace  amounts  of  other  minerals.  Note  that  both  magnetite  and  hematite were identified with XRD analysis.
- ¬∑ The  D 50   (50% passing value from  the cumulative  grain size distribution) shows  that  the niobium minerals are &lt;20 Œºm in size.
- ¬∑ Pyrochlore  carries  most  of  the  Nb  (78%  to  82%),  followed  by  Nb- ile  (11%  to  12%),  and rut ilmenorutile (10% to 6%).
- ¬∑ Free  and  liberated  pyrochlore  accounts  for  23%  and  37%  in  the  Nb  Comp  and  2 b  drill nd N core  head,  respectively.  Pyrochlore  liberation  is  significant  at  48%  and  57%  in  the  Œºm -25 fraction of the Nb Comp and 2  Nb drill core head, respectively.  This indicates the need for nd fine  grinding  to  liberate  the  niobium  mineralsif  a  physical  separation  is  used  in  the  process flowsheet.
- ¬∑ Exposure of niobium minerals greater than 30% exposure is 39% and 48% in the Nb Comp and 2 nd Nb drill core head.

## Comminution

Comminution testwork performed at SGS Canada Inc. (SGS) indicated that the mineralized material is considered relatively hard giving a Bond Ball Mill Work Index of 14.5 kWh/t and not very abrasive giving an abrasion index of 0.066.

## Flotation Testwork

## SGS

During the second half of 2014 and early 2015, SGS carried out a flotation testwork campaign using drill cores  samples.  Over  125  flotation  tests  were  performed  during  their  developmental  testwork program,  most  of  which  consisted  of  direct  pyrochlore  flotation  using  2  to  4  kg  of  feed  ground  at 100% passing (P100) of between 20 and 104 ¬µm. Their program consisted of collector screening and the  evaluation  of  various  reagents,  reagent  dosages,  grind  sizes,  and  operation  parameters.  Their best  tests  produced  flotation  concentrates  with  over  2.3%  Nb O5,  recoveries  over  70%  NbO5,  and 2 2 with weight recoveries of between 15% and 20%.

In October 2014, SGS ran a mini-pilot mechanical flotation plant in order to generate a large quantity of  feed  for  hydrometallurgical  testwork.  Prior  to  flotation,  the  feed  was  ground  using  two  ball  mills followed by Low Intensity Magnetic Separators (LIMS) in series. The flotation circuit consisted of five rougher  stages  and  four  cleaner  stages.  In  all,  the  mini  pilotlant  processed  1,100  kg  of  feed  over -p 30  hours,  and  generated  a  concentrate  with  3.33%  Nb 2 O5,  55.7%  Nb 2O5 recovery,  in  10.2%  mass pull.

Due  to  the  liberation  requirementof the  mineralized  material,  the  best  tests results  were  achieved with flotation  feed  ground  to  100%  passing  37  ¬µm  (equivalent  to  80%  passing  20  ¬µm).  Mechanical Flotation  of fine materials  usually  causes  a  lot  of  entrainment,  thus  the  option  of  using  flotation columns without desliming was considered.

In most tests performed during the testwork campaign, the titanium recovery followed the same trend as the niobium recovery, and scandium recovery was approximately equal to the mass pull.

## Eriez

In December 2014 and January 2015, a series of laboratory flotation tests  were completed by Eriez. Promising results were achieved on a feed that was 100% passing 37 m and 80% passing 20 ¬µm. ¬µ Several column flotation tests were performed including: ten rougher column tests, one column bulk rougher  run  under  the  optimized  flotation  conditions,  a  single  1 cavenger  bulk  run  test  on  the st s rougher  tail,  a  single  2  scavenger  bulk  run  test  on  the  1  scavenger  tail,  six  cleaner  tests  on  the nd st combined  concentrates  of  the  rougher,  1 and  2 st nd scavenger,  and  four  scavenger  column  tests  on the cleaner tails.

All the test results showed  that  column  flotation, with the use  of wash  water,  provided  superior results to those achieved  using  conventional  flotation  techniques  conducted  without  froth  washing. Under the optimized flotation conditions a rougher -scavenger-scavenger arrangement complete with a  cleaner  and  cleaner  scavenger  step  achieved  a  final  combined  concentrate  of  5.6%  Nb  at  a 2 O5 mass yield  of  11.2%,  and  an  NbO5 recovery  of  72.6%.  Final  combined  concentrate  showed  a  TiO 2 2 grade of 21.4% with 77.6% recovery (feed grade of 3.1%). Scandium was found to follow the mass pull  of  the  flotation,  yielding  approximately  11%  recovery.  The  conceptual  flowsheet  with  average bulk run results can be seen in Figure 13.1.1.1.

## COREM

flowsheet

During the first half of 2015, COREM  performed  pilot plant testwork to validate the , developed  by  Eriez.  Column  flotation  tests  were  performed  on  five  representative  composites.  The flotation feed was ground to 100% passing (P100) of 38 microns using a ball mill.

Continuous  conditioning  and  continuous  flotation  required  an  intensive  program  to  replicate  Eriez results. Several  pilot scale column flotations tests  were performed,  including various  adjustments  to reagents,  air  rates,  feed  rates,  froth  depth,  and  varying  the  number  of  columns.  After  an  intensive campaign, COREM was able to replicate the results of Eriez's rougher and scavenger flotation steps. Unfortunately  the  cleaning  flotation  stages  did  not  provide  the  desired  metallurgical  results  in  terms of mass pull versus recovery. A great deal more effort and time would have been required to achieve comparable results to the batch flotation steps achieved by Eriez.

Considering  the poor mass  pull performance  achieved  during  column  flotation  pilot  plant  test s and given the prospect of dramatically increased niobium, titanium, and scandium recoveries performing a  whole ore  leach  on  a  much  coarser  ground  material,  it  was  decided  not  to  puue  the rs flotation  mineral processing  beneficiation route. Therefore,  mineral processing  for the Elk Creek project has been limited to material handling and comminution prior to hydrometallurgical processing.

## 13.1.2 Process Selection

The first step in mineral processing consists of crushing the R OM to meet the required particle size for  the  grinding circuit feed . Grinding will be performed in a single stage by  a  SAG mill  to achieve a P80 of 1100 ¬µm, the target feed size for the hydromet plant . In order to increase the solids  density of the feed to the hydromet plant, the grinding circuit discharge will be fed to a thickener. The thickener overflow will be recycled to the SAG mill feed.

## 13.1.3 Future Metallurgical Testwork

Further comminution testworkand  grinding simulations are currently ongoing at SGS as requirement for the feasibility study.

a

Comminution testwork has been performed on representative samples and included  standard Bond indices, Bond Low-Energy Impact tests, JK Drop- weight tests, and SMC tests with abrasion indices. The  tests were conducted  on  thirteen  individual  samples  and  six  composites  covering  the  potential variability of the grinding characteristics of the deposit

The grinding simulations to  be  finalized  during  the  feasibility  study  will  provide  sizing  data  for  the grinding  mill(s),  as  well  as  the  material  balance  projection  (flow  rate,  water  rate,  %  solids,  particle size  distribution,  etc.),  which  can  be  used  to  confirm  the  sizing  of  other  equipment  such  as  pumps, water supply equipment, screens, crusher  and cyclones. The predicted grinding  circuit performance (power  draw,  specific  power  consumption  (kWh/t)  and  operating  work  index)  ll  be   presented  i n wi each simulation report.

Samples will be collected for settling tests, paste backfill testwork and characterization. Settling and rheology tests will have to be performed..

## 13.2.1 Metallurgical Testwork Summary

## Introduction

further the

Metallurgical testwork were first conducted at SGS Canada Inc. (SGS) throughout 2014 and 2015 to properly  design  the  required  process  units  for  the  conversion  of  mineralized  material nto  a  niobium i product  suitable  for  further  treatment  into  ferroniobium  as  well  as  scandium  and  titanium  products , . Testwork consisted of an exploratory bench and pilot scale hydrometallurgical test program aimed at defining an appropriate  lowsheet f using different reagents and technologies. Upon consideration of the ecoveries r and in particular the scandium recovery being very low in flotation, leach test work was conducted on coarse whole ore material. A leach using an hydrochloric acid was introduced followed by the original sulfation. Coarse whole ore leach testwork showed that a high recovery of the scandium could be achieved without any added losses of titanium or niobium. A  process  flowsheet  was  then  established  based  on testwork  performed  in  leaching,  purification, sulfation, and precipitation.

## Samples

## Leaching

## Pre-Leach

There  were  a  total  of 3  hydrochloric  acid pre-leach  tests  performed  on  the  individual  ariability 1 v samples  at  the  bench  scale  level   Using  different hydrochloric  acid  concentrations  and  residece . n times, the leachability of the gangue material in the mineralized material was confirmed. he results T supported  compositing  into  one  sample  as  there  were  little  difference  in  HCl  pre-ch  results.  An lea average weight reduction of 66% was achieved in the  testwork. A summary of the design conditions and elemental extraction is found in Table 13.2.1.2.

## Acid Regeneration

Synthetic solution and real pregnant leach solutions from the pre-leach testing were used in a series of acid regeneration tests, aimed at demonstrating the concept of hydrochloric acid regeneration and validating  the  theoretical  mass  balance  calculations  Both  the  synthetic  and  real  solution  produced . results in line with the theoretical calculations. Over 80 % of the consumed hydrochloric acid can be regenerated using sulfuric acid.

## Acid Bake and Water Leach

The residues from the pre- ach l testing were used in a series of acid bake tests, directed extracting  the  niobium,  titanium  and  remaining  scandium after  sulfation  using  sulfuric  acid  at  high temperature in a kiln. Five acid bake tests were performed to confirm that the hydrochloric acid preleach  residue  would  react  similarly  to  the  earlier  sulfuric  acid  pre-ch  residues. Twenty-four  acid lea bake tests and seven strong acid agitated bake tests had previously been performed on sulfuric acid pre-leach residue to evaluate various acid doses, bake times, bake temperature and variation in feed materials. It was determined that the hydrochloric acid pre- leach residue reacted in a similar manner to the previous sulfuric acid pre-leach residues.

and

The resulting acid bake residues were contacted with water in a series of water leach tests, aimed at solubilizing  the  sulfated  niobium,  titanium  and  scandium  Five water  leach tests were performed  to . confirm that the hydrochloric acid pre-leach residue, while being significantly (66%) reduced in mass, would react similarly to the previous sulfuric acid pre-leach residues. Previously, 24 water leach tests used the sulfuric acid pre leached  acid -bake residues while seven ore m used the strong acid agitated  bake  slurries.  These  earlier tests looked  into  a  selection  of  water  doses,  leach  times and , temperature. A mini-pilot test was also operated on the sulfuric acid pre-leached residue produced in the  sulfuric acid pre- eached  acid l bake  pilot plant. A summary  of  the optimized conditions elemental extraction for both the sulfuric acid and hydrochloric acid leach residues is shown in Table 13.2.1.3.

## Reduction and Niobium Precipitation

work

The  water  leach  liquors  were rocessed  in  a  series  of  reduction  tests  using  iron,  aluminumnd p ,  a sulfur  dioxide  followed  by  niobium  precipitation  tests,  aimed  at  producing  a  niobium  precipitate  with sufficient purity to be further treated into a ferroniobium product. Preliminary bench scale showed that the titanium and iron content of the niobium concentrate resulting from the precipitation of the water leach liquor were too high to produce a concentrate suitable for ferroniobium production. A  reduction step  was  then  introduced  and  tests roduced a  niobium  concentrate  with  much  higher p niobium  content suitable for further processing into ferroniobium product.  nine Fiftyiobium -n precipitation tests evaluated a selection of precipitation methods, water quantities, reaction times and temperature. A mini pilot test was also operated on  the water leach liquor produced in the acid bake and  water  leach  pilot  plant.  A  summary  of  the  optimized  conditions  and  elemental  concentration  is provided in Table 13.2.1.4.

## Titanium Precipitation

The resulting filtrate liquors from the niobium precipitation  reactions were used in a series of titanium precipitation  (TiP)  tests.  Although  few  in  numbers  due  to  the  small  amount  of  liquor  available,  the titanium  precipitation  tests  assessed  the  production  ofa titanium  precipitate  with  sufficient  purity  to be further  processed  into  a  pigment  grade  TiO  product.  Preliminary  bench  scale  work  showed  that 2 the process is feasible and produces a crude 2  precipitate. TiO Four   titanium p recipitation tests

evaluated  oxidizing agent doses,  reaction timesand  temperature.  A  summary  of the , optimized conditions and elemental recovery to precipitate is found in Table 13.2.1.6.

The pre- leach liquors were  treated  in a series of scandium extraction (ScSx) tests, aimed developing a suitable process for extracting scandium from  ach pre-liquors le and titanium precipitation filtrate. Using liquors from pre- leach tests, organics were contacted with fresh pre- leach liquor.  The  iron  concentrations  in  the  esulting  aqueous  phase  were  the  same  as  that  of  the  feed r liquor suggesting that co-extraction of iron is minimal.

at

The  loaded  organics  from  the  extraction  tests  were  stripped  with  different  strip  solutions.  These solutions  ranged  from  acidic  to  basic  with  varying  concentrations.  Based  on  these  tests,  it  appears that  scandium  is  better  stripped  by  alkaline  reagents.  Testwork  show hat  58%  of  the  scandium s  t loaded  can  be  stripped  with  a  150  g/  sodium carbonate  solution  in  a  single  stage. This  suggests L that  recoveries  greater  than  90%  can  be  achieved  with  a  small  number  of  stages. onversely,  the C thorium in the organic system is preferentially stripped under acidic conditions, leaving the majority of the  scandium  in  the  orgaic.  This  will  allowfor  an  acid  scrubbing  step  removing  thorium  prior  to n stripping  scandium  from  the  loaded  organic.  Testwork  shows  that  50.5%  of  the  thorium  loaded  can be stripped with a 2M HCl solution in a single stage while only stripping 1.3% of the  candium. This s suggests that recoveries greater than 90%  can  be  achieved with a small number  of  stages. A summary of the test conditions and key results is presented in Table 13.2.1.7.

## 13.2.2 Process Selection

The  numerous  tests  performed  have  provided  the  basis  for  the  selected  process.  The  first  step consists  of  a  hydrochloric  acid  (Cl)  pre -leach. H The  solid  residue  is  sulfated using ncentrated co

H2SO4  in a calciner at atmospheric pressure and a temperature of 0¬∞C  while 30 the filtrate is processed in a solvent extraction circuit where scandium is loaded onto an organic phase. Stripping of the scandium is selectively achieved using an acidic stripping step removing thorium first followed by a stripping step using a sodium carbonate solution  solvent extraction stage to recover scandium. The spent liquor is reacted with concentrated sulfuric acid to regenerate the hydrochloric acid.

The resulting residue is then leached with water at a rate of 1 liter per kilogram of solids in a series of agitated  tanks where the  niobium  is  solubilized  along  with  titaniumiron,  and  remaining  scandium . , The  pregnant  liquor  is  reacted  with  elemental  iron  to  reduce  all  iron(III)  present  in  the  solution  to iron(II)  and a  portion of the Ti(IV) to Ti(III). The solution is then cooled in an evaporative crystallizer to  precipitate  pure  iron(II)  sulfate.  The  resulting  pregnant  liquor  is  processed  in  a  solvent  extracn tio circuit  where  scandium  is  loaded  onto  an  organic  phase.  Stripping  of  the  scandium  is  selectively achieved  using  an  acidic  stripping  step  removing  thorium  first followed  by  a  stripping  step  using  a , sodium carbonate solution solvent extraction unit to recover scandium.

Niobium  is then selectively  precipitated  by  diluting  the  pregnant liquor  into  boiling  water.  This  final step  provides  a  niobium  concentrate  that  is  leached  with  NaOH  to  remove  impurities.  This  NaOH leach provides a high quality niobium concentrate that is suitable for  pyrometallurgical treatment into a ferroniobium product.

The titanium in the filtered liquor is precipitated by oxidization using heat and sparged air in a series of agitated tanks. The filtered liquor is neutralized and the solids are sent to tailings.

The  sulfates  recovered  in  the  acid  regeneration  step  and  the  iron  sulfate  recovered  in  the  iron(II) sulfate precipitation step are calcined in order to recover the sulfur as a gas. The gas in then sent to an acid plant that regenerates the H2SO4 for recycle in the hydrochloric acid and acid bake steps.

## 13.2.3 Future Metallurgical Testwork

Additional pilot-scale testing of the flowsheet is currently planned at SGS to further define and test all aspects of the process. Bench scale tests and mini pilots will be run  to provide the final basis for the pilot  testing. The tests will be conducted on whole ore samples lting resu from representatie v samples. The pilot plant will validate the robustness of the hydrometallurgical process with regards to the  variability  of  the  mineralized  material.  From  the  pilot  plant,  samples  will  be  collected  for  settling and filtration  tests,  paste  backfill  testwork,  and  environmental  characterization.  Settling  and  filtration tests will be performed by equipment suppliers to confirm equipment sizing.

## 13.3  Pyrometallurgical Plant

## 13.3.1 Introduction

Key  drivers  in  pyrometallurgical  testwork  on  the  niobium  concentrates  from  the drometallurgical Hy plant  are  the  contents  of  NbO5 2 ,  TiO ,  and  phosphorous.  Significant  hydrometallurgical  upgrades  to 2 the composition of the Nb concentrate precipitate have been achieved, particularly with the addition of a caustic leach (NaOH) step to remove phosphorous. The P2O5 levels have been reduced to 0.2% and lower in the hydromet concentrate. NbO5 grades have been significantly increased up to 90%, 2 with lower TiO2 levels.

Given  the  above  niobium  concentrate  from  the  caustic  leach,  the  pyrometallurgical  plant  comprises only alumino-thermic reduction to produce a relatively clean FeNb alloy containing less than 0.1% P.

## 13.3.2 Metallurgical Testwork Summary

Testwork

Preliminary pyrometallurgical testwork has been carried out at XPS Consulting and Services (XPS) in  Sudbury,  Ontario,  Canada. Four  preliminary  bench  scale  tests  were  performed; 2 demonstrating the successful conversion of the niobium oxide in the niobium precipitate into niobium metal.  These  tests  were  performed  on  lower  grade  Nb  feedstocks  and  the  resulting  alloy  Nb 2 O5 grades were low.

Subsequently, further preliminary calcination and alumino- thermic reduction tests were completed at Kingston Process Metallurgy (KPM) in Kingston, Ontario,  Canada. Summary points taken from the 3 work at KPM are:

- ¬∑ Successful alumino- thermic reduction of Nb concentrates to produce FeNb alloy achieved, albeit from small sample masses. FeNb alloy metal was produced.

was

- ¬∑ Niobium  recovery  of  85%  was  measured,  but  higher  Nb  recovery  of  over  95%  to  the  FeNb alloy i s to be expected and is feasible based on literature review and existing operations.

FeNb

- ¬∑ The  alumino- thermic  reduction  smelting  temperature  is  at ,650¬∞C,  and  is  consistent  with 1 FeNb industrial operations.
- ¬∑ The  slag  system  was  determined  for  smelting  the  Nb  Concentrate,  as  a  CaO3-TiO2 -Al2 system,  with some  minor  fluxing with fluorspar (CaFOperation  without  SiO   additions 2 ). 2 helps to produce a low Si FeNb product.

Memoranda to NioCorp:

- ¬∑ Almost  all  of  the  phosphorous  in  the  concentrate  reports  to  the  alloy,  under  such  aluminothermic reducing conditions. Given the low P levels in the Nb concentrate feedstock, the % P in alloy is likely to be low at 0.1%.
- ¬∑ Hematite powder (Fe2O3) was successfully added as the iron source for the alumino- thermic reduction  smelting  of  FeNb.  This  could  lead  to  the  potential  economic  opportunity  of  using the Fe2O3 precipitate product from the hydrometallurgical circuit as the source of iron for the reaction.
- ¬∑ No  carbon  was  added  to  the  reduction  smelt  process,  as  Fe--carbides  would  form,  and Nb compromise the quality of the FeNb alloy for sale.

## 13.3.3 Process Selection

Alumino-thermic reduction has been selected to convert the hydrometallurgical Nb Concentrate into FeNb alloy. This reduction is performed in a single FeNb furnace, to produce a saleable FeNb metal alloy.

Given the fine particulate nature of the hydrometallurgical Nb Concentrate after the caustic leach the dried Nb concentrate is pelletized to feed the furnace.

From  the  KPM  work,  to  form  the  slag  system  above,  furnace  additives  of  lime  and  fluorspare we selected. These are added together with aluminum powder, hematite and/or iron powder.

## 13.3.4 Future Metallurgical Testwork

Further  pyrometallurgical testwork is envisaged at KPM  following ongoing  hydrometallurgical development work at SGS. The recommended pyrometallurgical testwork would comprise:

- ¬∑ Larger  scale  smelt  testwork,  on  a  larger  bulk  sample  of  Nb  Concentrate,  after  the  caustic leach. A bulk sample of 3,000 g would be a target mass of feedstock to supply multiple tests.
- ¬∑ The larger scale smelt tests on 250 g samples, would confirm Nb, P, Si and Ti deportments to the FeNb alloy and slag.
- ¬∑ Testwork  would  also  be  done  in  these  reduction  tests  to  finalize  the  slag  chemistry,  with  a view to optimize temperature, slag fluidity, metal-slag separation and operating costs.
- ¬∑ Pelletizing testwork should also be carried out to ensure competent pellets to feed furnace feed preparation area. Possible use of a binder should also be tested.

the

- ¬∑ Full characterization and density testwork on Nb Concentrate feeds, pellets, FeNb alloy, and slags should be completed.

## 14 Mineral Resource Estimate

## 14.1  Introduction

This section describes the Mineral Resource estimation methodology and summarizes the assumptions  considered  by  SRK.  In  the  opinion  of  SRK,  the  ineral  R esource  Estimate  reported M herein is a reasonable representation of the global  Nb2O5, TiO2, and Sc Mineral Resources found at the Project at the current level of sampling. No additional sampling/assays have been completed since the previous updated mineral resource estimation, and therefore no updated estimate has been completed as part of this PEA. The Mineral Resource remains effective of date of the previous PEA effective April 28, 2015.

key

The Mineral Resources have been estimated in conformity with generally accepted CIM 'Estimation of Mineral Resource and ineral M Reserves Best Practices' guidelines and are reported accordance with NI 43 -101. Mineral Resources are not Mineral Reserves nd a do not have demonstrated  economic  viability.  There  is  no  certainty  that  all  or  any  part  of  the  neral Resource Mi will be converted into Mineral Reserve.

Due  to  time  constraints  and  assay  turnaround  for  the  multi ement  and scandium  assays  at  the -el Laboratory,  the  Company  requested  SRK  produce  an  initial ineral Resource Estimate  for  NbO5 M 2 only, which has been reviewed and updated based on the addition of TiO2 and Sc upon receipt of the assays.

The methodology used for preparation of the Mineral Resource Statement was as follows:

- ¬∑ Database verification;
- ¬∑ Construction of Nb2O5 mineralization wireframe models;
- ¬∑ Definition of resource domains;
- ¬∑ Preparing of data for geostatistical analysis and variography (capping and compositing);

## 14.2  Drillhole Database

The drillhole database was constructed by Dahrouge from Molycorp data and raw data captured by Dahrouge during the 2011 and 2014, drilling campaigns. The information has been exported from the Central  Database  and  provided  to  SRK  in  .csv  format.  SRK  determined  the  data  to  be  of  good quality. The  database  provided  in  Microsoft  Excel .csv  spreadsheets  containing  collar  locations ¬Æ surveyed in UTM coordinates, downhole deviation surveys, assay intervals with elemental analyses, geologic intervals with rock types, alteration and  key  structures. SRK  has  assigned  appropriate codes for missing samples and no recovery for use during the modeling procedures.

The complete database which covers the entire NioCorp concession area contains information from 129 diamond-core drillholes totaling approximately 64,981 m of drilling. There are no obvious gaps in the  naming  sequence  of  drillholes.  The  maximum  drillhole  depth  is .4  m  and  the  average  is 950 501.7 m. Focusing on Elk Creek a total of 48  holes have  been completed (inclusive  of one  wedged hole)  for  a  total  of  33.908.7  m of  drilling. .  A  summary  of  the  holes  by  drilling  phase  (Comny)  is pa shown in Table 14.2.1.

## 14.3  Geologic Model

The drill log lithology data contains four major rock types based on the geologic observations of drill core, which based on the latest logging codes can be broken down into 19  ub-lithologies. The four s main units considered during the analysis are:

- ¬∑ Overburden;
- ¬∑ Sediments;
- ¬∑ Carbonatite; and
- ¬∑ Mafic Units/Lamprophyre (low-grade domain).

The primary logging codes have been imported into Leapfrog¬Æ  to create geological horizons for the base  of  overburden/till,  plus  the  contact  between  the  Pennsylvanian  Sediments  and  the  underlying Carbonatite  (Figure  14.3.1).  The  models  have  been  used  by  creating  contact  points  within  each drillhole at the contact between these major units.

During the September 2014 geological model SRK did not consider the detail in the geological logs of the historical  drilling to have sufficient detail to enable modelling of the geological units. Primarily this  was  due to a mixed population of higher grade magnetite-olomite-carbonatite (mdolCarb), and d lower  grade  dolomite- carbonatite  (dolCarb),  within  material  logged  as  dolCarb.  As  a  result  of  this conclusion the decision was taken to review the historical information in addition to the collection of new drilling information, as discussed in Section 12.

Using  the  updated  database  SRK  has  completed  a  statistical  analysis  of  the  Nb %  grades  per 2 O5 lithology using classical statistical methods. The database was then analyzed for relative abundance and Nb2O5 based on the main lithologies as shown in Figure 14.3.2. The box whisker plot highlights -the  significant  difference  in  the  grade  distributions  between  mCarb  (pink  square)  and  Carb  (blue square).  The  MCARB  and  MCARB- LAMP  account  for  51%  of  the  samples  logged  vs.  33%  for  the CARB  and  CARB- LAMP,  which  indicates  these  four  codes  cover  84%  of  the  logged  intervals.  The other  unit  of  significance  in  terms  of  logged  intervals  is  the  Lamporpyre  units  which  accounts  for 12%. The weighted average for all units is shown on the right of the chart.

The highest grades both in terms of values and mean grades, are found within the MCARB units with the  next  highest  mean  recorded  in  the  MCARB LAMP.  The  MCARB  has  grades  in  excess  of  0.3% -Nb2O5 for  over  93%  of  the  logged  assays,  while  the  MCARBMP  79%  of  the  logged  values  is -LA greater  than  0.3%.  In  comparison  the  CARB  has  80%  of  the  database  below  a  nominal  cutof -off

0.3% Nb2O5. The results confirm the importance of accurate geological logging and the improvement in geological domaining based on the relogging of the historical drilling.

In  addition  to  the  lower  grades  in  the  CARB  units,  SRK  also  noted  lower  grades  within  the  MAFIC, INT  and  LAMP  units.  SRK  has  focused  on  trying  to  define  these  lower  grade  units  via  sectional analysis to domain these areas out of the geological model.

Historically  within  the  historical  database  all  early  or  late  stage  intrusives  not  defined  as  dolCarb have  been  assigned  a  mafic  rock  code.  The  ioCorp database  shows  a  split  between  units  logged N as Mafic   (considered to be late stage) which in general are low grade to barren, compared  to Lamprohyre  units  which  are  shown  to  carry  a  mixture  of  low  and  high  grades,  which  tend  towards higher  grades  where  units  have  been  logged  with  a  breccia  texture.  Given  the  ture  of  the  rock na types  and  their  similar  properties,  SRK  consider  there  could  remain  a  degree  of  mixing  of  data populations  within  these  units.  To  improve  the  validation  of  the  geological  domaining  for  the  low -grade a study of the multi -element database would increase the confidence required. SRK does not consider this to materially impact on the current geological model, but could provide additional confidence when looking to define Measured Mineral Resources.

SRK  considers  the  presence  of  potentially  late  stage  low/barren  mafic  units  to  be  important.  To  be able to understand the distribution of Nb 5 2 O   within the CARB  and  MCARB  units  SRK  has  first modelled the mafic units (Figure 14.3.3). To complete the model SRK  has primarily used the

lithology logging but has also used for guidance areas of low -grade to Nb2O5.and the overall trend of the  mineralization.  SRK  notes  that  while  the  low rade  domain  remains  relatively  easy  to  identify -g within cross-sections, the ability to link the structures between sections is difficult. In the September 2014  model  SRK  modelled  a  total  of  6  its, un but in comparison  a  total of 14  units have  been modelled in the current update, with the strike length ranging from 150 to 650 m.

from

The  resultant  geological  features  have  been  imported  into  Datamine  with  the  associated  boreholes coded by the relevant geological units. The coding allows these units to be filtered geological modelling of the Carbonatite units.

Using  log  histograms  and  log- robability p plots SRK  has  confirmed  the  box hisker  analysis  that -w more than one sample population is present (Figure 14.3.4) at Elk Creek. The two main populations can  be  described  as  low grade  population  ranging  between  0.1%  and  0.5%  Nb -2 O5,  and  a  higher -grade population in excess of 0.5% NbO5. The contact between the two populations is not clear on 2 the  charts  and  therefore  SRK  assumed  some degree of transition between these two domains may exist.  SRK  has  assumed  that  the  lower  grade  population  is  defined  by  the  CARB  units,  with  the higher grades indicating the presence of MCARB.

The results indicated a slight  change in the  histogram compared to  the September 2014  geological model, but overall supported the conclusions made at that time. The February 2015 geological model shows  a  more  defined  change  in  the  trend  for  the  higher  grade  domain,  plus  the  transitional  zone the

between the two main populations, can be seen by a third peak in histogram in the range of 0.3% to 0.4% Nb2O5.

Using  Figure  14.3.4  and  the  assumption  of  a  nominal  lower  grade  cutff  of  0.3%  NbO5,  SRK  has -o 2 created  grade  shells  at  0.3%,  0.4%  and  0.5%  Nb 2 O5.  SRK  found  visually  the  best  fits  (in  terms  of correlation of grade  and known higher -grade geological units),  when  using the  5  m composite data. At  the  shorter  intervals,  areas  comprising  of  less  than  five  continuous  meters  of  low  grade were producing isolates holes in the geological wireframes. SRK preferred the option to model larger more consistent  wireframes,  and  are  instead  accounted  for  as  internal  dilution  of  lowerde  samples -gra within the estimated blocks.

SRK  tested  multiple scenarios based  on  the raw and  composite  data to mimic  the changes  in niobium distributions between the CARB  and  MCARB  beneath  the unconformity, in addition to

creating interpretations based solely on geological logging. Given the close relationship between the higher  grades  and  the  MCARB unit  SRK  has based  the geological  wireframe for  the MCARB using an  indicator  methodology.  To  define  the dicator  model ,  values  in  the  database  are  assigned  a in value  of  0  or  1  based  on  a  set  criteria  uch  as  0.3%  NbO ,  0.4%  NbO5 and  0.5%  NbO5). This (s 2 5 2 2 criteria  is  then  used  as  the  mathematical  basis  forhe  definition  of  a  grade  shell  within  Leapfrog¬Æ t . The aim in using an indicator over a traditional grade shell is it removes the influence of the grades (where higher grades may push further), an lies d re on the underlying relationship between mineralized  (value equals  1) and  non-ineralized  (value  equals m 0) material, which  in SRK  view better mimics the geology at the Project. SRK initially used an indicator cut -off of 0.4% Nb2O5 using a range of thresholds between  0.25  and  0.5, with the resultant Leapfrog¬Æ e grad shells validated against the geological logging, and a 0.35 threshold (isovalue), providing the best visual correlation.

To  evaluate  the  preferred  interpretation  for  the  geological/grade  shells  boundaries,  SRK  has  been provided  with  a  series  cross sections  and  one  long  section  by  onsite  geological  staff  (Dahrouge). -SRK has also held technical meetings with the senior Project Geologist to assist in defining the key geological  controls  on  the  deposit.  The  interpretation  remains  consistent  with  the  September  2014 model, which has been supported by confirmation drilling during Phase II and Phase III programs at Elk Creek.

To improve the continuity in the geological interpretation SRK has used two dominant trend surfaces. The  southwest  contact  has  been  modelled  using  a  strong  sub-rtical  trend  (shown  in  blue),  while ve the  northeast  of  the  deposit  has  followed  moderate  dipping  trends  (shown  in  black)  parallel  to  the low-grade mafic units (shown in green) as shown in Figure 14.3.5.

Boreholes show geology and assays (red histograms), used for validation.

SRK  has  investigated  the  potential  cause  for  the  sharp  contact  on  the  southwestern  edge  of  the deposit, to determine if the contact is structurally controlled. Based on a review of the drill core and

ATV surveys completed to date no fault has been established. SRK therefore assume that this forms a sharp igneous lithological contact.

During the geological modelling SRK noted that the 0.4% Nb2O5 defined domain closely correlates to the  logged  MCARB  intervals,  while  the  0.3%  Nb5  limit  defines  the  edges  of  the  mineralization, 2 O which is defined as CARB.

SRK noted a number of cases where the indicator model created significant volumes on the edge of the  deposit  in  areas  of  limited  drilling.  SRK  assumes  these  volumes  to  lack  sufficient  geological confidence  for  the  definition  of  the  Mineral  Resource.  SRK  has  limited  the  extent  of  the  indicator wireframes in these cases to a corridor of mineralization bound by the steep southwest contact and a shallower northeast contact. The northeast contact has been based on geological and assay values at depth and projected to the unconformity (shown in brown on Figure 14.3.5).

The final wireframes (Figure 14.3.6) selected have been imported into Datamine and accordingly  to  mimic  the  unconformity  between  the  Carbonatite  and  the  overlying  Pennsylvanian sediments, to domain the drillhole information and for the generation of the geological block model.

## 14.4  Assay Capping and Compositing

Prior  to  the  undertaking  of  a  statistical  analysis,  an  outlier  analysis  has  first  been  completed  and samples  need  to  be  composited  to  equal  lengths  for  constant  sample  volume,  in  order  to  honour sample support theories.

## 14.4.1 Outliers

Outlier  analysis  has  been  completed  for  Nb O5,  TiO ,  Sc  assays  and  density  data  per  domain. he 2 2 T raw  assay  data  was  first  plotted  on  histograms  (Figure .4.1.1)  and  cumulative  distribution  plots 14 (Figure  14.4.1.2) to understand  its basic statistical distribution. High-grade capping was  applied based  on  a  combination  of  these  plots, plus log histogram  information. To  create the plots domained samples for all zones have been created in Datamine and imported into Supervisor v8.3 (Supervisor) for analysis.

The plots can be used to distinguish the grades at which additional samples have significant impacts on  the  local  estimation  and  whose  affect  is  considered  extreme.  Using  this  methodology  topcuts have been defined for each domain by reviewing the information from the different sample types.

formed

The spatial occurrence of the capped values was visually verified to determine if they discrete zo nes which  could  potentially be  modelled  separately.  Based  on  the  analysis  SRK  has decided to apply a grade capping of 2.5% Nb2O5. For the mafic zones (mafic and Lamprophyre units) a cap of 1.0% Nb2O5 has been applied for the statistical analysis (Figure 14.4.1.1).

The  influence  of  the  capping  has  been  reviewed  by  SRK,  to  confirm  the  potential  impact  on  the number  of  samples  capped  and  the  mean  grades  within  each  estimation  domain  able  14.4.1.1). (T Figure  14.4.1.2  provides  an  example  of  the  study  which  reviews  the  number  of  samples  capped within  the  0.5%  grade  shell.  The  results  show  that  approximately  0.62%  of  the  database  has  been capped, with the mean grade reducing from 0.829% to 0.825% Nb2O5. SRK considers the capping to be appropriate for the style of mineralization.

## 14.4.2 Compositing

SRK has undertaken a sample composite analysis (Table 14.4.2.1) in order to determine the optimal sample composite length for grade interpolation. The analysis investigated both changes composite length and minimum composite lengths for inclusion. Results are compared by reviewing the resultant mean grade against the length weighted raw sample mean grades, and the percentage in

of samples excluded applying the minimum composite length.

SRK  has  utilized  a  function  in  Datamine  where  all  samples  are  maintained  during  the  composite routine (MODE=1). MODE 1 forces all samples to be included in one of the composites by adjusting the  composite  length,  while  keeping  it  as  close  as  possible  to  the  5  m  interval  selected  by  SRK. A review  of  the  composite  lengths  per  domain  shows  on  average  the  mean  length  of  the  composite within the Carbonatite is in the order of 1.0 to 1.5 m, while the thinner mafic units average closer to 1.25 m. A comparison of the mean NbO5% grades shows the impact of the composite and capping 2 routines  results  in  slightly  lower  means  at  &lt;0.4%  in  the  Carbonatite.  The  reduction  in  mafic  units reports  larger  differences  of  up  to  15%  but  this  is  typically  due  to  the  low  numbers  in  the  samples populations.  SRK  assumes  the  differences  in  the  mafics  can  be  explained  by  differences  in  the logging  of  Molycorp  drilling,  and  while  this  may  have  a  degree  of  conservatism,  the  overall  tonnage of the mafic units is low in comparison to the Carbonatite. SRK deemed the capping satisfactory, and no bias has been introduced during the capping and composite processes.

## 14.5  Density

Dahrouge  conducted  density testing on the drill core to  port sup the resource estimation. Approximately  2,045  samples  were tested   from  the 2014 drilling program, completed using combination of volumetric density (1,777 samples) determination and water immersion samples)  for  confirm ation.  The density  data  was  subdivided  by  the  ajor lithologic  groups used  in m the geologic model, and averages were calculated for each group.

During the February 6 Mineral Resource  Estimate (Nb2O5 reported only) which formed the basis for the  press  release  dated  09  February  2015,  SRK  assumed  an  average  density  based  on  the  major geological units. The average density assigned is shown in Table 14.5.2. The breakdown of density has  been  based  on  the  estimation  domain  (KZONE),  with  higher  density  values  within  the  higher grade domains based on the relationship within higher magnetite content associated with the higher grades.

histograms

On  receipt  of  the  whole  rock  analysis  database  and  prior  to  updating  the  Mineral  Resource  for  the TiO2% and Sc (ppm) estimates SRK conducted a review of  the variability within the density values to determine/confirm if a relationship existed between the higher FeO 2 % and the Nb % 2 O5 (Figure 14.5.1). The study indicated that while a direct correlation is not established there is a trend for  high  density  associated  with  high  FeO %  and  Nb O5%.  Further  review  of  the  histograms  for  the 2 2 density data per zone show variation in the density, and large enough sample populations for SRK to consider the estimation of density into the block model to be appropriate. SRK has assumed in terms of  search  orientations  that  the  density  values  are  associated  with  the  same  search  orientations  as the Nb O5% 2 distributions. To complete the analysis SRK has reviewed the

(Figure 14.5.2) and applied capping to the density values per domain as appropriate. SRK has used the same methodology for reviewing outliers as discussed in Section 14.4.1 of this report.

- (1) Used assigned density from previous study

In summary the change from the use of a single density per zone compared to the estimated density for the estimated domains (13, 14, 15, 21), reported a difference of 229,200,000 t vs. 228,200,000 t which is in the order of 0.5% (at a 0% Nb O5 cut-off) which SRK does not consider to be a material 2 change.  SRK  considers  the  use  of  estimated  density  to  be  more  reasonable  given  the  variable nature based on higher Nb2O5% and Fe2O3% (disclosed on February 23, 2015).

## 14.6  Variogram Analysis and Modeling

Variography  is  the  study  of  the  spatial  variability  of  an  attribute  (in  this  case  Nb %,  TiO %,  Sc). 2 O5 2 Datamine  and  Supervisor  have  been  utilized  to  test  the  geostatistical  relationship  for  the  deposit. Variogram  analysis  was  performed  on  the  capped  and composited  data  fi ltered  to include only  the carbonatite domain. No stable semi-variograms have been achieved within the mafic units.

In completing the analysis the following has been considered:

- ¬∑ Azimuth and dip of each zone was determined;
- ¬∑ The down-hole variogram was calculated and modelled to characterize the nugget effect;
- ¬∑ Experimental raw and pairwise relative semi riograms, -va were calculated to determine directional variograms for the along strike, cross strike and down-dip directions;
- ¬∑ Directional  variograms  were  modelled  using  the  nugget  and  sill  defined  in  the  downhole variography, and the ranges for the along strike, cross strike and down-dip directions; and
- ¬∑ All variances were re-scaled for each domain to match the total variance for that zone

semivariogram hence

A  triple  spherical  structure  was  used  to  model  the  variograms  for  all  three  elements.  A  lag  of  25  m was used with a variable separation based on the extents of the data. The parameters are presented in Table 14.6.1. The experimental semi- ariogram v data is shown  n i Figure 14.6.1  fit  with the model semiariogram  parameters -v listed in Table 14.6 .  The .1 results indicate a reasonable nugget variance, but then a significant portion of the variability is within a short range  (first  sill)  of  between  7 to0 m.  SRK  attributes  the  short  scale  variability  to  changes  in  the 2 geological units between mdolcarb  nd a dolcarb. Improving the geological model and geological  domaining  may  improve  the  continuity  noted  within  each  of  this  units,  which  should  be considered during the next Mineral Resource update.

## 14.7  Block Model

The block model was constructed within the UTM grid (NADS83 Zone 14) coordinate limits listed in Table 14.7.1. A 5 m x 15 m x 5 m (x, y, z) block size was chosen as an appropriate dimension based on  the  current  drillhole  spacing  and  a  potential  underground  smallest  mining  unit  (SMU),  compared to  a  drill  spacing  in  the  order  of  60  m  x  60  m  within  infill  drilled  sections.  S ocking  has  been ub-bl allowed along the  boundaries to a minimum of 0.5 m along strike, 2.5 m across strike and 1.0 m in the vertical direction, to maintain the geological interpretation.  The block size has been based on the SMU, but it is SRK understanding that mine  planning for the stopes will likely occur at a larger scale and not be based on individual blocks. The current block size will allow the mine planning to have the required level of flexibility when running the stope optimization. The topographic surface was created from the aerial survey of the topography and verified against the drill collars.

sequence

All modelling was conducted in Datamine for the Project  grade estimation. The top of the carbonatite surface is located approximately 200 m below surface and is overlain by a Pennsylvanian sediments which have been modelled in Leapfrog¬Æ . All grade estimates are cropped to this contact.

SRK  previously  used  a  rotation  to  improve  the  geometric  representation  of  the  posit.  A  rotated de block model was  created using a strike of 120¬∫  (set  to -60¬∫  using  Datamine  convention).  Based  on work  currently  underway  on  the  geotechnical  aspects  of  the ject  this  rotation Pro is noted  to be

of

oblique  to  some  of  the  principal  stresses,  which  have  been  supported  by  the  fault  model,  and  a specialized horizontal stress test completed  as  part  of a geotechnical program.  To  improve  the potential  mine  design  and  to  reduce  the  potential  for  dilution  SRK  has  rotated  the  block  model  to align with the key stress orientations.

To  ensure  no  bias  has  been  introduced  in  terms  of  dilution  across  the  geological  block  model  SRK has run the same model parameters using three different scenarios:

- ¬∑ Block model set up -based on key geological orientations (maximize grade continuity between blocks);
- ¬∑ Block  model  rotated  15 towards  (half  the  required  rotation)  the  principal  stress  orientation; ‚Å∞ and
- ¬∑ Block model rotated 15  towards (full rotation) into the principal stress orientation. ‚Å∞

SRK  noted  that  the  difference  in  the  global  grades  and  tonnages  between  all  three  scenarios  was negligible.  Given  the  significant  potential  for  improvement  for  the  mine  design  (stope  orientations), SRK elected to use the fully rotated prototype which aligns to the principal stress.

SRK has maintained the 5 m block size across strike as used in the geological model to ensure the vertical variation in the zones is modelled. A comparison of the block model dimensions used in 2014 and 2015 are shown in Table 14.7.1 and Table 14.7.2.

## 14.8  Estimation Methodology

The  grade  estimation  has  been  completed  using  hard  boundaries  for  the  hological  (mafic)  and lit mineralization  (carbonatite  grade  shell)  domains.  Onlythe  composites  from  the  same  domain  have been used during estimation. his T boundary corresponds to the geologic model presented in Section 14.3.  The b lock model  was  first coded  so  that all blocks within this solid were  flagged according to the relevant estimation domain (KZONE). he T use of a soft boundary within the Carbonatite between the 0.4% and 0.5% limits has been tested during the September 2014 Mineral Resource  Estimate,  the  findings  of  which  indicated  that  the  higher  grades  within  the  MCARB  were smoothing  into  lower  grade  carbonatite  material.  The  findings  from  the  study  showed  in  a  previous iteration of the geological wireframe that removing the hard boundary increased the tonnage by 2%

and  the  grade  by  5%  at  a  cut off  of  0.3%  (NbO %).  This  increased  at  higher  cutoffs  to  32%  more -2 5 -tonnage  for  a  reduction  of  7%  in  the  grade.  SRK  concluded  that  the  hard  contact  provided  a  b er ett visual comparison to the raw sampling information. A review of the drillhole logs and core indicate a relatively sharp increase in the levels of magnetite and hence the definition of MCARB material. SRK considers this assumption to remain appropriate to the current geological model and estimation.

The Nb2O5% grade estimation utilized an OK algorithm supported by  the 5 m sample composites for all  units  and  elements,  and  density.  A  check  estimate  using  Inverse  distance  weighting  (IDW)  to  a power of 2 and nearest neighbor analysis has been completed for the Nb 2O5 estimates for validation purposes.  A  nested  search  method  consisting  of  three  passes  was  used.  The  search  ellipse  has been rotated into the main dip and strike orientation of the deposit (Table 14.8.1).

Due to observed variations in the dip of the carbonatite and mafic units the search ranges have been rotated to best fit the semi ariogram -v orientation and  the geological model  (Figure  1 .1).  The 4.8 search ranges are based on the results of the variography as well as the average drillhole spacing.

In  the first search  passes  for the  arbonatite, C the estimation required a minimum  of  sixd  a an maximum  of 16  composites to assign grade to each block. lower A maximum number of composites has been used in the mafics to account for the lower sample density and that commonly the mafics are represented by a single composite across the width of the wireframe. For the second pass,  a  minimum  of  three  and  a  maximum  of  12  composites  were  required  to  assign  grade.   the In third pass the minimum number of samples has been reduced to one sample and a maximum of 12 samples were required to assign grade. A maximum of three composites from a single drillhole were allowed  for  all  passes,  thus  at  least  two  drillholes  were  used  for  the  first  search  pass   blocks .  No estimated in subsequent passes were allowed to overwrite the prior passes of estimation.  o octant N search restriction was applied.

the

The number of composites and drillholes used to estimate each block were stored during estimation.  Each  pass  of  estimation  was  also  recorded  to  show  which  blocks  were  estimated  in which  pass.  The  results  show  that  an  verage  of eight  composites  (using  at  least  two  holes)  are a used within the first two passes,  which represents 73% of the number of blocks estimate. A detailed breakdown of the estimation parameters for the Carbonatite in each pass is shown in Table 14.8.2.

## 14.9  Model Validation

SRK has undertaken a thorough validation of the resultant interpolated model in order to confirm the estimation  parameters,  to  check  that  the  model  represents  the  input  data  on  both  local  and  global scales and to check that the estimate is not biased. SRK has undertaken this using a using a number of different validation techniques.

- ¬∑ Inspection of block grades in plan and section and comparison with drillhole grades;
- ¬∑ Comparative Statistical study vs. composite data and alternative estimation methods; and
- ¬∑ Sectional interpretation of the mean block and sample grades (Swath Plots).

## 14.9.1 Visual Comparison

Visual  validation  provides  a  local  validation  of  the  interpolated  block  model  on  a  local  block  scale, using visual  assessments  and  validation  plots  of  sample  grades  verses  estimated  block  grades.  A thorough  visual  inspection  of  crossections,  long- sections  and  bench/level  plans,  comparing  the -sample  grades  with  the  block  grades  has  been  undertaken,  which  demonstrates  good  comparison

between local block estimates and nearby samples, without excessive smoothing in the block model. Figure 14.9.1.1 shows  an  example cross-section of  the  visual  validation  checks  and  highlights  the overall block grades corresponding with raw samples grades.  Additional cross-sections showing the block estimates vs. the composite grades are shown in Appendix B.

## 14.9.2 Comparative Statistics

SRK compared the composite grades to  the  estimated  block  grades  within  the  wireframes  for  each domain. The composite grades are presented using the declustered weighting for comparison to the block statistics. Declustering was conducted using a c ell-declustering algorithm, with default cell size of  20  m  x  20  m  x  20  m,  improved  correlation  maybe  achieved  at  different  declustering  grids e .  Th comparison of the composite assays vs. the block estimates are shown in Table 14.9.2.1 for  all three elements.

The results show acceptable levels of correlation between the mean blocks and declustered means for the Carbonatite domains. The 0.4 Nb2O5% and 0.5 Nb2O5% which combined for the majority of the metal  above  cut -off  show  difference  in  the  mean  grades  ypically  reporting less  than ¬± 2.5%,  which t SRK deems within acceptable levels.

the

The highest differences in  the  mean  grades  are  noted  within  the  0.4 b2O5%  grade shell,  with  the N block model grades reporting approximately 4.7% her hig than the composite mean, and 0.3 Nb2O5%  grade  shell  (Sc\_ppm grades), which  reported  5.3% lower  than  the  composite  means. The  difference  in  the  mean  grades  between  the  composite  and  e  block  estimates  within  the  0.4 th Nb2O5%  grade  shell,  is  0.02%  to  provide  context.   SRK  still  considered  these  levels  of  error  to  be within acceptable levels of error for the current level of confidence and drillhole spacing.

In  addition  to  the  statistical  analysis  comparative  histograms  (Figure  14.9.2.1)  and  distribution  plots have  been  reviewed  to  assess  the  degree  of  smoothing.  The  result  indicate  the  mean  grade  of  the deposits are relatively close (as confirmed in the statistical analysis), with the bck models typically lo smoothed towards the mean and a reduction in higher end of the distribution. The level of smoothing is  a  function  of  the  current  drill  spacing  and to increase the correlation between the datasets further drilling at a closer spacing would likely be required.

During the 2014 Mineral Resource update SRK noted in the mafic units the differences between the composite  and  block  estimates  were  more  significant than  in  the  Carbonatite  units.  SRK  attributed the differences to two main factors:

- ¬∑ The relatively small sample populations; and
- ¬∑ The  data  populations  within  the  mafic units  were  more  highly  skewed  and  the  influence  of individual high grades on the overall statistical mean should be considered higher.

SRK comments that the mafic units represent a relatively small tonnage compared to the other units.

SRK  has  therefore  remodelled  these  units  based  on  the  revised  geological  logging  codes  and  infill drilling information. SRK considers the confidence in the mafic units geological interpretation remains lower than the Carbonatite, but the majority of the estimates fall below the economic cut -off. A review of  the  statistical  comparison  between  the  composite  grades  and  the  block  estimates  does  show  an improvement  in  the  2015  block  estimates.  SRK  still  considered  these  levels  of  error  to  be  within acceptable levels of error.

## 14.9.3 Swath Plots

Swath plots were generated, which show the mean grades in the block model as a function of their distribution along particular eastings, northings, and elevations.

The  swaths  compare  the  composite  grades  to  the  block  grades,  with  the  intention  of  ensuring t tha there  are  no  significant  deviations  between  the  two  which  might  mean  that  some  bias  exists  in  one part of the deposit. SRK calculated mean grades for composites and blocks within these swaths for all domains.

The  resultant  plots  show  a  good  correlation  between  the  block  model  grades  and  the  composite grades, with the block model showing a typically smoothed  profile of the composite grades expected.  The  plots  for  Nb2O5%  generally  confirm  no  indication  of  any  significant  bias  introduced during the estimation, and generally display an adequate degree of smoothing.Based on the results of the analysis SRK have accepted the grades in the block model.

## 14.10  Resource Classification

The  Mineral  Resources  are  classified  under  the  categories  of  Indicated  and  Inferred  according  to CIM  guidelines. Due  to  a  lack  of  dense  (&lt;35  m  x  35  m)  drilling  and  pending  further  analysis  of  the Actlabs vs. SGS accuracy issues no Measured Mineral Resource has been assigned at this stage for the Project.

the the

SRK's c lassification mainly  reflects the relative confidence of the geological model and associated  grade estimates. This classification is o als based  on  sample spacing relative to geological and geo-statistical observations regarding the continuity of mineralization, data verification to original sources,  specific gravity determinations, accuracy  of  drill collar locations, accuracy  of topographic surface, quality of the assay data and many other factors, which influence confidence of the mineral estimation. No single factor controls the resource classification rather each factor influences the result.

For the resource classification,  a  solid  shape  was  constructed  around  the  elatively  well  drilled core r of  the  deposit  resulting  from  the  ioCorp Phase  I  to  Phase  III  programs,  where  most  drillholes  are N spaced  approximately 60 to  70  m  apart   which  allows  typically  three  holes  to  be  used r  the  first fo estimation search pass.

All blocks located within this area were classified as Indicated Mineral Resource  (Figure 14.10.1). All blocks estimated  outside  of  the  perimeter  of  drillholes  are  classified  as  Inferred  Mineral  Resource, which typically extends 100 to 150 m beyond the drilling.

## 14.11   Mineral Resource Statement

The following section defines the updated Mineral Resource  ement Stat for the Project. This statement includes the estimated Mineral Resources for NbO5, TiO2 and Sc for the deposit and was 2 disclosed  on  February  23,  2015,  with  an  effective  date  of  April  28,  2015.  This  represents  the  latest Mineral Resource for the Project.

CIM Definition Standards for Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves  (May 2014) defines a Mineral Resource as:

- '(A) concentration or occurrence of diamonds, natural solid inorganic material, or natural solid fossilized organic material including base and precious metals, coal, and industrial minerals in or on the  Earth's  crust  in  such  form  and  quantity  and  of  such  a  grade  or  quality  that  it  has  reasonable prospects for economic extraction. The location, quantity, grade, geological characteristics and continuity of a Mineral Resource are known, estimated or interpreted from specific geological evidence and knowledge'.

Portions  of  a  deposit  that  do  not  have  reasonable  prospects  for  eventual  economic  extraction  must not be included in a Mineral Resource.

The  'reasonable  prospects  for  economic  extraction'  requirement  generally  implies  that  the  quanti ty and grade estimates meet certain economic thresholds and that the Mineral Resources are reported at an appropriate CoG taking into account extraction scenarios and processing recoveries. Based on this  requirement,  SRK  considers  that  major  portions  of  the  Project  are  amenable  for  underground extraction with a processing method to recover Nb2O5, TiO2 and Sc2O3 products.

potential

The  economic  parameters  were  selected  based  on  experience  and  benchmarking  against  similar projects (Table 14.11.1), and a 20% mark-up in the price assumptions to account for potential upside in  market  assumptions.  Detailed  technical  studies  have  not  been  completed  to  date  to  confirm  the assumed  mining  and  processing  costs,  however  SRK  has  provided  reasonable  estimates  of  the expected costs based on the knowledge of the style of mining (underground) and processing methods. The selected metal recovery is based on the initial metallurgical testwork completed during the Phase 1 program discussed in Section 13 of this current report.

Further work will be required to confirm these numbers via a detailed engineering (prefeasibility  or  feasibility  study).  The  reader  is  cautioned  that  the  results  are  used  solely  for  the purpose of testing the 'reasonable prospects for economic extraction' by underground methods,  and  do  not  represent  an  attempt  to  estimate  Mineral  Reserves.  There  are  no  ral Mine Reserves for the Project, and further work will be required to establish the costs to a higher level of confidence.

study mining

The  estimated  cost  information  presented  here  is  used  as  a  guide  to  assist  in  the  preparation  of  a Mineral Resource Statement  and  to  select  an  appropriate  resource  reporting  CoG.  The  calculated Nb2O5 CoG is based on a fixed relationship between Nb2O5 and TiO2 of 3.5 TiO2:1 Nb2O5. Similarly a Nb2O5 and Sc fixed relationship of and 9 Sc: 1 Nb2O5 was used for the CoG calculation.

economic

In order to determine the quantities of material offering 'reasonable prospects for extraction' by an underground mining method, SRK has defined a suitable underground mining CoG based on assumed costs, pricing and metallurgical recoveries. The cost and recoveries used as the basis  for  the  Mineral  Resource  have  been  based  on  the  initial  preliminary  economic  assessment completed in 2015 (disclosed in a press release, April 20, 2015). No update to the Mineral Resource statement  has  been  made  as  part  of  the  current  technical  report  and  therefore  the  assumptions shown in Table 14.11.1 remain valid. Increases  the in  recoveries and changes in the price assumptions shown in this study would result in a drop in the current selected cut-off grade.

The  Mineral Resource  has  been  filtered to show  all blocks above  the mining  ff cut -o to ensure estimates form suitable mining targets. Any isolated blocks of material reporting above cut -off can be removed as they will unlikely warrant the cost of development. No such cases existed at the Project and all material within the geological wireframes above a cut-off of 0.3 Nb2O5% has been considered to have reasonable prospects of being mined via underground methods.

planned

The result of positive indications from the company's ongoing metallurgical testing and development program,  titanium (TiO) 2 and  scandium  (Sc) were  added to the MineralResource  Statement   in February 2015. Both of these metals can be recovered with simple additions to the existing process flowsheet, and would provide additional revenue streams that would complement the production of ferroniobium.

press as

SRK defined a Mi neral Resource on receipt of a validated database, to account for these additional revenue  streams. No  additional resource definition drilling has been  completed  since the releases and therefore the drilling and sampling information presented in this  technical report remain unchanged. The Mineral Resource  also accounted for an estimate of the density values, relationship  has  been  identified  by  SRK  for  higher  density  values  at  higher  Nb5,  TiO  and  Fe O3 2 O 2 2 grades. The difference in the global tonnage between the estimated and assigned density has been accounted as &lt; 1% change and is not considered material.

a

The  Mineral Resource Statement  in Table 14.11.2 has been determined using the economic parameters as defined in Table 14.11.1. The Mineral Resource was disclosed on February 23, 2015. This should be considered the latest estimate for the Project and be used in any future studies.

PEA

The Mineral Resource presented has been reported following CIM guidelines. The preliminary  in  nature,  that  it  includes  a  level  of  engineering  precision  and  assumptions  which  are currently considered too speculative to have the economic considerations applied to them that would enable Mineral Resources to be categorized as Mineral Reserves.

Inferred  Mineral  Resources  are  not  included  in  the  mine  plan  for  this  PEA.  Mineral  Resources  that are not Mineral Reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability.

The PEA includes price and market assumptions concerning an expanded demand in the scandium market. There is no certainty that the PEA will be realized.

## 14.13  Comparison with Previous Estimate

when be

In comparison to the 2014 Mineral Resource  imate Est for the Project, the updated estimate (February 20, 2015) represents a significant increase in the Indicated Mineral Resource compared to the September 2014 estimate. The differences in the Mineral Resource can attributed to the following points:

- ¬∑ Phase  II  and  III  infill drilling has  decreased  the  drill  spacing  to  the  order  of  60  to 70  m through the central portion of the deposit;
- ¬∑ Phase  II and  III infill drilling has  targeted higher grade  material at depth  in the Resource; and

Mineral

- ¬∑ Increase  in  the  geological  understanding  of  the  controls  on  the  niobium  mineralization  and grade domaining, based on the 2014 drilling program and relogging of historical holes.

To  provide  a  like  for  like  comparison  of  the  Indicated  Mineral  Resources,  SRK's  2014  block  model reported using a CoG of 0.3 Nb 2O5% has 22.6 Mt at a grade of 0.70% Nb 2O5 which has increased to 80.5 Mt at a grade of 0.71% 2O5, Nb within the Indicated category. This is an increase in the contained Nb 2 O5%  from  177,000,000 kg to 571,600,000 kg, or 187%  increase in the Indicated tonnage or 226% within the contained Indicated Nb2O5.

The Phase II and III infill drilling program initially only targeted the conversion of Inferred to Indicated within  the  current  geological  model,  however  as  a  direct  result  of  the  program  additional  Inferred material  has  been  identified  at  depth  and  at  the  edges  of  the  current  neral  Resource (limited  to Mi approximately 150 m along strike and 75 m down-dip.

from

The Inferred material  when compared using  a CoG of 0.3 Nb O5% has reduced from 132.8 Mt at a 2 grade of 0.55 Nb5%  to 2 O 99.6 Mt at a grade of 0.56 5%, Nb which 2 O is a reduction 733,700,000 kg  to  557,800,000  kg  (-24%)  in  contained  NbO5 between  the  2014  and  2015  mdels 2 o respectively.

the

Given the significant increase in the portion of Indicated material SRK considers the reduction in the Inferred  to be  reasonable  as  there  is  an  increase  in  the  global  tonnage  of  approximately  20  Mt (approximately 10%). The deposit remains open at depth and along strike. A summary  of comparisons between CoG grades of 0.30 to 0.70 Nb2O5% is shown in Table 14.13.1.

## 14.14   Relevant Factors

SRK  is  not  aware  of  any nvironmental,  permitting,  legal,  title,  taxation  marketing  or  other  factors e that could affect resources.

## 15 Mineral Reserve Estimate

No Mineral Reserves have been estimated for the Project.

## 16 Mining Methods

The  Project  is  currently in the  exploration  phase  and  has  not  been  developed.  Mineralization  is located  approximately  200  to  1,000  m  below  the  surface.  Based  on  geomechanical  information  and mineralization geometry an underground longhole stoping method (LHS) is suitable for the deposit.

The stopes will be 15 m wide and stope length will vary based on mineralization grade. A spacing of 25  m  between  levels  has  been  used.  The  deposit  is  mined  in  blocks  where  mining  within  a  block occurs from bottom to top with the use of paste backfill. Sill pillars are left in situ between blocks. The backfill  will  have  sufficient  strength  to  allow  for  mining  adjacent  to  filled  stopes,  thusliminating  the e need for dip pillars.

The mine will be shaft access to minimize development through water bearing Mineralization  will  be  transported  from  stopes  to  the  shaft/hoist  system  by  underground  trucks. A single ventilation raise will serve as a dedicated exhaust raise and will be raisebored  conventionally. Intake air will be down the shaft with fresh air entering a dedicated ventilation drift above the loading pocket. As  levels  are  developed  lower  in  the eposit short  slot  raises  will  be  developed  connecting d levels for ventilation purposes.

horizons.

The  mine  design  process  involvd  using  stope  optimization  within  Vulcan‚Ñ¢ oftware  to  determine e s potentially mineable areas based on a CoG and minimum mining dimensions.  Dilution and recovery were  added  to  the  designed  tonnage  to  account  for  unplanned  stope  dilution  and  unrecoverable material within the stope.

NioCorp's  current  view  on  the  marketability  of  FeNb  is  that  approximately  7,500  t  FeNb  can  be produced  and  sold  per  year.  Based  on etallurgical  recoveries,  estimated  mine  grades,  and  the m 7,500 t FeNb target the process facility has been sized to 2,700 t/d. With this facility size an average grade  of 0.80%  Nb2O5 is  targeted  to  produce  the  desired  amount  of  product A  consistent  average . grade in the mine plan is achieved by varying the CoG for various levels of the mine.

Access  and  infrastructure  development  underground  was  designed  to  support  the  mining  method and sized based on mining equipment and production rate requirements. Surface infrastructure and tailings were  designed  on  lands  which ioCorp  has  an  option  to  purchase  or  which  NioCorp N is currently  negotiating  an  option  agreement  with  the  landowner.  The  general  layout  of  the  mine  and mill is shown in Figure 16.1.

## 16.1  Cut-off Grade Calculations

Net  Smelter  Return  (NSR)  is  a  commonly  accepted  method  of  evaluating  a  mineral  deposit ere wh revenue  is  generated  from  multiple  elements.  NSR  is  defined  as  the  proceeds  from  the  sale  of mineral products after deducting  -site off processing and distribution  osts. c NSR is typically expressed  on  a  dollar  per  ton  basis. ne For  this  Project  the  NSR calculation takes  into account revenue for three products, FeNb, TiO2, and Sc. A factor of 0.699 was used to convert  Nb2O5 in the block model to Nb contained in the FeNb product. Similarly a factor of 1.534 (1/0.652)  was used to convert Sc to Sc2O3.

Recoveries used are based on metallurgical testwork discussed  Section  13.  The  NSR in was evaluated for each block in the  D 3geologic resource  block model. Table 16.1.1 hows  NSR s parameters and an example NSR calculation for an individual block.

## 16.2  Geotechnical

## 16.2.1 Geotechnical Characterization Program

SRK  has  conducted  a field geotechnical characterization program that included data collection, laboratory testing, and recommending geotechnical mine design parameters. The geotechnical characterization data collected for the TSF and mill infrastructure is documented in Section 18.

From May 21, 2014 to December 12, 2014 SRK completed a geotechnical investigation program on site for the Project. The program was designed to characterize subsurface geotechnical conditions to assist in the development of a  feasibility-level design capable of meeting the requirements for Basic Engineering Design.

The geotechnical field investigation consisted of 18 drillholes ( 15,383 m ) used for rock mass characterization,  designed  to  examine  rock  mass  fabric  and  structural  features  in  and  around  the mineralized  zone  at  different  depths  and  orientations.  The  drilling  was  conducted  in  three  phases with incremental data collection designed to fill knowledge gaps within geotechnical conditions. Holes  were  drilled  at  varying  orientations  into  the  angingwall,  footwall,  and  mineralized  rock.  The h field investigation  included   geophysical  borehole  logging  of  structural  features,  geotechnical  core logging, core sample collection for laboratory strength testing, and  in situ stress measurements. The location of the drillholes is shown on Figure 16.2.1.1.

Two  recent  drill  holes  were  drilled  in  addition  to  the  18  characterization  holes.  These  holes  were drilled  and  cored  along  the  centerline  of  the  proposed  production  shaft  location  and  ventilation  hole location.  The  core  was  logged  for  geological  and  geotechnical  characteristics,  but  analysis  of  the data has not been conducted to date. These holes were not considered as part of the PEA study.

The  geotechnical investigation included a total of 12,986  m  of  acoustic iewer  scans telev where 9,345 m  were  successfully  interpreted  giving  an  overall  teleiewer  interpretation  of  72%.  The  rock v testing  program  included  53  unconfined  compression  (UCS)  tests,  17  triaxial  compression  (TCS) test,  and  32 direct shear strength (DSS)  tests of rock joint sampling. Tests were  conducted  at different confinement levels (80 tests). A set of 25 static and dynamic elastic  oduli measurements, m and 13 Brazilian tensile strength (BTS) testsre we conducted. This in rmation fo was used for calibration  of  the  1,992  point  load  tests  conducted  in  the  field  and  the  14,400  m  of  field  estimated strength parameters estimated during the core logging.e Th laboratory tests were sufficient to

develop  discontinuity  shear  strength  parameters  and  estimates  of  the  static  and  dynamics  elastic constants.

## 16.2.2 Geotechnical Domains

Four geotechnical domains were identified based on lithology,  weathering, structural conditions and rock mass strength similarities. These geotechnical domains include:

- ¬∑ Pennsylvania Formation in the upper 200 m;
- ¬∑ Hangingwall material to southwest of the mineralization;
- ¬∑ Mineralized carbonatite; and
- ¬∑ Footwall material to northeast of the mineralization.

The  domains,  shown  on  Figure  16.2.2.1,  were  delimited  based  on  intact  rock  properties  and  in  situ rock  mass  quality  from  characterization  logging.  Characterization was  based  on    Rock  Mass the Rating (RMR) (Bieniawski, 1976) and the Q-system (Barton, 1974). These value were then used with empirical design methods to assess the basic inputs for underground mine design.

## 16.2.3 Structural Geology

The regional structural geology and the borehole logging data have been used to estimate the minescale structural geology. A total of 31 major structures have been identified. Figure 16.2.3.1 shows a plan view section with the position of stopes and footwall accesses relative to the geologic structures on the +60 m elevation level.

## 16.2.4 Rock Mass Properties

The laboratory testing and characterization data has been analyzed by domain and statistical ranges of  values  have  been  estimated.  Table  16.2.4.1  shows  a  summary  of  the  rock  mass  properties  by domain.

In addition  to the geotechnical  core  logging, coustic  tele viewer  data a was  used  to  establish  the structural  domains  and  for  preparation  of  the  major  structural  model.  For  each  domain,  structural sets were identified based on orientation and discontinuity type. Table 16.2.4.2 shows a summary of the discontinuity orientation by domain.

The  Pennsylvania,  domain  I,  is  controlled  by  sub-orizontal  structural  sets,  dipping  between  0 and h ¬∞ 18¬∞ mostly in the NE and SW direction, in combination with a sub vertical joint set, between 66  and ¬∞ 90¬∞ in the NW and SE direction.

The  Hangingwall,  domain  II,  joint  set  shows  a  joint  set,  dipping  between  48¬∞ 80¬∞  to  SE,  in and combination  with  two  bedding  sets.  The  principal  set  dips  between  3¬∞ d  39¬∞  in  the  NE  direction an and the secondary set dips between 30¬∞ and 60¬∞ in the SW direction.

The  mineralized  carbonatite,  domain  III,  is  characterized  by  one  conjugate  joint  set  (10¬∞/166¬∞  and 86¬∞/360¬∞)  and  three  defects  logged  as  bedding  sets.  The  principal  bedding  set  is  dipping  between 25¬∞ and 75¬∞ to SE and the secondary set dips to the SW.

The footwall,  domain  IV,  is  controlled  by  two  joint  sets  where  the  principal  set  is  sub  vertical  and dipping  SE  (42¬∞/138¬∞¬±15¬∞)  and  a  secondary  joint  set  dipping  to  the  SW  (66¬∞/245¬∞¬±10¬∞).  Both  joint sets combine with two bedding sets dipping to the SE (30¬∞/118¬∞¬±19¬∞) and SW (48¬∞/234¬∞¬±20¬∞).

Based on joint  spacing  descriptions  in  the  geotechnical  logs  and  using  the  approach  by  Palmstr√∂m (1995,1996), volumetric joint and block sizes have been estimated for each domain. The results, as follows, are variable depending on the fracture frequency and the degree of weathering.

- ¬∑ Domain I - approximately 11-12 joints/m ; 3
- ¬∑ Domain II- approximately 8.5 and 15 joints/m ; 3
- ¬∑ Domain III - approximately 9 to 13 joints/m ; and 3
- ¬∑ Domain IV - approximately 15 to 20 joints/m . 3

This information is used to estimate ground support requirements and potential stope dilution.

## 16.2.5 Rock Mass Quality

The  geotechnical  domains  show  most  of  the  material  to  be  fresh  or  moderately  weathered  with  a RMR between 55 and 80. This translates to a Class II rock, considered good rock, and is described as  blocky with fair/good joint surfaces,  fresh to moderately  weathered,  planar  rough  and  planar smooth in condition.

Other areas identified as moderately weathered have an RMR between 40 and 60. This translates to a Class III rock, considered fair rock, and is described as blocky with fair joint surfaces.

Core logs indicate that rock masses described as highly weathered are associated with major faults. These  zones  have  an  RMR  of  approximately  30  to  40.  This  translates  to  Class  IV  rock,  considered poor rock, and is described as very blocky with fair and poor joint surfaces.

Table 16.2.4.1 includes the RMR76 values for each domain. The RMR6 values are the same as the 7 Geologic Strength Index (GSI) used in Hoek-Brown strength criteria (Hoek and Brown, 2008).

## 16.2.6 Pre-Mining Stresses

In September 2014, Agapito Associates, Inc. (AAI, 2014) performed downhole in situ stress testing at the site. The  purpose  of  the work  was  to estimate the in situ horizontal stress field in the mineralized Pennsylvania rock (surface to 200 m depth) and the mineralized carbonatite zone (below 200  m).  A  total  of  thirteen  tests  were  attempted,  eight  of  which  were  successful.  The  results  of  the study concluded the following:

- ¬∑ There is an apparent increase of stress with depth of approximately 36 kPa/m for the major stress ( œÉ H) and 21 kPa/m for the minor stress( œÉ h );
- ¬∑ The  major  stress  (H)  is  approximately  20%  greater  than  the  vertical  stress  (   and  the œÉ œÉ V) minor stress ( œÉ h ) is 71% of the vertical stress( œÉ V);

un-

- ¬∑ Both the major and minor stresses are approximately 66% lower than values predicted from the database of US-Canada non-coal sites;
- ¬∑ The average orientation of the major stress is N 66¬∞ E; however, a calculation using selected overcores provides an estimate of N 72¬∞ E; and
- ¬∑ The  orientation  of  the  principal  stresses  is  well  correlated  with  the  orientation  of  the  maj or fault structures, validating the major fault model.

SRK  assumes  that  the  major  to  minor  stress  ratio  is  1.5  with  the  minor  stress  being  the  vertical stress.

Figure  16.2.6.1  shows  a  summary  of  the  major  and  minor  stress  orientation  relative  to  the  fracture set and fault structure orientations.

These values are taken from the International Building Code  commonly used for mine applications. , The source of the peak ground acceleration is the 2002 USGS, Interactive National Seismic Hazard

Map  (Frankel  et  al,  2003).  It  shows  the  Maximum  Design  Earthquake  (MDE)  with  an  expected  1% probability of having an earthquake of magnitude greater than 5.0 in 100 years.

## 16.2.8 Underground Geotechnical Mine Design Parameters

## Stope Dimensions

For the purposes of mine design the stopes have been oriented at an orientation of  60¬∞E to create N the  most  favorable  ground  conditions  during  mining.  The  orientation  considers  the  major  geologic structures, the local discontinuities and the principal stress orientations. The resource block model is also oriented along this same direction. Figure 16.2.8.1 shows the terminology used to describe  he t stope dimensions.

The  sizing  of  stopes  has  been  based  on   empirical  design  method  (Potvin,  et.  al.  1988).  The an method compares the hydraulic radius (area divided by perimeter) of a stope face to a stability index number.  The  stability  index  number  accounts  for  the  rock  mass  quality  (primarily  Q  values)  with adjustments  for  local  fracture  orientations,  potential  block  failure  mode  into  the  stope,  and  induce d mining  stresses.  Figure  16.2.8.2  shows  a  plot  of  the  stability  chart  at  three  representative  depths (400 m, 600 m, and 800 m) below ground and three representative rock qualities (fresh, moderately weathered  and  highly  weathered).  The  chart  includes  points  for  the  stope  back,  the  hangingwall stope  face,  and  the  stope  sidewall.  The  selected  stope  sizes  used  to  compute  the  hydraulic  radius are:

- ¬∑ Width 15 m;
- ¬∑ Height 25 m; and
- ¬∑ Length 100 m.

The figure indicates that these stope dimensions should remain stable when fully open and emptied of material.  SRK  notes  that  n  weaker  ground  areas  the  stope  lengths  may  need  to  be  reduced i depending on ground conditions. This should affect only a small percentage of stopes.

## Sills and Mining Sequence

The  longhole  open  stoping  mining  method  is  based  on  overhand  mining  so  the osit has  been dep divided  into three  blocks  wh ere  mining  starts  at  the  bottom  of  block  1  mining  upwards  for  s even levels (i.e., top  of the  deposit). Mining then continues from the bottom of block 2 and mines the five levels upward leaving a sill between Blocks 1 and 2. Mining continues in this way for block 3. Based on  tributary  stresses,  and  preliminary  numerical  analyses,  a  5  m  high  sill  has  been  included  in  the design.  This  analysis  assumes  the  mining  rate  is  slowed  for  stopes  immediately  beneath  the  sill, stope sizes are reduced to account for increased stresses, and that cemented pastefill is used in all the stopes below the sill level. There may be an opportunity to increase stope lengths with additional stability analysis as the design is advanced.

The strategy for mining stopes is to use a primary/secondary stoping sequence that allows a gradual stress  transfer  on  a  given  mining  level.  Optimal  stoping  sequence  on  a  level  would  be  from  the center  of  the deposit out  toward  the  abutments  to  push  induced  mining  stresses  away  from  active haulage/access areas.

## Infrastructure Setback Distances

To  minimize  mining -induced  damages  to  long- term  drifts  the  setback  distances  used  in  the  design are:

- ¬∑ Haulage setback: 25 m from stopes; and
- ¬∑ Main ramp setback: 75 m from stopes.

The setback distances are shown on Figure 16.2.8.4.

## Backfill Requirements

The  mining  method  requires  that  most  of  the  stopes  be  backfilled.  The  backfill  material  will  be  a paste  fill  made  of  fly  ash  and  and.  The  primary/secondary  extraction  sequence  requires  that  the s primaries  be  backfilled  with  cemented  pastefill  having  a  minimum  14 ay UCS  strength  of  1.0  MPa d for  single face fill exposure during mining of the adjacent secondary stope in high stress conditions. In  lower  stress  conditions  the  minimum  14  day UCS  strength  can  be  0.5  MPa.  In  secondary  stopes where  the  backfill  will  never  be  exposed  only  sufficient  binder  is  required  to  prevent  liquefaction  of the backfill during mining operations.

## Rock Mechanics Description Around the Shaft

A  total  of  five  geotechnical  units,  as  shown  in  Table  16.2. ,  are  expected  to  be  crossed  during 8.1 shaft construction.

These geotechnical domains, were characterized using the Bieniawski (1976) rock mass rating and the  Barton's  Q -system  (1974),  to  provide  the  basic  inputs  for  mine  designs.  Tables  16.2.8.2  and 16.2.8.3  summarize  the  geotechnical  parameters  of  the  geotechnical  units  to  be  intersected  during shaft construction.

Figure  16.2.8.5,  shows  a  cross  section  of  the  shaft,  indicating  the  depth  and  the  geometry  of  each geotechnical domain that would be disturbed by the construction of this facility. This figure is based on the 2014 geotechnical drill characterization and does not consider data from the recent 2015 shaft and  ventilation  drill  holes.  The  geotechnical  domains  should  be  updated  to  consider  the  2015  data for the feasibility level design.

## 16.3  Hydrogeology

The hydrogeology of the deposit is characterized based on three phases of work:

- 1. The first phase of hydrogeologic characterization was conducted during phases 1 and 2 of the core drilling program and consisted of packer testing, installation of piezometers, and measurement of water levels. Specifically, the program included:
- ¬∑ 42 downhole packer-isolated injection and airlift tests in coreholes;
- ¬∑ Installation  of  six  2  inch PVC  standpipe  piezometers isolated  in  the  carbonatite  and open to large intervals of the deposit;

- ¬∑ Installation  of  two  nom inal 2 inch PVC  standpipe  piezometers  isolated  in  the  180 m thick Pennsylvanian aquitard above the carbonatite; and
- ¬∑ Frequent  measurement  of  water  levels  in  open  coreholes  and  piezometers  over  a period of six months.
- 2. Following the second phase of resource-related core drilling, an 11 day airlift pumping test was completed using a deep, open, vertical PQ corehole as a pumping well. Water levels from the surrounding piezometers were recorded over the duration of the test and for several weeks following the test.
- 3. The third phase of hydrogeologic characterization involved installation of two multi-level, distally-located piezometers and a deep 6 inch diameter injection well completed to depths of 850 m, followed by completion of a nominal 30 day injection test. The piezometers were completed within the carbonatite at distances of 0.6 km and 1.2 km from the center of the deposit. Water from Elk and Todd Creeks was injected at rates of between 22 and 30 L/sec (350 to 480 gpm) over a period of 33 days, including downtime. Response to the injection test was monitored over the duration of the test and for eight weeks following the test.

## Conceptual Hydrogeology

Analysis and interpretation of the data from the testing program has been completed following preliminary conceptual model describes the site hydrogeology.

and the

low highly

The upper 30 m  of lithology is comprised of glacial till, underlain by a 170 to 180  -m  of permeability, Pennsylvanian-aged mudstone and limestone, otherwise known as the 'Pennsylvanian strata' (PENN).  The  PENN  is  reportedly  continuous  across  the  state  of  Nebraska,  and  locally  it behaves  as  a  very  effective  aquitard  beneath  the  glacial  till  and  above  the  carbonatite  in  which  the deposit  is  hosted.  Testing  in  the  PENN  indicates  the  horizontal  hydrauliconductivity  of  this  unit  is c approximately  5 x 10  m/day. -5 In addition, the PENN is highly stratified and is likely anisotropic, whereby the vertical hydraulic conductivity is several orders of magnitude lower than the horizontal. There  is a verticallyownward  hydraulic  gradient  across  the -d PENN,  resulting  in very gradual leakage of water into the carbonatite. The carbonatite intrusive underlies the PENN  to unknown depths. The rock within the mineralized zone is fractured and faulted, while the carbonatite beyond  the  immediate  limits  of  the ineralized m zone   is  likely to be  less permeable.   At a radial distance  of  about  4  km,  granite  county  rock  hosts  the  carbonatite.he  hydrogeologic  nature  of  the T granite  has  not  been  well  characterized, but  results  from  the  recent  injection  test  indicate  it  is  less permeable than the carbonatite and may act as a partial boundary to groundwater flow.

Water  levels  in  wells  completed  in  the  carbonatite  are  consistently  at  about  100  m  below  ground surface, or approximately 251 m above mean sea level (mamsl); water levels in the wells completed in the  PENN  are  50  to  85  m  higher  than  water  levels  in  the  carbonatite.  This  indicates  that  the groundwater  system  in  the  carbonatite  is  confined  from  above.  Groundwater  levels  and  pertinent hydrogeologic information are presented in Figure 16.3.1.

Testing in the carbonatite and subsequent analysis ing us an analytical method as h indicated average  hydraulic  conductivities  as  high  as  0.2  m/day  to  depths  of  83 m below  the  surface.  Sub0 vertical  faults  have  been  mapped  within  the  carbonatite  proximal  to  the  deposit,  and  these  faults contribute  to  the  elevated  bulk  hydraulic  conductivity  values  generated  from  the  testing  program.  A summary  plot  of  hydraulic  conductivity  values  generated  during  all  three  phases  of  the  project is provided in Figure 16.3.2.

The  response  observed  in  the  surrounding  piezometers  over  the  course  of  the  inal nom 30 day injection  test  indicates  that  faults  and  fractures  within  the  carbonatite  are  relatively  well  connected. The distribution of mounding seen during the injection test confirms that the stress propagates from the  center  of  the  deposit  in  a  roughly  radial  geometry.  Water  from  Elk  Creek  was  injected  into  the 6 inch  injection  well  completed  in  the  carbonatite  to  a  depth  of  approximately  830  m  with  shutter screens; the injection  rate  was  22  L/s  (350  gpm)  for  the  first  two  weeks  of  the  test,  at  which  time  a severe  storm  caused  a  flood  which  shut  the  test  down.  After  two  days  to  allow  the  flood  waters  to recede,  the  test  was  restarted  at  approximately 30  L/s  (475  gpm)  for  two  more  weeks.  The  rise  in water levels witin h the carbonatite due  to injection  served ob at the end  of the injection test is presented in Figure 16.3.3, showing 4.85 m  of response in NEC15-located 002 0.6 km  to the southwest,  and  over  2  m  of  response  in  NEC15-3  located  1.2  km  to  the  southeast.  On  a  mine 00 scale, the faulted and fractured carbonatite exhibits mogeneous quasi -ho and isotropic characteristics.

Groundwater temperatures from logging have been in the range of 35Àö to 51.7ÀöC (95Àö to 125ÀöF), and the water chemistry can be categorized as brackish. Chloride and sodium concentrations approximately 10 and 8 g/L respectively, resulting in a TDS of 18 g/L.

## Predicted Dewatering Requirements

dewatering

Based  on the data analysis and interpretation, SRK generated a prediction of requirements for the underground mine. A numerical groundwater flow model was built using MODFLOW-2000  finite- difference code to simulate mining progress, assuming the active mine blocks are sequentially dewatered as the mine progresses downward, using dewatering wells located  along  the  edges  of  the  mine.  The model  simulates  the  deep  groundwater  system  below  the confining  PENN  aquitard, which  includes  860  m  of  carbonatite  sur ounded  laterally  by  granite  at  a r radial distance  of  4  km.  The  modeled  deep  groundwater  system  includes  six  units  as  shown  in Table 16.3.1.  The  model  was  calibrated  to  match  the  groundwater  response  observed  during  and after the  nominal  30  day  injection  test.  A  summary  of  calibrated  hydrogeological  parameters  are provided in Table 16.3.1.

Compared  to  analytical  method,  calibration  of  the  numerical  model  to  injection  test  data  indicates that  mineralized  zone  and  faults  within  carbonatite  are  more  permeable  (K  varies  from  0.5  m/d  to 3 m/d) while carbonatite outside of mineralization zone has hydraulic conductivity about 0.15 m/day.

(almost

Two  scenarios  were  considered  regarding  boundary  conditions  of  the  carbonatite  within  the  deep groundwater system - unbounded and bounded by the granite. For example, in the case of bounded conditions, the hydraulic conductivity of the granite was assumed to be very low impermeable) at K=0.001 m/day as shown in Table 16.3.1, while for an unbounded scenario a value of 0.15  m/d  was simulated.  Additionally, a range  of  storage  parameters  were  considered  in  the dewatering projection, as shown in Table 16.3.1.

Expected  pumping  rates  for  dewatering  activities  are  illustrated  in  Figure  16.3.4  and  represent  an average  of  the  predicted  flows  for  unbounded  and  bounded  conditions  as  discussed  above.  It  was assumed  that  installation  of  the  dewatering  well  system  (a  number  of  wells  drilled  from  surface) would begin two years in advance of production mining to allow dewatering of development workings such  as  the  shaft,  vent  shaft  and  main  access  ramp.  The  maximum  anticipated  dewatering  rate (~725  L/sec)  is  expected  to  occur  one  year  into  production  mining,  following  three  yearsactive of dewatering. The expected dewatering rate is projected to decline to  500 L/sec in Year 13 and to 400 L/sec at end of mining.

## 16.4  Mine Design

Figure 16.4.1 shows  cross sections of the resource block model blocks above a NSR  CoG  of US$180/t which have been classified as Measured and I ndicated. There is a higher grade portion of mineralization  at depth  (approximately  -400 to -600 m elevation) and  the mineralization at those depths is approximately 300 m along strike. Higher in the deposit the mineralization is approximately 600 m in length along strike, and tends to have a lower grade central core area with higher grades at the edges of the deposit. This model formed the basis of the stope design.

<!-- image -->

Source: SRK, 2015

Stope optimization was completed in Vulcan‚Ñ¢ using a minimum mining stope width of 15 m, a stope height  of  25  m,  variable  length  along  strike,  and  an  NSR  CoG  of  US$ 0/t.  The  stopes  and  block 18 model  are  oriented  to  match  the  direction  of  in  situ  stresses,  which  are  elevated  (~1.5H:1V).  As discussed in Section 16.2, this stope orientation optimizes stress distribution and allows for mining of larger openings.

To  produce  7,500  t  FeNb  annually  with  a  process  facility  capacity  of  00  t/d minimum  average 2,7 grade of 0.793% Nb2O5 must be mined. This is achieved by varying the mine design CoG by level to maintain the approximate average grade required. All CoGs used are above the marginal calculated CoG discussed in  Section  16.1.  Using  elevated  CoGs  to  maximize  NPV  or  achieve  other  company goals has the effect of leaving lower grade resource material in situ.

## 16.4.1 Stope Design

Stope  optimizer  shapes  were  used  as  a  basis  for  the  design  work.  A  typical  level  is  made  up  of approximately 20 to 30 stopes. Stopes are 15 m wide and 25 m high with varying length. Each stope has  a 4.5  m  x 4.5  m  access  located  at  the  bottom  of  the  stope  as  shown  in  Figure  16.4.1.1.  Top accesses  are  designed on  most  levels  to  give  access  to  stopes  on  the  next  level  and  to  allow  for backfilling. For upper most stopes in a block or where there is no mining above, if the stope must be filled,  it  is  assumed  a  hole  can  be  drilled  from  adjacent  development  into  the  e  for  backfilling stop purposes. The stopes are drilled top down  and rings are blasted from the end of a stope toward the access. The blasted material is remotely mucked from the stope access.

cure.

A primary/secondary stoping sequence will be used, where on any given level, primary stopes must be separated by a secondary stope. Extraction  of the secondary stope can only  occur after the two immediately adjacent primary stopes have been mined, backfilled, and have had time to Backfilling  will  be  an  integral  part  of  the  LHS  mining  cycle  however  with  the  quantity  of  stopes  on  a level  and flexibility  in  sequencing  mining  should  not  be  limited  by  backfilling  operations. f  a  shorter I

level  is  encountered  w ith fewer stopes  then  backfilling  may  be  a  limiting  actor which  could reduce f mining rates on that level.

## 16.4.2 Development Design

The  stope  accesses  are  connected  to  a  level  access  located  in  waste  or  low  grade  material. e Th level  accesses  are  offset  approximately  25 m  from  the  end  of  stopes. Each  stope  access  typically connects  to  the level access  except  in  cases  where  stopes  are  small  and  long  development  is required  to  reach  the  stope.In  those  instances  a  connec ion from  an  adjacent  stope  is  included  in t the design. This minimizes the amount of development, however it limits the sequencing order.

The  level  accesses  connect  to  the  main  ramp  which  is  offset  at  least  70  rom  stoping  into  the m  f footwall. On the southeast side of each level the level access connects to an exhaustir ventilation a raise  and  on  the  northwest  side  connects  to  a  resh  air raise.  Figure 16.4.2.1 shows  a  typical  level f section.

Shaft  bottom  development  was  not  designed  at  this  time, owever  a  loading  pocket  and  necessary h accesses  will  be  developed  prior  to  production.  Underground  shops  and  associated  development accesses  are  also  assumed  to  be  developed  prior  to  production  in  the  vicinity  of  the  shaft.  These infrastructure items should be located away from known faults.

## 16.5  Mine Plan Resource

The  underground  mine  design  process  results  in  mine  plan  resources  of .1 Mt  (diluted)  with  an 31 average grade of 0.80% Nb2O5, 2.84% TiO2, and 73 ppm Sc.

This estimate is based on a mine design using elevated CoGs and applying the US$180/t NSR CoG to material within the design. These numbers include a 95% to 100% mining recovery based on type of opening (stope, development, etc.) to the designed wireframes in addition to a 5% 0% to unplanned  waste  dilution.  An  additional  development  allowance  of  26%  was  applied  to  main  ramps and 19% to level accesses to account for detail currently not in the   A design. 7% additional allowance was applied to stopes where arched backs were not designed at the average grade of the stope.  This  percentage  was  determined  based  on  percentage  of  stopes  within  the  design  where

there  is  no  stope  above.  Waste  dilution  for  stopes  was  applied  with  grade,  slightly  lower  than  the cutoff grade, based on an analysis of the material around stopes in a representative area.

Table 16.5.1 summarizes the mine plan resources.

- (1) All rates are per face. Multiple areas/faces are mined together to generate the production schedule.
- (2) Includes drilling, blasting, and mucking.

A delay of 9 days was used prior to driving on pastefill and a  28 day delay prior to mining adjacent to a pastefilled stope. These delays account for curing time as well as multiple pours.

The mining operation schedule is based on 365 days/year, 7 days/week, with two 12 hour shifts each day. A production rate of  ,700 t/d 2 was targeted with ramp- p u to full production as quickly possible.

## 16.7.1 Stoping

blasted

Stope lengths vary throughout the deposit ranging from 6 m to a maximum of 100 m giving a range of approximately 6,000 to 110,000 t per stope. After bottom and top accesses are established a slot raise  will  be  developed  at  the  far  end  of  the  stope  (hangingwall  side).  rilling will continue with  the D longhole drill using a fan shaped pattern as shown in Figure 16.7.1.1. Holes will be loaded with bulk emulsion and stope blasting will commence  in the slot and subsequently rings will be retreating toward the level access.

Remote  mucking  will  be  required  for  the  majority  of  stope  mucking  so  the  load- l-dump  (LHD) h u operator  can  remain  behind  the  brow  of  the  stope.  Stope  material  will  be  mucked  arily  into  a prim muck bay near the level access  or the adjacent stope access. The material  will then be loaded into trucks  and  hauled  to  the  shaft  for  hoisting  to  surface.  Once  the  stope  is  emptied  a  bulkhead  will  be placed  in  the 4.5  m  x 4.5  m  access  and  the  stope  void  will  be  filled  with  paste  backfill  from  the  top access or via a drillhole at the top of the stope.

## 16.7.2 Development

where

Drifting development such as main ramps  and level accesses are sized as 5 m x 5 m openings with an arched back. Drifting top/bottom stope accesses are sized as 4.5 m x 4.5 m flat back openings. These dimensions   provide enough room for equipment, ventilation ducting, and utilities necessary. Main ramps are typically a single heading environment. Level accesses are  also typically single heading environments. Drifting top/bottom stope accesses are multiple heading environments.

All  development  will  be  mined  using  a  double  boom  jumbo  taking  4  m  rounds.  Blasted  material  will typically be mucked into a muck bay near the heading. The waste muck will subsequently be loaded into trucks and transported for disposal in the secondary stopes. As some development mineralized  material  grade  control  will  be  required  to  determine  material  destination  on  a  round  by round basis.

is

The ramp  system  is  designed  at  a  maximum  gradient  of  15%.  A  turning  radius  of  40  m  was  used which is suitable for any underground truck.

## 16.7.3 Mine Access

The underground mine will be accessed through a shaft system. The surface facilities include a hoist house,  headframe  structure,  hoisting  system,  compressor  room,  MCC  room,  headframe  structure with  collar  house,  a  mine lectrical  substation,  and  a  development  ventilation  system  that  will  be e converted to a ventilation booster system during production. Shaft heating will also be provided.

The underground system includes the shaft, two cage over skips, an auxiliary cage, loading pocket and  skip  loader,  and  a  muck  handling  system  at  the  bottom  of  the  shaft.  An  emergency  escape system is included in the return air raise.

## Surface Facilities

The  hoist  house  is  a  single  building  with  one  large  room  that  houses  two  hoisting  plants   an and annex that houses the electrical systems for the hoists, the control rooms, compressor mechanical cooling room, and other systems. The hoistroom will incorporate the use of an overhead crane to assist in installing the hoisting plants. The crane will have a capacity of 40 t with secondary hooks of 5 t capacity to assist with day -to-day maintenance on the hoists. The hoist foundations  are reinforced concrete with some provision for a roping up winch in the hoistroom.

room,

The  hoist  house  contains  a  two- oist  system,  a  main  production  hoist  and  an  auxiliary  hoist.  The h production  hoisting  system  is  a  1,415  kW  (1,900  HP),  double  drum  system,  5 in  diameter,  in  a m double-clutch  configuration  for  maximum  efficiency.  The  system  allows  for  up  to  5,000  t  of  muck hoisting  within  an eight hour  shift,  in  addition  to  the  use  of  the  light  duty  service  hoist.  The  second hoisting plant will utilize a 447 kW (600 HP), 2.44 m single drum hoisting plant that will serve as light duty  service  hoist  and  secondary  means  of  egress  during  shaft  construction.  The  auxiliary  hoist  will be connected to the emergency generator included in the plant electrical system, as it serves as an emergency egress from the shaft.

till

The  headframe  is  a  structural  steel  system  founded  on  a  mat  foundation  on  the  glacial extends to a depth of 30 m. The structural steel framing for the facility provides for four internal floors within the headframe, including:

that

- ¬∑ Production  Sheave  deck - The  topmost  floor  in  the  headframe  and  houses  the  two  4.72 m diameter sheaves for the production hoisting facility.
- ¬∑ Service  Sheave  deck - The  second  floor  from  the  top  and  houses  the  two  4.72  m  diameter sheaves  for  the  service/sinking  hoist  activities.  It may  also  house  sheaves  for  equipping stages (if needed) and the sinking sheaves for galloway winches.
- ¬∑ Dump floor - This provides maintenance access to the skip dumps. The floor also provides a dust barrier for the material being dumped and can house dust collection equipment.

in

ropes

- ¬∑ Collar  floor - The  main  operating  floor  located  at  ground  level.  This  provides  access  in  and out of the shaft to the conveyances for service hoisting and to the hoist attachments for maintenance.
- ¬∑ A small bin will be utilized to capture and transfer mined material from the cages/skips to an apron feeder which will feed the conveyor system leading to the mineral processing facility.

The entry to the collar will be provided by a collar house attached to the headframe. The collarhouse provides a staging area for personnel and materials going down the shaft or returning to  he surface t and for maintenance. It is equipped with a 15 t overhead crane for material movement conveyance removal/repair.

and

## Shaft and Underground Access

both

The  mine is accessed through a single 435 m  deep, 7.5 m  diameter shaft that supports production  and  service  hoisting  operations.  Shaft  sinking  is  completed  using  conventional  sinking methods.  The  shaft   is  compartmentalized  with  the  primary  skipping/mancage  system  on  one  side and the light duty system on the other. The compartments will be separated for the full length of the shaft with a brattice panel system of cladding or expanded metal mesh sheet in an angle frame.

The primary skipping system consists of a two skip/cage arrangement adjacent to each other on one side of the shaft. The cages have two decks and are 1.8 m x 1.8 m with the capability to handle 6 m long items internally. Utilizing this layout, each of the cages will have the ability to approximately  39  persons  per  trip  or  78  persons  in  one  full  cycle  of  the  hoist  (both  conveyances unloading).  Palletized  consumables  will  be  used  for  rapid  handling.  The  cages  will  be  a  two- k dec design  with  a  removable  upper  deck  that  can  be  slung  up  or  pulled  out  for  handling  long  internal items. Four large pallets can be handled simultaneously king , ma movement of consumables relatively  efficient.  The  skip  will  be  located  above  the  cage  with  a  bottom  dump  mechanism.  Each skip will have a 10.5 t payload.

move

The secondary light service hoisting system will have a capacity of approximately 5 t. The system will include  a  double- decked  cage  with  a  capacity  of  approximately n  people  and  will  move  smaller te materials. In the event of a power loss connected emergency generator would come on automatically allowing the auxiliary hoist to transport personnel from the mine.

Near the shaft bottom the system includes a muck handling system with a grizzly, hydraulic breaker, jaw crusher, 3,000 t bin, conveyor belt, vibratory feeder, belt magnet, transfer car  and two measuring pockets (flasks) in a typical loading pocket arrangement. The scalper, grizzly, hydraulic rock breaker, feeder and crusher will size the rock to a minus 15.25 cm (6 inch) size.

The system has an allowance for a control system that would integrate with the plant system.

One  5.5 m  diameter  ventilation  raise  to  surface,  approximately  410  m  in  length,  is  raise- ed  by bor contractors prior to mine production. The raise will serve as an exhaust air raise and as emergency egress  during  production.  The  raise  will contain  an  emergency  hoist  at  the  surface  and  bullet  cage for emergency use.

## 16.7.4 Haulage

The mine will incorporate the use of four 14 t LHDs that muck material from stopes and development headings  to  either  a  muck  bay  or  into  40  t  underground  trucks  for  haulage.  Mineralized  material  is hauled  to a  grizzly/crusher  that  feeds  the  shaft  loadig  bin. Early  in  the  mine  life  average  one-way n and

haulage  distances  are  approximately  540  m  and 3  trucks  are  required.   As  the  mine  is  developed deeper  the haulage distance increases and additional trucks are required. Waste  material development will be moved from muck bays and hauled to secondary stopes as conjunction with the pastefill.

from backfill

Table 16.7.4.1 shows the maximum one-way haul distance by mining block and the number of trucks required. Truck count includes waste haulage.

During the pre-production period, prior to mining of stopes and the commissioning of the plant, waste and mineralized material will be hoisted to surface. The material will be segregated development and stored separately in a designated storage facility on the surface. The lined storage facility is designed with a capacity of 500,000 t with surface water controls as required. The mine will produce  approximately  245,000  t  of  waste  and  220,000  t  of  mineralized  material  in  the  two  years prior to plant  peration.  The o mineralized material will be fed into the processing plant commissioning or as needed.

## 16.7.5 Backfilling

## Paste Backfill Plant

A paste backfill plant will be located on surface and the paste backfill product will be made of fly ash from  a local  (74  km away)  coal  power  plant.  Sand  will  be  used  as  an  aggregate  source  to  regulate the strength gain characteristics of the paste. The backfill mixture has a minimal  amount of cement, as  the  fly  ash  is  expected  to  gain  some  strength  without  the  cement.  Initial  rheological  testing  has shown that fly ash used may begin to hydrate quickly and indicates the possible need for a retarder or  water  dilution  with  appropriate  amounts  of  sand  to  allow  for  proper  pipeline  conveyance  to  the stopes. A 25% fly ash, 75% sand fill composition has been assumed. Primary stopes would be filled with 5% cement fill and secondary stopes would be filled with 2% cement.

The paste backfill plant has been designed to fill 1,500 m /day when operating. This is approximately 3 50%  more  than  the  void  space  generated  from  daily  mining  operations.  Any waste  rock  mined underground and not hauled to surface will also be used as backfill material.

A  simplified  backfill  process  flow  sheet  is  shown  in  Figure  16.7.5.1. aste  plant  major  mechanical P equipment is shown in Table 16.7.5.1.

## Underground Distribution

The  paste  location  is  near  the  east  side  of  the  deposit.   surface  borehole  is  cased  and  twinned, A where  one  hole  acts  as the  main  hole  while  the  second  is  backup.   borehole  orientation  from A surface of 70¬∞ was evaluated and underground holes  between  levels maintained  a 60 ¬∞ to 70¬∞dip. A 250 mm slump with a friction factor of 4  kPa/m can reach all areas of the underground mine using a gravity system only. Paste is then piped to the working areas through a network of steel and HDPE pipes.

Capital  and  operating  costs  for  both  the  paste  plant  and  the  distribution  system  were  provided  by Kovit, and were reviewed and accepted by SRK.

## 16.7.6 Ground Support

be

The current knowledge of the geotechnical characteristics indicate that ground support will required  in  the  ramps  and  primary  access  drifts  as  well  as  the  shaft  and  shop  areas.  The  stope access drifts will require minimum ground support except at brows of the stopes. The ground support plan  included  use  of  swellex  style  bolts  as  a  standard.  The  bolting  will  be  supplemented  with  wire mesh, shotcrete,  and  additional  support  where  required.  The  plan  includes  allowances  for  areas  of full shotcrete,  but  it  is  not  expected  to  be  required  in  normal  operations,  just  in  areas  encountering faulted  or  challenging  ground  conditions.  A  bolter  will  be  utilized  as  normal  practice  and  shotcrete equipment and transmixer are included in the estimate.

Table 16.7.6.1 shows the expected ground control systems for the various categories conditions.

The systematic bolting is planned to use 2.5 m swellex bolts and a spacing of 1.2 m.

## 16.7.7 Grade Control

As the main ramp is developed, drill stations from the main ramp allow for fan drilling of the deposit prior  to  developing  levels.  This  confirmatory  drilling  should  be  used  to  update  the  long  term  block model and provide confidence in expected tonnage and grades prior to level development.

Once  a  level  is  being  developed,  level  and  stope  accesses  will  be  sampled  to  determine  material destination.  This  sampling  can  occur  through  use  of  a  handheld  XRF  instrument  which  is  able  to sample  the  Nb  grade.  To  provide  more  detail,  samples  can  be  taken  from  longhole  cuttings  and tested in the on-site lab.

Once stope accesses are developed vertical holes will be drilled through the anticipated stopes and cuttings will be sampled to determine stope extents and estimated stope grades. Any samples tested in  the  lab  should  be  used  to  update  short  term  planning  block  models  to  better  estimate  tonnages and grades in the short term mine plan.

## 16.8  Mine Services

## 16.8.1 Ventilation

## Primary Ventilation

16.8.1.1.

The primary ventilation system during preproduction consists of fans installed on surface at the shaft. These  surface  fans  become  booster  fans  as  the  primary  ventilation  fans  are  installed  underground near the return (exhaust)  air  raise  (RAR)  The  fan  system  is  designed  to  be  adequate  for  the  life  of . mine design with installation  of  ventilation  doors  and  controls. Intake  air  is  drawn  down  the  hoisting shaft (and used for ramp ventilation) and across working levels as shown in Figure Required  airflow  quantities  are  based  on  a  ventilation  rate  of  0.08  ¬≥/kW  of  diesel  equipment  and m assumed utilization factors for mobile equipment. A ventilation factor of 1.2 was applied to the diesel dilution  airflow  requirements  for  heat  dissipationwhen  the  mining  reaches  the  third  block   A  worst -. case early mining scenario was modeled with three active stopes in series on one level (two actively mucking) and the exhaust temperature was kept under a design target of 26.5¬∞C wet bulb.

Source: SRK, 2015

<!-- image -->

Early  in the  mine  life, the  primary  fan  is  expected  to  operate  at  m¬≥/s  and  1.0 kPa,  with  the 370 operating  point  eventually  reaching  583  m¬≥/s  at  2.7  kPa  during  later  years.  The  RAR  is assumed  to be  built  to  finished  internal  diameter  of  5.5 .  Slot raises  used  for  ventilation  were  assumed  to  be m 4.5 m √ó 4.5 m.

Total airflow required ranges from 350 m /s early in the mine life to 620 m /s late in the mine life. 3 3

## Auxiliary Ventilation

An auxiliary ventilation system is required to provide ventilation from the level access to the stopes. A  production  heading  is  assumed  to  only  have  one  243  kW  LHD  requiring  19.4 of  airflow. m¬≥/s Models indicate a 65 kW fan should be used with a 1.2 m diameter duct for production headings.

Ramp  and  level  development  are  ass med  to  have  one  243  kW  LHD  and  a  405  kW  haul  truck u requiring 51.8 m¬≥/s of airflow. These types of headings can be ventilated with a 302 kW fan and a 1.4 m diameter duct.

## Mine Heating and Cooling

The need for mine air heating and/or cooling ws assessed based on average temperatures for Elk a Creek, NE as well as estimated virgin rock temperatures of approximately 35 ¬∞C nd assumed rock a thermal  properties .  Mine  air  refrigeration  was  determined  to  be  unnecessary  as  the  air  could  be cooled sufficiently with  additional airflow.   Approximately a 20% increase in airflow yond be th e amount  required for diesel exhaust dilution will be needed.e  additional Th amount  of airflow is included in the design of the system.

Heating is assumed to be required at some time during five months of the year.  The system will heat the intake air to 4¬∞C above freezing during the winter months

## 16.8.2 Pumping

produce

The mine, after dewatering from the surface (discussed in 16.3), is expected to approximately  18.9  L/sec at maximum  flows  and  thus  an  internal  mine  pumping  system  will  be required. The system will be installed during development at the bottom of the shaft and will consist of two vertical agitated cone bottom tanks, sump, and two 260 kW positive displacement pumps per tank.  This c onfiguration will allow the system  to be capable  of pumping  63  L/sec  up  the  shaft. Supplemental stage pumping skids will be located at the bottom of each block level and will consist of  a  473  L/sec  agitated  holding  tank  and  two  dirty  water  pumps  each  capable  of  pumping  63  L/sec. One pump will operate and the other will be a spare. The skid system will be installed in series and report to the main pump station at the bottom of the shaft.

Face  pumps  will  be  employed  at  the  development  faces  and  will  pump  to  the  stage  pumping  skids that feed the main block sump.

## 16.8.3 Electrical Supply

All  surface  facilities  will  be  supplied  by  power  from  the  main  project  substation.e  main  surface Th substation  will  feed  the  mine  substation  located  on  the  surface  near  the  hoist  hous . The  mine  sub e will  feed  the  shaft  electrical  systems and the main underground infrastructure and equipment power down the shaft via a 13.8 kW feed line. The 13.8 kV power will feed throughout the mine to main load centers  where  the  power  will  be  stepped  down  to  480v  for  underground  equipment  use.  Feeds  will be  provided  at  110v  and  220v  for  auxiliary  use  in  the  shops  and  for  smaller  loads  such  as  fans, pumps, and auxiliary lighting.

case

A diesel backup generator at the surface will supply backup power for the emergency hoist systems and required ventilation systems to maintain minimum ventilation requirements in the emergency.

## 16.8.4 Health and Safety

The mine design incorporates MSHA safety standards and includes an emergency hoist in the return air  raise  and  a  secondary  light  duty  hoist  in  the  main  shaft.  Both  hoists  are  connected  to  backup power generation. Additionally three 12- person refuge chambers are included that will be located in active working areas over the LoM.

The mine will have a communications system that has both mine phones and communication  through  a  leaky  feeder  system.  A  mine  rescue  team  will  support  the  operation.  The mine safety program will integrate with local providers in case of any mine emergency. A stench gas emergency warning system will be installed in the mine' s intake ventilation system. This system can be  activated  to warn  underground  employees  of  a  fire  situator  other  emergency   whereupon ion emergency  procedures  will  be  followed.  The  shop  areas  and  underground  fueling  station  will  be equipped with automatic closure doors that will operate in case of fire.

## 16.8.5 Manpower

Manpower levels are estimated based on the production schedule and equipment needs. productivities used reflect a mix of local and skilled labor with an experienced management team.

The

The estimate is based on owner mining using an operating schedule consisting of 12  hours per shift, two shifts per day, and seven days per week. The 12 hour shift is supported by a four crew rotation. The management and technical team are planned to work five 8 hour days per week.

Tables 16.8.5.1 to 16.8.5.3 shows the required  workforce. The rotating crews  will have a split  of 46 people underground and 7 people on the surface. It is expected that the maximum  personnel underground would be 59 per shift. The workforce will increase over time through the addition of staff to operate additional equipment.

## 16.8.6 Equipment

The underground equipment used, shown in Table 16.8.6.1, is typical for a sublevel stoping mining method  with  the  number  of  pieces  of  equipment  calculated  from  the  production  rates  and  typical availabilities for underground mines.

The estimate uses an equipment availability  of 85% and an operator efficiency factor (job factor) of 90%.  Each  shift  of  12  hours  is  reduced  by  1.5  hours  to  represent  shift  change,  lunch,  and  travel  to and  from  working  areas.  This  provides  an  equivalent  working  day  of  21  hours  or  10.5  h rs  per hou shift. An operational utilization of 85% is used for planning purposes. This nets approximately 5,000 hours per year of mining time. It should be noted that the layout of this mine and mining on multiple levels  requires  the  addition  of  equipment  to  reduce  tram  time.  This  reduces  the  overall  utilization  of the  equipment  fleet.  The  surface  fleet  is  available  to  handle  the  stockpiling  and  mill  feed  needs  as well as supplement the ongoing work at the tailings facility.

The equipment totals by pre- production and production year are summarized in Table 16.8.6.2. The later years include additional trucks and LHD's due to increasing haul distance.

The mine will also have major fixed equipment that is summarized in Table 16.8.6.3.

## 17 Recovery Methods

mineral

The ferroniobium processing facility is designed with three distinct operation units: a processing plant including a grinding circuit, designed to reduce the particle size prior to leaching; a hydrometallurgical plant (hydromet), designed to extract niobium  pentoxide (Nb2O5), scandium oxide (Sc2O3),  and  titanium  oxide  (TiO );  and  a  pyrometallurgical  plant  (pyromet),  designed  to  produce 2 ferroniobium, an iron-niobium alloy.

## 17.1  Mineral Processing Plant / Grinding Circuit

Following an intensive flotation testwork program, direct leaching of the ground  mineralized material without  a  flotation  pre- concentration  circuit  was  selected  as  the  most  favorable  process  for  treating the  Elk  Creek  mineralized  material  due  to  a  significant  increase  in  recoveries  associated  with  this process.

## 17.1.1 Flowsheet and Process Description

A preliminary flowsheet has been developed for the mineral processing   and plant is shown in Figure 17.1.1.1. Run-of-mine mineralized material is crushed underground to a P80 of 115 mm with a  jaw  crusher.  The  crushed  mineralized  material is  then  conveyed  at  a  rate  of  337.5  t/h  from  a  bin located at the mine shaft house to a mineralized material bin with a live capacity of 2,700 t.

Crushed  mineralized  material   is  reclaimed  from  the  bin  using  vibrating  fders  and  is  fed  to  the ee 6.71 m  diameter  x  2.44  m  long  (22  ft  x  8  ft)  semi-togenous  grinding  (SAG)  mill.  The  SAG  mill  is au equipped  with  a  1,343  kW  (1,800  hp)  motor  and  a  variable  speed  drive.  The  SAG  mill  operates  in closed circuit with a classifying screen and an 89 kW (120 hp) pebble crusher. The SAG mill grinding circuit is designed at an average throughput of 122.3 t/h to produce a minus 2 mm product.

Classifying  screen  undersize  flows  by  gravity  to  the  SAG  Mill  discharge  pumpbox  where  it  will  be pumped to the 6 m diameter leach prethickener. The thickener underflow with a  of P 80 approximately 1.1 mm is pumped to the hydrometallurgical plant while the thickener overflow will be recirculated to the SAG Mill.

The hydrochloric acid leach unit is designed to leach the majority of the impurities and the scandium present in the feed material to reduce  the size of subsequent  process  equipment.  The  mineral processing  plant  product  is  pumped  from  the  thickener  underflow  at  a  rate  of  122  t/h  (102  m¬≥/h  of slurry) and combined with 196 m¬≥/h of hydrochloric acid from the hydrochloric acid regeneration unit and  fed  to the hydrochloric  acid leach  circuit. The  hydrochloric  acid leach  circuit ains  three cont parallel trains of three agitated tanks in series. The leaching reaction occurs at 0¬∞C. The discharge 4 of the hydrochloric leach tanks is dewatered successively with centrifuges and belt filters. The

centrate  and  filtrate  (222  m¬≥/h)  are  sent  to  the  hydrochloric  acid  scandium  extraction  unit  ahead  of the hydrochloric acid regeneration unit, while the belt filter cake (36.5 t/h) is sent to the acid bake and water leach unit.

The  hydrochloric  acid  scandium  extraction  unit  is  three- stage  D2EHPA  solvent  extraction  circuit a followed  by  two  stripping  circuits  used  to  selectively  recover  thorium  and  scandium  from  the  leach solution. The hydrochloric acid leach solution is contacted with a D2EHPA organic solution in mixer -settler  extraction  units.  The  organic  solution  is  first  stripped  of  its  thorium  by  a  hydrochloric  acid solution  in  mixer -settler  stripping  units,  followed  by  stripping  of  its  scandium  by  a  sodium  carbonate solution  in  mixer -settler  stripping  units.  The  scandium  stripping  stage  also  conditions  the  organic solution before  it is recycled  to  the  extraction  step. The  scandium  solution  is  evaporated  to -rich precipitate scandium hydroxide which is then dried to scandium trioxide. The thorium and scandium free raffinate is sent to the hydrochloric acid regeneration unit, while the thorium strip solution is sent to tailings neutralization.

regenerate thickener

The hydrochloric acid regeneration unit uses sulfuric acid and sodium chloride to hydrochloric  acid  for  the  hydrochloric  acid  leach.  The  scandiumpleted  hydrochloric  acid  leach -de centrate and filtrate (222 m¬≥/h) are combined with sulfuric acid (21 m¬≥/h) and sodium chloride (8 t/h) in  the  agitated  low -temperature  acid  regeneration  (LTAR)  reactor  tank  where  hydrochloric  acid  and gypsum are formed. The resulting slurry is sent to the LTAR thickener. The LTAR underflow  is continuously filtered using a belt filter to remove  gypsum  from  the  circuit which is transferred  to  the  tailings  (74  t/h).  The  LTAR  thickener  overflow  is  heated  and  combined  with  hot sulfuric acid in the high-temperature acid regeneration (HTAR) reactor tank at 130¬∞C. Metal chlorides present in the solution react with sulfuric acid and form metal sulfates and hydrogen chloride which is vaporized  and  removed  from  the  solution  along  with  water.  The  vaporization  of  hydrogen  chloride and  water  causes  metal  sulfates  in  the  solution  to  precipitate.  The  hydrochloric  acid  gas  generated from the HTAR reactor tank is condensed and returned to the hydrochloric acid leach unit (196 m¬≥/h). The  HTAR   reactor tank discharge is  ransferred  to  a t centrifuge. The  cake, composed  of  metal sulfates,  is  sent  to  the  ferrous  sulfate  calcining  unit  (106.8  t/h),  while  the  centrate  is  sent  to  a  flash tank. The liquid pumped from the bottom of the flash tank is returned to the HTAR reactor tank The . vapor from the top of the flash tank is condensed and sent to the tailings neutralization unit, while the non-condensables are sent to the plant scrubbing system.

The acid bake and water leach units are used to convert all remaining metals to sulfates (acid bake) and solubilize all soluble sulfates (water leach) while separating  oluble nons impurities. The hydrochloric  acid  leach  cake  (36.5  t/h)  is  combined  with  29  m¬≥/h  of  pre-ted  (150¬∞C)  fresh  and hea recovered sulfuric  acid  and mixed  at  high  percent  solids  in  a  pair  of  pug  mills efore  being  fed  into , b the acid bake calciner. The acid bake calciner provides heat to perform the acid bake reaction on the pug mill discharge. The acid bake discharge (25 t/h) is continuously fed via a screw conveyor into the water leach tanks, where it is combined with 64 m¬≥/h of water. The water leach circuit is composed of a  series  of  agitated  tanks  discharging  to  centrifuges.  The  centrate  (79  m¬≥/h),  which  contains  the soluble sulfates, is sento the iron reduction and crystallization unit while the cake (12 t/h) discarded as tailings.

The iron reduction and crystallization unit is used to reduce iron (III) sulfate present in the solution to iron  (II)  sulfate  and  to  remove  a  portion  of  it  from  the  solution  by  cooling  and  crystallization.  In  the iron reduction and crystallization unit, the acidic water leach discharge (79 m¬≥/h) is reacted with iron chips and/or shavings in a series of four agitated tanks. The discharge of the iron reduction tanks (81

m¬≥/h) is sent to the crystallizer circuit where is it cooled, causing iron (II) sulfate to precipitate out of the  solution.  The  crystallizer  discharges  to  centrifuges,  where  the  centrate  (66  m¬≥/h)  is  sent  to  the scandium extraction unit, while the cake (24 t/h) is sent to the ferrous sulfate calcining unit.

The sulfate solution scandium extraction unit is composed of a stag three-D2EHPA solvent extraction circuit followed by a two stripping circuits used to selectively recover thorium scandium  from the sulfate solution. The reduced iron water leach solution is contacted with D2EHPA organic solution in mixer -settler extraction units. The organic solution is first stripped of its thorium  by  a  hydrochloric  acid  solution  in  mixer ettler  stripping units,  followed  by  stripping  of  its -s scandium  by  a  sodium  carbonate  solution  in  mixer ettler  stripping  units.  The  scandium  stripping -s stage also conditions the organic solution  before it  is  recycled  to  the  extraction  step.  The  scandium rich solution is evaporated to precipitate scandium hydroxide which is then dried to trioxide.  The  thorium  and  scandium -free  raffinate  is  sent  to  the  niobium  precipitation  unit,  while  the thorium strip solution is sent to tailings neutralization.

and

a

scandium

The niobium precipitation unit uses water dilution to selectively hydrolise niobium and precipitate it as niobium oxide. The scandium-depleted crystallization discharge (66 m¬≥/h) is diluted with boiling water and  flowed  through  a  series  of  agitated  tanks.  The  precipitation  reaction  temperature  is  maintained by  direct  steam  injection  in  the  agitated  tanks.  The  discharge  of  the  niobium  precipitation  tanks  is dewatered  using  centrifuges.  The  centrate  (243  m¬≥/h)  is  sent  to  the  titanium  precipitation  unit  while the  cake  (1.03  t/h)  is  sent  to  the  niobium  calciner.  The  calciner  operates  at  800¬∞C  and  is  used  to drive off any remaining sulfur and water. The calcined material (1.01 t/h) is fed via a screw conveyor into the caustic leach tank, where it is combined with a sodium hydroxide solution. The caustic leach dissolves  phosphorus  from  the  calcined  material,  bringing  the  phosphorus  concentration  down  to acceptable  levels.  The  caustic  leach  discharge  is  sent  to  a  filter  press.  The  filtrate  is  sent  to  the tailings  neutralization  unit,  while  the  filter  cake  (1.01  t/h)  is  sent  to  the  pyrometallurgical  plant  for further processing.

The  titanium  precipitation  unit  triggers  hydrolysis  and  precipitation  as  titanium  oxyhydroxide  using dilution and  heat.  The  centrate  from  the  niobium  precipitation  unit  (243  m¬≥/h)  is  diluted  with  boiling water.  Air may  also  be  contacted  if necessary  through  a  series of agitated tanks. The  reaction temperature  is maintained  by  direct steam  injection in the agitated tanks. The  discharge  of the titanium precipitation tanks is dewatered using centrifuges and belt filters. The filter cake on the belt filters is  washed  in a series of successive washing steps to ensure product purity. The centrate and filtrate (471  m/h)  are  sent  to  the  tailings  neutralization  unit  while  the  cake  (4.1  t/h)  is  sent  to  a 3 dryer/calciner. The material is dried and calcined using conditions which convert the titanium oxyhydroxide into a saleable titanium dioxide product (3.2 t/h).

combined

The tailings neutralization unit is fed by the centrate and filtrate from the titanium precipitation unit as well as other acidic tailings streams. The tailings neutralization feed (517 m¬≥/h) is successively  with  limestone  and  the  caustic  leach  tailings  in  a  series  of  agitated  tanks  in  order  to raise the pH to around 7.0. The discharge is successively dewatered with a thickener and belt filters . The filtrate is returned to the thickener, the filter cake is sent to the tailings facility, and the thickener overflow is recycled as process water or sent for water treatment.

The ferrous sulfate calcining unit  feeds  the  combined  crystallization  cake  with  the  acid  regeneration metal  sulfate  cake  to  a  calciner  to  convert  iron  and  magnesium  sulfates  to  oxides  while  forming  a

mixture  of  gaseous  sulfur  dioxide  and  sulfur  trioxide.  These  gases  re further  converted  to  sulfuric a acid.

The ferrous sulfate from the crystallizer  centrifuge  cake  (24  t/h)  is  combined  with  the  metal  sulfates from  the  HTAR  centrifuge  cake  (107  t/h)  and  fed  a  screw  conveyor  into  the  ferrous  sulfate via calciner. The calciner operates at a temperature of 1,000¬∞C to decompose iron sulfate magnesium sulfate into their respective oxides while producing sulfur dioxide and trioxide. The sulfur dioxide  and  trioxide  gases  are  sent  to  the  sulfuric  acid  plant  for  further  treatment,  while  the  metal oxides are sent to the tailings facility.

The  ferrous  sulfate  calcination  offgas  produced  at  a  rate  of  153,700  Nm /h  containing  10.5%  SO -3 2 gas is treated to reduce the sulfur dioxide emissions to the atmosphere. This process is achieved by oxidizing sulfur dioxide to sulfur trioxide, and converting it to sulfuric acid. The sulphur dioxide gas is cleaned  through  a  series  of  electrostatic  precipitation  and  scrubbing  steps.  The  clean  gas  is  then diluted  with  air  and  dried  in  a  drying  tower  prior  to  entering  the  contact  process.  These  steps  allow the acid plant to produce sulfuric acid of an acceptable quality, to protect downstream equipment and for reuse in  the  hydrometallurgical  plant.  The  circuit  up  to  this  point  isuction  fed,  feeding  into  two s single-stage centrifugal blowers which are used to compress the inlet gas to the contact process.

A  sulfur  burning  plant  operates  in  parallel  with  the  ferrous  sulfate  calcination  unit  to  allow  for  the production  of  3,030 t/d of  pure  sulfuric  acid  (100%  basis)  required  by  the  hydrometallurgical  plant. Molten sulfur is delivered by train, unloaded and stored in storage tanks. Molten sulfur is pumped to the  sulfur  furnace  where  it  is  converted  to  sulfur  dioxide.  The  furnace  offs,  at  a  temperature  of -ga about 950¬∞C to 1,000¬∞C is cooled through a  waste heat boiler producing high pressure steam used in the hydro plant. The cooled gas is sent to the contact section for the conversion of sulfur dioxide to sulfur trioxide.

The contact process consists of multiple catalyst bed conversion stages with inter stage gas-cooling -heat exchangers followed by two absorption stages. The conversion stages convert sulfur dioxide to sulfur trioxide, while the absorption stages capture the sulfur trioxide to produce concentrated sulfuric acid. Primary  conversion  is  obtained  in  the  first three catalyst beds.  The  sulfur  trioxide-as rich g formed  is  absorbed  in  the  intermediate  absorber  tower  with  sulfuric  acid.  The  first  sulfur  trioxide absorption  results in  a  higher  overall  conversion  rate  allowing  the  remaining  gas  to  convert  in  the final  catalyst  beds.  The  sulfur  trioxide  formed  in  the  last  conversion  stage  is  absorbed  in  the  final absorber.

A  tail  gas  scrubbing  system  after  the  absorber  towers  reduces  sulfur  dioxide  and  other  pollutants contained  in  the  acid  plant  exhaust  gas.  A  gas/liquid  contact  scrubber  tower  is  designed  to  reduce remaining pollutant concentrations to within environmental regulations by reacting the gases with an alkaline solution.

The acid plant is designed for an overall conversion rate of 99.7% and a product acid concentration of 96%. The tail gas scrubbing system further reduces the SO  in the gas to achieve low emissions 2 to the environment.

## 17.2.3 Mass Balance

balance

Based on the design criteria and the flowsheet, a mass and energy hydrometallurgical  processing  plant  has  been  developed.  The  mass  balance  was  prepared  for  an average feed of 2,700 t/d or 122.3 t/h with 92% plant availability at 0.80% Nb O5. The mass balance 2 for the plant was calculated to provide tonnages and flow rates to different sections and equipment in the plant. The mass balance was designed using the flowsheet integrator METSIM.

## 17.2.4 Process Equipment

Based  on  the  design  criteria  and  mass  balance  major  process  equipment  as  well  as  some  minor equipment has been sized. These pieces of equipment have been used to determine the capital and operating  costs  for  the  Project.  An  allowance  was  made  for  some  minor  equipment  and  facilities where it was required. The major equipment units are listed in Table 17.2.4.1.

be

The  hydrometallurgica l tailings will  go through the  tailings neutralization unit, where  they  will brought to a neutral pH of 7 using limestone and spent caustic leach sodium hydroxide prior to being thickened and filtered. The cake will be sent to the tailings facility, while the overflow produced will be sent to water treatment or recycled as process water.

## 17.2.8 Hydrometallurgical Plant Water Management

In order to assess water management in the hydrometallurgical plant, a water bal as ance w developed with plant requirements based on 2,700 t/d throughput and 92% availability. A net total of 101  m¬≥/d  of  treated  water  will  be  required  for  washing  of  the  filter  cakes  and  reagent  preparation. Treated  water  will  be  supplied  from  the  mine  dewatering  operation  and  water  treatment  plant.  The overflow of the tailings neutralization thickener will be pumped to the water treatment plant, where it will be treated and recycled as process water or discharged to the environment.

## 17.3.2 Flowsheet and Process Description

The  preliminary  pyrometallurgical  processing  plant  flowsheet  is  presented  in  Figure  17.3.2.1 he T proposed  process  is  based  on  alumino-ermic  reduction  of  niobium  pentoxide  (Nb 2O5)  in the  Nb th Concentrate which is a precipitate product supplied from the hydrometallurgical plant. Given the high grade of Nb in the Nb Concentrate (90% NbO5) with a very low phosphorous content, only a single 2 reduction furnace is required, to produce f erro-niobium alloy (FeNb). Smelting energy is provided by the  oxidation  of  aluminum,  with  additional  electrical  energy  supplied  to  the  submerged  arc  furnace (SAF), via a three electrode AC power input system.

Filtered Nb Concentrate is fed to a rotary dryer to drive off approximately 20% water concentrate.  The  rotary  dryer  is  fired  by  a  natural  gas  burner  and  operates  at  300¬∞C.  The  dried  Nb concentrate is pelletized in a disc (pan) pelletizer unit, to produce pellets with a d of approximately 80 6 mm.

in

The  dry  Nb  Concentrate  pellets  are  fed  by  conveyor  to  the  Furnace  Feed  Preparation  Area  (FPA), and stored in two closed bins, giving a total of 14 days storage time. Alumum powder, the primary in reductant,  with  hematite  Fe O3  powder  to  supply  iron  units  and  fluxes,  lime  (CaO)  and  fluorspar 2

the

for system,

(CaF2) are each  ored st separately in bins. even  flux S and additive bins provide storage aluminum,  hematite,  lime,  fluorspar,  furnace  dustsnd  FeNb  alloy  fines  recycle.  These  bins  are a loaded  by  crane,  manually  for  each  furnace  additive,  to  maintain  the  required  storage  capacity.  All bins are on load-lls, ce as part of the furnace feed preparation mass measurement automatically controlled via a PLC control system.

The  furnace  feed  preparation  is  performed  batch- ise  with  specified  mass  measurement  of  the  Nb w concentrate  pellets  with  the  required  aluminum,  hematite,  and  fluxes  to  satisfy  a  batch  'recipe'  for the production of on-spec FeNb alloy (65% Nb). Each batch is fed to a single mixer bin to feed to an Eirich Mixer for complete blending of the batch as a charge to the furnace.

Each charge is stored in one of two furnace charge bins, both on load cells. This allows tight control on continuous feed of the mixed charge into the furnace, to maintain furnace levels of slag and metal alloy.  Furnace  feeding  would  be  stopped  briefly  for  tapping  of  both  molten  slag  and  FeNb  alloy, according to levels of slag and metal in the furnace.

The tapping of slag and FeNb alloy is scheduled over two 12 hour shifts:

- 1. Slag: 3 taps x per 12 hour shift, 15 minute tapping duration. 4.46 t per tap.
- 2. FeNb alloy: 3 taps x per 12 hour shift, 10 minute tapping duration. 3.42 t per tap.

A  tapping  drill  and  clay  gun  unit  is  used  to  open  each  slag  and  metal  tap-le,  and  plug  each  tapho hole  with  clay  after the  tap  is complete.  A  molten  heel  or  pool  of  metal  is  left  remaining  in  the furnace, with some slag layer covering the metal. This is carried out according  o measured furnace t levels  with  the  slag  and  metal  masses,  providing  ongoing  control  and  continuous  operation  of  the furnace. The FeNb furnace is operated at 1,650¬∞C.

Electrical energy  is  supplied  to the furnace  to initiate or maintain  heat  input into rnace  to the fu complete the reduction of NbO5 and Fe2O3. Aluminum is the primary reductant and on oxidation to 2 Al2O3 forms a large part of the slag system with TiO2, fluxed with lime (CaO) and fluorspar (CaF2).

On tapping, the slag is granulated with water, using a granulator system. High volume flows of water, via jets impact  the  slag  continuously  as  the  slag  flows  into  a  sloped  launder  system.  The  rapid cooling  of  the  slag,  forms  slag  granules  at  about  2  to  15  mm  in  diameter.  Carried  by  the  stream  of water the slag granules pass over a screen to dewater and are transferred to a storage bunker area by conveyor belt. The slag is stored in a two concrete bunkers (one for loading, the other for transfer out,  alternating).  From  the  load  out  bunker  the  slag  is  removed  with  a  front   loader  (FEL)  for -end disposal in the tailing impoundment. Slag from either of the bunkers or from disposal areas, may be recycled back to the FeNb furnace to recover Nb units, when the slag Nb value is sufficient to cover the cost of such scavenger smelting.

The FeNb alloy metal is tapped via a short launder into a pre-eated ladle. After alloy metal tapping h is  complete  the  ladle  is  hoisted  by  overhead  crane  and  moved  to  the  casting  bay  area.  The  ladle  is tipped  using  the  crane's  second  hoist,  to  pour  the  molten  FeNb  alloy  (at  about  1,600 ,  into  cast o C) iron refractory lined casting molds. The cast alloy in molds is allowed to cool for up to 24 hours, and thereafter  the  mold  is  transferred  by  crane  to  a  casting  grizzly,  (square  slots  350   x  350 mm), mm onto which the solidified FeNb alloy is discharged from the mold. A mechanical alloy breaker is used to break up the alloy through the grizzly into a tote box below. These totes are transferred by crane / vehicle to the FeNb  Alloy  Crushing  and  Screening  plant, where  the  FeNb  alloy  is crushed  and

screened  into  specific  size  fractions,  as  required  for  sale  to  customers.  FeNb  alloy  fines  from  the Crushing and Screening plant, if un-saleable are recycled back to the FeNb Furnace.

Dusts from the FeNb Furnace Feed Preparation Area, are captured via ducting through a dry cyclone - bag-house  system.  All  dusts  from  this  area  are  returned  to  the  FeNb  Furnace  Feed  Preparation Area  and  placed  in  a  separate  bin.  As  required,  according  to  the  furnace  charge  mix  recipe,  these fines are bled back into the furnace charge for smelting.

The  FeNb  furnace  off -gas,  slag  and  alloy  tapping  fumes,  and  casting  fumes  above  each  mold  are captured and ducted to the furnace off -gas dust collection cyclones and baghouse. These dusts are recycled to dust bin in the FeNb Furnace Feed Preparation Area.

Both the Feed Preparation and Furnace dust collectors cleaned air exhausts are ducted respectively to their own exhaust stack. Each air exhaust  may duct  be monitored by sampling to  eet m environmental regulations.

## 17.3.3 Mass Balance

Based on the design criteria and the pyrometallurgical flowsheet, a mass balance model with energy requirements was  developed  for the pyrometallurgical processing plant. The  mass  balance  was prepared for an average feed rate of 22.3 t/d (dry basis) or 1.01 t/h at 90.3% Nb O5 (63.1% Nb) with 2 a  92%  overall  plant  availability.  The  mass  balance  for  the  pyrometallurgical  plant  was  calculated  to provide tonnages and flow rates to different sections and equipment in  lant. the  A p partition coefficient  method  was  used  to  define  the  split  of  elements  between  furnace  slag  and  FeNb  metal alloy. These  partition coefficients were  assumed  based  on  earlier  KPM  testwork,  slag  and  alloy chemistry, and supported by other FeNb alloy industry operations.

The major element partition coefficients defining the mass balances are tabled Table 17.3.3.1.  Other  element  distribution  coefficients  are  provided  in  the  Design  Criteria  back -up documents.

below

Table 17.3.3.1: FeNb Furnace Partition Coefficients

| Element   |   % to Slag |   % to Alloy Metal |

| Nb        |           3 |                 97 |
| Fe        |           1 |                 99 |

From  Table  17.3.3.1,  the  Nb  recovery  in  the  pyrometallurgicalrocess  plant  is  targeted  at  97%, p given  the  assumptions  made  in  the  Design  Criteria.  For  this  study,  it  is  assumed  that  all  dust  and metal fines with Nb units in fumes are collected and recycled to the FeNb Furnace. This includes Nb bearing dusts and fume from the Feed Preparation Area, FeNb Furnace off -gas, Tapping &amp; Casting, and FeNb Crushing and Screening areas.

The FeNb alloy production was calculated as 20.5 t/d or 7,490 t/y, with a target standard alloy grade of 65.0%Nb. (Mass balance value at 65.8% Nb).

The FeNb Furnace slag output was estimated at 26.7 t/d or 9,730 t/y, with an estimated Nb 2O5 grade of 3%. This slag may be recycled back to the FeNb Furnace, if economics permit.

## 17.3.4 Water Balance

The water requirements for the pyrometallurgical plant provide make up water to supply systems:

- 1. The  FeNb  Furnace  cooling  systems for furnace sidewalls, tapping blocks and  electrode clamps. This system is provided by the furnace package supplier, depending on the type and design of the furnace system. This water must be of a high purity, usually with a biocide and anti-scalant  added. Treated  potable  water  is  added  as  make- p  water,  due  to  losses  from u the cooling tower.
- 2. The FeNb Furnace Slag granulation system r fo slag granulation, based on the production rates and tapping schedule, discussed above, the make-p water requirement is u summarized below in Table 17.3.4.1.

Note  that  for  the  above  two  water  supply  systems,  there  will  be  a  first l  water  requirement  to  the -fil plant water storage tanks. These water volumes have not been estimated. It is important to note that only dry baghouse units have been used in place of a gas scrubber  - water quench system to clean the  furnace  off -gases  and  fumes.  The  potential  presence  of  radio- ctive  species  (compounds  with a uranium  and  thorium,  etc.)  in  the  concentrates  and  solids  which  would  contaminate  the  water,  has dictated this decision.

## 17.3.5 Power Requirement

For the Pyrometallurgical process plant, the total installed power is 2,500 kW (including the furnace), and at a 92% utilization, the installed  operating  power  requirement  is  2,300  kW, which  gives  a  total annual electrical energy consumption 20.15 MWh/y.

from

The power requirement was estimated based on scoping testwork and from calculations previous  FeNb  testwork  (XPS,  KPM, nd  Hazen).  Furnace  equipment  /  technology  vendors  also a confirmed the estimated power requirement for the FeNb ace, Furn as summarized below in Table 17.3.5.1.

The return air raise will have a fan system located underground near the vent hole as well as a bullet style emergency hoist system at the surface on the vent hole.

## 18.2  Tailings Storage Facility

potential

Preliminary  investigation  performed  by  SRK  included  a  comparison  of  potential  TSF  sites  for  both slurry and filtered (dry stack) tailings disposal options. The comparison considered engineering, strategic, permitting and closure issues:

tailings slurry

road

- ¬∑ Engineering: Containment area, required reclaim for negative water balance on impoundment, relative embankment  heights, distance to plant, pumping head for (plant to impoundment)  and  reclaim  water  (impoundment  to  plant),  upstream  stormwater management, major road crossings, potential residential impacts, and potential relocations;
- ¬∑ Strategic: Proximity to major roadways, churches and cemeteries, visual embankment heights, and property ownership;
- ¬∑ Permitting: Major drainage crossings and major road encroachment; and
- ¬∑ Closure: Closure cover areas and volumes, seepage potential, and mass stability.

Of eight  identified  sites,  Area  1  and  Area  7  were  considered  appropriate  for  further  evaluation.  This evaluation  included  development  and  implementation  of  a  preliminary  foundation  characterization plan  for  Area  1  and  Area  7,  as  well  as  development  of  a  preliminary  water  balance  spreadsheet  for both slurried and filtered tailings options for both sites.

In  addition,  further  delineation  of  Waters  of  the  US  (WOUS)  was  conducted  in  Areas  7  and  1  as described  in  Section  20.1.1.  For  the  PEA,  this  delineation  was  used  to  limit  the  footprints  of  the Area 7 and Area 1 TSFs.

The facility incorporates the following assumed parameters and preliminary design details.

- 1. Design has been performed using 1 m contoured topography.
- 2. Liner and closure cover requirements for Area 7 and Area 1 TSFs are based on dam safety, solid waste, water storage and radioactive licensing regulations as shown in Table 320.1.1.

- 3. The tailings material will be predominantly dry (i.e., not in a slurry consistency) incorporate two independent areas:
- a. An  area  for  'dry  stacking'  and  storage  of  tailings  solids  which  will  have  composite  liner consisting of a geo-synthetic liner overlying a compacted clay layer; and
- b. An  evaporation  pond  which  will  be  utilized  for  management  of  stormwater  runoff  and drainage from the tailings solids.  This  pond  will  be  lined  with  two yers  of  geosynthetic la liner  (primary  and  secondary),  sandwiching  a  permeable  spacer  that  allows  evacuation of all leakage through the primary liner to be collected in a sump and pumped back into the  TSF,  thereby  providing  a  means  of  long-rm  leakage  control  as  shown  on  Figure te 18.2.4. This approach is known as a Leakage Collection and Recovery System (LCRS).
- 4. The tailings production rate is an average of 4,930 dry t/d consisting of water leach residue, gypsum residue,  iron  oxide  (FeO3)  and  tailings  neutralization  residue.  Water  leach  residue 2 and the tailings neutralization residue will be filtered and are anticipated to be approximately 70:30 (solids:  liquid)  weight  ratio.  The  gypsum  residue  and  the  iron  oxide  are  products  of calcined processes and are thus dry. As the materials will be dried or filtered prior to storage in the TSF, an average dry density of 1.3 t/m  is assumed for the mass tailings. 3
- 5. It  is  currently  anticipated  that  the  tailings  materials  will  be  transported  via  conveyor  to  the TSF.  (Note:  Trucking  is  an  alternative  option  for  cost  trade- ff  in  the  feasibility  study.)  One o meter of growth media will be removed prior to construction of the TSF and will be stockpiled at the locations shown on Figure 18.2.1 for use during closure cover construction.
- 6. The base of the Area 7 facility will be around 346 masl and incorporate the following phased construction schedule and details (Table 18.2.1 and Figures 18.2.1, 18.2.3, and 18.2.4):
- a. Area  7  Phase  1- A  of  the  facility  consisting  of  tailings  solids  storage  (~  36  ha),  and  an evaporation pond (~ 25 ha). The tailings solids storage area will have a crest elevation of 364 masl with a maximum embankment height of approximately 12 m. The evaporation pond  will  have  a  crest  elevation  of  356 masl  with  a  maximum bankment  height  of em 15 m.  Area  7  Phase  1- A  will  be  constructed  for  containment  of  approximately  5.3  Mt  of tailings from Year 1 through Year 2.
- b. Area 7 Phase 1- B of the facility  consists  of  an  expansion  of  approximately  26  ha  to  the east of the Area 7 Phase 1 -A tailings solids storage portion of the facility. No expansion of the Area 7 Phase 1-A evaporation pond is planned as it will be sufficient for containing runoff  and  drainage  from  Area  7  Phase  1-and  Phase  1-.  The  Area  7  Phase  1A B B tailings solids storage  area  will have  a  crest  elevation  of  masl 364 with a maximum embankment  height  of  approximately  25  m.  Area  7  Phase  1-will  be  constructed  for B containment of an additional 4.6 Mt of tailings from Year 3 through Year 5.

Area

- c. Area  7  Phase  2  will  consist  of  a ownstream  embankment  raise  of  Area  7  Phase  1-, d A Area  7  Phase  1- B  and  the  Area  7  Phase  1-  evaporation  pond  for  storage  of  tailings A solids.  A  new  evaporation  pond  covering  approximately  20  ha  will  be  constructed  for Area  7  Phase  2  located  in  Area  1.  Area Phase  2  tailings  storage  will  have  a  crest 7 elevation of 376 masl with a maximum embankment height of approximately 39 m. Area 7  Phase  2 will  be  constructed  for  containment  of  an  additional  approximately  14  Mt  of tailings from Year 6 through Year 14. All  stormwater runoff and drainage will be pumped from a sump at the north toe of the Area 7 Phase 2 embankment  to the evaporation pond (Figure 18.2.1 and 18.2.2).
- d. The total capacity of the Area 7 facility is therefore 26.2 Mt.

and

- 7. The base of the Area 1 facility will be around 370 masl and incorporate the following phased construction schedule and details (Table 18.2.2 and Figures 18.2.2, 18.2.3, and 18.2.4):
- a. The Area 1 evaporation pond utilized for water management of Area 7 Phase 2 will also be used for water management for Area 1 Phase 1 and Phase 2.
- b. Area  1  Phase  1  of  the  facility  will  cover  approximately  87  ha  for  tailings  solids  storage. The tailings solids storage area will have a crest elevation of 392  asl with a maximum m embankment  height  of  approximately  27  m.  Area  1  Phase  1  will be  constructed containment of approximately 16.1 Mt of tailings from Year 15 through Year 23.
- c. Area 1 Phase 2 will consist of a vertical expansion via downstream embankment raise of Area 1 Phase 1. It will have a crest elevation of 406 masl with a maximum embankment height of approximately 41 m. Area 1 Phase 2  will be constructed for containment of an additional approximately 13.5 Mt of tailings from Year 24 through Year 30.
- d. The total capacity of the Area 1 facility is therefore 29.6 Mt for a total storage (i.e., Area 1 plus Area 7) of 55.9 Mt.
- 8. Foundation  preparation  for  all  evaporation  pond  embankments,  TSF  starter  embankments and  embankment  raises  will  incorporate  removal  of  1.5  m  of  native  soils,  re- pacted  in com layers to form a non-settling structure as shown on Figure 18.2.3 and 18.2.4.
- 9. All  TSF  and  evaporation  pond  embankments  will  be  constructed  using  soil  borrowed  from within the respective TSF basins, and compacted in layers to form a non-settling structure as shown on Figures 18.2.3 and 18.2.4.

tailings of

- 10. All tailings embankment raises will incorporate the 'downstream' method of embankment construction, which requires progressive downstream relocation embankment crest with phased increases in embankment height as shown on Figure 18.2.3. This  results  in  new  raise  construction  being  performed  on  original  ground  and  not  on  top  of tailings  solids.  This  in  turn  allows  independent  extension  of  the  TSF  liner  and  embankment drainage  elements,  and  prevents  the  facilityfrom  being  affected  by  potential  liquefaction  of the tailings solids under seismic loads.

the

- 11. All  TSF  embankment  sections  will  incorporate  a  20  m  crest  width  and  2  (horizontal)  to  1 (vertical) side slopes as shown in Figure 18.2.3. Sod will be placed on the d ownstream faces of all Phase 1 embankments as an interim erosion control measure, and then removed prior to  vertical  Phase  2  expansions.  The  sod  will  then  be  placed  on  all  Phase  2  downstream embankment slopes and will remain in place as a reclamation measure.
- 12. The components of the facility liner system as described below and shown in Figures 18.2.3 and 18.2.4:
- a. Foundation preparation to a depth of one meter incorporating TSF and evaporation pond base  grading,  and  compaction  of  the  sub- ner  surface  in  layers  to  form  a  non- ttling li se structure.
- b. The evaporation pond facilities will incorporate an mil 80-h igh-density polyethylene (HDPE) primary  liner  over  a  60- mil  HDPE  secondary  liner  with  a  geonet  drainage  layer between  the  two  liners.  The  geonet  drainage  layer  will  drain  to  either  of  two  Area  7 evaporation pond sumps or of two Area 1 evaporation pond sumps). The LCRS sumps are geotextile-wrapped, gravel-filled facilities between the primary and secondary liners , with a riser pipe (perforated within the grav el) for leakage collection and removal. Within the sump areas, the soil beneath the secondary liner will be amended and compacted  to create a low permeability soil layer beneath each sump area.

for

- c. The  TSF  solids  storage  area  base  will  incorporate  an  80- il  high-density  polyethylene m (HDPE)  primary  liner  over  the  compacted  foundation,  except  for  a  portion  of  Area  7, Phase 2, which will be constructed using a pre-xisting double-lined system in the Area e 7 Phase 1-A evaporation pond.
- d. The upstream face of the compacted embankment will incorporate a drained -permeability  compacted  clay  core  (with  bentonite  amendment  as  necessary  to  achieve low permeability requirements), that is raised in a downstream configuration according to the phased  construction. This will prevent potential ice damage  to  any liner on upstream face of the embankment. To provide drainage on the upstream side of the lowpermeability core, a continuous 'perimeter drain' will be constructed embankment profile, which will  include independent sumps to allow consistent  pumping of collected water, thereby preventing leakage though the upstream face embankment.  This  drained,  low -permeability  core  will  tie  into  the  above- er  drainage lin system described in Item 13.

- e. A 500 mm thick above-liner, fine-sand drainage system, incorporating slotted pipes at 30 m centers, will be constructed above the lined base of the facility as shown Figure 18.2.3. The above iner -l drainage system will assist in reducing entrained moisture in the tailings via gravity drainage or pumped removal to the evaporation pond for  each  phase.  This  will  minimize  head  on  the  TSF  liner  during  its  operational  life,  and provide  a  way  to  accelerate  facility  dewatering  (primarily  related  to  precipitation)  and increase tailings consolidation during operations and closure.

Operational  management  of  tailings  material and  supernatant  water  is  addressed  under ections S 17.1.7 and 17.2.7 and summarized below:

- 1. Tailings solids will be conveyed from the process plant to the planned deposition locations at the TSF. From these locations, the tailings will be placed by an equipment fleet consisting of 2 self-loading scrapers, a grader, a dozer and a water truck.
- 2. At  Area  7,  deposition  will  be  managed  from  the  southern  embankments  and  the  tailings  will be graded to drain supernatant water towards a decant system on the northern embankment and thence to Area 7 Phase 1 evaporation pond or the Area 7 Phase 2 collection sump for pumping to Area 1 evaporation pond.
- 3. At  Area  1,  deposition  will  be  managed  from  the  western  embankment  and  tailings  will  be graded to drain supernatant water towards a decent system on the eastern embankment and thence to the Area 1 evaporation pond.
- 4. Water  collected  in  the  above- iner  drainage  system  will  also  be  managed  in  the  respective l evaporation pond.
- 5. From the Area 7 and Area 1 evaporation ponds water will either pumping directly back to the plant (direct reclaim water), or to a water treatment facility (treated reclaim water).

The closure of the TSFs includes the following anticipated actions:

- 1. Removal of residual supernatant water from the Area 1 evaporation pond via pumping to the water  treatment  plant,  followed  by  treatment  and  discharge  to  the  stormwater  management system, and thence to creeks.
- 2. On-going drainage or pumping of water from Area 7 and Area 1  liner above-rainage d systems to remove entrained water and increase consolidation of the tailings mass.
- 3. Removal of all tailings deposition conveyors and water reclaim piping and pumps.

- 4. Placement of an engineered cover system on the TSF surface consisting of:
- a. An average of 500 mm of compacted underliner using borrow from Area 1;
- b. An 80-mil HDPE geomembrane liner;
- c. An overliner drain system including drainage piping, drain rock, and geotextile; and
- d. An average of 1 m growth media.
- 5. Scarification and vegetation of the final cover surface.

## 18.3  Active Mine Dewatering and Pipeline System

Active  dewatering  from  the  surface  will  be  utilized  in  advance  of  development  of  the  mine  and  will continue to be utilized throughout  the mine  life.e Th active dewatering  system  will consist of a network  of  approximately  12  perimeter  wells,  equally  spaced  around  the  deposit.  The  wells  will  be drilled to a depth of 50 to 75 m below the next active mine block. The wells will be a minimum of 12 to  18  inches  in  diameter  and  will  be  capable  of  pumping  approximately  65  L/sec  (1,000  gpm)  each. The  first  round  of  wells  must  be  installed  and  operational  prior  to  'year  zero'  of  mine  production; therefore installation of those wells will begin two years  prior to underground mining. A second round of 12 deeper replacement wells will be drilled to the bottom of the next planned mine block beginning in year 8 of mining to allow dewatering of the second mine block.

of

Each well will be equipped with a nominal 9.5 inch diameter, 820 kW (1,100 HP), submer sible pump. Water from each well will be piped to a collection pond constructed as Phase 1 Evaporation  Pond (Figure  18.2.2).  The  water  will  then  be  pumped  via  a ine  dewatering  discharge m pipeline to the Missouri River. The total maximum anticipated input to the collection pond will be 725 L/sec, anticipated to occur during the first year of mine production (Year 1).

Area

The  collection  pond  will  cover  approximately  9  ha  with  a  crest  elevation  of  379 l  and  a  base mas elevation of 369 masl. The maximum embankment height will be approximately 13 m. Assuming 2 m of dry freeboard, the pond has a capacity of approximately 520,000 m . The pond will provide 7 days 3 of emergency storage at the maximum dewatering rate plus the 100 year, 24 hour storm.

The mine dewatering  discharge  pipeline  has  been  designed  to  a  maximum  flow  of  2,270 m h.  The 3 / discharge  pipe  would  be  50  km  long  and  would  require  a  24  inch  steel  pipe  that  would  discharge through  a  diffuser  at  the  Missouri  River.  It  has  been  assumed  that  the  pipeline uld  be  buried  to wo protect against freezing. A pump station would be located at the pond. All pumps could be installed at the pond pump station or at a booster station installed along the pipeline.

## 19 Market Studies and Contracts

SRK has reviewed public market analysis and commissioned studies performed for this Project and confirms the price assumptions for niobium, titanium dioxide and scandium oxide are reasonable and appropriate for use in the PEA.

## 19.1  Commodity

## 19.1.1 Niobium

Niobium  is  used  in  alloys  including  high  strength  low  alloy  steel  and  improves  strength  at  lower temperatures.  Alloys  containing  niobium  are  used  in  oil  and  gas  pipelines,  beams  and  girders  for buildings and jet engines. Niobium also exhibits superconducting properties and is used superconducting  magnets.  The  USGS  publication Mineral  Commodity  Summaries  2015 states  that niobium is consumed mostly in the form of ferroniobium by the steel  industry and as niobium alloys and  metal  by  the  aerospace  industry. pparent  US  domestic consumption  measured  in  contained A niobium is estimate at 10,000 t in 2014 which was a 23% increase from 2013.

## 19.1.2 Titanium Dioxide

USGS  publication Mineral  Commodity  Summaries2015 , lists  the  highest  consumption  of  titanium dioxide  in  paints  (62%),  plastic  (24%),  paper  (11%)  and  other  uses  (3%)  which  included  catalysts, ceramics,  coated  fabrics  and  textiles,  floor  coverings,  printing  ink  and  roofing  materials.  Domestic consumption  was  estimated  to  have  increased  by  5%  in  2014  in  part  due  to increase  use  of the titanium dioxide containing products in the housing industry.

## 19.1.3 Scandium Oxide

USGS publication Mineral Commodity Summaries 2015 lists  principal  uses for scandium in 2014  as solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) and aluminum ndium -sca alloys. Other uses include ceramics, electronics,  lasers  and  lighting.Global  supply  and  consumption  of  scandium  was  estimated  to  be between 10 and 15 t/y. Two characteristics of scandium oxide,  hich have the potential to increase w the  demand  within  the  scandium  m rket,  include  the  oxide's  ability  to  act  as  a  highly  efficient  ion a channel at lower temperatures in solid oxide fuel cells and the ability of the metal to serve as a highly effective grain refiner when alloyed with many metals such as aluminum.

Current  technology  employed  in  the  manufacturing  of  solid  oxide  fuel  cells  uses  materials,  which operate at temperatures up to or exceed 1,000 C. Competing technologies now in use show that the o use of scandium oxides in the fuel cell have higher conductivity at reduced operating temperatures, which in turn can extend the life of fuel cells.

strength,

Benefit  of  scandium -aluminum  alloys  used  in  the  aerospace  industry  have  been  known  since  the 1970's. Russian military aircraft used scandium-aluminum alloys for strength and reduction of weight. Currently, Airbus Group has advertised the potential uses of scandium magnesium-aluminum alloys -in aerospace, transportation, defense and leisure products due to its high specific functionality  and  high  corrosion  resistance.  The  alloys  also  exhibit  excellent  weldability  and  good joint strength.

## 19.2  Market Price Projection

The payable products recovered through processing at the Elk Creek project site  will be in the final salable form which includes ferroniobium, titanium dioxide and scandium oxide. Metallurgical testing to date indicates that all three products can be produced within acceptable market specifications.

Pricing  was  established  using  current  data  found  in  the  public  domain,  confidential  studies  and  inhouse knowledge. Commodity prices used in the calculation of financial US$39 to US$44/kg Nb for ferroniobium containing 65% niobium, US$2.10/kg 2  for TiO titanium dioxide, and US$3,000 to US$4,000/kg Sc2O3 for scandium oxide.

results

Pricing for ferroniobium was estimated using reputable market study data provided by Roskill which ranged  from  an  average  market  price  of  US$39/kg  Nb  in  2015  to  a  2020  forecast  of  US$44/kg  Nb. The  approach  used  in  the  PEA  set  the  niobium  price  at  US$39/kg  for  the  first  year  of  production, increased to US$44/kg in the fourth year and through LoM.

Pricing for titanium dioxide was estimated based on a lower quality product and inhouse knowledge -of the titanium market. Potential upgrade to the quality of the titanium dioxide produced to a pigment grade product could have a positive impact on market price. For the PEA, SRK used a conservative estimate of US$2.10/kg for the financial analysis.

Pricing  for  scandium  oxide  was  estimated  using  a  reputable  market  study  entitled  'Scandium: A Market  Assessment' developed  by  OnG  Commodities  LLC  during  the  preparation  of  the  PEAnd ,.a authored by Dr. Andrew Matheson.  Dr. Matheson has extensive experience in specialty metals and consulted to global firms in the metals, materials and energy industries.

The  base  case  pricing  used  for  the  economic  analysis  used  a  ranged  ice  for  scandium  oxide  of pr US$3,000/kg Sc O 2 3 to US$4,000/kg Sc 3 2 O . It is estimated that the current price US$3,500/kg Sc2O3  will decline slightly over the first three to four years of production US$3,000/kg Sc2O3  as  an increased reliable supply of scandium  oxide become available.  The s market price projection is then estimated  to increase to US$4,000/kg Sc 2O3 and remain at that level for  the  LoM  due  to  an  anticipated  increase  in  demand  for  the  commodity  in  both  the  SOFC  market and  the aerospace  industry. Understanding  that  these  are forecasts in a currently undeveloped market,  the  sensitivity  to  the  scandium  oxide  pricing as  examined  by   a  second  price  projection w which  reflected  a  slower  ramp- up  of  consumption  in  the  aerospace  industry.  This  projection  started with a price of US$3,500/kg Sc2O3 in the first year and ramping down to US$2,000/kg Sc2O3 by 2021 before ramping back to US$3,500/kg Sc2O3 in year 2023 and remaining at that level for the LoM.

Figure  19.2.1  shows  the  market  pricing rojection for  both  the  base  case  and  the  slow  aerospace p growth  scenarios.  The  chart  reflects  the  initial  drop  in  price  as pply  increases  and  the  market su becomes  established,  with  a  price  recovery  based  on  increased  demand  as  industry  nsumption co accelerates before it stabilizes.

Perhaps  the  most  critical  of  the  required  permits  and/or  authorizations  for  Elk  Creek  will  be  the approvals  to  construct  the  mine,  plant  and  tailings  disposal  facilities,  as  they  cover  considerable area, and cross various water features that fall under jurisdiction the of the state and federal governments.  The  facilities  for  the  operation  have  been  designed  to  avoid  jurisdictional  features  as much  as  possible.  A  wetlands  delineation  survey  was  conducted  by  sson  Associates   (October Ol 2014) to define the nature and extent of potential jurisdictional features which could trigger the need for  such  permitting.  Wetlands  were  identified  in  agricultural  fields,  pastures,  roadside  ditches  and abutting  stream  channels.  The  total  acreage  of  wetlands  in  the  Project  area approximately  10.6 is acres.  Nine  unnamed  streams  were  also  found  during  the  site  investigation  for  a  total  length  of approximately 13,726 ft. At the time of this report, all wetlands and waters in the Project study area are assumed to be jurisdictional unless declared otherwise by the USACE. A site visit was conducted by the USACE on April 7, 2015 in order to inspect the site and assess the recommendations made by Olsson (2014) with  respect  to  inclusion  or  exclusion  of  various  features in the final determination. NioCorp and Olsson are currently working with the agency to make a final determination, which will be followed by the preparation and submission of a formal application.

Section 404 of the federal Clean Water Act (CWA) establishes a program to regulate the discharge of dredged  or  fill material into waters  of  the  . U.S (WOUS) ,  including wetlands   and jurisdictional drainages/waterways. Activities in WOUS regulated  under this program include fill for development, water  resource  projects  (such  as  dams  and  levees),  infrastructure  development  (such  as  highways and airports)  and  mining  projects.  Section  404  requires  a  permit  before  dredged  or  fill  material  may be discharged into WOUS.

Proposed  activities  are  regulated  through  a  permit  review  process.  An  individual  permit  is  required for potentially significant impacts. Individual permits are reviewed by the  USACE. However, for most discharges  that  will  have  only  minimal  adverse  effects,  a  general  permit  may  be  suitable.  General permits are issued on a nationwide, regional, or state basis for particular categories of activities. The general permit process eliminates individual review and allows certain activities to proceed with little or no delay, provided that the general or specific conditions for the general permit are met.

As  part  of  the  PEA,  NioCorp  has  directed  the  engineering  partners  on  the  project  to  avoid  both floodplains and any potentially jurisdictional water features during the design process.  The mine and surface  plant  completely  avoid  these  features,  while  the  preferred  tailings  impoundment(s)  impact just three  small  areas  of  potentially  jurisdictional wetlands.  This  design  approach  is  viewed  very favorably by the USACE,  as  most  agricultural  entities tend to completely ignore USACE  permit requirements.

## National Environmental Policy Act Review

Within  this  permitting  process,  the  need  for  environmental  impact  analysis  is  typically  required.  The National  Environmental  Policy  Act  (NEPA)  requires  federal  agencies  to  consider e  environmental th effects of, and any alternatives to, their proposed actions. A USACE  action that involves placement  of  fill  material  into  a  WOUS  and  issuance  of  an  Individual  Permit  (IP),  the  USACE  must determine compliance with the CWA and NEPA prior to issuance of the permit.

the

The NEPA process generally involves one of two levels of analysis:

- ¬∑ Preparation  of  an Environmental  Assessment  (EA)  and Finding of No  Significant Impact (FONSI); or
- ¬∑ Preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS).

It  is  i mportant  to  remember  that  both  EAs  and  EISs  are  public  disclosure  documents,  not  permit  or approval  documents.  They  are  intended  to  disclose  what,  if  any,  environmental  impacts  may  occur from  the Project and  guide  the  decisions  of  federal  agencies.  The  primary  difference  between  the two  types  of  documents  is  that  an  EA  is  prepared  when  no  significant  impacts  are  expected  or  the potential  impacts  are  unknown,  and  an  EIS  acknowledges  that  there  is  a  potential  for  significant impacts,  and  analyzes  and  discloses  what  those  potential  impacts  are.ignificance  is  determined S based on a variety of factors such as compliance with state, federal, and local regulation regulations, USACE, EPA and USFWS policies and guidelines, and other site specific concerns such removing water sites or critical habitat.

## Compensatory Mitigation

Both NEPA processes are likely to result in the development of compensatory mitigation for the loss of wetlands and other jurisdictional features. Compensatory mitigation can occur through four methods:  aquatic  resource  restoration,  establishment,  enhancement,  or  in  certain  circumstances, preservation. There are three mechanisms for achieving the four methods of compensatory mitigation  (listed  in  order  of  preference  as  established  by  the  regulations):  mitigation  banks,  inlieu fee programs, and permittee- sponsible r mitigation. The Omaha USACE is likely to require permittee-responsible mitigation at a ratio of 2:1. NioCorp will be required to perform the mitigation at the site of the permitted impacts, or at an off-site location within the same watershed.

## USACE Permit Timing

the

NioCorp  has  initiated  mitigation  discussions  with  the  USACE  and  commenced  preparation  of  the formal permit application. The  time  to review and  evaluate  the actual 404  Permit  cation appli is typically  overshadowed  by  the  NEPA  review  of  the  Project  impacts.  The  time  to  complete  an  EA (generally accepted at approximately 12 months) is usually less than an EIS (3 to 5 years), as there are no statutory time frames and fewer bureaucr procedures atic involved. Both include public scoping and public review processes. NioCorp's current understanding is that the simpler EA is likely the route to be taken by the USACE with respect to Elk Creek given the limited impacts anticipated to  wetlands  and  riparian  resources.  Inclusion  of  the  dewatering  water  pipeline  and  discharge  to  the Missouri River is pending a delineation along the pipeline corridor before discussions with USACE are initiated on this item. Several other dewatering water management options are also still under consideration and evaluation as part of the overall project feasibility study.

## 20.1.2 DHHS Radioactive Materials Program and Licensing

The Elk Creek resource and thus the residual post -processing tailings, will contain trace amounts of uranium and thorium, which are Naturally Occurring Radioactive Materials (NORM). At issue will be the  ultimate  classification  of  the  tailings  because  of  these  constituents.  Preliminary  discussions  with the  State  of  Nebraska  have  indicated  that  a  Broad  Scope  Radioactive  Materials  License,  issued under  180  NAC  3- 013  by  the  Nebraska  Department  of  Health  and  Human  Services  (DHHS),  may likely be necessary.

As defined by the Nebraska Radiation Control Act, radioactive material means any material, whether solid, liquid, or gas, which emits ionizing radiation spontaneously. Radioactive material includes, but is not limited to, acceleratorroduced  material, by-product  material,  naturally -p occurring  material, source material, and special nuclear material. The classification of radioactive material appears to be irrespective of any concentration   it -merely has to emit ionizing radiation.   material The for processing, waste rock, and tailings are likely to be seen as naturally occurring material, therefore, classified as a radioactive material.

and

The DHHS retains the right to require registration or licensing of [any] radioactive material in order to maintain  compatibility  and  equivalency  with  the  standards  and  regulatory  programs  of  the  federal government  or  to  protect  the  occupational  and  public  health  and  safety  and  the  environment  [NRS 71-3507(2)]. At the same time, the DHHS can exempt certain sources of radiation or kinds of uses or users  from  licensing  or  registration  requirements  when  the  department  finds that  the  exemption  will not  constitute  a  significant  risk  to  occupational  and  public  health  and  safety  and  the  environment [NRS 71 -3507(4)].  At a minimum, the Broad Scope License will require the development an d implementation  of  a  formal  Radiation  Safety program  for  the  facility,  including  environmental  and personnel  monitoring  programs,  appropriate  warning  signage  be  displayed  around  the  site,  and  a final  permanent  closure  cover  for  the  tailings  disposal  facility  be  engineered  and  constructed.  The final closure of the tailings will also require coordination with the Solid Waste Branch of the  Nebraska Department of Environmental Quality (NDEQ).

In  the likely event  that  the  Elk  Creek  facility  is  regulated  in  this  way   some  land  restrictions  may be , invoked at the time of mine closure. While these requirements appear to be directed at uranium mills and commercial radioactive waste disposal facilities, and not necessarily mine tailings  for operations containing NORM, the law makes no clear distinction between the facility types. As such, the State of Nebraska could apply them under either scenario, which could even include the possibility deeding the land to the State of Nebraska following closure.

Irrespective  of  ultimate  classification, the  tailings (and  t ir he disposal  facility) will require  inancial f assurance  for  reclamation  and  closure.  Again,  these  rules  appear  to  be  directed  at  uranium  mill tailings and  low -level radioactive  waste  facilities,  but  are  on-specific  enough  that  they  could  be n applied  to  other  situations  where  radioactive  materials  are  being ctively managed. In  addition  to  a a direct reclamation financial assurance, it is probable that the state will require a funding mechanism (e.g., trust fund, escrow, etc.) for monitoring and maintenance of the facility in the longer term as part of a Broad Scope License.

## DHHS License Timing

NioCorp estimates that a  Broad Scope  License for Elk Creek will take 6 to 9 months to  obtain, and will involve several months of discussions and negotiations related ineering, to eng design, monitoring, and terms and conditions.

## 20.1.3 Nebraska NPDES Permitting Program

dewatering preferred

to the

projected

The current Project water balance suggests that excess water from underground operations will need to be managed for discharge to the environment. The current alternative will be to discharge dewatered groundwater via pipeline and diffuser directly Missouri River, approximately 56 km to the east of the project site. The Missouri River is believed to be  the only regional water body  of sufficient quantity (flow) and  quality to accept  the of

volume of water from the mine with minimal treatment, and still meet applicable discharge standards. Various  rights -of-way  and  easements  will  also  need  to  be  negotiated  with  Johnson  and  Nemaha counties  and  private  landowners.  In  addition,  the  location  and  design  of  the  in- eam  diffuser  and str impacts  to  any  jurisdictional  areas  along  the  proposed  pipeline  corridor,  will  need  to  be  addressed through the USACE.

In  the  State  of  Nebraska,  all  persons  discharging  or  proposing  to  discharge  pollutants  from  a  point source  into  any  waters  of  the  state  are  required  to  apply  for,  and  have  a  permit  under  the  National Pollutant Discharge  Elimination System  (NPDES)  to  discharge,  including  all significant industria l users discharging to a publicly owned  treatment works (POTW).  The NDEQ  is responsible developing  and issuing  NPDES permits, and for insuring that  permitted facilities  comply  with  permit requirements.

for

Alternatively,  NioCorp  may  still  elect  to  treat  the  mine  dewatering  water  to  meet  local  discharge requirements and re- ject in the treatment plant reject water back underground through Underground Injection Control permit, administered through the  ter Wa Division of the NDEP. Additional studies for the viability of this option are pending. Other alternatives for management at the site, which may or may not prove feasible in the long run, include:

- ¬∑ Direct discharge to surface waters;
- ¬∑ Direct deep well injection;
- ¬∑ RO treatment with surface discharge of permeate and crystallization of reject water;
- ¬∑ RO treatment with surface discharge of permeate and force freezing of the reject water;
- ¬∑ RO treatment with surface discharge of permeate and on-site storage of reject water; and
- ¬∑ RO treatment with surface discharge of permeate and deep well injection of reject water.

Most of these alternatives are not likely to be cost effective, but are still under consideration.

## NPDES Permit Timing

Regulations require an individual, site- specific NPDES permit application be submitted to the NDEQ at least 180 days (six months) prior to the date of first discharge. This is predicated administratively  and  technically  complete  and  accurate  permit  application.  If  changes  are  made  or additional  information  is  submitted  or  is  required  by  the  agency,  the  180  ay period  may  start  over. d NPDES permits are public noticed for 30 days before being issued. If comments are received and a hearing is required, the NDEQ would schedule a hearing and respond to any comments received at the hearing. This may require an additional 60 to 90 days.

## 20.1.4 Nebraska Air Quality Permitting

The Nebraska air regulations are primarily based on regulations developed  U.S. by Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to address the Clean Air Act (CAA) requirements. Air quality permits are the primary tool used by the NDEQ to implement the CAA. For businesses that intend to operate unit sources that emit regulated pollutants that will exceed Nebraska air quality thresholds, a construction permit will be required.

the

(PSD)

There  are  two  types  of  construction  permits:  state construction permits  and  federal  construction permits, known  as New  Source  Review  (NSR)  or Prevention of Significant Deterioration permits.  The  type  of  construction  permit  that  is  needed  will  depend  on  the  uantity  of  air  pollutants q that potentially could be released from the new plant or expansion project.

an water

an

Because the project includes a primary sulfuric acid plant [a regulated facility under   40 ¬ß52.21(b) which anticipates emissions in excess of the regulatory thresholds], and since Nebraska is currently classified as in ' attainment' of all ambient air quality standards, a federal PSD construction permit will be required, The entire permit process is expected to take at least 190 days, provided that there  are  no  significant  technical  issues  or  problems  in  obtaining  information,  and  the  facility  has submitted  a  complete  application  (including  detailed  air  dispersion  odeling).  Typically,  however, m PSD permits require over one year in order to complete.

CFR

grading

The PSD permitting process includes both public and EPA review and comment periods. Part of the EPA review  of  the  application  includes  additional  scoping  through  issuance  of  a  PSD  Public  Notice Package to other federal agencies and land managers, local officials, affected states and others, as necessary. This can lengthen the permit timeline. However, opportunities exist within the program to authorize certain early construction activities (typically limited to ground clearing and activities) prior to permit issuance. The nature and extent of these variances must be negotiated and applied for with the NDEQ.

In addition to the construction permit, the NDEQ also issues operating permits based on a source's level  of  emissions.  There  are  two  types  of  operating  permits:  major  source  (federal  program)  and minor source (state program). As before, the potential to emit associated with the sulfuric acid plant will  necessitate  the  issuance  of  a  major  source  permit  for  the  operation.  The  federal  major  source program (a.k.a., Class I or Title V) regulates larger sources of air pollution. A Class I source has the potential-to-emit (PTE) quantities greater than:

- ¬∑ 100 t/y of any criteria air pollutant, excluding lead;
- ¬∑ 10 t/y of any single hazardous air pollutant (HAP) or 25 t/y of a combination of HAPs; or
- ¬∑ 5 t/y of lead.

The operating permit incorporates all of a source's requirements into one permit, including construction  permit  limitations  and  federal  regulations.  Operating  permits  usually  require  additional monitoring,  stack  testing,  reporting,  and  recordkeeping.  However,  the  application  for  the  operating permit need only be submitted within 12 months after the emissions unit(s) begin operation,  or within 12 months of becoming subject to the operating permit requirements, whichever is earlier.

## 20.1.5 Nebraska Dam Permitting

The Department of Natural Resources R) (DN regulates the construction, operation, maintenance of dams in Nebraska to protect life and property from dam failures.  The DNR regulates all dams in the state that:

and

- ¬∑ Have  a  total  height  of  25  ft  or  more  and  an  impounding  capacity  at  the  top  of  dam  that  is greater than 15 acre-ft;
- ¬∑ Have an impounding capacity at the top of dam of 50 acre- t or more and a total height that f is greater than 6 ft; or
- ¬∑ Are located in a high hazard potential location.

As promulgated in Chapter 46, Article 16  - Safety of Dams and Reservoirs, approval of applications shall be issued within 90 days after receipt of the 'completed' application plus any extensions of time required  to  resolve  matters  diligently  pursued  by  the  applicant.  At  the  discretion  of  the  DNR,  one  or more  public  hearings  may  be  held  on  an  application  (46-54).  This  will,  of  course,  add  additional 16

time  to  the  overall  permitting  process  for  both  the  proposed  tailings  disposal  facility  and  treatment plant reject water storage pond.

## 20.1.6 Greenhouse Gas Permitting

The  NDEQ defines  Greenhouse  Gases  (GHG)  as  chemical  compounds  that,  when  emitted  into  the atmosphere,  have  the  potential  to  cause  climate  change.  There  are  currently  73  GHG  chemicals identified  in  40  CFR  ¬ß 98  Table  A -1  to  Subpart  A,  which  include,  but  are  not  limited  to:  COCH , 2 , 4 N2O, and Fluorinated GHGs  (SF6, PFCs, HFCs). Recent rulemaking by the EPA  incorporates changes impacting the regulation of GHGs and establishes emission thresholds for GHG emissions, while  provides  the  State  of  Nebraska  (among  others)  the  authority  to  issue  PSD  permits  governing GHGs.

Because  not  all  GHGs  remain  in  the  atmosphere  for  the  same  amount  of  time  or  have  the  same potential  effect  in the  atmosphere,  a  system  of  equivalents  (using  CO  as  a  baseline  or  CO )  was 2 2 e developed  to  account  for  the  variation  between  compounds.  For  New  Sources,  the  PSD  permitting threshold is: 100,000 t/y CO2 e (as of July 1, 2011). Preliminary calculations for the Elk Creek Project suggest that the operation will be above this threshold.

To  date,  the  EPA  has  not  implemented  a  minor  source  program  for  GHGs,  and  Nebraska  has  not chosen  to  implement  a  minor  source  program  either.  At  this  time  no  fees  will  be  collected,  but  all sources will be required to report GHG emissions.

## 20.2  Engineering Design Criteria

The  State of Nebraska  does  not  have  regulatory environmental protection requirements for the design and operation of hardrock mines, especially underground hardrock mines with chemical beneficiation circuits. As such, ioCorp  has N engaged in a conservative approach to minimize environmental  risk  and  liability  by  adopting  relevant  Environmental  Design  Criteria  (EDC).  Without state  or  federal  guidance  in  this  matter,  the  EDCs  for  Elk  Creek  were  fashioned  after  those  from  a jurisdiction  dedicated  to  sustainable  hardrock  mining;  the  State  of  Nevada  and  the  U.S.  Bureau  of Land  Management. However,  Nebraska  does  have  regulations ertaining  to  the  management  of p solid wastes, including mining wastes.

mining

While there are no specific regulations governing the construction and operation of hardrock tailings impoundments  in  the  State  of  Nebraska,  the  definition  of  Solid  Waste  in  Chapter  1  of  Title  132 -Integrated Solid Waste Managementegulations R includes material generated from operations and therefore the tailings facility at the Project may be subject to all or part of the Title 132 regulations.  A  final  determination  on  the  applicability  of  these  regulations  will  be  made  once re mo information has been developed on the final tailings waste stream and chemical constituents. In the meantime, the PEA was intended to be developed under the assumption that these regulations will be applicable, and were addressed in the overall preliminary design of the facility.

Detailed  design  and  development  of  the  process  facilities  is  ongoing,  and,  as  such,  environmental control  equipment  selection  is  somewhat  premature.  However, ioCorp remains  committed  to  the N integration  and  implementation  of  the  most  appropriate  control  technologies  for  both  air  emissions and  water  discharges  in  order  to  meet  the  pollution  prevention  requirements  set  by  the  regulatory agencies.

## 20.3  Environmental Study Results

## 20.3.1 Soils

Soils  in  the  vicinity  of  the  Project  are  primarily  comprised  of  clay,  silty  clay,  silt  loam,  and  clay  loam within an  ecological  site  that  is typified as  'Rangeland'.  For  all  soil  types,  the  depth  to  any  soil restrictive  layer  is  more  than  200  cm  below  ground  surface  (bgs)  and  the  infiltration  is  generall y 'slow' to 'very slow'. Soils in the area are generally eroded and range in slope from 2% to 30%, with the majority of the area having slopes between 6% to 11% (NRCS, 2015).

## 20.3.2 Climate/Meteorology/Air Quality

A dedicated meteorological stationas w installed at Elk Creek in July 2014. Parameter measurements included in the overall instrument package include:

- ¬∑ Wind Speed;
- ¬∑ Wind Direction;
- ¬∑ Temperature;
- ¬∑ Temperature Difference;
- ¬∑ Dew Point Temperature;
- ¬∑ Precipitation;
- ¬∑ Pressure; and
- ¬∑ Solar Radiation.

The  data  thus  far  collected are concluded  to  be  a  satisfactory  start  to  the  goal  of  a  continuous  one year record  that  can  subsequently  be  used  in  PSD  modeling. A  continuation  of  data  review  will  be conducted on a monthly basis  as specified in Meteorological Monitoring Plan,  and a final review will be necessary prior to submittal for inclusion in dispersion modeling.

## 20.3.3 Cultural and Archeological Resources

There  were  at  least  15  Native  American  tribes  that  have  inhabited  the  Great  Plains  region  now incorporated in the State of Nebraska, including the Kansa and Otoe tribes of southeastern Nebraska. Of these original inhabitants, there are four federally recognized Indian tribes that remain in Nebraska today, including:

- ¬∑ Omaha Tribe of Nebraska;
- ¬∑ Winnebago Tribe of Nebraska;
- ¬∑ Ponca Tribe of Nebraska; and
- ¬∑ Santee Sioux Tribe of Nebraska.

Reservations associated with these tribes are located in the northeastern part of the state, over 200 km to the north of Elk Creek.

tribal

The Otoe Tribe once lived south of the Platte River  in the region of the proposed mine, but in  1881, sold  all of their land  in  Nebraska  to  the  federal  government  and  moved  to  Indian  Territory  (now Oklahoma). An assessment of potential cultural and archeological resources in the area will need to be performed as part of the USACE  NEPA  analysis of the Project. However, no direct consultation appears to be necessary at this time.

Since the passage of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966,  the governor of each state has been mandated to  appoint  a  State  Historic  Preservation  Officer  to  oversee  preservation  forts.  In ef Nebraska, the director of the Nebraska State Historical Society serves as State Historic Preservation Officer. The  State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO)  administers, among  others, the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP), the Nebraska Historic Resources Survey &amp; Inventory (NeHRSI), as well as the state Archeological Survey.

NioCorp will work with SHPO during the development of the Project to identify potentially significant cultural resources  within  the  Project  boundary  and  ensure  that  any  such  resources  are  properly managed ort mitigated.

## 20.3.4 Vegetation

Cultivated  crop land  (principally  corn,  soy,  and  alfalfa)  makes  up  the  majority  of  the  surface  area within the  Project boundary.  Native  and  non-ricultural  vegetation  exist  primarily  in  the  form  of ag hedgerows and windbreaks along field margins, and in riparian areas along surface water drainages. According  to  ecosite  descriptions  from  the  NRCS  (2015),  plant  communities  within  the  vicinity  of Project  consist  of  annual  and  perennial  weedy  forbs  and  less  desirable  grasses  from  abandoned farmland, as well as big bluestem ( Andropogon gerardii ), smooth brome ( Bromus inermis ), tall fescue ( Schedonorus arundinaceus ), switchgrass ( Panicum  virgatum ), Indiang ass r ( Sorghastrum nutans ), sideoats grama ( Bouteloua curtipendula ), little bluestem ( Schizachyrium scoparium ), Scribner's rosette grass ( Dichanthelium oligosanthes var. scribnerianum ), porcupinegrass ( Hesperostipa spartea ), sedge ( Carex ), leadplant ( Amorpha canescens ), eastern redcedar ( Quercus macrocarpa ), honey locust ( Gleditsia triacanthos ), and smooth sumac ( Rhus glabra ).

## 20.3.5 Wildlife

According to Schneider et. al. (2011) the Project is located in Nebraska's Tallgrass Prairie Ecoregion which  is  home  to  more  than  300  species  of  resident  and  migratory  birds  and  55  mammal  species, most of which can also be found in central  and  western Nebraska. The small mammal fauna of the Tallgrass Prairie Ecoregion consist of species such as the plains pocket gopher ( Geomys bursarius ), prairie  vole  ( Microtus  ochrogaster ), thirteen- lined  ground  squirrel  ( Spermophilus  tridecemlineatus ), and  Franklin's  ground  squirrel  ( Spermophilus  franklinii ).  White-tailed  deer  ( Odocoileus  virginianus ) are the common big game species in the region. The most abundant large predator of the region is the  coyote  ( Canis  latrans ),  but  other  predators  such  as  the  red  fox  ( Vulpes  vulpes )  and  American badger  ( Taxidea  taxus )  can  be  found  in  the  Tallgrass  Prairie  Ecoregion  as  well.  The  bobcat  ( Lynx rufus ),  least  weasel ( Mustela nivalis ),  and American mink ( Neovison vison )  can be found in wooded areas, wetlands and along river valleys (Schneider et. al . 2011).

## 20.3.6 Threatened, Endangered, and Special Status Species

The Project and surrounding areas lie in the Southeast Prairies Biologically Unique Landscape (BUL) within  the  Tallgrass  Prairie  Ecoregion  of  Nebraska  (Schneider et.  al ., 2011).  No  species  that  are listed  as  Th reatened  or  Endangered  under  the  federal  Endangered  Species  Act,  or  the  Nebraska Non-game  and  Endangered  Species  Conservation  Act,  have  been  identified  as  inhabitants  of  the Southeast  Prairies  BUL.  According  to  Schneider et. al . (2011)  special  status  species  which  have been identified as 'Tier I at-risk species' by the state of Nebraska, as well as those species that may

be headed  for state or federal listing, that may  occur in the vicinity of the Project include following:

- ¬∑ Birds:
- o Greater Prairie-Chicken ( Tympanuchus cupido );
- o Henslow's Sparrow ( Ammodramus henslowii );
- o Loggerhead Shrike ( Lanius ludovicianus ); and
- o Wood Thrush ( Hylocichla mustelina ).
- ¬∑ Reptiles:
- o Massasauga ( Sistrurus catenatus ); and
- o Timber Rattlesnake ( Crotalus horridus ).
- ¬∑ Insects:
- o Iowa Skipper ( Atrytone arogos iowa );
- o Regal Fritillary ( Speyeria idaliaI );
- o Married Underwing ( Catocala nuptialis ); and
- o Whitney Underwing ( Catocala whitneyi ).
- ¬∑ Mollusks:
- o Pimpleback ( Quadrula pustulosa );
- o Pistolgrip ( Tritogonia verrucosa ); and
- o Plain Pocketbook ( Lampsilis cardium ).
- ¬∑ Mammals:
- o Plains Harvest Mouse ( Reithrodontomys montanus griseus ).

The Pistolgrip is known to only occur in one other BUL in Nebraska, while the Massasauga and Plain Pocketbook  are  known  to  occur  in  only  two  other  BULs  in  Nebraska.  No  nesting  Piping  Plovers ( Charadrius melodus ), Interior Least Terns ( Sternula antillarum athalassos ), migrant Whooping Cranes ( Grus Americana ),  or nesting Bald Eagles ( Haliaeetus leucocephalus ) are known to occur in the  vicinity  of  the  Project  area  (Brown,  2014).  The  Massasauga's  primary  habitat  is  wet  meadows while the Timber  Rattlesnake  generally  inhabits rocky outcropping  and adjacent habitats.ny If a construction  is  to  be  conducted  in  the  range  of  either  of  the  nake  species, or  any  Tier  I  species , a s proper  impact  analysis  is  required  to  e  executed.   This  would  likely  be  accomplished  during  the b USACE NEPA assessment.

## 20.3.7 Land Use

Since the settlement of Johnson County, farming for livestock, crops, and pasture has been the most important  land use  enterprise. Over  the years, crop  production  has  shifted  from  orchards,  oats, barley,  and  rye  to  corn,  soy,  wheat,  alfalfa,  and  grain  sorghum.  Livestock  in  the  county  generally consists of hogs, cattle, and milk cows (USDA SCS, 1984). About 10,000 acres in Johnson County is irrigated  cropland,  while  about  42,000  acres  is  used  for  pasture.  About  32,000  acresJohnson of County is used for rangeland, which includes both native prairie that was never broken from sod and areas that were cultivated and then reseeded. Based on known soil types, land use in the vicinity of the  Project  is  best  suited  for  rangeland  and  native  hay,  introduced  or  domestic  grasses  for  pasture and, if irrigated, corn, sorghum, and soybeans (USDA SCS, 1984).

the

## 20.3.8 Hydrogeology (Groundwater)

A hydrogeologic characterization of the deposit was conducted during the core drilling program. The program included:

- ¬∑ 42 downhole packer-isolated injection and airlift testing in core holes;
- ¬∑ Installation of six, 2 inch PVC standpipe piezometers isolated in the carbonatite and open to large intervals of the deposit;
- ¬∑ Installation  of  two,  nominal  2  inch  PVC  standpipe  piezometers  isolated  in  the  180  m  thick Pennsylvanian aquitard above the carbonatite; and
- ¬∑ Frequent measurement of water levels in open core holes and piezometers over a period of six months.

The hydrogeologic characteristics of the resource area were significant enough that  day 10 a pumping test was conducted in the fall of 2014. During this initial test, an open borehole was pumped at  35  gpm,  and  the  response  in  the  aquifer  was  observed  in  earby  piezometers.  These data were used to establish the prospective mine water inflow that appears in the owever, PEA. H t e h hydrogeologic issues associated with these initial findings  were considered to be significant enough for a second  test, conducted  in May  and  June  of  2015.   this For second  test, a large diameter injection well was  installed  in the approximate  center of the deposit, and  two additional distant piezometers were established. Water was injected at a rate of  22 to 30 L/sec (350 to 480 gpm) over a nominal 30-day period, and the response was measured by a series of instrumented piezometers. Analysis  and  interpretation of the data  from  these  testing  programs  has  been  completed  and  a preliminary  conceptual  model  developed.  Details  of  this  model  are  rovided  in  Section  16.3  of  this p PEA.

The  samples  collected  from  NEC  14-14  and  Met -1  indicate  very  similar  water  quality.  Both  wells 0 have TDS over 18,000 parts per million, with the major contributors being sodium and chloride.  Both wells exceed EPA primary MCLs with respect to the following:

- ¬∑ Arsenic;
- ¬∑ Gross alpha; and
- ¬∑ Ra-226 + Ra-228.

Water from both of these wells also exceeds secondary Maximum Contaminant Levels (MCLs) with respect  to chloride, fluoride, iron, manganese,  sulfate,  and  TDS.  NEC  14- also  exceeds  the 014 secondary  MCL  for  aluminum.  There  were  no  detectable  pesticides/herbicides  in  4uarter  2014 th q groundwater samples.

Although the groundwater is not currently a drinking water source, concentrations were compared to drinking water  standards  as  a  reference  to  possible  regulatory and  management  implications  of groundwater disposal from future mine dewatering.

The  groundwater  chemistry  data  indicate  a  low xygen,  chemically  reducing  groundwater  system -o that  is  out  of  chemical  equilibrium  with  surface  conditions.  Supporting  evidence  of  this  conclusion includes:

- ¬∑ Nitrogen species are mostly dominated by ammonia rather than nitrate or nitrite;
- ¬∑ Iron is elevated at neutral pH, a condition which is unlikely to occur in an oxygenated, natural
- ¬∑ system; and

- ¬∑ Groundwater  brought  to  the  surface  at  some  boreholes  is  initially  black,  changes  to  orange over  a  time  period  ranging  from  hours  to  days,  then  eventually  turns  clear  while  forming  an orange precipitate. This is characteristic of water initially containing reduced ferrous iron that eventually oxidizes to ferric iron.

in

Further investigation is needed to determine the origin of the elevated concentrations groundwater,  as  well  as  overall  pumping  requirements  for  the  underground  mining  operation  (from surface wells and the underground mine).

## 20.3.9 Hydrology (Surface Water)

Surface water samples have been collected as part of baseline sampling on a quarterly basis since early 2014. Surface water sampling locations were selected to establish a baseline monitoring perimeter both upstream and downstream from all proposed facilities in the Project area.

All  samples  were  analyzed  by  Midwest  Laboratory  in  Omaha  for  a  comprehensive  suite  of  metals and other inorganic analytes plus a panel of pesticides and herbicides. The preliminary results of the program are as follows:

- ¬∑ Surface water quality can be classified as slightly impaired. Aluminum, iron, manganese, and TDS show recurring concentrations over the EPA secondary standards.
- ¬∑ Aluminum,  iron,  and  manganese  also  exceed  State  aquatic  life  criteria  at  various  locations on a recurring basis.
- ¬∑ Average stream TDS in the 2 nd and 3 rd quarters of 2014 was 560 and 430 mg/L respectively, jumping to 708 mg/L in the   quarter. 4 th This could be the result of post rvest -ha runoff containing more sediments.
- ¬∑ A single elevated concentration of arsenic (0.013 mg/L) in Elk Creek upstream  sample ECKN-U  was  reported  in  the  2  quarter  of  2014.  This  has  been  the  only  exceedance  of  a nd primary EPA MCL.
- ¬∑ Stream pH is consistently neutral, ranging from about 6.6 to 8.2 standard units.
- ¬∑ Gross alpha, beta, Ra- 26 2 and Ra-28 2 have been detected in several surface samples, but at concentrations below their respective EPA MCLs.

## 20.3.10 Wetlands/Riparian Zones

and the

As noted above, Olsson Associates (2014) was  retained to conduct a wetland delineation potential jurisdictional waters assessment in Sections 3, 28, 29, 32, 33, Township 3; 4 North, Range 11  East,  Pawnee  and  Johnson  counties,  Nebraska.  The  purpose  behind  this  investigation  was  to identify wetland and drainage features within the proposed Project boundary that could be classified as jurisdictional waters of the U.S., and  therefore be subject to permitting requirements by USACE.

pastures,

The study   area, at the time of the site visit, consisted of existing agricultural fields, farmsteads  and  unnamed  tributaries  to  Todd  and  Elk  creeks.  The  majority  of  unnamed  tributaries consisted  of  riparian  areas  and  ponds  that  drained  to  Todd  and  Elk eks.  Many  of  the  wooded cre areas that were not situated along drainages were located along fence lines as windbreaks. Most of the study area had been impacted by grazing livestock.

stream

Wetlands were identified in agricultural fields, pastures, roadside ditches and abutting channels. Olsson identified a total of 45 wetlands encompassing a total area of approximately 10.64 acres.  Nine  unnamed  streams  were  also  found  during  the  field  investigation  for  a  total  length  of approximately 13,726 ft. Portions of these streams are likely to be classified as jurisdictional.

At  the  time  of  this  report,  all wetlands  and  waters  in  the  Project  study  area  are  assumed  to  be jurisdictional.  Olsson  and NioCorp are  currently  working  with  the  USACE  in  order  to  obtain  a  final determination.

## 20.3.11 Geochemistry

A  geochemical  characterization  program  for  the  mineralized  material,  waste  rock,  and  tailings  has been initiated by SRK for the Project. Preliminary results are provided in the following sections.

## Niobium Mineralized Material

Preliminary  results  suggest  that  the  mineralized  material  has  potential  to  leach  various  constituents due  to exposure  to  meteoric  precipitation. Laboratory  leach  tests  of a composite  sample  of  this material from drillhole NEC11-01 indicate that, at a minimum, fluoride and nitrate could be mobilized during surface stockpiling.

However,

Contained within the mineralized material are naturally occurring uranium and thorium. Leach testing has not produce concentrations of radionuclides above regulatory limits. concentrations in the rock are relatively elevated:

- ¬∑ Gross alpha = 200 pCi/g;
- ¬∑ Gross beta = 160 pCi/g;
- ¬∑ Radium 226 = 56 pCi/g; and
- ¬∑ Radium 228 = 18 pCi/g.

The mineralized material suitable for mill feed will require proper management during the periods it is exposed on the surface, prior to processing.

## Waste Rock and Overburden

There are two basic types of waste rock associated with the niobium deposit. These include:

carbonate

- ¬∑ Pennsylvanian  limestones  and  mudstones -  The upper  30  m  of  lithology consists of unconsolidated glacial  till,  underlain  by  a  170  to  180  m  of  lowermeability,  Pennsylvanian-p aged mudstone and limestone, otherwise known as the 'Pennsylvanian strata' (PENN). The PENN  is  reportedly  continuous  across  the  state  of  Nebraska,  and  locally  it  behaves  as  a very effective aquitard. This material is strongly neutralizing due to its high content.  In terms of metal leaching aracteristics, ch meteoric water mobility procedure (MWMP) testing suggests that the PENN has the potential to  leach antimony and selenium at concentrations above general surface water standards. Additionally, the  PENN exhibits a propensity to leach gross alpha and radium above regulatory limits.
- ¬∑ Non-ore  grade  carbonatite -  Preliminary assessment  of the host rock identified visual sulfide content  of  up  to  one  percent  based  on  observations  by  core  loggers.  Laboratory analyses  confirmed  the  sulfide  content  at  around  1.34%.  This  sulfide  consists  mainly of pyrite,  chalcopyrite,  bornite,  galena,  sphalerite,  and  possibly  pyrrhotite.  However,  e en  with v

th

detectable  sulfide  content,  the  carbonatite  waste  rock  is  still  net  neutralizing  given  the  high carbonate content.

Of  the  94  rock  samples  collected  over  a  255  m  vertical  length  of  the  waste  rock  and  mineralized zone, eight samples (8.5%) registered a reading of &gt;25 ¬µRads/hour. These levels are not considered to be hazardous, but ould  be  used c as a diagnostic tool to identify elevated ncentrations co of uranium and thorium.

these or

Additional drilling  and  testing has been proposed to better define the geochemical characteristics of the  waste  rock  types  before  a  proper  management  plan  can  be  developed.  Any  surface  disposal  of waste rock will be predicated on minimizing meteoric infiltration and leaching of this material. iven G the  uncertainty  surrounding the  geochemistry  of  the  Elk  Creek  Project  waste  rock  and  overburden (until additional testing is completed), NioCorp has conservatively elected to line the waste rock and low-grade mineralized material stockpiles, and actively manage any runoff derived from materials until such  time  as they can  be  processed,  returned  to the underground  as  backfill properly closed in place.

## Tailings

Representative  quantities  of  post -process  tailings  from  the  metallurgical  testing  program  have  been limited. Geochemical  testing  and  characterization  (including  radiological  testing)  of  the  tailings  is scheduled  for  late  2015  when  the  testing  of  the  beneficiation  process  is  complete  and  the  need  for and usability of tailings as underground backfill has been properly evaluated.

## 20.4  Health and Safety

Federal

Occupational  health  and  safety  at  the  Project  will  be  strictly  regulated  by  the  U.S.  Department  of Labor, Mine Safety &amp; Health Administration (MSHA), under Title 30 of the Code of Regulations, Mineral Resources, Parts 1 through 199 (30 CFR Parts 1 through 199). This includes all of the training requirements specified in 30 CFR Parts 46 through 49. Given the radiological nature of the mineralized  material,  MSHA  will  likely  institute  radon  exposure  and  monitoring  requirements  n o all workers in accordance with 30 CFR ¬ß 57.5039 thru ¬ß 57.5047.

## 20.5  Reclamation and Closure

Without specific hardrock mining regulations, there are limited obligatory requirements reclamation and closure of mining properties in Nebraska. There are proviions, however, within the s applicable  regulatory  framework  which  are  likely  to  be  applied  to  the  Project  during  the  permit  and licensing processes.

## 20.5.1 Surface Disturbance

The principal objective of the surface reclamation plan will be to return disturbed lands productive post-mining land use. Soils, vegetation, wildlife and radiological baseline data will be used as guidelines for the design, completion, and evaluation of surface reclamation. Final reclamation  will  blend  affected  areas  with  adjacent  undisturbed  lands  so  as  to  re- tablish  original es slope  and  topography  and  present  a  natural  appearance.  Surface  reclamation  efforts  will  strive  to limit soil erosion by wind and water, sedimentation, and re-establish natural drainage patterns.

## 20.5.2 Buildings and Equipment

All surface structures and equipment will be evaluated for appropriate losure post -c re- use or disposal. Buildings and equipment will be decommissioned, decontaminated (as necessary), dismantled, and either salvaged or disposed of in an appropriate on-site or off-site disposal facility.

All  wells,  including  injection  and  production  wells,  monitoring  wells,  and  any  other  wells  within  the Project Area used  for the collection of hydrologic or water quality data or incidental monitoring purposes, will be properly abandoned in accordance with NDEQ and DNR requirements.

## 20.5.3 Tailings Disposal Facility

Since the definition  of  Solid Waste  in  Chapter  1  of  Title  132 -Integrated  Solid  Waste  Management Regulations includes material generated from mining operations ailings  disposal  facility ,  t at the Project  will likely be subject to all or part of the Title 132 regulations, including the requirements. These requirements include:

closure

- ¬∑ A final cover system shall be installed which shall be comprised of an erosion layer underlain by an infiltration layer as follows:
- o The  infiltration  layer  shall  be  comprised  of  a  minimum  of  18  inches  of  earthen  material that has a permeability less than or equal to the permeability of the bottom liner system or natural subsoil present, or a permeability no greater than 1 √ó10 -5 cm/sec, measured at the site, whichever is less; and
- o The  erosion  layer  shall  consist  of  a  minimum  of  18  inches  of  earthen  material  that  is capable of sustaining adequate vegetative cover.
- ¬∑ Owners or operators of solid waste disposal areas shall prepare and submit a written closure plan that describes the steps necessary to close the solid waste disposal area in phases, or the entire area, whichever is applicable. This closure plan shall be part of the application. The closure plans shall include, but not be limited to, a description methods of closure which comply with the requirements of the law.

permit of

the

With respect to  post -closure  requirements, operators  of solid  waste  disposal  areas  shall  provide  for post-closure  care  for  a  period  of  30  years.  Additional  details  regarding  the  closure  of  the  tailings disposal facility are provided in Section 18.2 of this report.

## 20.5.4 Financial Surety Requirements

other

In addition to lacking hardrock mining regulations for reclamation and closure, there are also limited requirements  for  the  provision  of  financial  sureties  with  respect  to  hardrock  mining  operations  in Nebraska.  One  possible  exception  would  be  under  the  scenario  in  which  the  facility  falls  under  a broad  scope  radiological  license,  which  may  have  inancial assurance  requirements  for  reclamation f and closure. As noted before, however, these rules appear to be directed at uranium mill tailings and low-level radioactive waste  facilities, but are vague  enough  that they could be applied to situations where  radioactive  materials  are  being  managed.  These  surety  requirements  extend  to long-term site monitoring, maintenance, and care.

In  addition,  financial  assurances  will  also  be  required  for  the  tailings  disposal  facility,  which  will  fall under the NDEQ Title 132  Integrated -Solid Waste Management Regulations. lowable Al mechanisms for financial assurance include trust funds, surety bonds, and letters of credit.

At this time, the type and amount of financial surety for Elk Creek has not yet been established.

## 20.5.5 Closure Cost Estimate

Closure  costs  for Elk Creek  have  been  estimated  at  just  over  US$60  million,  the  bulk  of  which (US$40 million) is intended for reclamation and closure of  the tailings disposal facility. Approximately US$15  million  has  been  allocated  for  surface  reclamation  of  the  remaining  facilities  (i.e.,  building demolition,  site  regrading  and  revegetation,  shaft  closure,  etc.),  while  the  remaining  US$5  million  is set  aside  for  postclosure  monitoring  and  maintenance.  These  costs  will  be  refined  as  part  of  the -feasibility  study,  and  may  need  to  be  adjusted  based  on  specific  regulatory  agency  requirements, particularly those associated with any radioactive material licensing of the plant and tailings facility.

## 20.6  Community Relations and Social Responsibilities

Community relations and stakeholder engagement have been undertaken in parallel with operations in Nebraska and have included town hall  and  individual meetings  with local  landowners. Some  early  communications  have  occurred  between  NioCorp and  Johnson  County  representatives (including the county commissioners) as well as the Southeast Nebraska Development (SENDD).  Given  the  accelerated  schedule  proposed  by NioCorp for  the  Project,  all  of  the  relevant regulatory agencies will need to be formally engaged as soon as possible using the presented herein as the basis for permitting. Any  significant deviations from this design, therefore, have an impact on overall Project timing.

NioCorp is committed to ensuring that a proper Social License is garnered from the community and stakeholders. Thus far, support for the Project has been positive from those who have been engaged and notified of the pending Project.

## 20.7  International Standards and Guidelines

social

Even  though  the  United  States  is  a  Designated  Country  with  respect  to  the  Equator  Principles, NioCorp has committed to ensuring that Elk Creek is in compliance with international standards and guidelines,  to  the  extent  practicable,  given  the  potential  for  international  investment  in  the  Project. Designated Countries are those countries deemed to have robust environmental and governance,  legislation  systems  and  institutional  capacity  designed  to  protect  their  people  and  the natural environment.

Potentially  relevant  international  policies  and/or  guidelines  for  which  the  Project  is  likely  to  maintain compliance with include, but are not necessarily limited to:

- ¬∑ Equator  Principles  risk  management  framework for  determining,  assessing  and  managing environmental and social risk in projects;
- ¬∑ International Finance Corporation (Performance Standards) (IFC  PS) --social and environmental management planning;
- ¬∑ World Bank Guidelines (Operational Policies and Environmental Guidelines);
- ¬∑ Washington  Convention  of  1940  on  Nature  Protection  and  Wild  Life  Preservation  in Western Hemisphere;
- ¬∑ Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer;
- ¬∑ Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer;
- ¬∑ Basel Convention  on  the  Control  of  Trans -boundary  Movements  of  Hazardous  Wastes  and

The  equipment  costs  were  from  Sandvik  2014  cost  information  and  recent  quotations  for  similar equipment, as well as an SRK database and CostMine Mining Cost Service data.

Process equipment were sized and quantified based on this PEA process design criteria and mass and water balances. Process equipment costs were estimated with either historical data, budgetary quotations in some cases, or equipment cost databases. Minor equipment costs such as small bins or pumps were estimated based on historical data or with an allowance.

and require

The process facilities equipment installation, freight, process piping and process electrical instrumentation  costs  were  estimated  with  factors  of  mechanical  equipment  cost.  Factors  did  vary based on the application. For example, the pyrometallurgical plant process does not significant process piping, therefore the cost for piping was adjusted accordingly.

The  buildings'  shells  including  earthworks,  concrete,  structural,  architectural  building  related  HVAC, electrical &amp; inst umentation r and piping, were estimated based on dimensions from conceptual drawings. Based on equipment sizing and quantities, a footprint with building height was established and used as a basis for the estimation.

As  for  the  other  infrastructure  costs,  most  of  the  estimate  was  performed  using  quantities  and  unit costs for roads, site pad  preparation, parking, etc. Auxiliary buildings were  estimated  based  on conceptual drawings produced. Rail was estimated based on typical cost per kilometer of railway to build, cost estimate for connection with BNSF, a bridge, etc. Rail unloading was estimated based on the  required  equipment  for  unloading,  loading  and  handling  of  products  coming  into  and  from  the mine  site.  Finally,  some  smaller  cost  items  such  as  potable  water,  sewage  treatment  system,  and fuel station were estimated based on historical data from similar size mining projects.

## 21.2  Operating Cost Estimates

The operating costs are based on processing 2,700 t of mineralized material per day to produce an average  of  7,500 t/y  of  ferroniobium  (rounded).  The  operating  costs  are  based  on  Q1-5  costs, 201 and  the  estimate  has  been  broken  down  into  three  main  areas:  mining  costs  (mine),  processing costs (process), and general &amp; administration (G&amp;A).

The  mine  operating  cost  is  estimated  at  US$53.00/t  of  the  mineralized  material  delivered  to  the processing operation and includes the manpower, energy, spares and maintenance supplies required  for  the  underground  development  and  production  of  the  mineralized  material s  well  as ,  a underground paste backfill distribution, underground pumping systems, and ventilation.

The process operating cost is estimated at US$135.75/t of the mineralized material milled consists of the manpower, energy, consumables, reagents, spares and maintenance required  for  the  operation  of  the  mineral  processing,  hydrometallurgical,  acid  and  pyrometallurgical plants,  as  well  as  the  operating osts  of  the  fresh  water  supply  and  treatment,  surface  dewatering c wells, and tailings disposal.

and supplies

The  general  &amp;  administration  operating  cost  is  estimated  at  US$8.11/t  of  the  mineralized  material milled.  This  includes  all  of  the  project's  operating  costs  which  are  not  related  to  the  mining  and processing plants. The G&amp;A costs include the following subsections: administration manpower, nd a general costs for operations.

The overall LoM operating cost for the Project is estimated $ 6.1  billion, at US US$ 196.86/t mineralized  material  milled  or  US$39.28/kg  of  Nb  excluding  Ti  and  Sc  credits).  A  summary  of  the ( operating costs for the Project is shown in Table 21.2.1. All costs presented in this section are in US dollars per mineralized material milled, or kg of Nb, or US dollars. The details of the operating costs for each area are presented in Tables 21.2.1 to 21.2.4.

## 21.2.1 Basis for Operating Cost Estimates

The mining operating cost was developed as follows:

- ¬∑ The development costs are based on unit costs US$/m  for specific mine development activities  and  are  converted  to  a  per  tonne  basis  using  the  planned  production  rate  of  the mine.
- ¬∑ The stoping costs are developed from CostMine Mining Cost Service data with a justments d for  haulage  distance  and  additional  equipment  costs.  The  operating  cost  varies  over  time based on haul distance. Diesel fuel costs assumed in this study are US$0.806/L.

- ¬∑ Underground  water  pumping  costs  were  based  on  maintenance  parts,  labor,  and  lectricity e costs for system.
- ¬∑ The  underground  backfill  cost  information was  provided  by vit  based  on  their Ko internal database information.
- ¬∑ The ventilation costs are based on estimated electricity use per year that is adjusted for mine depth and additional equipment as the mine deepens. The estimate is based electricity price of US$0.0575/kWh.

The G&amp;A cost was estimated at approximately 6.8% of direct cost in a typical year and held constant for the LoM.

The process operating costs were determined by  estimating the required quantities of consumables, reagents, manpower, natural gas and electrical power on a 'dollars per tonne milled' basis.

well

The main consumables for the mineral processing plant are grinding mill  liners and grinding media. The consumption rates were calculated based on the bond abrasion test results as consultation with mill suppliers for the liner consumption. The prices for the consumables were from recent quotes from suppliers for similar projects.

an as

The reagent consumption rates are based on the laboratory test results used for the PEA  with prices taken  from  suppliers'  quotes.  The  reagent  consumption  for  acid  plant,  hrometallurgical  plant  and yd pyrometallurgical  plant  accounts  for  around  50%  of  the  total  Process  and  Infrastructure  operating cost.

The  connected  loads  for  the process  equipment  were  taken  from  the  electrical loads that were established  based  on  the  mechanical  equipment  lists  for  each  plant.  The  cost  of  electricity  was assumed to be US$0.0575/kWh.

The natural gas consumption rates are based on process equipment, with the hydromet consuming the bulk of the natural gas. Cost for natural gas is $2.789/mmBtu taken from the current natural gas price for Nebraska as per U.S. Energy Information Administration.

kilns

Labor  requirements  were  determined  and  estimated  for  various  unit  operations  in  the  processing plants.  The  labor  cost  was  then  calculated  using  manpower  rates  taken  from  recent  plant  operation wages from Nebraska.

and

- A factor of 4% of the mechanical equipment  ital  cost cap was considered for the spares maintenance  supplies.  A  factor  of  2%  of  piping  materialapital cost  and  8%  of  instrumentscapital c cost were used for piping and instrumentation supplies costs.

Other  processing  costs  for contractors for shut downs  or  other purpose  were  estimated  for  the different process facilities based on past experiences.

The rail operating cost, was based on Roche's experience with similar rail maintenance estimates for both the Niocorp rail crew and outside contractors.

cost

The  paste  backfill  plant  operation  cost  estimate  is  based  on  a  rate  125  t/h,  with  US$0.060  kWh  for electricity, US$15/t for flyash, US$150/t for cement as a binder, and US$40/man- hour for manpower costs.

PEA

The Mineral Resource presented has been reported following CIM guidelines. The preliminary  in  nature,  that  it  includes  a  level  of  engineering  precision  and  assumptions  which  are currently considered too speculative to have the economic considerations applied to them that would enable Mineral Resources to be categorized as Mineral Reserves.

Inferred  Mineral  Resources  are  not  included  in  the  mine  plan  for  this  PEA.  Mineral  Resources  that are not Mineral Reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability.

The PEA includes price and market assumptions concerning an expanded demand in the scandium market. There is no certainty that the PEA will be realized.

## 22.2  Cashflow Forecasts and Annual Production Forecasts

The  mine  production  summary  includes  1,135  kt  of  waste  material  from  the  sinking  of  the  shaft, access development of the ramp and drifts, and ventilation raises and connection drifts required for proper operation of the underground mine.

Mineralized material identified in the 32 year mine plant includes 31,086 kt of which 10%, or 3,073 kt, is from  development  and  90%,  or  28,013  kt,  is  from  production  stopes  (Table  22.2.1).  The  mine production rate of 2,700 t/d will carry the mine for an estimated 31 to 32 years. The first production of mineralized material associated with mine development will occur in late 2017. Full mine production is anticipated to start early in 2018 and the first full production year would by 2019.

## 22.3  Taxes, Royalties and Other Interests

The State of Nebraska has a number of tax incentive programs that are available to businesses of all sizes  and  industries.  These  incentives  provide  reductions  or  elimination  of  property,  payroll,  income and/or sales tax liabilities.

The State of Nebraska Tax Incentives Programs can be grouped into the following c ategories related to the undeveloped niobium mining/extraction activities in Elk Creek, Nebraska and Johnson County:

- ¬∑ Nebraska Advantage Act;
- ¬∑ Nebraska Advantage Research and Development Act;
- ¬∑ Nebraska Customized Job Training Advantage; and
- ¬∑ Nebraska Advantage Rural Development Act.

Based on review of the various incentive programs, it is expected that the investment credit and the compensation  credits  could  offset  part  of  the  corporate  federal  tax  rate  over  the  initial  part  of  the Project. Most likely an offset of the property taxes will occur based on the  Project being a contributor to the local economy in terms of job creation.

The tax rates assumed for the economic analysis has been set at an effective rate of 20% for the first 10 years of the Project followed by a 25% effective tax rate for the remaining LoM.

The Project also includes a standard 2% NSR on proceeds.

## 22.4  Sensitivity Analysis

Sensitivity analyses for key economic parameters are shown in Table 22.4.1 and Figure 22.4.1.  This analysis  suggests  that  Project economics  are most  sensitive  to  the  metal  recovery.  The  economics are less sensitive to operating cost followed closely by capital costs.

## 22.5  Alternative Scandium Oxide Pricing

For the purpose of examining the sensitivity to the scandium oxide price projection, an alternate case was  developed.   The following economic  analysis  shows  the  results  of the rnate alte case  which assumes a slower ramp- p u in consumption of scandium oxide in the aerospace industry. The economic  model  assumes  LoM  average  metal  prices  of  US$43.55/kg  for  ferroniobium.  The  mar t ke price is set with a start point of US$39/kg Nb in 2015 and increases to US$44/kg Nb in 2020 through the  remaining  LoM.  Market  prices  of  US$2.10/kg  for  titanium  oxide  are  used  for  revenue  purposes. The alternate case market price for scandium oxide is set at US$3,500/kg for scandium oxide for the first year, declining to US$2,000/kg scandium oxide by 2021 then increasing to US$3,500/kg scandium oxide by 2023 and remaining at that level for LoM.

PEA

The Mineral Resource presented has been reported following CIM guidelines. The preliminary  in  nature,  that  it  includes  a  level  of  engineering  precision  and  assumptions  which  are currently considered too speculative to have the economic considerations applied to them that would enable Mineral Resources to be categorized as Mineral Reserves.

Inferred  Mineral  Resources  are  not  included  in  the  mine  plan  for  this  PEA.  Mineral  Resources  that are not Mineral Reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability.

The PEA includes price and market assumptions concerning an expanded demand in the scandium market. There is no certainty that the PEA will be realized.

Sensitivity analyses for key economic parameters are shown in Table 22. 5.1 and Figure 22.5.1. This analysis  suggests  that  Project  economics  are  most  sensitive  to  the  metal  recovery.  The  economics are less sensitive to operating cost followed closely by capital costs. All results are positive within the +/- 25% range.

## 25 Interpretation and Conclusions

## 25.1  Mineral Resource Estimate

SRK  has  constructed  mineralization  models  for  the  deposit,  based  upon  all  of  the  available  drilling information.  Modelling  has  initially  been  completed  in  Leapfrog¬Æ  y  modelling  the  grade  shells  at b 0.3, 0.4, 0.5 Nb2O5% intervals. The use of structural trends has been utilized to mimic the geological interpretation.  The  grade  shells  have  been  cross  checked  against  the  geological  interpretation  to select the optimum parameters.

SRK has undertaken a statistical study of the data, which demonstrates adequate splitting/domaining of  the  deposit.  High  grade  statistical  outliers  have  been  controlled  in  the  estimation  through  grade capping. SRK has undertaken a geostatistical study to investigate the niobium grade continuity which showed  minor  changes  to  the  parameters  used  in  2014.  The  semi- iograms  remain  to  have  a var relatively short first range of between 7 to 20 m, with the maximum range of influence of 80  to 110 m along strike and 60 m down-dip.

SRK  has  interpolated  NbO5 grade  data  using  OK  into  a  block  model  of  dimensions  5  m  x  15  m  x 2 5 m  (based  on  an  assumed  mining  unit) and using  appropriate  search  and  estimation  parameters were  then  tested  for  sensitivity  to  the  estimation  process.  The  resultant  block  model  has  been  f ully validated and no material bias identified.

Mineral

SRK has classified the Mineral Resource in the Indicated (51%) and Inferred (49%) Resource  categories,  mainly  on  the  basis  of  the  geological  and  grade  continuity  and  the  relatively wide drillhole spacing of up to 60 to  120 m on average. Additional Inferred material has been added to the geological model as a result of the Phase II and III drilling programs, at the end of the deposit and by increasing the model at depth, with the deeper vertical holes completed. The deposit remains open  both  along  strike  to  the  northwest  and  southeast  and  at  depth.  SRK  notes  that  the  highest grades are associated with mineralization at depth and this remains the best potential to increase the current Mineral Resource further.

The  Mineral  Resource Estimate  for  the  deposit,  at  0.3  Nb O5%  cut-off,  is  an  Indicated  Resource  of 2 80.5 Mt at 0.71 Nb2O5%; and an Inferred Resource of 99.6 Mt at 0.56 NbO5%. The updated Mineral 2 Resource  represents  a  significant  increase  in  the  reported  contained  metal  for  the  Indicated  when compared to the 2014 estimate, while replacing a portion of the Inferred material which upgraded in terms of confidence. The main reasons for the increases are:

was

- ¬∑ Phase  II  and  III  infill drilling has  decreased  the  drill  spacing  to  the  order  of  60  m to 70 through the central portion of the deposit;
- ¬∑ Phase  II and  III infill drilling has  targeted higher grade  material at depth  in the Resource; and

Mineral

- ¬∑ Increase  in  the  geological  understanding  of  the  controls  on  the  iobium  mineralization  and n grade domaining, based on the 2014 drilling program and relogging of historical holes.

## 25.2  Mining and Mineral Reserve Estimate

No  Mineral Reserves   have been estimated for the Project. The available data indicate underground operations using longhole stoping methods are viable for the Project. The maintains  the  target  FeNb  production  for  a  32  ear  period.  An  elevated  NSR  cutff  was  used  to y -o minimize  plant  and  capital  requirements  and  to  meet  NioCorp  forecasted  market  needs r  FeNb. fo Development  of  the  shaft , initial  ramp  and  accesses  is  imperative  to  achieving  production  in  early years.

## 25.3  Metallurgy and Processing

## 25.3.1 Mineral Processing

A

desired and

Several  direct  flotation  and  reverse  flotation  (carbonate  flotation)  experiments  were  conducted in mechanical  flotation  cells.  The  best  result  was  obtained  with  a  direct  flotation.  Testwork  was  also performed  in  flotation  columns.  Due  to  the  entrainment  of  fine  materials,  column  flotation  with  froth washing provided superior results to those achieved using conventional flotation techniques. flotation column circuit was piloted, but the cleaner flotation stage did not provide the metallurgical results in terms of mass pull versus recovery. With additional time, effort optimization, these results may have been improved. Furthermore, hydrometallurgy testwork showed that  direct  leaching  of  the  ground mineralized  material (without  flotation)  significantly  increased  the recoveries associated with the process. As a result, the flotation testwork was put on hold in pursuit of whole ore direct leaching.

## 25.3.2 Hydrometallurgy

selective

Numerous tests have been performed both at the bench and mini pilot scale on the different steps of the  hydrometallurgical  process.  These  tests  have  led  to  the  selection  of  a  proces   that  successfully s produced a niobium product suitable for subsequent processing into a final ferroniobium product. In doing  so,  a  titanium  oxide  product  suitable  for  further  treatment  into  a  pigment  grade  product  was also  produced.  Scandium  was  successfully  loaded  and  selectively  stripped  from  an  organic  in  a solvent extraction stage. The best results were obtained using a chloride based process, followed by a sulfate based process involving an elevated temperature sulfation, followed by precipitation of niobium and titanium, and independent extraction of scandium from both the chloride and sulfate liquors.

Key results and interpretations are:

- ¬∑ Niobium recovery of 92%;
- ¬∑ Titanium recovery of 87.6%;
- ¬∑ Scandium recovery of 90%;
- ¬∑ The  process  development  was  challenging.  Though  the  unit  processes  considered  have been reported on in literature and are known process, the selection of the unit processes has been a challenge due to the required materials of construction, the recoveries of the different products and the quality required in the different products; and
- ¬∑ Solid liquid separation at the different steps of the process will be challenging. Centrifugation is a suitable, but expensive option.

## 25.3.3 Pyrometallurgy

Preliminary  testing  performed  on  the  niobium  oxide  product  from  the  ydrometallurgy testwork  has h demonstrated  that  ferroniobium  can  successfully  be  produced.  An  external  source  of  heat  will  be required in order to meet the reduction reaction energy requirements. Niobium recovery is estimated at 97% for the pyromet process.

## 25.4  Tailings Storage Facility

Based  on  the  parameters  and  assumptions  outlined  in  Section  18.2,  the  Area  7d  Area  1 TSFs an have been design with adequate capacity to manage planned  water leach residue, gypsum residue, and iron oxide tailings deposition for a 30 year mine life.

## 25.5  Environmental and Social

order

A number of key permits and environmental management requirements have been identified for  he t Elk Creek   Project, some  of which need to be implemented as soon as practicable in maintain the proposed Project schedule.

to

- ¬∑ While not necessarily complex, the timing generally required to complete permitting through any  federal  regulatory  agency  requires  that  NioCorp  engage  key  agencies  (in  this  case  the USACE and possibly the U.S. EPA) early on in Project development, and consider the siting and  orientation  of  facilities  carefully  in  order  to  minimized  the  risk  of  a  protracted  National Environmental Policy Act analysis of the Project. At this time, the design emphasis  on limiting  impacts  to  jurisdictional  wetlands  and  waters  of  the  U.S.  should  result  in  the  use  of an  Environmental  Assessment  as  opposed  to  an  Environmental  Impact  Statement  as  the disclosure document for the USACE analysis of the Project.  However, pursuing the option of including  a  48  km  pipeline  and  discharge  of  dewatering  water  to  the  Missouri  River  could trigger additional federal involvement and extend the scope of NEPA to EIS proportions.
- ¬∑ Perhaps  one  of  the  most  critical  approvals  likely  to  be  needed  by  the  operation  will  be  a radioactive materials license from the Nebraska Department  of Health and Human Services, Office of Radiological Health. Because of their limited experience with hardrock mining in the State of Nebraska, much less mining that includes or NORM,  the DHHS  may  require additional  information  and  more  time  to  approve  the  Project  under  a  Broad  Scope  License. Early and frequent engagement is a necessity with respect to this regulatory agency.
- ¬∑ Documentation of existing baseline environmental conditions at the site was initiated in 2014 and  should  continue  throughout  the  permitting  process.  Additional  studies  will  need  to  be added once regulatory authorities have been given an opportunity to review the current mine plan presented in this PEA and assess their particular data needs for approval of the Project.
- ¬∑ Surface  water  monitoring  should  continue  on  a  quarterly  basis  throughout  the  permitting process, and extend into construction and operations as part of the Environmental Management  System.  Flow  monitoring  of  all  surface  water  sampling  locations  should  be added  in  order  to  calculate  potential  loading  to  the  watershed(s).  The  NDEQ  Water  Quality Division will be engaged as soon as practicable in order to discuss the  roject and potential P data  needs  in  order  to  initiate  NPDES  discharge  permitting.  This  would  include  both  local discharges as well as discharges to the Missouri River.

the all

- ¬∑ A  wetland  delineation  and  potential  jurisdictional  waters  assessment  was  conducted  in  late 2014  to  identify  wetland  and  drainage  features  within  the  proposed  Project  boundary  that could be classified as jurisdictional waters of the U.S., and  therefore be subject to permitting  requirements  of  the  USACE.  A  total  of  45  wetlands,  encompassing  an  area  of approximately  10.64  acres,  were  identified  in  agricultural  fields,  pastures,  roadside  ditches and abutting stream channels within the general project area and outside of floodplain areas identified by the State of Nebraska. Nine unnamed streams were also found during the field investigation for a total length of approximately 13,726 ft. At the time of this report, wetlands  and  waters  in  the  Project  study area  are assumed  to  be  jurisdictional. Olsson Associates  and  NioCorp  are  currently  working  with  the  USACE  in  order  to  obtain  a  final determination.  A  delineation  of  potential  jurisdictional  features  along  the  discharge  water pipeline corridor to the Missouri River is still pending.
- ¬∑ A geochemical characterization program for the mineralized material, waste rock and tailings has  been  initiated  by  SRK  for  the  Project.  Preliminary  results  are  provided  in  Section  20. Addition studies are ongoing.
- ¬∑ Closure  costs  for  the  Project  have  been  estimated  at  just  over  US$60  million,  the  bulk  of which (US$40 million) is intended for reclamation and closure of the tailings disposal facility . Approximately  US$15 million  has  been  allocated  for  surface  reclamation  of  the  remaining facilities  (i.e.,  building  demolition,  site  regrading  and  revegetation,  shaft  closure,  etc.),  while the  remaining US$5 million is  set  aside  for  postclosure  monitoring  and  mainten ance. This -estimate will be refined during development of the feasibility study.
- ¬∑ Community  engagement  has  occurred  in  parallel  with  Nebraska  field  operations  and  has included  public  meetings,  presentations  to  public  agencies,  communications  with  local  and state politicians, and one-on-one meetings with area landowners.

## 25.6  Projected Economic Outcomes

The  project  as  modeled  provides  a  positive  after tax  NPV  of  US$2.3  billion  at  an  8%  discount  rate -with  free  cash  flow  of  US$9.6  billion  after  taxes.  The  Project  generates  approximately  7,500  t/y  of FeNb, a co-roduct p of ScO3  and 2 a by -product of TiO  that 2 offset cost  substantially  at current commodity price estimates. The upfront capital is US$978.7 million. The Project is net NPV positive through sensitivities of +/- 25% on operating cost, capital cost, and recovery.

Variations in the metal prices have a significant impact on the financial results of the Project.

## 25.7  Foreseeable Impacts of Risks

Foreseeable risks and impacts include:

is

the

- ¬∑ Changes  in  product  prices  and  market  conditions  could  have  a  large  impact  on  the  project economics.  SRK notes that the pricing for ferroniobium, the primary product that operation  would  produce,  has  a  more  stable  pricing  history  than  other  commonly  mined commodities, such as gold and copperRK . S notes that the pricing of scandium a is significant portion of the Project revenue and achieving the revenue projected in this study  is subject to market growth in scandium, which is a developing market with a risk of oversupply and/or undersupply disrupting pricing;
- ¬∑ Nebraska does not have clearly defined regulations with respect to permitting mines and the learning  curve  could  potentially  impact  the  total  time  to  market  for  the  project.  SRK  notes that  this also  could  be  considered  an  opportunity  as  the  regulatory  environment  may  be more streamlined;
- ¬∑ The construction and permitting timeline requires a carefully coordinated design, permitting, and scheduling effort that will need to occur concurrent to and immediately after completion of  the  next  level  of  study  to  achieve  the  project  startup  dates.  Any  issues  with  this  effort could impact the startup date; and
- ¬∑ The  results  of  ongoing  hydrogeology  studies  should  clarify  expected  mine  water  quantities and quality and the resulting impact on the project mining and water treatment requirements.

## 26 Recommendations

## 26.1  Recommended Work Programs and Costs

## 26.1.1 Geology and Resource

SRK has no further recommendations for additional drilling needed to support the Mineral Resource for  the  impending  feasibility   study. SRK  notes  that  the  current  understanding  of  the  extents  of  the deposit, while sufficient for the current level of study, are still limited by the extent of the drilling, and that the deposit is locally open along strike and at depth. SRK previously highlighted to the Company a series of work programs to increase the confidence in the assay database for the historical drilling. SRK  understands  that  the  Company  has  programs  in  place  to  address  all  the  outstanding  issues, with the results to be reflected in the next updated Mineral Resource estimate. SRK is of the opinion that there may be an opportunity further to refine and improve the understanding of mineralization, particularly near the top of the deposit where mining is scheduled to begin. This may be considered in planning for future exploration and mining, as a matter of course development of the project.

## 26.1.2 Mineral Reserve Estimate, Mining, and Geotechnical

SRK recommends that the following areas be reviewed during the next phase of work:

- ¬∑ Review drift sizes to optimize and minimize waste movement;
- ¬∑ Review  and  refine  the  development  required uring  the  pre- production  period  to  minimize  cost d and maximize faces available for development;
- ¬∑ Detailed  sequencing  of  shaft  development  and  pre-roduction  activities. To  achieve  production p in the desired timeframe several activities may need to be completed in parallel;
- ¬∑ Review  and  confirm  sill  locations  and  optimize  sill removal  to  maximize  the  recovery  of  the resource;
- ¬∑ Review the mine ventilation to optimize the system maximizing the use of all shafts. This should include  reviewing  the  impact  of  utilizing  more  electric  powered  equipment  to  reduce  ventilation needs. More specifically review use of electric LHD's in the stopes and development mucking to muck bays.
- ¬∑ Review ventilation mine design to minimize the number of angles/turns in the system to reduce losses.  Also evaluate sealing mined levels to eliminate losses while maintaining necessary accesses for ventilation system maintenance.
- ¬∑ Review  shaft  costs,  productivities,  and  PEA  assumptions  to  reduce  cost,  optimize  sizing,  and reduce upfront time to production. Consider impacts of knowledge of hydrology and geotechnical conditions in the mine shaft and key underground infrastructure areas.  Provide geotechnical and hydrogeological analysis of the shaft and vent hole areas.
- ¬∑ Review  the  truck  haulage  system  to  see  if  there  is  a  more  cost  effective  method  or  options  to reduce  cost,  increase  productivity  or  reduce  number  of  equipment  and  labor  required  for  the haulage of mineralized material to the shaft.
- ¬∑ Refine  the  backfill  quantities,  material  characteristics,  and  placement  scheme  to  optimize  the system and confirm PEA assumptions. This should include testwork to determine paste makeup and strength.

the in

the

- ¬∑ Perform  geotechnical  analysis  on  sills  to  minimize  loss  and  confirm  required  sill  thickness  and location.
- ¬∑ Optimization of the production schedule by delaying development to an as-needed basis.

## 26.1.3 Hydrogeology

The  hydrogeologic  characteri zation  of  the  groundwater  system,  including  short  term  testing  during core  drilling,  nominal  10  daypumping  test, and  nominal  30  day  injection  test  allowed  definition  of hydrogeological parameters for the carbonatite within the mineralization area. This testing confirmed that  mineralization  area  is  highly  permeable,  located  within  a  confined  groundwater  system,  and isolated  from  the  shallow  groundwater  system  by  low  permeable  PENN  strata.  However,  the  lateral extent  of  highly  permeable  rock  is  currently  unknown.  Dewatering  requirements  were  preliminarily estimated as an average f o the total of pumping  rates from dewatering wells predicted  an for unbounded and bounded granite deep groundwater system.

SRK recommends to conduct additional hydrogeological testing of:

- ¬∑ The area of the proposed shaft to obtain a site specific hydrogeological data to evaluate grouting procedure and cost of installation (completed in July 2015); and

better

- ¬∑ Carbonatite  and  granite  outside  of  mineralization  area  to  define  lateral  extent  of  zone  high permeability  within  deep  groundwater  system  (this  work  can  be  conducted  at  the  detailed engineering phase).

Current  early  results  of  groundwater  sampling  efforts  on  the  site  indicate  naturally  occurring  but locally  elevated  levels  of  salinity  (TDS  &gt; 8,000 mg/L),  plus  arsenic  and  radiochemical  parameters 1 exceeding  drinking  water  standards.  These  findings suggest  that  further  groundwater  sampling  is warranted to characterize and delineate the water quality, and to determine design criteria for ater w treatment. Options for disposal or storage of water treatment residue also should be investigated. A monitoring program for selected existing piezometers should be established.

## 26.1.4 Processing Plan

In order to improve process efficiency and minimize the potential risks of operating a full scale plant, -testing  programs  need  to  be  carried  out  during  the  different  phases  of  engineering  studies.  While some small-scale test methods provide adequate information for scoping or prefeasibility studies, it is suggested  that pilot plant testing be  ompleted  to c provide sufficient information for the process development  during  the  feasibility  study  at  the  15%  accuracy  levels.  At  the  current  stage  of  the ¬± study, a bench scale laboratory testing program including  -pilot  and mini pilot testing has been completed for understanding the mineralized material sample characteristics and its behavior under controlled conditions. During this program testing, sufficient data has been collected from hydromet circuit to produce a preliminary economic assessment and has justified the to need complete  hydromet  pilot  level  studies.  Implementation  of  such  testwork  will  provide  additional  key information  to  confirm  bench  test  results  and  enable  development  of  mass  and  energy  balances, equipment selection and plant design. As process safety risk is an important factor, a  comprehensive pilot  plant  program  will  help  to  reduce  possible  risks  associated  with  the  construction  and  operation of the new full-scale process plant.

## Mineral Processing

Comminution  testwork  should  be  finalized  using  representative samples  and  it  should include a sufficient  number of standard  Bond  indices,  Bond  Low Energy  Impact  tests,  JK  Drop- eight  tests, -w and SMC  tests with abrasion indices. The tests should be conducted on several samples composites covering the potential variability of the grinding characteristics of the deposit.

and power

Grinding  simulations  should  be  performed  to  provide  sizing  data  for  the  grinding  mill(s),  as  well  as the material balance projection (flow rate, water rate, % solids, particle size distribution, etc.), which can  be  used  to  confirm  the  sizing  of  otheruipment  such  as  pumps,  water  supply  equipment, eq screens, crusher, cyclones, etc. The predicted plant performance (power draw, specific consumption  (kWh/t)  and  operating  work  index)  will  also  have  to  be  presented  in  each  simulation report.

Samples should be collected for settling tests, paste backfill testwork, and characterization.

environmental

## Hydrometallurgy

An  ongoing  testwork  program  to  further  define  and  test  all  aspects  of  the  preliminary  process  is required.  Bench  scale  tests  and  mini  pilots  will  be  run  to  provide  the  final  basis  for itional  pilot plant work. The tests will be conducted on whole ore  samples resulting from representative samples.

add The additional pilot  plant  will  validate  the  robustness  of  the  hydrometallurgical  process  with  regards to the variability of the mineralized material. From the pilot plant, samples will be collected for settl ing and filtration  tests,  paste  backfill  testwork,  and  environmental  characterization.  Settling  and  filtration tests will be performed by equipment suppliers to confirm equipment sizing.

Care should be taken in the subsequent testwork program to assess different construction through the use of coupon testing or other means.

materials

## Pyrometallurgy

Further testwork should be performed on larger sample sizes to assess the energy requirement and to optimize the recovery. Induction furnaces as well as arc furnaces should be tested considering  the  different  types  of  reduction.  Further  testing  of  alumino- ermic  reduction  should  be th performed using a heel combined with an induction furnace. Testing of a reduction stage followed by oxidation of the impurities using oxygen should be performed to assess the benefit in product purity.

## 26.1.5 Tailings Storage Facility

The  following  work  is  recommended  to  facilitate  further  easibility design of the  Area  7 and  Area  1 f TSFs and associated evaporation areas:

- ¬∑ Confirm minimu m design criteria applicable to the TSF via discussions with regulatory bodies, including closure and reclamation.

pertinent

- ¬∑ Verify assumptions regarding WOUS for Area 7 and Area 1.
- ¬∑ Confirm design solid- o-liquid t ratios anticipated from the water leach residue, residue, and iron oxide tailings.

gypsum oxide

- ¬∑ Confirm engineering properties of water leach residue, gypsum  residue, and iron tailings  including  gradation,  settling  potential,  density,  drainage/permeability,  consolidation, and strength.

of

- ¬∑ Confirm geochemical properties of the tailings to verify the containment design composite-lined tailings solids storage and double lined containment at evaporation ponds ).
- ¬∑ Confirm  containment  requirements  based  on  potential  changes  to  the  mine  plan  quantities that could impact the overall size and staging of the TSF.
- ¬∑ Confirm  Area  7  and  Area  1  TSF  footprint  foundation  design  assumptions  for  gradation,  soil classification, moisture content, compaction, and strength.
- ¬∑ Determine  applicable  specifications  for  embankment  compaction,  base  compaction,  drain rock, filter sand, and low-permeability compacted clay core.
- ¬∑ Confirm assumptions related to mass stability including seismic stability.
- ¬∑ Refine  assumptions  for  TSF  water  balance  including  7  ar  dry  and  wet  scenarios,  and ye design storm criteria.

## 26.1.6 Environmental and Social

The following are general recommendations regarding the environmental and social management of the  Project,  and  do  not  necessarily  come  with  a  specific  cost  for  implementation  (unless  otherwise noted).

- ¬∑ A meteorological station has been set up at the  Project site. NioCorp will continue to collect climatological  and  air  quality  data  for  use  in  air  quality  permitting,  but  should  consider  the installation of a second station in the location of the tailings  undment, im po as well as installation of PM 0 1 monitors to establish baseline fugitive  st  conditions du prior to the initiation of construction activities and deposition of tailings.
- ¬∑ Geochemical characterization of the mineralized material, waste rock and taili ngs (including radiological characterization) needs to be expanded. Post-metallurgical testing of the tailings material is necessary to obtain solids and supernatant chemistry , and generate data needed to evaluate the closure alternatives for the underground workings and tailings impoundment, and the potential requirements for post-closure water management, if necessary.
- ¬∑ Most of the major permits for the mine will require some form of public scoping and review, especially any federal permitting through the NEPA process. While stakeholder engagement has  been  undertaken  by  NioCorp,  the  breadth  and  scope  of  this  commitment  needs  to  be expanded in order to secure a Social License for the Project. This includes full disclosure of the findings of the PEA,  as  well as progress toward the feasibility   and studyproposed construction schedule.

rail

- ¬∑ A detailed traffic study will need to be completed given the probability of using transport materials  o t and from the site  s  well a as semi tractor -trailer shipments. Both activities  will  impact  state  highway  rights- of-way,  including  State  Highway  50  and  possibly Highway 62.

to

- ¬∑ As  early as  practicable, jurisdictional delineations along  the  proposed  rail  and  harge disc pipeline  corridors  should  be  completed  and  assessed  for  impacts,  as  well  as  the  potential USACE  expansion  of  involvement.  In  parallel,  NioCorp  needs  to  complete  the  feasibility assessment of water treatment and injection reof reject water within  e th carbonatite formation as an alternative to direct discharge to the Missouri River.
- ¬∑ Post-closure management of the site needs to be considered during the planning and design phases  in  order  to  minimize  potential  long- rm  environmental  and  social  impac  to  the te ts area; and

(i.e.

- ¬∑ NioCorp should i itiate n development of roject-specific P environmental and management plans based on the potential impacts identified during the permitting process.

social

## 26.1.7 Marketing and Economics

Market  studies  have  been  conducted  on  niobium  and  scandium  oxide.   market  study  should  be A performed  on  titanium  dioxide.  The  market  studies  rovide  summary  commodity  price  projections, p product  valuations,  market  entry  strategies,  or  product  specification  requirements. nsportation Tra studies  should  also  be  conducted  for  the  purpose  of  estimating  transport  and  shipping  costs  for  the commodities produced.

## 28 Glossary

the been

The Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves have been classified according to the 'CIM Definition Standards for Mineral Resourcesnd  Mineral a Reserves' (May 10, 2014). Accordingly, Resources have been classified as Measured, Indicated or Inferred, the Reserves have classified  as  Proven,  and  Probable  based  on  the  Measured  and  Indicated  Resources  as  defined below.

## 28.1  Mineral Resources

A Mineral Resource is a concentration or occurrence of solid material of economic interest in or on the Earth's crust in such form, grade or quality and quantity that there are reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction. The location, quantity, grade or quality, continuity and other geological characteristics  of  a  Mineral  Resource  are  known,  estimated  or  interpreted m  specific  geological fro evidence and knowledge, including sampling.

An Inferred Mineral Resource is  that  part  of  a  Mineral  Resource  for  which  quantity  and  grade  or quality are estimated on the basis of limited geological evidence and sampling. Geological vidence e is sufficient  to  imply  but  not  verify  geological  and  grade  or  quality  continuity.  An  Inferred  Mineral Resource  has  a  lower  level  of  confidence  than  that  applying  to  an  Indicated  Mineral  Resource  and must  not  be  converted  to  a  Mineral  Reserve.  It  is  reasonably  expected  that  the  majority  of  Inferred Mineral Resources could be upgraded to Indicated Mineral Resources with continued exploration.

and of

An Indicated  Mineral  Resource is that  part  of  a  Mineral  Resource  for  which  quantity,  grade  or quality, densities, shape and physical characteristics are estimated with sufficient confidence to allow the application of Modifying Factors in sufficient detail to support mine planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit. Geological evidence is derived from adequately detailed reliable exploration, sampling and testing and is sufficient to assume geological and grade or quality continuity between points of observation. An Indicated Mineral Resource has a lower level confidence  than  that  applying  to  a  Measured  Mineral  Resource  and  may  only  be  converted  to  a Probable Mineral Reserve.

reliable quality

of

Mineral

A Measured  Mineral  Resource is that part of a  Mineral  Resource  for  which  quantity,  grade  or quality, densities, shape,  and  physical  characteristics  are  estimated  with  confidence  sufficient  to allow  the  application  of  Modifying  Factors  to  support  detailed  mine  planning  and  final  evaluation  of the economic  viability of the deposit. Geological evidence is derived from detailed and exploration, sampling and testing and is sufficient to confirm geological and grade or continuity between points of observation. A Measured Mineral Resource has a higher level confidence than that applying to either an Indicated Mineral Resource or an Inferred Resource. It may be converted to a Proven Mineral Reserve or to a Probable Mineral Reserve.

## 28.2  Mineral Reserves

A Mineral  Reserve is the economically mineable part of a Measured  and/or Indicated Mineral Resource. It includes diluting materials and allowances for losses, which may occur when  the material is mined or extracted and is defined by studies  refeasibility at p or feasibility level as appropriate that include application of Modifying Factors. Such studies demonstrate that, at the time of reporting, extraction could reasonably be justified.

The reference point at which Mineral Reserves  are defined, usually the point where the  mineralized material  is  delivered  to  the  processing  plant,  must  be  stated.  It  is  important  that,  in  all  situations where  the reference point is different, such as for a saleable product, a clarifying statement included to ensure that the reader is fully informed as to what is being reported. The disclosure of a Mineral Reserve must be demonstrated by a prefeasibility study or feasibility study.

is public

some

A Probable  Mineral  Reserve is the economically mineable part of an Indicated, and in circumstances, a Measured Mineral Resource. The confidence in the Modifying Factors applying to a Probable Mineral Reserve is lower than that applying to a Proven Mineral Reserve.

A Proven Mineral Reserve is  the  economically  mineable  part  of  a  Measured  Mineral  Resource.  A Proven Mineral Reserve implies a high degree of confidence in the Modifying Factors.
