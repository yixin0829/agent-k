Cautionary Note to United States Investors Concerning Estimates of Measured, Indicated and Inferred Resources

This technical report uses the terms 'measured resources', 'indicated resources' and 'inferred resources'. Hard  Creek  Nickel  Corp.  advises  United  States  investors  that  while  these  terms  are  recognized  and required by Canadian regulations (under National Instrument 43-101 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects),  the  United  States  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  does  not  recognize  them. United States investors are cautioned not to assume that any part or all of the mineral deposits in these categories will ever be converted into reserves . In addition, 'inferred resources' have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence, and economic and legal feasibility. It cannot be assumed that all or any part of an Inferred Mineral Resource will ever be upgraded to a higher category. Under Canadian rules,  estimates  of  Inferred  Mineral  Resources  may  not  form  the  basis  of  feasibility  or  pre-feasibility studies,  or  economic  studies  except  for  a  Preliminary  Assessment  as  defined  under  43-101. United States investors are cautioned not to assume that part or all of an inferred resource exists, or is economically or legally mineable.

## 1 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

Hard  Creek  Nickel  Corporation  holds  a  100%  interest  in  the  Turnagain  nickel  property  situated  70 kilometres  east  of  Dease  Lake  in  northern  British  Columbia.  The  property  consists  of  81  contiguous, legacy and cell mineral claims covering an area of 29,370 hectares centred on Turnagain River. Primary access to the property is by helicopter from Dease Lake. A short airstrip of the property has been used in the past for limited access as has a secondary road extending easterly from highway 37 near Dease Lake.

This report,  prepared  at  the  request  of  Hard  Creek  Nickel  Corporation,  is  based  on  discussions  with company personnel, on records of recent exploratory work provided by the company, on information readily available in the public domain and on previous technical reports prepared by N.C Carter on the 2003 and 2004 exploration programs dated April 21, 2004 and June 15, 2005. This report also references a  more  recent  technical  report  dated  April  13,  2006  prepared  by  the  current  author.  The  author conducted a recent site inspection of the property between October 11 and October 12, 2006.

The first mineral claims in the area of the current Turnagain property were staked in 1956. Exploratory work since 1966, carried out by a number of operators including Hard Creek Nickel Corporation and a predecessor company, has included geological mapping, geophysical and geochemical surveys and 50,935 metres of diamond drilling in 230 holes. Nickel mineralization on the Turnagain property is associated with a zoned, Alaskan-type ultramafic body within Paleozoic metasedimentary and lesser metavolcanic rocks adjacent to the faulted terrane boundary between the North America cratonic margin and accreted Quesnel  terrane.  The  Turnagain  ultramafic  body  hosting  mineralization  is  elongate  in  a  northwesterly direction  and  measures  8  by  3.5  kilometres.  The  complex  consists  of  a  central  dunite  core  and  outer, marginal  zones  of  wehrlite,  olivine  clinopyroxenite,  clinopyroxenite  and  hornblendite,  all  of  which represent  crystal  cumulate  sequences.  Contacts  between  the  various  phases  are  gradational.  Later intrusive events include narrow felsic dykes which are probably related to a small granodiorite stock in the central part of the ultramafic body and basic dykes of unknown age. Iron and nickel sulphides, of magmatic origin, are preferentially hosted by wehrlite and dunite adjacent to the transition from  wehrlite to  dunite.    The  central  dunite  core  appears  to  be  only  weakly  mineralized.  Massive,  semi-massive  and sulphide matrix breccias have been noted in several surface showings and over restricted intervals in drill core  within  the  Horsetrail  zone  in  the  southern  part  of  the  Turnagain  ultramafic  suite.  Most  of  the sulphide mineralization  encountered  in  drill  holes  consists  of  between  1%  and  5%  disseminated  blebs which locally coalesce to form net-textured sulphides. Nickel is the principal commodity of interest, with low copper and cobalt values that average less than 0.02%. Combined platinum and palladium values are generally less  than  100  parts  per  billion.  Analytical  studies  indicate  that  between  60%  and  90%  of  the nickel values are present in the form of sulphide minerals with the remainder occurring in crystal lattices of the silicate mineral olivine.

The 2007 mineral resource estimate is based on a revised and expanded geologic interpretation of the Horsetrail zone and peripheral area. The block model grades were estimated by the ordinary kriging using composites  generated  from  drill  data  obtained  since  2002.  The  following  table  presents  the  updated resource estimate using a cut-off grade of 0.10% sulphide nickel.

## 2 INTRODUCTION AND TERMS OF REFERENCE

Hard  Creek  Nickel  Corporation  (formerly  Canadian  Metals  Exploration  Limited)  owns  the  Turnagain nickel property which is situated east of Dease Lake in northern British Columbia. Exploratory work on this property, in the mid-1960s and between 1997 and 2004, revealed the presence of widespread nickel and associated copper, cobalt and platinum group elements mineralization within an ultramafic complex. Comprehensive work programs and related research studies in 2004 and 2006 served to better define the geological setting of the property and the nature and distribution of mineralization. The last published Mineral Resource for the project was released March 2, 2006 (Simpson, 2006). A Preliminary Assessment was also completed by AMEC Americas Ltd. in June, 2006 (AMEC,2006).

The  author  of  this  report  has  been  retained  by  Hard  Creek  Nickel  to  prepare  an  updated  resource estimate.  This  technical  report  has  been  prepared  in  compliance  with  the  requirements  of  National Instrument 43-101 and Form 43-101F1 and is intended to be used as supporting documentation to be filed with the British Columbia Securities Commission and the TSX Venture Exchange.

The author visited the Turnagain Nickel property in October, 2005 and, more recently, from October 1112 th , 2006. The site inspection included examination of drill sites, drill core and surface outcrops as well as  observation  of  sample  preparation  and  QA/QC  procedures.  The  author  has  also  reviewed  the geological information from previous programs and other relevant data available in the Vancouver office. The author is of the opinion that the programs and the data have been conducted and gathered in a professional and ethical manner and conforms to standards acceptable within the industry.

## 3 DISCLAIMER

The mineral resource estimates referred to within this document include the use of inferred resources that are considered too speculative geologically to have economic considerations applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves, and there is no certainty that the preliminary assessment will be realized.

This report includes technical information, which requires subsequent calculations to derive sub-totals, totals and weighted averages. Such calculations inherently involve a degree of rounding and consequently introduce a margin of error. Where these occur, GeoSim does not consider them to be material.

Initial  mineral  claims  were  located  in  1996  by  J.  Schussler  and  E.  Hatzl  and  subsequently  optioned to Bren-Mar Resources Limited, a predecessor company of Canadian Metals Exploration Limited and Hard Creek Nickel Corporation. The original option agreement gave Bren-Mar Resources the right to earn a 100% interest in the mineral claims in exchange for the issuance of 200,000 shares and incurring property expenditures of $1 million within five years of acquisition. The 100% interest has been earned subject to a  4%  net  smelter  royalty  on  possible  future  production  from  the  mineral  claim  511330.  Hard  Creek Nickel Corporation retains the right to purchase all or part of this royalty for $1 million per 1%.

The 14 DRIFT and DINAH cell mineral claims, situated southeast of Turnagain River (Figure 4-2), were acquired early in 2005 by way of the BC ministry of Energy and Mines 'online' map selection process. Twenty-nine of the original 4-post mineral claims (now termed legacy claims) northwest of Turnagain River were converted to cell mineral claims in April. This conversion process ensures greater security of mineral title by effectively eliminating the possibility of internal and external fractions within or adjacent to  the  various  mineral  claims.  Accumulated  assessment  work  credits  are  also  retained  under  the conversion system.

One 4-post claim and twenty-seven 2-post claims, located adjacent to and partially within the central part of  the  property  holdings  but  outside  of  the  prospective  ultramafic  rocks,  were  the  subject  of  a  legal dispute between Hard Creek Nickel Corporation and Mr. Weise.  On July10, 2007 the Supreme Court of British Columbia ordered that these claims be transferred to Hard Creek Nickel.  The transfer has been completed and the claims have been included in the Turnagain property.  Mr. Weise has subsequently filed a Notice of Appeal of the Order.

Legacy mineral claims in British Columbia may be kept in good standing by incurring assessment work or by paying cash-in-lieu of assessment work in the amount of $100 per mineral claim unit per year during the  first  three  years  following  the  location  of  the  mineral  claim.  This  amount  increases  to  $200  per mineral  claim  unit  in  the  fourth  and  succeeding  years.  Cell  mineral  claims,  which  are  of  varying  size depending on their position within the province, require annual expenditures (or cash-in-lieu payments) of $4 per hectare per annum for the first three years of tenure and $8 per hectare annually thereafter. The maximum permitted assessment work (ten years) has been filed on all of the key claims to advance their expiry dates into 2017.

## 4.2 Permits &amp; Environmental Liabilities

Exploration work on mineral properties in British Columbia requires the filing of A Notice of Work and Reclamation with the Ministry of Energy and Mines. The issuance of a permit facilitating such work may involve the posting of a reclamation bond. Permits for the 2003 to 2006 exploration work programs were obtained  with  no  undue  delays  and  permitting  for  the  proposed  2007  program  is  in  progress. Reclamation bonds totalling $187,900 have been posted by Hard Creek Nickel to the end of 2006.

Environmental  studies  within the property area have  been  ongoing  since  2003.  These  include hydrological  measurements  on  tributary  creeks,  water  quality  sampling  from  creeks  and  drill  holes, wildlife observations and determination of fish species and the collection of weather data.  Multi-element analyses of soil samples have provided useful information regarding background concentrations of major and trace elements.

The author is not aware of any specific environmental liabilities to which the various mineral claims are subject. The Turnagain property is situated in an area where mining-related activities have been underway for more than 75 years.

## 5 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES INFRASTRUCTURE AND PHYSIOGRAPHY

The Turnagain nickel property is centred on Turnagain River 70 kilometres east of the community of Dease Lake (Figure 5-1). Dease Lake is situated on highway 37 some 400 kilometres north of the port of Stewart (Figure 4-1). Helicopter access from Dease Lake involves a 20 minute flight. Secondary roads extending easterly from Dease Lake have been used by large, articulated 4-wheel drive vehicles to convey large jade boulders from the Kutcho Creek area and to supply placer gold operations at Wheaton Creek over the past number of years. A branch of this road network extends into the Turnagain property; road distance to Dease Lake is about 100 kilometres.

A 700 metres long dirt airstrip, constructed in the 1960s and situated in the central property  area on the north side of Turnagain River, can accommodate small aircraft. This airstrip is immediately adjacent to Hard Creek Nickel's current camp facility. Past exploration programs have made use of camp facilities at Wheaton Creek (Boulder) which is about 15 kilometres by road west of the property.

Dease Lake has three times a week scheduled airline service and offers some supplies and services. The communities of Terrace and Smithers, both several hundred kilometres south, offer the best range of supplies  and  services  which  can  be  trucked  to  Dease  Lake  via  highway  37.  On-site  communications include satellite telephone, facsimile and internet connections.

The Turnagain property is situated in the Stikine Ranges of the Cassiar Mountains. The area between Dease Lake and the property features maturely dissected mountains rising to elevations of between 2000 and 2150 metres above sea level (Figure 5-1) and separated by wide, drift-filled valleys in which elevations average 1000 metres. Relief can be described as moderate for this part of British Columbia. Forest cover is  present in valley areas up to elevations of about 1500 metres above sea level above which is typical alpine terrain. Bedrock is reasonably well exposed in the areas above tree line and along drainages.

The  Turnagain  property  covers  north-,  west-and  east-facing  slopes  northwest  and  southeast  of Turnagain River and alpine terrain above tree line (Figure 5-1). Elevations range from about 1000 metres above sea level along Turnagain River in the central claims area to 2200 metres at an unnamed summit in the central property area.

The climate is typical of the northern interior of British Columbia with cold temperatures and moderate snow cover during the winter months and limited precipitation during the remainder of the year. Field work is best carried out between mid-June and late September when daytime temperatures average 10 to 15 degrees Celsius.

## 6 HISTORY

The Turnagain property is situated in the Dease Lake area where placer gold was discovered at the north end of Dease Lake in the late 1800s. Subsequent prospecting resulted in the discovery of additional placer gold in other creeks including Goldpan Creek in the 1920s. The Letain asbestos deposit, 20 kilometres southeast  of  the  Turnagain  property  was  discovered  in  1955  and  exploration  for  porphyry  copper deposits  in  the  1960s  resulted  in  the  discovery  of  the  Eaglehead  prospect  10  kilometres  west  of  the Turnagain  property.  The  Kutcho  Creek  massive  sulphide  deposit,  40  kilometres  southeast,  initially investigated in the 1970s and 1980s, was the focus of a major programs in 2004 and 2005. Numerous jade deposits in the area between Wheaton Creek and Kutcho Creek have been mined over the past 20 years.

Nickel  and  copper  sulphides  were  discovered  within  the  current  property  area  in  a  bedrock  exposure along  Turnagain  River  in  1956.  Mineral  claims  covering  this  showing  and  other  occurrences  were acquired  by  Falconbridge  Nickel  Mines  Limited  in  1966  and  work  completed  over  the  ensuing  seven years  included  surface  and  airborne  geophysical  surveys,  geological  mapping,  geochemical  surveys  and 2895 metres of conventional and packsack diamond drilling in 40 widely spaced drill holes (Crosby and Steele,1969; McDougall and Clark,1972,1973).

During  this  same  time  interval,  geochemical  surveys  were  carried  out  on  adjacent  ground  by  Union Miniere Exploration and Mining Corporation Ltd. (Burgoyne,1971). One short diamond drill hole (17 metres) was completed by independent claim owners in 1979 (Cukor,1980) and Falconbridge drill core was re-sampled for platinum group elements in 1986 (Cukor,1987). Additional investigation of platinum group elements was also undertaken by way of geochemical surveys conducted on behalf of Equinox Resources Ltd. in 1986 (Page,1986).

The Turnagain River property was acquired by Bren-Mar Resources Limited (predecessor company of Canadian Metals Exploration Limited and Hard Creek Nickel Corporation) in 1996 and work that year included 400 line kilometres of airborne magnetic surveys and 792.5 metres of diamond drilling in 5 holes (Livgard,1997).  Additional  diamond  drilling  in  1997  and  1998  amounted  to  3096  metres  in  14  holes (Downing,1998).  Related  work  included  18  line  kilometres  of  surface  magnetic  surveys  covering  two areas of the property, bore hole pulse electromagnetic surveys of four of the 1997-1998 drill holes and preliminary metallurgical test work on drill core composites.

Canadian  Metals  Exploration  Limited  undertook  work  in  2002  consisting  of  an  Induced  Polarization survey  of  part  of  the  claims  area  and  1687  metres  of  diamond  drilling  in  7  holes  (Downing,2003). Exploratory work in 2003 included geological mapping, prospecting and bedrock, stream sediment and soil sampling and 8669 metres of diamond drilling in 22 holes.

Hard  Creek  Nickel's  2004  exploratory  program  consisted  of  geological  mapping,  bedrock,  stream sediment  and  soil  sampling,  surface,  borehole  and  airborne  geophysical  surveys  and  7522  metres  of diamond  drilling  in  49  holes.  Various  mineralogical,  metallurgical  and  analytical  studies  were  also undertaken.

In 2005, Hard Creek Nickel completed 7154 metres of core drilling in 37 holes. In addition, transient EM surveys were conducted in 13 holes (7,400 m), fill-in soil geochemistry was carried out and the geologic mapping program was continued.

## 7 GEOLOGICAL SETTING

## 7.1 Regional Geology

The Turnagain nickel property is associated with a late Triassic ultramafic complex situated within early Paleozoic  metasedimentary  and  metavolcanic  rocks  along  the  faulted  terrane  boundary  between  the cratonic  margin  (ancestral  North  America)  and  accreted,  Mesozoic  Quesnel  terrane  or  Quesnellia  as indicated on Figures 7-1 and 7-2 which are reproductions of a Geological Survey of Canada published map (Gabrielse, 1998).

As shown in Figure 7-1, the Turnagain ultramafic suite (Scheel et al, 2005) was emplaced principally in an early Paleozoic (Ordovician to Devonian) metasedimentary sequence of black, graphitic and calcareous phyllites  and  lesser  limestone  and  clastic  sediments,  part  of  ancestral  North  America.  Along  its northwestern margin, the complex is also in contact with volcaniclastic rocks of possible early Triassic age and of uncertain terrane affiliation.

The Turnagain ultramafic intrusion is immediately north of the regional, northwesterly trending Kutcho Fault  (Figure  7-1)  which  separates  ancestral  North  America  from  Quesnellia    in  this  part  of  British Columbia. The Turnagain intrusion is recognized (Nixon, 1998) as an Alaskan-type ultramafic intrusion similar to those which have been identified in southeast Alaska and elsewhere in British Columbia and are considered as being part of accreted terranes. Two interpretations have been proposed (Nixon, 1998) for the  geological  setting  of  the  Turnagain  ultramafic  intrusion.  The  first  of  these  suggests  that  the  early Paleozoic rocks marginal to the intrusion are autochthonous, or part of ancestral North America. The second interpretation, and the one favoured by Nixon (1998) and Scheel et al (2005) , suggests that the ultramafic suite is part of the Mesozoic accreted island-arc terrane of Quesnellia, which in this locality was thrust eastward onto the margin of the North American craton. This latter interpretation conforms to the geological setting of similar, documented Alaskan-type ultramafic intrusions.

Regardless of which interpretation is correct, it is worthy of note that the Turnagain ultramafic suite is situated along a major terrane boundary, or in a geological setting not dissimilar to many of the major nickel-bearing mafic intrusions of the Canadian Shield.

Numerous other ultramafic bodies in this area are non-zoned Alpine-type bodies which cut sedimentary rocks  of  Cache  Creek  terrane.  Most  of  these  are  serpentinized  and  an  example  is  the  Letain  asbestos deposit southeast of the Turnagain property which hosts some 15 million tonnes grading 4.7% asbestos fibre.

The area east of Dease Lake features diverse geology and a number of mineral deposits and occurrences. The best known of these include the Kutcho Creek massive sulphide deposits hosted by late Triassic felsic  volcanic  rocks  (Figure  4-1).  The  main  zone  includes  a  measured  and  indicated  resource  of  11.6 million tonnes grading 2.22% copper, 2.98% zinc, 38.1 grams/tonne silver and 0.47 gram/tonne gold and 2.1 million tonnes grading 3.26% copper, 5.86% zinc, 75.7 grams/tonne silver and 0.71 gram/tonne gold in  the  higher  grade  Esso  West  zone  (Western  Keltic  Mines  Inc.  news  release,  January  11,  2005).  The Eaglehead porphyry deposit, west of the Turnagain property and hosted by early Jurassic granitic rocks, includes a reported 30 million tones grading 0.41% copper, 0.01% molybdenum, 2.71 grams/tonne silver and 0.20 gram/tonne gold.

## 7.2 Local and Property Geology

The generalized geological setting of the northern part of the Turnagain property is shown in Figure 7-3. Dominant  is  the  Turnagain  ultramafic  suite  which  measures  8  by  3.5  kilometres  and  is  elongate  in  a northwest direction and is conformable with the regional structural grain. The ultramafic body is in fault contact with early Paleozoic graphitic phyllites and lesser calc-silicate and quartz-rich tuff layers along its northern and eastern margins. Country rocks proximal to the intrusion display no evidence of contact metamorphism  but  the  ultramafic  rocks  near  the  fault  contact  are  serpentinized  (Scheel  et  al,  2005). Diamond drilling to date suggests that the poorly exposed southwestern margin of the intrusion is in intrusive  contact  with  metasedimentary,  volcaniclastic  and  carbonate  rocks  of  possible  Triassic  age.  A large raft of similar rocks in the northwestern part of the intrusive suite is reported by Scheel et al (2005) as being hornfelsed.

The Turnagain ultramafic suite broadly consists of a central dunite core with peripheral units of wehrlite (olivine+clinopyroxene-rich peridotite), olivine clinopyroxenite, clinopyroxenite and hornblendite, all of which  represent  crystal  cumulate  sequences  (Clark,1980,  Nixon,1998).  Gabbro,  common  to  many Alaskan-type complexes, has not been recognized (Nixon,1998).

As indicated on Figure 7-3, variably serpentinized dunite, the most widespread exposed unit, is flanked by wehrlite,  olivine  clinopyroxenite,  pyroxenite  and  hornblendite  along  the  eastern,  southern  and  western margins  of  the  intrusive  suite.  Contacts  between  the  ultramafic  phases  are  gradational  and  difficult  to follow although magnesium/calcium ratios derived from analyses of drill cores have proven to be useful in determining the boundaries of the various units.

In detail, the central dunite is massive and consists solely of olivine with minor chromite and pyroxene. Locally significant concentrations of cumulus chromite are present in this unit. Dunite weathers to a light brown  colour  which  is  particularly  evident  in  the  higher  (northern)  parts  of  the  property.  On  fresh surfaces, this unit is dark green to black as are the other units. Layering on a small scale has been noted in a few localities. Serpentinization of dunite is variable but may amount to 10% by volume (Scheel et al, 2005). Wehrlite, the second most abundant rock unit and an important host for sulphide mineralization, mainly  consists  of  cumulus  olivine  and  intercumulus  clinopyroxene.  Clinopyroxenites  and  olivine clinopyroxenites, mainly exposed in the southwestern and northwestern parts of the intrusion (Figure 73) consist mainly of clinopyroxene with lesser olivine and alteration minerals. While most of these appear to be differentiates of original magma, coarser, intrusive varieties have also been noted. Hornblendites in the  northwestern  part  of  the  intrusion  include  both  cumulus  hornblende  and  hornblende  replacing pyroxene.

A 1700 x 300 metres, elongate hornblende diorite to granodiorite body intrudes hornblendite and dunite in  the  central  part  of  the  intrusive  suite  and  is  offset  by  an  east-northeast  striking  fault  (Figure  7-3). Recent age dating indicates the granodiorite and ultramafic units have similar ages of 190 Ma (Scheel et al; in  prep.). Narrow porphyritic granitic dykes, usually in the order of 1 to 2 metres in width and clearly post-mineral, were noted cutting wehrlites and clinopyroxenites in drill core.  Numerous inliers, xenoliths and small inclusions of hornfelsed, calc-silicate metasedimentary rocks, similar to those seen marginal to the ultramafic intrusion, are present within the ultramafic intrusive rocks.

## 8 DEPOSIT TYPE

The Turnagain nickel deposit is classified as an ultramafic associated magmatic nickel sulphide deposit. The host Turnagain Complex is a zoned, Alaskan-type ultramafic.

## 9 MINERALIZATION

The Turnagain ultramafic intrusion is regarded as unusual in that it hosts relatively abundant sulphide minerals for an Alaskan-type complex (Clark,1980; Nixon,1998). A number of showings of semi-massive and massive sulphides have been identified by work to date (Figure 7-3). These semi-massive and massive zones, plus broad zones of disseminated sulphides, are invariably hosted by dunite and wehrlite near the southern and eastern margins of the ultramafic body (Figure 7-3). The central dunite is essentially devoid of sulphide minerals although it is worthy of note that the highly magnesian olivine is more enriched in nickel (up to 0.20-0.30% weight percent) than the olivines in the peridotites and pyroxenites which have been reported to be depleted in nickel in areas of sulphide mineralization. Nixon (1998) suggests that these features are further evidence of fractional crystallization of the ultramafic magma.

The association of sulphide minerals with wehrlite-dunite and, to a lesser degree, with clinopyroxenites, was recognized during earliest exploratory work on the property. McDougall and Clark (1972) state that contact  areas  between  pyroxenites  and  peridotites  (wehrlites  and  dunite)  appear  to  be  the  most prospective zones in which to prospect for nickel.

Primary sulphide minerals consist mainly of pyrrhotite with lesser pentlandite (iron-nickel sulphide) and minor chalcopyrite.  Some bornite has been reported. The writer concurs with other investigators that these are magmatic sulphides. Intercumulus and blebby sulphides, with grain sizes ranging from 1 to 4 millimetres, are evident in widespread disseminated zones  seen in drill cores. With  increasing concentrations, these intercumulus sulphide grains coalesce to form net-textured sulphides. Semi-massive and massive sulphides, and rare sulphide matrix breccias, were also noted in drill cores over intervals not exceeding a few tens of centimeters.

Narrow  fracture-filling  sulphide  lenses,  commonly  featuring  chalcopyrite  and  minor  pentlandite  along with the more prevalent pyrrhotite, appear to be products of remobilization of primary sulphides adjacent to dykes, altered xenoliths and serpentinized areas.

Secondary nickel and copper sulphides, including violarite and valleriite, have been noted in serpentinized zones  and  both  primary  and  secondary  sulphides  are  associated  with  graphite  (Nixon,1998).  Recent microscopic and microprobe studies of drill core samples from the Horsetrail zone (Kucha, 2005) have identified  additional  nickel  sulphide  minerals  including  mackinawite,  heazlewoodite,  godlevskite  and millerite. Platinum group element minerals identified to date include vysotskite, a palladium-iron-nickel sulphide and sperrylite, a platinum arsenide mineral.

The principal mineral zones identified to date on the Turnagain property (Figure 7-3) include the original Discovery  Zone  which  is  exposed  along  Turnagain  River  and  contains  nickel-copper  values  plus anomalous  platinum.  The  Fishing  Rock  Zone,  also  adjacent  to  Turnagain  River  southwest  of  the Discovery Zone, consists of disseminated sulphides in wehrlite. The Cliff Zone, 1.5 kilometres east of Turnagain  River,  features  pyrrhotite,  pentlandite  and  chalcopyrite  within  a  100  x  75  metres  area.  The Northwest zone, near the southern contact of the intrusive body, and the Davis showing, situated near the northern margin of the ultramafic complex, include interstitial pyrrhotite and minor chalcopyrite in

wehrlite and clinopyroxenite. Two new discoveries in 2006 are in the Hatzl area located southeast of the Horsetrail Zone and the Duffy area lying 500 metres northeast of the Horsetrail.

The Horsetrail Zone, and the adjacent Northwest Zone have been the focus of most of the historic and recent  diamond  drilling  (Figure  7-3).  Results  to  date  suggest  a  northwest  to  west-northwest  trend  for both  of  these  zones  which  consist  of  broadly  dispersed,  disseminated  to  intercumulus  sulphide mineralization in both dunite and wehrlite and in particular, in contact areas between the two rock types.

In  detail,  the  Horsetrail  Zone  includes  several,  parallel,  west-northwest-striking,  steeply  north-dipping lenses  of  &gt;0.25%  nickel  which  are  separated  by  intervals  of  sulphide  mineralization  containing  lower nickel  grades.  Within  the  zone,  the  transition  from  dunite  to  wehrlite  is  marked  by  an  increase  in clinopyroxene, due in part to the contamination of the ultramafic magma by partially digested xenoliths of  metasedimentary  rocks  containing  sulphur,  graphite,  calcium  and  silica.  It  is  thought  that  these xenoliths not only provided the elements for crystallization of clinopyroxene to form wehrlite but also resulted in the precipitation of iron-nickel sulphides. As such, there appears to be a spatial relationship between  graphitic  xenoliths,  increasing  clinopyroxene  content  in  the  ultramafic  host  rocks  and  the incidence of sulphide mineralization.

Sulphide grains within the broad zones of disseminated to intercumulus mineralization range in size from 0.5 to 5 millimetres and commonly rim olivine grains. Pyrrhotite is the most abundant sulphide mineral; zones  of  higher  grade  nickel  mineralization  feature  pentlandite  grains  enclosed  in  pyrrhotite.  Where present, chalcopyrite occurs along the margins of pyrrhotite and in narrow veinlets.

As noted, relatively unaltered dunite adjacent to the Horsetrail zone may contain nickel values of 0.20 to 0.30%,  virtually  all  of  which  is  encapsulated  in  the  silicate  mineral  olivine  and  consequently  is  not  of current  economic  importance.  Nevertheless,  dunite  with  high  background  levels  of  nickel  may  be  an indicator of potential nearby nickel sulphide mineralization.

The Hatzl Zone was discovered in 2006 by exploration drilling of several airborne geophysical anomalies identified during  2004.  Mineralization consists of disseminated  and  net  textured  pyrrhotite and pentlandite hosted by dunite and wehrlite. This mineralization is similar in texture and host rock to the Horsetrail Zone and may be continuous with the Horsetrail as the area between has not been tested.

The Duffy Zone was also discovered by exploration drilling in 2006 designed to test the eastern contact of the ultramafic complex and coincident geophysical and geochemical anomalies.

The Highland area lies 3 kilometres north-northwest of the Horsetrail Deposit and was discovered in 2005. It was tested by 6 core holes in 2006.

A magnetitie-rich pegmatite horizon containing platinum and palladium mineralization was discovered 3 kilometres  northwest  of  the  Horsetrail  Zone  in  2004.  Subsequent  drilling  has  expanded  the  apparent strike length of the horizon to 1.1 km.  This includes targets labeled the Bench, DJ and DB zones.

## 10 EXPLORATION

The Turnagain property was acquired in 1996 and the exploration program that year included 400 linekilometres  of  fixed-wing  magnetic  survey  and  795.3  metres  of  core  drilling  in  5  holes.    Addition  core drilling completed in 1997 and 1998 amounted to 3,119 metres in 14 holes.  Holes were targeted to test mainly beneath mineralization exposed in the Hatzl, Cliff, Discovery, Horsetrail and Northwest areas. Related work included 18 line-kilometres of surface magnetic surveys, covering two small areas on the

property, bore-hole pulse-electromagnetic surveys in four of the 1997-1998 drill holes and preliminary metallurgical testwork on drill composite samples.

In  2002,  work  resumed  on  the  property  with  ground  magnetic  and  Induced  Polarization  geophysical surveys over the eastern portion of the ultramafic intrusion and 1,687 metres of core drilling in 7 holes.

Exploratory work in 2003 was focussed on extending the Horsetrail mineralization encountered in 2002. Twenty-two  holes  and  the  deepening  of  a  2002  hole  were  completed  for  a  total  of  8,672  metres.    A reconnaissance  geochemical  sampling  program  carried  out  in  2003  was  the  first  attempt  to  gain information outside of the drill area and consisted of the collection and analyses of 250 soil samples at 100  metres  spacing  along  four  topographic  contour  lines  between  1300  and  1460  metres  elevation, northwest and upslope of the principal mineralized zones. An analysis and interpretation of the results obtained from these samples was undertaken by Dr. Colin E. Dunn, P.Geo., on behalf of the company in early  2004.    Results  for  copper,  nickel,  cobalt  and  platinum+palladium  were  kriged  and  contoured  as 90th,  80th,  70th  and  50th  percentiles.  Coincident  and  higher  copper,  cobalt  and  platinum+palladium values  were  concentrated  within  an  area  between  3  and  4  kilometres  west-northwest  of  the  Horsetrail zone. Higher nickel values in soils were more widespread and are coincident with the Horsetrail area, and several  areas  north  and northwest of the Horsetrail area.  Results from these reconnaissance soil lines were considered very sufficiently encouraging to plan for a larger, systematic geochemical soil survey in 2004.

Towards the end of 2003, metallurgical flotation tests were initiated on composite core samples from the 2002 and 2003 drill programs.

A reconnaissance biogeochemical survey, carried out in April, 2004, consisted of the collection of 132 twig  and  bark  samples  along  four  transects  over  the  Turnagain  ultramafic  intrusion.  Analytical  results were not as definitive as those obtained from previous soil sampling and a comprehensive geochemical soil  sampling  program  was  initiated  in  mid-2004  to  follow  up  and  expand  upon  results  of  the  2003 surveys.

The 2004 program consisted of 49 drill holes for 7,633 metres, a helicopter-borne geophysical survey and extensive soil and rock sampling.  The geochemical soil survey involved the collection of more than 2,000 soil samples collected at 50 metres intervals along survey lines at 200 metres spacing within an area of 15 square kilometres. More detailed sampling was undertaken in areas yielding anomalous base and precious  metals  results.  Results  of  this  survey  include  two  strong  copper-in-soil  anomalies  located  2.5 kilometres  northwest  of  the  Horsetrail  zone.  Values  exceed  430  parts  per  million  (ppm)  copper  (with peaks to 3219 ppm copper) over areas of 1500 x 1100 metres and 900 x 600 metres. These anomalous areas  (DJ-DB  area)  flank  the  hornblende  diorite-granodiorite  intrusion  which  intrudes  the  ultramafic rocks in this area. Anomalous platinum-palladium values in soils are often coincident with the anomalous copper values.  Drill holes in 2004, 2005 and 2006, located to test the stronger platinum-palladium soil anomalies,  intersected  long  intervals  of  anomalous  platinum  and  palladium,  including  49.8  metres averaging 0.96 g/tonne platinum plus palladium in hole 05-88.

Anomalous  nickel  values  in  soils  are  widespread  over  the  northern  part  of  the  Turnagain  ultramafic intrusion  from  the  Highland  area  southeast  towards  the  Horsetrail  mineralization,  a  distance  of  three kilometers.  Much of the nickel soil anomaly is the result of sampling disintegrating nickel-rich dunite and is not directly related to nickel sulphides.  However, several drill holes in the Highland area did intersect disseminated nickel sulphides near several of the higher nickel soil anomalies.

The  2004  geochemical  program  also  included  the  collection  and  analyses  of  330  rock  float  and  243 bedrock samples from within and adjacent to the soil geochemical grid. Significant total nickel results

(&gt;0.20% to a maximum of 1.9%) in both float and bedrock samples are mainly clustered in the area of the  Horsetrail  zone  and  in  a  smaller  area  north  of  the  DJ  zone.  Enhanced  platinum-palladium  values (&gt;300 ppb to &gt;600 ppb) are coincident with the nickel values in the area north of the DJ zone and are more broadly dispersed in the area of the Horsetrail zone.  A more detailed description and illustration of the results of the 2004 soil and rock sampling program is given by Carter, P.Eng (2005) in his Report on the 2004 Exploration progam.

Surface  geophysical  surveys  undertaken  in  2004  were  directed  to  the  Horsetrail  zone  and  included  16 line-kilometres of magnetometer and VLF-EM surveys and 9 line-kilometres of transient EM coverage. The transient EM survey identified a number of east-west conductors within the Horsetrail zone; these have apparent strike lengths of up to 600 metres and are estimated to extend to depths of more than 100 metres. Down-hole transient EM surveys completed in 9 diamond drill holes aided the interpretation of the surface survey and also identified several off-hole conductors, at depths of up to 270 metres below surface, which remain untested.

An airborne geophysical survey was completed over the Turnagain property by AeroQuest Limited in late September of 2004. The survey utilized a helicopter-borne AeroTEM II time domain electromagnetic system and a high sensitivity  cesium  vapour magnetometer. Continuous readings on both instruments were  obtained  from  northeast-southwest  oriented  survey  lines  at  50  to  200  metres  spacings;  precise locations were established using a global positioning system (GPS). Terrain clearance was 30 metres and the survey totaled 1866 linekilometres (Ruddx, 2005).

The  magnetic  response  confirmed  the  results  of  earlier  surveys,  accurately  outlining  the  limits  of  the Turnagain ultramafic intrusion (Figure 10-1). Magnetic data ranged from lows of 55,000 nanoteslas (nT) to highs of 63,000 nT; average background was 57,800 nT (Rudd, 2005).

Electromagnetic anomalies were classified by conductance and by the thickness of the source. Early Off Time  TAU  electromagnetic  response  is  illustrated  on  Figure  10-1  and  the  data  is  dominated  by  the response  from  the  highly  graphitic  and  conductive  metasedimentary  rocks  units  which  border  the ultramafic  intrusion.  The  highlighted  electromagnetic  anomalies  within  the  intrusion  are  of  interest, particularly  those  labeled  Bench  Area,  Highland Area, Hatzl and Horsetrail Zone (Figure 10-1). All of these include multi-channel responses and with well defined dips.

Exploration drilling in 2005 and 2006 targeted a number of electromagnetic conductors in the Bench, Highland,  Hatzl  and  Horsetrail  areas,  located  within  the  ultramafic  complex,  and  several  conductors adjacent to the ultramafic - metasedimentary contacts.  Most of the conductors were caused by seams of graphite,  semi-massive  pyrrhotite  or  a  combination  of  the  two  with,  unfortunately,  only  minor  nickel sulphides.  However, conductors in the Horsetrail, Hatzl and also in a portion of the Highland area, while still  caused  by  graphite  and  pyrrhotite,  were  present  within  wide  zones  of  disseminated  to  blebby pyrrhotite-pentlandite mineralization.  Grade and size of these mineralized zones justified additional stepout drilling in 2005 and 2006.  Overall conductivity in the Horsetrail area is probably enhanced by finely disseminated graphite or carbonaceous material in the matrix of the altered dunite and wehrlite.

Five  holes  were  designed  to  test  electromagnetic  conductors  in  the  DJ-DB  area  and  intersected pyrrhotite±chalcopyrite±pyrite in clinopyroxenite and hornblendite clinopyroxenite.  Platinum-palladium values in three holes warrant additional drill holes.

Conductors along the southern portion of the Cliff area remain untested.

Although the 2006 exploration program was dominated by 19,121.8 metres of NQ core drilling in 68 holes, limited fill-in soil geochemical sampling and rock-saw channel sampling helped to define targets for

future drilling.  Fifty-two of the drill holes in 2006 program were designed as step-out holes to increase the  resource  in  the  Northwest-Horsetrail-Hatzl  areas.    The  remaining  holes  tested  conductors  and/or ultramafic-metasedimentary  contacts  in  the  Highland,  Duffy  and  towards  the  western  edge  of  the ultramafic complex.  Significant intervals of intercumulus pyrrhotite and pentlandite were intersected in the Duffy area, located 900 metres northeast of the Horsetrail.  Additional drill holes will be required to establish a connection, if any, between the Duffy and Horsetrail mineralization.

## 11 DRILLING

The Turnagain ultramafic intrusion has been tested by 50,935 metres of diamond drilling in 230 holes since  1966  (Table  11-1).  Sixty-eight  inclined  NQ  core  holes  (19,122  metres)  were  completed  by  Hard Creek  Nickel  Corporation  in  2006  and  one  previous  hole  was  deepened.  The  drill  hole  locations  are shown in Figure 11-1 and details listed in Appendix I and II.

- * One 2003 drill hole was also extended
- ** One 2005 drill hole was extended

Most of the holes drilled to date have been inclined. Initial drilling by Falconbridge between 1966 and 1970 recovered QXT and AQ core; BQ size (36.4 mm diameter) core has been recovered since 1996 by drill  contractor DJ Drilling. The last nine holes of the 2004 program recovered NQ-size core. In 2005 holes drilled in, and peripheral to, the Horsetrail Zone also recovered NQ-size core. Seven BQ core holes were drilled on more remote targets using a helicopter-portable drill rig. Core recoveries are excellent, averaging  95%.  Most  drill  holes  have  been  sampled  over  their  entire  lengths;  sample  intervals  do  not exceed 2 metres in length.

Drill core from holes drilled between 1996 and 2002 is stored in racks at the Boulder camp on Wheaton Creek 15 kilometres west of the property. Core recovered from all the 2003 to 2006 programs is stored at the camp on the property.

During 2006, sixty-eight core holes were completed and one older hole extended for a total of 19,121.8 metres. Drilling was carried out by DJ Drilling of Surrey, B.C. using one skid-mounted LY38 drilling NQ size  core  and  one  helicopter  supported  LF70  drilling  NQ  size  core.  A  206B  helicopter  from  Pacific Western Helicopters of Dease Lake was used for drill moves and crew changes for holes 06-135 to 06157.  Recoveries  were  generally  better  than  95%  and  down  hole  surveys  indicate  that  holes  generally deviate  only  a  few  metres  from  collar  to  end  of  hole.  The  2006  targets  consisted  of  AeroTEM conductors,  magnetic  anomalies,  geochemical  soil  anomalies,  and  potential  extensions  of  known mineralization.

## 11.1  Collar Surveying

Hole locations were surveyed to centimeter accuracy with dual frequency GPS equipment. Azimuth and inclination of casing were also accurately determined in order to initialize the downhole survey tool. Most of the hole collars and casing orientation for 2003-2005 holes drilled in the Horsetrail area were surveyed. All surveying between 2004 and 2006 was conducted by Gabriel Aucoin, CLS, of Aucoin Surveys Ltd.

## Downhole Surveying

A Reflex Maxibor® unit was used for most downhole surveying during the 2004, 2005 and 2006 drill programs.  Where casing was intact, 2002 and 2003 holes were re-entered and surveyed with the Maxibor instrument.  A  number  of  holes  were  not  surveyed  either  because  they  were  initial  exploration  holes drilled  outside  of  the  Horsetrail  area  (04-42  to  59,  05-85  to  89  and  101,  06-141  to  143),  damaged  or missing  casing  prevented  re-entry  or  the  tool  was  not  available.    Where  Maxibor  surveys  were  not conducted, acid dip tests provided limited control on hole orientation.

Figure 11-2 is a plot of dowhole azimuths vs collar azimuths from the Maxibor surveys. Most of the drill holes  are  oriented  either  close  to  180 ° or  between  030  and  055 ° and  show  a  very  slight  tendency  to increase (clockwise deviation).

Figure 11-2 Comparison downhole vs collar azimuths

Figure 11-3 is a plot of dowhole dips vs collar inclination and shows a clear tendency for dips to steepen slightly except for a series of NQ holes drilled angles between -55 and -65 degrees.  The steepening is somewhat more pronounced in the survey results from BQ drilling.

Figure 11-3 Comparison of downhole vs collar dips

Scatterplots were also generated showing the changes in azimuth and inclination between the collar and downhole surveys (Figures 11-4 and 5).  Trend lines show that, with a few exceptions, the azimuths tend to stay stay within 5 degrees of the collar orientation while inclinations tend to steepen by a few degrees. The smalle diameter BQ holes show only slightly more deviation than the NQ holes.

## 11.2 Summary and Interpretation of Drilling Results

During  the  2006  exploration  program  58  inclined  NQ-size  core  holes  were  completed  in  the  present resource area for a total length of 14861.5m (average depth of 286m).  Twelve of these holes were drilled to determine the near surface extent and grade of the Horsetrail mineralization and upgrade part of the 2005  resource  estimate  from  an  inferred  to  an  indicated  category.    Twenty  holes  were  fill-in  and definition for the Northwest Zone. Twelve holes explored the Hatzl Zone and eight were drilled on the Duffy Zone. Holes were oriented north or south and inclined at -48 to -86 degrees to intersect the eastwest striking mineralization at close to optimum angle.

In all, 35 of the 58 holes drilled in the resource area intersected significant disseminated and net-textured pyrrhotite-pentlandite mineralization. Drilling results to date have outlined mineralization over a strike length of 2700 metres and a width of up to 700 metres.  The mineralization remains open at depth in all zones and lateral boundaries have only been partially defined.  The area between the Horsetrail and Hatzl zone has not been tested.

The twenty holes drilled outside of the resource area were designed to test magnetic and electromagnetic anomalies, geological contacts, geochemical soil anomalies and areas of minor, disseminated sulphides.  A number of conductive pyrrhotite and/or graphitic intervals were intersected as well as several intervals of finely disseminated sulphides, but nickel values were disappointingly low.

## 12 SAMPLING METHOD AND APPROACH

Drill  core  from  the  2006  program  was  logged  and  marked  for  sampling  by  C.  Baldys,  P.Eng.,  Bruce Northcote P.Geo., Greg Ross, Jeff Kyba and Erik Scheel.  Drill core was sampled at 4 metres intervals or less and halved by use of a hydraulic core splitter and/or a diamond saw. Half of the core is stored in core boxes on site and half sent for analysis.

On arrival at the core logging facility the core was treated or examined as follows:

- · washed if necessary to remove drill water additives
- · location of depth markers and metric conversion checked
- · core marked in one metre intervals
- · core recovery, RQD and additional geotechnical parameters measured
- · magnetic susceptibility and electrical conductivity measured
- · metal tags, marked with hole number, core interval and box number, stapled to end of core box
- · core photographed
- · core logged for lithology, structure, alteration and mineralization
- · core marked with sample numbers and sample intervals
- · specific gravity measured on selected intervals by the water immersion method
- · core split, placed in sequentially numbered plastic bags and closed with wire ties
- · groups of 5 core samples for analysis secured in numbered, addressed bags for shipment
- · reference  pulps  inserted  every  25  samples  and  field  blanks  every  30  samples  to  monitor laboratory performance
- · primary analytical laboratory requested to forward every 10 th  sample pulp to the check laboratory for analysis

Split core samples were numbered and bagged and were transported, in numbered bags, from the site by helicopter, in 300-350kg lots, to Dease Lake and shipped by commercial transport to Acme Analytical Laboratories, a certified ISO 9002 facility, in Vancouver. ALS Chemex, in North Vancouver, is also an ISO registered laboratory and was the check analytical facility for 2006 samples.

## 13 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND SECURITY

Drill  core  samples  received  by  Acme  Analytical  were  checked  against  requisition  documents  prior  to being  dried,  weighed,  crushed,  split  and  pulverized  prior  to  being  subjected  to  a  variety  of  analytical techniques.

Samples were analyzed for platinum, palladium, and gold by lead-collection fire-assay fusion followed by inductively  coupled  plasma  emission  spectroscopy  (ICP-ES)  and  results  reported  in  parts  per  billion (ppb).  Sulphur  content,  used  to  assist  in  distinguishing  between  silicate  and  sulphide  nickel  and,  to  a lesser extent, cobalt, was analyzed by the Leco furnace method. Prior to 2004, samples were also analyzed for nickel, copper, cobalt, and approximately twenty major and minor elements by aqua regia digestion followed by an ICP-ES finish. Although aqua regia digestion is routinely used to determine metal content of sulphide mineralization in more siliceous host rocks, it is not the most suitable digestion method for lower-grade nickel sulphide mineralization hosted by olivine-bearing ultrabasic rocks. Not only is nickel a major component in several sulphide minerals such as pentlandite, it can also occur in amounts of up to 0.20  to  0.30  percent  within  the  crystal  structure  of  olivine,  a  silicate  soluble  in  hydrochloric  acid.  As noted,  to  assist  in  distinguishing  nickel  in  sulphide  from  nickel  in  silicate  phases,  samples  collected  in 2003 were analyzed for total sulphur and every tenth sample was analyzed for sulphide nickel with an ammonium acetate-hydrogen peroxide leach.

Samples  collected  from  the  2004,  2005  and  2006  programs  were  subjected  to  a  four  acid  (HNO3HCIO4-HF and HCI) digestion followed by ICP-ES analyses to determine values for total nickel, copper, cobalt, and 20 other elements. The nickel sulphide content of each sample was determined by analyzing a second  pulp  by  the  ammonium  acetate-hydrogen  peroxide  leach.  As  with  previous  procedures,  Leco sulphur contents also helped to distinguish between nickel sulphide and nickel silicate contents. Although nickel  analyses  reported  between  1996  and  2002  relied  on  aqua  regia  digestion  without  the  benefit  of determination  of  sulphur  contents  or  ammonium  acetate-hydrogen  peroxide  leach,  most  of  the significant mineralized intervals have been re-analyzed to determine sulphide nickel content or have been included  in  metallurgical  test  samples  to  determine  the  recoverable  nickel  content.  Sufficient  analyses have  been  completed  to  suggest  that  sulphide  nickel  contents  determined  by  ammonium  acetatehydrogen peroxide leach constitute between 60% and 95% of total nickel content.

## 13.1 Quality Assurance / Quality Control Program

Laboratory quality control was maintained by routinely analyzing internal standards, sample blanks and duplicate samples. Hard Creek Nickel staff also inserted standard reference samples with known nickel content  in  the  sample  sequence  every  25  samples  to  monitor  laboratory  accuracy.  Field  blanks  were inserted  every  30  samples  to  check  for  possible  laboratory  contamination.  For  every  30th  sample, duplicate pulps were prepared from separate rejects and analyzed to monitor laboratory error and sample homogeneity.

The field standards used for Ni, Cu and Co were two CANMET reference samples labeled 'U.M. 2' and 'U.M. 4' (GSC Paper 71-35). Both were derived from small lenticular masses of peridotite that occur along  a  major  east-west  fault  zone  in  the  Werner  Lake  district  of  northwestern  Ontario.    CANMET analysed the material for ascorbic acid-hydrogen peroxide soluble nickel and also by use of a four acid

digest  for  total  Ni  contents.  The  average  grades  of  the  standards  determined  by  the  initial  CANMET testing and by ACME laboratories in 2004 and 2005 are shown in the following table.

Table 13-1 Average grades (% total Ni) of certified reference materials

| CRM    |   CANMET  (1975) |   ACME  2004 |   ACME  2005 |
|--------|------------------|--------------|--------------|
| U.M. 2 |             0.39 |        0.36  |        0.357 |
| U.M. 4 |             0.25 |        0.247 |        0.244 |

Although the UM-2 and UM-4 standards were prepared by CANMET specifically as standards for total and sulphide nickel and have been in use for 30 years, the development of the standards in 1975 did not include a round robin test program. Thus, the mean values for total and sulphide nickel were not certified and there is no data on standard deviation between various analytical laboratories for the nickel values. Since Hard Creek has relied on UM-2 and UM-4 for analytical quality control during the last four years of drilling and during the metallurgical flotation tests, certification of these two standards was considered a priority.

In order to begin the certification process, CDN Resource Laboratories Ltd. was instructed to prepare pulps from the following samples;

- · UM-2
- · UM-4
- · HNC-94 is a composite from hole 05-94 between 108-156m with a head grade of 0.231% total nickel and 1.37% sulphur
- · HNC-103 is a composite from hole 05-103 between 113.4-124.4m with a head grade of 0.415% total nickel and 4.3% sulphur.

Ten  pulps  from  each  of  the  above  samples  were  forwarded  to  Acme,  IPL,  SGS  Lakefield,  Assayers Canada and Global Discovery Laboratory (Tech Cominco) for the following suite of analyses;

- · Four acid digestion followed by multi-element ICP analyses for total Ni, Cu, Co, Fe and Mg
- · Ammonium acetate / hydrogen peroxide leach followed by ICP analyses for Ni, Cu, Co, Fe and Mg (sulphide Ni, Cu and Co)
- · Total S by Leco
- · Samples 05-94 and 05-103 were also subjected to aqua regia digestion and multi-element ICP analyses for Ni, Cu, Co, Fe and Mg.

Analytical results from the five laboratories were forwarded to Smee and Associates Consulting Ltd. for review  and,  ultimately,  to  certify  the  various  mean  values  and  determine  between-laboratory  standard deviation.    Unfortunately,  there  was  considerable  variation  in  interest  and  competency  between  the laboratories.  Sufficient data was produced for Smee to certify means and determine between lab standard deviations for nickel and copper analyzed by ICP following four acid digestion.  Leco sulphur was also certified for three of the samples.  The attempt to certify results of the ammonium acetate / hydrogen peroxide leach for sulphide nickel, copper and cobalt was not successful.  Only two labs, Acme and IPL, produced  acceptable  results.    The  other  three  labs  either  could  not  follow  the  requested  protocol  or declined to participate. The certificates of analysis prepared by Smee &amp; Associates are in Appendix III.

In a discussion with Barry Smee regarding HNC's course of action after his inability to certify standards for sulphide nickel, copper and cobalt, he made the following comments;

- · He could not recommend any additional analytical laboratories, worldwide, capable of providing sulphide specific analyses for either round robin testing or routine analytical test-work,
- · Certification  of  standards  for  any  partial  extraction  process,  not  just  the  ammonium  acetate  / hydrogen peroxide  leach,  is  a  difficult  process.    Minor  differences  in  leach  time,  temperature, reagent strength, operator ability etc. can have a disproportionate effect on the results.  Even if the five laboratories had  all followed  the  recommended  protocol  and  produced  results, certification  was  not  assured.    Methods  involving  total  extraction  of  elements  are  obviously preferred by both analytical labs and those certifying analytical results.
- · In the absence of certified standards for sulphide Ni, Cu and Co, HNC could use the four years of  data  for  CANMET  standards  UM-2  and  UM-4  generated  by  Acme  and  IPL  to  continue establishing analytical limits for accepting future results.

Relying on previous results from only two labs to set the limits for determining QC/QA parameters is not ideal, but it does represent data collected over a four-year period using various batches of reagents and  several  laboratory  technicians.    HNC  has  recently  forwarded  10  pulps  from  the  four  standards mentioned  above  to  another  laboratory  with  some  experience  in  sulphide  specific  leaches  but,  as  of writing  this  report,  had  not  received  any  results.    Monitoring  analytical  results  for  UM-2  and  UM-4, during  the  last  few  years,  has  alerted  HNC  to  changes  in  operator  and/or  reagents,  which  were  then corrected by Acme.

A total of 243 field standards were inserted into the sample stream during the 2006 drill program (Figures 13-1 to 13-4). The results are generally acceptable with few samples exceeding two standard deviations from the  mean  for  both  total  Ni  and  AC  Ni.  In  four  cases  where  analytical  results  for  the  reference standards  differed  significantly  (more  than  two  standard  deviations)  from  their  acceptable  range,  or  if there was evidence of contamination, the laboratory re-analyzed the compromised batch of samples.

In general, ACME shows a slight low bias for total Ni which is more pronounced in the UM-4 standard (Figure 13-2). The average of all the 2006 standard assays for UM-4 from ACME was 0.240 compared to the certified mean of 0.244.

A review of the 2006 AC Ni sample sequence plots (Fig. 13-3 and 4) shows a noticeable drop in the ACME mean grade which occurred around mid September. The magnitude is only around 0.015% (UM2) and is still within 2 standard deviations of the mean so is not considered to be significant.

The field blank material used was crushed granite gneiss obtained from Squamish. A total of 94 blanks were inserted into the sample stream during the 2006 program.

## 14 DATA VERIFICATION

Laboratory quality control was maintained by routinely analyzing internal standards, sample blanks and duplicate samples. Hard Creek Nickel staff also inserted standard reference samples with known nickel content in the sample sequence every 25 samples to monitor laboratory accuracy. Field blanks were also inserted in sample batches to check for possible laboratory contamination.

## 14.1 Core Duplicates

In 2004, twenty-seven intervals of quarter split core duplicates were analyzed in order to test for sampling variability. Plots of the quarter split core against the original half split core grades are shown in figures 141 and 14-2. Results show a very good agreement on average with mean absolute differences of 0.016% for total Ni and 0.013% for AC Ni.

## 14.2 Pulp Reject Duplicates

A  total  of  228  pulp  reject  duplicates  from  the  2006  drilling  program  were  analyzed  as  part  of ACME's internal verification procedure. Plots of the pulp reject duplicates against the original analyses for AC Ni and total Ni are shown in the following charts. Results show excellent agreement with a mean absolute difference of 0.002%.

Acme's performance was also monitored by sending a separate pulp from every tenth sample to ALS Chemex, in Vancouver, for check analyses. A total of 465 pulps from the 2006 drilling programs were analyzed by ALS-Chemex for Ni, Cu, Co, S, Pt and Pd. The comparison with the initial ACME analyses for  total  Ni  and  Co  ares  shown  as  a  scatterplot  charts  in  Figure  14-5  and  6.  On  average  the  total  Ni grades from ACME were 5% higher than those from ALS-Chemex.  This is a significant improvement over the 2005-2006 rechecks which averaged 11% higher. Cobalt values from ACME are also marginally higher than the re-checks.

## 14.3 Coarse Reject Duplicates

A  total  of  378  coarse  reject  duplicates  from  the  2006  drilling  program  were  analyzed  as  part  of ACME's internal verification procedure. Plots of the coarse reject duplicates against the original analyses for AC Ni and total Ni are shown the following charts. Results show excellent agreement with a mean absolute difference of 0.004%.

## 16 MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING

A  summary  of  the  metallurgical  testing  up  to  and  including  2004  is  reported  by  Nick  Carter,  P.Eng (2005), and for 2005 by Ron Simpson, P.Eng. (2006).  Since the 2006 Simpson report the metallurgical program has continued with using the 2005 drill core primarily obtained from the Horsetrail Zone, which includes portions of the North West Zone.  Testing recently began on the 2006 drill core as soon as the composites were received by the metallurgical laboratory in March 2007.  None of the flotation results from  the  2006  drill  core  program  were  available  at  the  time  of  writing  this  report.    To  reduce  time requirements and improve storage practices for making up the metallurgical composites the company has leased property in Chilliwack BC.  From this site, the assay rejects will be catalogued, stored, and blended for making up the composites used in future metallurgical programs.  For 2007, assay rejects from the geological  program  will  be  shipped  directly  to  Chilliwack  from  a  sample  preparation  lab  operated  by ACME Laboratories in Smithers, BC.

Frank Wright, P.Eng., has provided a summary of the procedure and results of the metallurgical program. A primary  objective  of  the  current  mineral  processing  philosophy  is  to  define  what  ore  zones  of  the deposit  have  the  highest  probability  to  produce  a  saleable  flotation  concentrate,  suitable  for  direct shipment to smelters.  Ideally, this would be to target a flotation concentrate nickel (Ni) grade above 9%, and containing less than 8% magnesium oxide (MgO), while still maintaining acceptable Ni recoveries. Alternately  an  on-site  hydrometallurgical  plant  can  be  contemplated  which  can  treat  lower  grade concentrates  with  higher  MgO  content.    In  particular,  identifying  ore  zones  that  produce  saleable concentrate closer to surface would be more relevant in order to reduce the upfront capital requirements by  delaying  construction  of  a  hydrometallurgical  treatment  circuit  until  such  time  that  it  is  required. Metallurgical data is to be implemented into the mine data base as part of the engineering evaluation.  At current  metal  prices  over  90%  of  the  project  value  is  in  the  nickel  content.    Cobalt  and  copper  are followed as a by-product credit.  Platinum group elements (PGE) are monitored as potential by-products for some portions of the resource.

Since  the  last  technical  report  (Simpson,  2006)  the  laboratory  bench  scale  test  work  has  continued  to focus on the concentration of nickel minerals using sulphide flotation techniques.  As well there have been preliminary studies relating to comminution and hydrometallurgical treatment.  Laboratory studies were  performed by  SGS  Research,  of  Lakefield  Ontario,  and  by  Process  Research  Associates  Ltd.,  of Richmond, BC.  Drill hole composites were blended from drill core, assay rejects that were contiguous to a single drill hole and typically measured between 15 m to 80 m in length.  Intervals were selected for blending based on the characteristics relating to the mineralogy and lithology, as well as nickel and sulfur head grades.  The tested composite samples were obtained from drill holes 05-90 consecutive to 05-108. Further process studies are scheduled over the next several months on 2006 composite samples obtained from drill holes 06-109 consecutive to 06-175.

In addition laboratory studies were performed on master composites that were obtained by recombining some of the 2005 drill hole composites.  Selection of sub-samples for the 2005 master composites was based on the head grade, sulfur to nickel ratio in the head, and the flotation response to best represent the  various  areas  of  the  resource.    Bench  scale  studies  on  the  master  composites  focused  on  further flotation optimization, as well as locked cycle studies, both of which are continuing.  One to two flotation pilot plant runs, each using up to two tonnes of 2005 master composite material is planned for spring 2007.    The  primary  purpose  of  the  piloting  is  to  produce  a  sufficient  quantity  of  concentrate  for  a

preliminary technical evaluation using various pyrometallurgical and  hydrometallurgical treatment options.

The conceptual mineral processing flowsheet remains similar to earlier studies for production of a bulk concentrate,  at  a  primary  grind  of  ~80%  passing  125  microns,  and  cleaned  in  4  or  5  stages,  without regrinding.  A rougher scavenger concentrate may also be produced for recycle or for separate cleaning of a secondary lower grade product.  Principal flotation reagents consisted of xanthate as a collector, copper sulfate as an activator, MIBC as a frother, and CMC as a dispersant.  Additional modifications to reagents and circuit design are being tested.

Provided that the mineralogy and head grade were similar, the concentrate grades and recoveries obtained during recent open cycle flotation tests were similar to earlier work undertaken on composites obtained primarily from the central portion of the Horsetrail Zone  However, the majority of the recent tests were preformed on material obtained from drill holes at locations that extend the resource out from the central Horsetrail  Zone.    The  new  resource  areas  resulted  in  some  corresponding  differences  in  the  sample mineralogy.  Among the most important mineralogical differences is the total sulfur (S) to sulfide nickel ratio  in  the  feed.    Drill  hole  composites  to  the  north and  east  trend  toward  a  lower  total  S  to  sulfide nickel  ratio  in  the  head.    This  type  of  feed  can  produce  higher  grade  concentrates,  but often  at  lower recoveries,  and  typically  carry  more  magnesium  oxide  (MgO)  minerals.    In  sufficiently  high  amounts MgO can make the flotation concentrate unsuitable for pyrometallurgical treatment and increase costs for hydrometallurgical treatment.  Evaluation of various flotation reagents and the use of column flotation will be examined in hopes of improving rejection of MgO to the final concentrate.

Composites  showing  higher  sulfur  to  sulfide  nickel  ratio  tend  to  exhibit  a  lower  grade  flotation concentrate, but bulk recoveries typically trend higher.  The lower grade is due to increased iron sulfide (pyrrhotite)  content  without  a  corresponding  increase  in  sulfide  nickel  (pentlandite)  mineralization.    A more detailed evaluation of the concentrate nickel grade verses recovery relationship will be undertaken for pyrrhotite rejection, and as a best fit for the selected downstream production option.  Future mineral processing studies will include the evaluation of flotation modifying reagents and depressants as well as use of physical separation procedures such as magnetic separation or flotation retention time.

The grade range of the cleaned concentrate from open cycle testing depends on the nickel grade and the sulfur to nickel ratio in the feed.  As the sulfur ratio increases in the feed, the nickel recovery will typically increase, but produces a lower grade concentrate. The bulk recovery ranges from about 70% to 83% for open cycle testing.  Pyrrhotite rejection can be considered during flotation testing for higher sulfur feed, but  this  will  decrease  recovery.    Without  pyrrhotite  rejection  and  for  head  grades  between  0.10%  to 0.14% sulfide nickel; the flotation concentrate grade ranged from approximately 4% to 10% nickel.  For head grades between 0.14% to 0.20% sulfide nickel; the flotation concentrate ranged from approximately 5% to  13%  nickel.    For  head  grades  over  0.2%  sulfide  nickel;  the  flotation  concentrate  ranged  from approximately 7% to 17% nickel.  A tabulated summary is provided in the table below, using a cutoff grade of 0.10% sulfide nickel (NiS).

*NiS denotes nickel content in the sulfide form as defined by the ammonium citrate -hydrogen peroxide analytical procedure

Additional  flotation  test  results  using  higher  S:NiS  ratio  feed  is  available.    However,  this  material  is currently classified as waste, as the likely concentrate grade is considered too low (&lt;4% Ni) to maximize project economics.  Modifications to the flotation procedure to improve grade and / or use of on-site hydromet treatment to treat lower grade concentrate could result in re-evaluation for placing some of this material into the resource category in the future.  An ore grade of less then 0.10% sulfide nickel is also not currently included in the resource.  Flotation studies show samples below the current sulfide nickel cutoff grade (&lt;0.10%, but &gt;0.075% NiS) could produce suitable concentrate grades, but at recoveries of generally  less  than  65%,  depending  on  the  head  grade  of  both  nickel  and  sulfur.    The  use  of  higher forecast metal prices, or process circuit modifications may result in some of this material to be considered as part of the resource in the future, likely to be stockpiled initially into low grade dumps.  Conversely lower forecast metal prices and more restrictive process design parameters would decrease the resource tonnage.

## 17 MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATE

## 17.1 Database - General Description

The current database for the Turnagain Nickel Deposit consists of 19,869 analyzed intervals in 230 drill holes representing 45,988 metres of core. An additional 5288 metres of core was not analyzed as it was deemed  to  be  unmineralized.  Data  from  149  of  these  holes  was  used  in  this  resource  estimation comprising 17,654 assayed intervals (41,590 m).  The data from pre-2002 drilling was not used as it was mostly small diameter core, sampling was incomplete and very few intervals were able to be re-analyzed for AC Ni. Furthermore, the areas drilled prior to 2002 have been covered reasonably well by later drill programs.

Virtually  all  samples  from  post  2002  drilling  within  the  presently  known  mineralized  zones  have  now been analyzed by the ammonium acetate-hydrogen peroxide leach process (AC Ni) as well as for total sulphur content (Leco S). Comparison of total Ni with AC Ni grades revealed that a small proportion of samples contained AC Ni grades exceeding the total Ni grade. This was more prevalent in the 2002-2003 results  where  total  Ni  was  determined  using  an  Aqua  Regia  digestion  and  3.6%  of  the  AC  Ni  results exceeded the total Ni by greater than 0.02%. Comparisons of the 2004-2006 results show less than 0.2% of samples had ACNi&gt;Total Ni by over 0.02%. This is illustrated in figure 17-1 which compares AC Ni with total Ni determined by the total digestion method and total Ni determined by aqua regia digestion method.  Points plotting above the reference line indicate AC Ni values greater than total Ni analyses.

It is concluded  from  these  results  that  the  partial  digestion  analytical  method  used  for  total  Ni determination in the 2002-2003 drilling programs slightly understated the true total Ni grades. Only a few samples over a narrow range of values were analyzed for total Ni by both methods. Although the total digestion values did average slightly higher than the aqua regia values there was not enough data to be statistically relevant

The sulphide Ni content used for resource estimation was based on the AC Ni value where total sulphur was greater or equal to 0.2%. Sulphide Ni was assumed to be absent and assigned a zero value where total sulphur values were less than 0.2%.

Silicate  Ni  content  was  determined  by  subtracting  the  sulphide  Ni  value  from  total  Ni.  In  the  small percentage of cases where AC Ni (and therefore sulphide Ni) exceeded total nickel analysis, the silicate Ni value was set to zero.

The descriptive statistics for the analyzed intervals within all the domains used in the present resource model are shown in table 17-1.

Levels of Cu, Pt and Pd in the Horsetrail and peripheral zones are not high enough to be of economic interest and will not be discussed further in this report.

Frequency distribution and probability plot for AC Ni is shown in Figure 17-2. Histograms of total Ni, silicate Ni, total sulfur and AC Co are illustrated in Figure 17-3 to 17-6. Only assay data within the zone constrains (see Section 17.2) was used for creation of the charts.

The histograms for AC Ni and total Ni show a moderately skewed distribution with no strong bimodality evident.  However,  the  log  probability  plot  does  indicate  a  small  outlier  population  above  0.8%.    The silicate  Ni  plot  shows a strongly skewed distribution with a weak bimodal indication. Both total sulfur and AC Co approximate normal distributions.

## 17.2 Zone Constraints

For the purpose of constraining the resource estimate, domains were created based on plan and cross section  interpretation.  Six  separate  domains  were  identified  based  on  a  low-grade  cut-off  of  0.1% sulphide Ni.  Previous resource estimate (GeoSim, 2006 and Baldys, 2005) used additional higher-grade domains  as  hard  boundaries  base  on  +0.2%  and  higher  sulphide  Ni  cutoffs.  After  re-estimating  the

previous model with and without these inner hard boundaries it was found that they had little impact on the grade distribution and are presently deemed to be unnecessary.

The domains were coded 1 to 6 as follows and their locations are illustrated in the following figure.

- 1) Northwest Zone
- 2) Horsetrail North Zone
- 3) Horsetrail Main Zone
- 4) Hatzl North Zone
- 5) Hatzl South Zone
- 6) Duffy Zone

## 17.3 Density

Specific gravity measurements were carried out on 1122 core samples collected between 2004 and 2006. Specific gravity of core samples was measured in the feld by the immersion method.  A piece of whole core up to 50cm in length was weighed in air and in water and the specific gravity calculated using the following formula:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

As part of the metallurgical test program, Process Research Associates Ltd. (PRA), measured SG using the  pycnometric  method  with  -10  Tyler  mesh  assay  rejects.    Their  results  were  within  5%  of  SG determinations  measured  by  ACME  Laboratory  in  2007  using  the  same  method.  A  total  of  810 measurements were done by the immersion method on whole core and 312 measurements carried out on crushed samples using the pycnometric procedure. The table below summarizes the statistics by lithology.

The average value of 3.05 was used for the tonnage calculations in this study.  It is recommended that the database  of  density  measurements  be  expanded  and  analyzed  with  the  goal  of  modeling  the  specific gravity as a block attribute.

## 17.4 Extreme Grades

The distribution  of  drill  hole  assays  within  the  mineralized  zones  was  examined  to  check  for  outliers. These are extreme values that can lead to serious over estimation of average grade if they are treated in the  same  manner  as  are  lower-grade  values  during  resource  estimation.  Commonly  these  outlier populations are geologically distinctive and have limited geologic continuity relative to lower-grade values. From examination of the histogram and probability plot of AC\_Ni (Figures 17-2) it is evident that there is  a  small  high  grade  population  above  0.8%.    It  was  decided  to  limit  the  influence  of  these  samples during block estimation by only allowing them to be used in the first kriging pass (40m anisotropic search distance).

## 17.5 Compositing

Drill  hole  assays  within  the  separate  domains  were  composited  downhole  at  intervals  of  15  metres honouring domain boundaries.  Partial composites were allowed if they were at least 7.5 metres in length. Composites from 117 drill holes were used in the final resource estimation.

A comparison of composite length vs grade (Figure 17-8) shows no evident bias towards higher or lower grades.

## 17.6 Variogram Analysis

A down-hole variogram using 15 metre AC Ni composites from the Horsetrail zone was modeled in order to determine the nugget effect (Figure 17-9). The  AC Ni values from the down-hole composites were then used to model directional variograms in order to determine anisotropy and kriging parameters. Pairwise relative variograms were also examined to assist in determining anisotropy. Nested models were fitted to the three principal directions and the results are shown in Figure 17-7.

Figure 17-9 Downhole variogram and directional variograms for AC Ni

<!-- image -->

The principal bearing directions were adjusted for the various domains to match the individual geologic interpretations.  This  resulted  in  slight  changes  in  the  major  axis  between  090  and  110  degrees  and variations  in  the  secondary  axis  of  between  -60  and  -90  degrees  from  horizontal.  The  final  model parameters for all domains are summarized in Table 17-5.

Variography was also performed for silicate nickel (%), total sulfur(%) and AC cobalt (ppm).  Combined composites samples in all domains were used for modeling. Results are summarized in table 17-6.

## 17.7 Block Model and Grade Estimation Procedures

A block model with dimensions of 25x25x15 metres was created using Surpac Vision software. Extents of the model are shown in the following table:

Table 17-7 Block model extents

|    |     Min |     Max |   Extent |   size |   number |
|----|---------|---------|----------|--------|----------|

| z  |     600 |    1350 |      750 |     15 |       50 |

Blocks  were  estimated  by  ordinary  kriging  in  three  passes.  Domain  envelopes  were  treated  as  hard boundaries for sulphide Ni but not for the silicate Ni, total sulfur or AC Co. Search parameters for the various items estimated are summarized in the following table.

Block grades were estimated for sulphide Ni, silicate Ni, and AC Co. The total Ni value for each block was  calculated  by  adding  the  sulphide  and  silicate  nickel  estimates.  This  eliminated  the  possibility  of sulphide Ni block estimates exceeding the total Ni value. The levels of Cu, Pt and Pd were considered too low to be of economic interest in the Horsetrail Zone.

Partial  block  weighting  was  not  used  in  this  model.  Only  blocks  with ≥ 50% of their volume within a domain were estimated.

The grade distribution of the model is illustrated in figure 17-12 as nested grade shells at cut-offs of 0.15, 0.20 and 0.25% Sulphide nickel. Figures 17-13 to 23 illustrate the Sulphide nickel block grade distribution in plan and section.

## 17.8 Mineral Resource Classification

Resource classifications used in this study conform to the following definition from National Instrument 43-101:

## Measured Mineral Resource

A 'Measured Mineral Resource' is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, grade or quality, densities, shape, physical characteristics are so well established that they can be estimated with confidence sufficient to allow the appropriate application of technical and economic parameters, to support production planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit. The estimate is based on detailed and reliable exploration, sampling and testing information gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes that are spaced closely enough to confirm both geological and grade continuity.

## Indicated Mineral Resource

An 'Indicated Mineral Resource' is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, grade or quality, densities, shape and  physical  characteristics,  can  be  estimated  with  a  level  of  confidence  sufficient  to  allow  the  appropriate  application  of technical and economic parameters, to support mine planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit. The estimate is based on detailed and reliable exploration and testing information gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes that are spaced closely enough for geological and grade continuity to be reasonably assumed.

## Inferred Mineral Resource

An 'Inferred Mineral Resource' is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity and grade or quality can be estimated on  the  basis  of  geological  evidence  and  limited  sampling  and  reasonably  assumed,  but  not  verified,  geological  and  grade continuity.  The  estimate  is  based  on  limited  information  and  sampling  gathered  through  appropriate  techniques  from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes.

Blocks were classified as measured, indicated or inferred based on the number and distance of informing samples with relation to the block position. Extrapolated estimates were differentiated from interpolated values by using octant searches in the first two kriging passes. The methodology for block classification is as follows:

- · Blocks estimated in the first kriging pass using an octant search were initially assigned to the 'Measured' category.
- · Selected blocks estimated in the second pass but containing composite points were classified as 'Measured' within the Northwest and Horsetrail zones.
- · Some  areas  were  downgraded  to  'Indicated'  based  on  visual  examination  including  any blocks in the Hatzl or Duffy zones estimated on the first pass.
- · Remaining blocks estimated in the second pass were assigned to the 'Indicated' category.
- · All blocks estimated in the third pass were classified as 'Inferred'

The following figures illustrate the distribution of the three classes in plan view and cross section.

## 17.9 Cut-off Grade Determination

In June, 2006, AMEC (2006) completed a preliminary assessment of the Turnagain deposit. A cut-off grade of 0.095% sulphide nickel was determined to be the bread-even grade for reporting resources that could potentially be mined by open-pit methods. The parameters used in the AMEC analysis included a nickel price of US$5.50/lb, mining cost at CAD$1.20/t, processing cost of CAD$6.95/t and a recovery factor varying with grade from 57% to 62.7%.

In order to be consistent with the reporting accuracy of the present resource estimate, the cut-off grade was rounded to 0.10% sulphide nickel.

## 17.10 Mineral Resource Estimate

The  following  tables  presents  the  updated  resource  estimate  using  a  cut-off  grade  of  0.10%  sulphide nickel.  A  total  of  24,408  metres  of  diamond  drilling  in  117  drill  holes  were  used  in  the  block  model estimate.

## 17.11 Model Verification

Model verification was carried out by visual comparison of colour coded blocks and composites on plans and sections.

Statistical  comparisons of global block grades and composite grades show excellent correlation (Figure 17-34). The mean sulphide Ni grade of the composites was 0.16 g/t as was the mean grade for the block model at a zero cutoff grade.

Model verification  included  a  comparison  of  kriged  to  ID 3   and  nearest  neighbour  estimates.  A  gradetonnage chart comparing the block model statistics for the various interpolation methods is shown in Figure 17-35. Only a marginal difference is apparent between the ID 3  and kriged block models.

Comparison of the global resource statistics by zone and classification shows good agreement between the  average  sulphide  Ni  grades  using  the  three  interpolation  methods.  The  average  nearest  neighbour grades were within 6% of the kriged grades while the ID 3  grades were within 4% (Table 17-11).

Swath plots were generated all major orientations in order to test for local bias in the estimate. This was accomplished by selecting 50 metre-wide panels of blocks in three N-S cross sections, one longitudinal (E-W) section and one level plan. The block estimates for sulphide nickel using kriging, ID3 and nearest neighbour methods were then averaged and plotted (Figures 17-36 to 40).

No significant local biases were identified.

## 18 OTHER RELEVANT DATA AND INFORMATION

The author is of the opinion that all known relevant technical data and information with regard to the Turnagain Nickel project has been reviewed and addressed in this Technical Report.

## 19 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS

Using a 0.1% sulphide nickel cut-off grade for potential open pit resources, the Turnagain Nickel deposit is  estimated  to  contain  a  measured  and  indicated  resource  of  428.6  million  tonnes  averaging  0.17% Sulphide Ni and 0.011% Co. An additional 743 million tonnes grading 0.17% Sulphide Ni and 0.011% Co is classified as inferred.

The  outer  resource  boundaries  are  not  completely  defined  and  the  deposit  remains  open  both  along strike  to  the  southeast  and  down  dip.  The  area  between  the  Horsetrail  and  Hatzl  zones  has  not  been adequately tested.

## 20 RECOMMENDATIONS

- · The database of density measurements should be expanded and analyzed with a view towards modeling the specific gravity as a block attribute.
- · Fill-in and step-out drilling is warranted in order to establish the ultimate extents of the sulphide nickel zones and explore for peripheral zones.

## Hard Creek Nickel Standard UM-2

| Element   | Certified Mean   | Two Standard Deviations (between lab)   |
|-----------|------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Tot Ni    | 3532 ppm         | 200 ppm                                 |
| Tot. Cu   | 959 ppm          | 90 ppm                                  |
| Tot. Fe   | 9.09 %           | 0.96 %                                  |
| Tot. S    | 1.03 %           | 0.08 %                                  |

| Element   | Indicated Mean   | Two Standard Deviations (between lab)   |
|-----------|------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Tot. Co   | 149 ppm          | 29 ppm                                  |

| Element   | Provisional Mean   |
|-----------|--------------------|
| Tot. Mg   | 23.03 %            |
| AR Mg     | 19.55 %            |

Means and standard deviations were calculated from data supplied by five laboratories. All data and graphics are contained in the accompanying Excel spreadsheets. Indicated means are shown where the standard deviations are considered to be too large to certify an accepted mean, and Provisional means are for information purposes only. Laboratories were asked to supply analysis for sulphide Cu, Ni and Co, but some labs could not perform the analyses as defined, and two laboratories declined to participate in that analytical method. There is no useable data for the sulphide method.

The participating laboratories were:

Acme, Vancouver Assayers, Vancouver SGS Lakefield, Ontario IPL, Vancouver Global Discovery Labs, Vancouver

The final limits were calculated after first determining if all data was compatible within a spread normally expected for similar analytical methods done by reputable laboratories. Laboratories that failed a grouped t test were removed from the data set before calculating the initial mean and standard deviations. Any analysis that fell outside the mean ± 2 SD limits was designated as a 'flier' and was removed from the ensuing data base. The mean and standard deviations were again calculated using the remaining data (shown as the 1 st Iteration in the spreadsheets). The final standard deviation values are known as the 'Between Lab' deviations, and can be used to monitor accuracy of a single analysis.

As some of the labs were removed from calculations, it is recommended that additional labs be invited to participate in this round robin and the calculations redone with the additional information.

The bulk standards were prepared and packaged by CDN Labs of Delta B.C. Each bulk sample was pulverized in a large rod mill, screened through 200 mesh using an electric sieve, and homogenized in a large rotating mixer. Each standard was sealed in plastic to prevent gravity separation and oxidation.
