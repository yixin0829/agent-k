- 4) I have practiced my profession continuously since 1970.  I have had 40 years' experience estimating mineral  resources.    I  have  previously  completed  resource  estimations  on  a  number  of  porphyry copper-gold deposits both in B.C. and around the world, many similar to that found on the property (the 'Whistler, Raintree West and Island Mountain deposits') that is the subject of the Technical Report (as defined below).
- 5) I  am  responsible  for  the  technical  report  titled  "NI  43-101  Resource  Estimate  for  Whistler Project, Alaska" (the "Technical Report"), dated and made effective as of March 24, 2016 and amended and re-stated May 30, 2016, prepared for Brazil Resources Inc. (the "Issuer").
- 6) Prior  to  being  retained  by  the  Issuer  to  prepare  the  Technical  Report,  I  have  not  had  prior involvement with the property that is the subject of the Technical Report.
- 7) I have read the definition of 'qualified person' set out in National Instrument 43-101 - Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects, ("NI 43-101") and certify that by reason of my education, affiliation with a professional association (as defined in NI 43-101), and past relevant work experience, I fulfill the requirements to be a "qualified person" for the purposes of NI 43-101.
- 8) I completed a site visit of the property on April 21, 2016.
- 9) I am independent of the Issuer applying all of the tests in section 1.5 of NI 43-101.
- 10) I am not aware of any material fact or material change with respect to the subject matter of the Technical Report this is not reflected in the Technical Report, the omission to disclose, which makes the Technical Report misleading.
- 11) I  have  read  NI  43-101  and  Form  43-101F1,  and  the  Technical  Report  has  been  prepared  in compliance with that instrument and form.
- 12) I  consent  to  the  filing  of  the  Technical  Report  with  any  stock  exchange  and  other  regulatory authority and any publication by them, including electronic publication in the public company files on their websites assessable by the public.

Technical Report - NI 43-101 Resource Estimate for the Whistler Project, Alaska

## 1.0 Summary

The Whistler Project is a gold-copper exploration project located in the Yentna Mining District of Alaska, approximately 150km northwest of Anchorage.  Giroux Consultants Ltd. ('GCL') was commissioned by Brazil Resources Inc. ("BRI") to complete maiden resource estimates for the Raintree West and Island Mountain gold-copper deposits located at the Whistler Project and this NI 43-101 technical report (the "Report").    The  project  also  hosts  the  Whistler  gold-copper  deposit,  for  which  a  resource  estimate completed by Moose Mountain Technical Services ("MMTS") for BRI was documented in a NI 43-101 technical report with an effective date of August 15, 2015 and summarized herein.

The  Whistler  Project  comprises  304  State  of  Alaska  mining  claims  covering  an  aggregate  area  of approximately 172km 2 .  The center of the property is located at 152.566° longitude west and 61.983° latitude north.  The project is located in the drainage of the Skwentna River.  Elevation varies from about 400m  above  sea  level  in  the  valley  floors  to  over  5,000m  in  the  highest  peaks  resulting  in  quite  a spectacular landscape.  A base camp and gravel airstrip for wheel-based aircraft is established adjacent to the Skwentna  River. The  fifty-person camp  is equipped  with  diesel  generators, a satellite communication  link,  tent  structures  on  wooden  floors  and  several  wood-frame  buildings.    Although chiefly used for summer field programs, the camp is winterized.

Rights to the Whistler Project were acquired by BRI, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, BRI Alaska Corporation ("BRIA"), in August 2015 pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement (the "Asset Purchase") with Kiska Metals Corporation ("Kiska") in exchange for the issuance of 3,500,000 common shares in the capital of BRI as disclosed by news releases on July 21 and August 6, 2015. The project is subject to three underlying agreements, which were assigned to BRI under the transaction.

The first underlying agreement is a Royalty Purchase Agreement between Kiska, Geoinformatics Alaska Exploration Inc. ("Geoinformatics") and MF2, LLC ("MF2"), dated December 16, 2014. This agreement grants MF2 a 2.75 percent net smelter royalty ("NSR") over all 304 claims, and extending outside the current claims over an Area of Interest defined by the maximum historical extent of claims held on the project.  BRIA can purchase 0.75 percent of the NSR royalty for a payment of US$5,000,000 to MF2.

The second underlying agreement is an earlier agreement between Cominco American Incorporated and Mr. Kent Turner dated October 1, 1999.  This agreement concerns a 2.0 percent net profit interest to Teck  Resources,  recently  purchased  by  Sandstorm  Gold  Ltd.,  in  connection  with  an  Area  of  Interest specified by standard township sub-division as indicated in Figure 4-2.

The  third  underlying  agreement  is  a  Purchase  and  Sale  agreement  among  Kent  Turner,  Kiska  Metals Corporation and Geoinformatics Alaska Exploration Inc., dated December 16, 2014 that terminated the "Turner Agreement" (an agreement that grants Kennecott Exploration ("Kennecott") and its successors a 30-year  lease  on  twenty-five  unpatented  State  of  Alaska  Claims)  and  transferred  to  Kiska  and Geoinformatics, and their successors, an undivided 100 percent of the legal and beneficial interest in, under, to, and respecting the Turner Property free and clear of all encumbrances arising by, through or under Turner other than the Cominco American net profit interest.

## Technical Report - NI 43-101 Resource Estimate for the Whistler Project, Alaska

Mineral exploration in the Whistler area was initiated by Cominco Alaska Inc. in 1986, and continued through  1989.    During  this  period,  the  Whistler  and  the  Island  Mountain  gold-copper  porphyry occurrences were discovered and partially tested by drilling.  In 1990, Cominco's interest waned and all cores from the Whistler region were donated to the State of Alaska.  The property was allowed to lapse. In  1999,  Kent  Turner  staked  twenty-five  State  of  Alaska  mining  claims  at  Whistler  and  leased  the property to Kennecott.  From 2004 through 2006 Kennecott conducted extensive exploration of Whistler region,  including  geological  mapping,  soil,  rock  and  stream  sediments  sampling,  ground  induced polarization,  the  evaluation  of  the  Whistler  gold-copper  occurrence  with  fifteen  core  boreholes (7,948m) and reconnaissance core drilling at other targets in the Whistler region (4,184m).  Over that period Kennecott invested over USD$6.3 million in exploration.

From 2007 through 2008, Geoinformatics drilled twelve holes for 5,784 metres on the Whistler Deposit and  six  holes  for  1,841  metres  on  other  exploration  targets  in  the  Whistler  area.    Drilling  by Geoinformatics on the Whistler Deposit was done to infill the deposit to sections spaced at seventy-five metres  and  to  test  for  the  north  and  south  extensions  of  the  deposit.    Exploration  drilling  by Geoinformatics  in  the  Whistler  area  targeted  geophysical  anomalies  in  the  Raintree  and  Rainmaker areas, using the same basic porphyry exploration model as Kennecott.

Kiska  was  formed  in  2009  by  the  merger  of  Geoinformatics  Exploration  Inc.  and  Rimfire  Minerals Corporation in order to advance exploration on the Whistler Project.  The rights to the property were acquired  by  Geoinformatics  from  Kennecott  in  2007  subject  to  exploration  expenditures  totalling  a minimum of  USD$5.0  million  over  two  years,  two  underlying  agreements,  and  certain  back-in  rights retained by Kennecott to acquire up to sixty percent of the project.  In September 2010, Kennecott's back-in right was extinguished after the completion and review of a geophysical and drilling program (the "Trigger Program") whose technical direction was guided by Kiska and Kennecott.  From that time forward,  Kiska  continued  to  explore  the  project  and  completed  a  total  of  48,447  metres  of  drilling, several  large  geophysical  surveys,  and  an  updated  Whistler  Deposit  resource  estimate,  for  a  total expenditure of USD$29.4M.  Kiska's primary objective was to explore the entire project area and test porphyry  targets  other  than  the  Whistler  Deposit,  including  Raintree  West  and  the  Island  Mountain Breccia Zone (hereafter referred to as the Island Mountain Deposit).

Alaskan geology consists of a collage of various terrains that were accreted to the western margin of North  America  as  a  result  of  complex  plate  interactions  through  most  of  the  Phanerozoic.    The southernmost Pacific margin is underlain by the Chugach-Prince William composite terrain, a MesozoicCenozoic accretionary prism developed seaward from the Wrangellia composite terrain.  It comprises arc batholiths and associated volcanic rocks of Jurassic, Cretaceous, and early Tertiary age.

The  Alaska  Range  represents  a  long-lived  continental  arc  characterized  by  multiple  magmatic  events ranging in age from about 70 million years ("Ma") to 30Ma and associated with a wide range of base and precious  metals  hydrothermal  sulphide  bearing  mineralization.    The  geology  of  Whistler  Project  is characterized by a thick succession of Cretaceous to early Tertiary (ca. 97 to 65Ma) volcano-sedimentary rocks intruded by a diverse suite of plutonic rocks of Jurassic to mid-Tertiary age.

Two main intrusive suites are important in the Whistler Project area.

## Technical Report - NI 43-101 Resource Estimate for the Whistler Project, Alaska

- 1) The  Whistler  Igneous  Suite  comprises  alkali-calcic  basalt-andesite,  diorite  and  monzonite intrusive rocks approximately 76Ma with restricted extrusive equivalent.  These intrusions are commonly associated with gold-copper porphyry-style mineralization (Whistler Deposit).
- 2) The  Composite  Suite intrusions  vary  in  composition  from  peridotite  to granite  and  their  ages span from 67 to about 64Ma. Gold-copper veinlets and pegmatitic occurrences are characteristics  of  the  Composite  plutons  (e.g.  the  Mt.    Estelle  prospect,  the  Muddy  Creek prospect).

The  Whistler  Project  was  acquired  by  BRI  for  its  potential  to  host  magmatic  hydrothermal  gold  and copper  mineralization.    Magmatic  hydrothermal  deposits  represent  a  wide  clan  of  mineral  deposits formed by the circulation of hydrothermal fluids into fractured rocks and associated with the intrusion of  magma into  the  crust.    Exploration  work  completed  by  Kennecott,  Geoinformatics,  and  Kiska  has discovered  several gold-copper  sulphide  occurrences  exhibiting  characteristics  indicative  of  magmatic hydrothermal processes and suggesting that the project area is generally highly prospective for porphyry gold-copper deposits.

Kennecott, Geoinformatics and Kiska used industry best practices to collect, handle and assay soil, rock and core samples collected during the period 2004-2011.  The procedures are documented in detailed manuals describing all aspects of the exploration data collection and management.  All assay samples were prepared by the Alaska Assay Laboratory, in Fairbanks, Alaska and assayed at either the Alaska Assay  Laboratory  (2004)  or  the  accredited  ALS-Chemex  laboratory  in  Vancouver,  British  Columbia. Samples were assayed for gold by conventional fire assay and a suite of elements including the usual metals  by  aqua  regia  digestion  and  inductively  coupled  plasma  atomic  emission  spectroscopy.    The operators used industry best practices quality control measures during its exploration at Whistler.

Gary Giroux of GCL visited the Whistler Project on April 21, 2016.  The purpose of the site visit was to examine the property and the areas of drilling, to review drill core and geological models that pertain to Raintree  West,  Island  Mountain  and  the  Whistler  deposits,  and  to  review  the  sample  preparation, handling and analysis procedures conducted by previous operators.

GCL conducted a series of routine verifications to ensure the reliability of the electronic data provided by BRI, and believes the electronic data is reliable.  GCL visually examined assaying quality control data produced by Kiska and believes these data are reliable for resource estimation.

This  technical  report  documents  the  first  ever  resource  estimates  for  the  Raintree  West  and  Island Mountain deposits and is largely based on drilling by Kiska between 2009 and 2011. In addition, this document includes a resource estimate for the Whistler gold-copper deposit which was completed by MMTS in the name of BRI (effective date of August 15, 2015), which is  based  largely  on  the  historic resource estimate completed by MMTS for Kiska as documented in the NI 43-101 technical report with an effective date of March 17, 2011; no new sampling or drilling has been completed on the Whistler Deposit  since  March  17,  2011.    The  first  resource  estimate  on  the  project  (Whistler  Deposit)  was completed by SRK with an effective date of December 31, 2007.

The Raintree West deposit is one of several porphyry centers identified on the Whistler Project.  The deposit is located 1500 metres east of the Whistler Deposit and is concealed by 5 to 15 metres of glacio-

fluvial sediments. The deposit has been drilled over a strike length of 500 metres and to a depth of 700 metres;  the  deposit  is  up  to  400  metres  in  width.  The  deposit  is  open  along  strike  to  the  north  and south, and at depth. Gold-copper mineralization is associated with quartz + magnetite stockwork zones hosted  in  potassic  altered  diorite  porphyry  intrusive  rocks.  The  diorite  porphyry  host  rocks,  the mineralization  style  and  the  alteration  associated  with  gold-copper  mineralization  are  similar  to  the Whistler Deposit.

No metallurgical testing has been carried out on rocks from the Raintree West deposit, however given the similarities in geological setting, host rock, mineralization and alteration between Raintree West and the Whistler Deposit, it has been assumed that metallurgical processes and metal recoveries determined for  the  Whistler  Deposit  are  a  reasonable  approximation  for  the  Raintree  West  Deposit  at  this  time. From the metallurgical testwork results and subsequent analysis reported in MMTS (2015), the Whistler Deposit  is  metallurgically  very  amenable  to  a  conventional  flotation  route  to  produce  saleable  high quality  copper  concentrates  with  gold  credits,  despite  the  low  head  grade,  and  that  the  levels  of recovery and upgrade for both copper and gold are relatively insensitive to feed grade. Metal recoveries reported for the Whistler Deposit resource estimate, and used here for Raintree West, include 85% for copper, 75% for gold and 75% for silver.

The Raintree West deposit was modelled on a series of east-west cross-sections and a grade shell (0.1 g/t AuEq) representing the mineralization was constructed to constrain the resource estimate.  Fourteen diamond drill holes totaling 7,078 metres were used to define the model.  Given the limited geological information available due to the current density of drilling at Raintree West and its classification as a porphyry  deposit  type,  the grade  shell  model  was  deemed  a  reasonable  constraint  on  mineralization until further drilling enables the construction of a detailed geological model.  Erratic high grade outliers for gold, silver and copper were capped within the mineralized and waste solids. Composites 5 metres in length were formed within each of the domains that honoured the domain boundaries.

Variography was used to model the grade continuity and to determine the search ellipse orientations and dimensions for interpolation.  Ordinary  kriging  was  used  to  estimate  gold,  silver  and  copper  into blocks measuring 10 x 10 x 10 metres in dimension. A total of 39 samples within the mineralized solid had specific gravity  measurements,  which  were  used  to  convert  volumes  to  tonnes.  The  blocks  were classified as Inferred based on the limited amount of drilling. For the near surface mineralization (above 250  m  elevation),  a  0.30  g/t  gold  equivalent  cut-off  grade  was  chosen  as  a  possible  open  pit  cut-off based on studies completed at the nearby Whistler Deposit. For the deeper mineralization (below 100 m elevation), a 0.60 g/t gold equivalent cut-off grade was chosen as a possible block cave cut-off based on the  New  Afton  mine  in  British  Columbia,  that  is  currently  in  production  and  using  a  similar  mining method. Validation of the model was completed by comparison of the block model and drill hole grades by visual inspections in section and plan across the deposit.

## Technical Report - NI 43-101 Resource Estimate for the Whistler Project, Alaska

Gold-copper  mineralization  is  hosted  by  intrusive  and  hydrothermal  breccia  associated  with  strong sodic-calcic  alteration,  and  gold-only  mineralization  is  hosted  by  diorite  porphyry  with  vein  and disseminated pyrrhotite.

Metallurgical  processing  of  samples  from  Island  Mountain  show  excellent  recovery  rates  (80%)  and saleable Cu concentrate grades using conventional processing techniques. The Lower Zone (disseminated Pyrrhotite) composite sample achieved nearly 90% Au recovery through a combination of selective  flotation  and  cyanidation  of  tailings.    The  upper  composite  sample  (Actinolite-Magnetite breccia) achieved 75% Au recovery; further modification and optimization can be expected to greatly improve  those  results.    Processing  infrastructure  contemplated  at  Whistler,  including  conventional milling and flotation followed by cyanide leaching of tailings, matches what would be required at Island Mountain based on this early testwork.

The Island Mountain deposit was first modelled on a series of cross-sections, followed by longitudinal sections  and  plans  for  both  lithology  and  alteration/mineralization  and,  from  this,  a  geologic  solids model was produced to constrain the resource estimate. A total of 8 mineralized geologic domains were modelled. Thirty-four diamond drill holes totaling 12,668 metres were used to define the model.

Erratic high grade outliers for gold, silver and copper were capped within each of the geologic domains. Composites  5  metres  in  length  were  formed  within  each  of  the  domains  that  honoured  the  domain boundaries. Variography was used to model the grade continuity and to determine the search ellipse orientations  and  dimensions  for interpolation.  Ordinary  kriging  was  used  to  estimate  gold,  silver  and copper  into  blocks  measuring  10  x  10  x  10  metres in  dimension. A  total  of  218  samples  had  specific gravity measurements, which were subdivided into domains to convert volumes to tonnes.

The  blocks  were  classified  as  Indicated  or  Inferred  based  on  grade  continuity  as  measured  by semivariograms. A 0.30 g/t gold equivalent cut-off grade was chosen as a possible open pit cut-off based on  studies  completed  at  the  nearby  Whistler  Deposit.  Validation  of  the  model  was  completed  by comparison of the block model and drill hole grades by visual inspections in section and plan across the deposit.

Table 1-3 and Table 1-4 Notes:

- 1. 1 Gold-equivalent grade  assumes  metal  prices of  US$1,250/oz  gold,  US$16.50/oz silver  and  US$2.10/lb  copper  and recoveries of 90% for gold (cyanide), 80% for copper (flotation) and 25% silver (recovery in copper concentrate).
- 2. A  0.30 g/t  gold  equivalent  has  been highlighted  as  a  possible open pit  cut-off  based on  studies  completed  at  the nearby Whistler Deposit.
- 3. Totals may not represent the sum of the parts due to rounding.
- 4. The Mineral Resources have been prepared by Giroux Consulting Ltd. in conformity with "CIM Definition Standards for Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves 2014".

The following summary of the Whistler Deposit is from MMTS (2015), a NI 43-101 technical report titled "NI  43-101  Resource  Estimate  for  the  Whistler  Project"  with  an  effective  date  of  15  August,  2015, authored  by  Robert  J.  Morris,  Susan  C.  Bird  and  Alan  Riles.  The  Whistler  Deposit  is  a  structurally controlled porphyry deposit with Au, Cu and Ag as the primary economic metals.  There are at least three  intrusive  phases  recognized  at  the  Whistler  Deposit,  the  earliest,  Main  Stage  Porphyry  (MSP), being that of principal mineralization.  A major northwest trending fault (the Divide Fault) is used to segregate the mineralization into two domains prior to grade interpolation.  There is some evidence that lateral offsets of as much as 100m may have occurred along this fault.

Statistical analyses (cumulative probability plots, histograms, classic statistical values) of the assay data are used to confirm the domain selection, to decide if capping is necessary, and to determine the extent of  non-mineralized  zones  within  the  diorite  solid.    Assay  data  was  composited  into  5m  intervals, honoring  the  domain  boundaries,  with  composite  statistics  also  compiled  for  comparisons.    The composites  are  then  used  to  create  relative  variograms  for  Au,  Cu,  and  Ag  grades  using  the  MSDA

module  of  the  MineSight  software,  thus  establishing  rotation  and  search  parameters  for  the  block model interpolation.

Validation of the model is completed by comparison of the block values with de-clustered composite values,  with  values  interpolated  by  inverse  distance,  by  the  use  of  swath  plots,  as  well  by  a  visual inspection in section and plan across the project area.

Specific gravity values are based on 21 measurements by ALS Chemex to give an average density of 2.72 for ore, and 2.60 for waste.

The  resource  has  been  interpolated  and  classified  based  on  variogram  modeling  using  the  search parameters as defined below.

## Summary of Search Parameters for Interpolation and Classification of the Resource

| Search Parameter        | Pass 1   | Pass 2                       |
|-------------------------|----------|------------------------------|
| Resource Classification | Inferred | Indicated                    |
| Search distance         | Range    | ½ Range                      |
| 4                       | 3        | Minimum # comps              |
| 9                       | 9        | Maximum # comps              |
| 3                       | 2        | Maximum # Comps/Hole         |
| 6                       | 7        | Max # Comps / Split Quadrant |

Classification is based on the variogram parameters, and restrictions on the number of composites and drillholes used in each pass of the interpolation, as indicated in Table 1-5.  The definition of Indicated and Inferred used to classify the resource is in accordance with that  of the CIM Definition Standards (CIM, 2014).

The pit delineated resource is given in Table 1-6, for a range of NSR cut-offs with the base case cut-off of $7.50/tonne highlighted.  Process recoveries, as well as mining, processing and off site costs have been applied in order to determine that the pit resource has a reasonable prospect of economic extraction. The $7.50/tonne cut-off (an Au Equivalent grade of approximately 0.3 gpt at the base case prices) yields an Indicated resource of 79.2 Mtonnes at 0.51 gpt gold, 0.17% copper and 1.97 gpt silver (2.25 Moz Au Eqv.) and an Inferred resource of 145.8 Mtonnes at 0.40 gpt gold, 0.15% copper and 1.75 gpt silver (3.35 Moz Au Eqv).  The mining, processing and off site costs used here are estimates and may not represent actual costs.

There  are  no  known  significant  environmental,  permitting,  legal,  title,  taxation,  socio-economic, marketing, political, or other factors that could materially affect the resource estimate.

Exploration drilling, property-wide airborne magnetic surveys and extensive Induced Polarization ground surveys  have  identified  multiple  porphyry  prospects  that  warrant  initial  or  further  drill  testing (Rainmaker,  Raintree  North,  Round  Mountain,  Puntilla,  Snow  Ridge,  Dagwood,  Howell  Zone,  Super Conductor).  The Muddy Creek area, underlain by the 65Ma Composite Suite of intrusions, is geologically younger  that the Whistler area, and  represents  a prospective area for Intrusion-Related gold mineralization.

Recommendations for further work on the Whistler Project area include:

- · Further step-out and infill drilling at Raintree West and Island Mountain to upgrade the resource classification and to potentially add new resources.
- · Construction of a geological model and mineral domains at Raintree West.
- · Preliminary metallurgical testwork for Raintree West.
- · Additional geological modelling and mineral domain definition at the Whistler Deposit in order to  further  determine  potential  lithological  and  structural  controls  on  mineralization,  with potential updates to the resource estimate.
- · The collection of additional specific gravity measurements from existing drillholes at all deposits to augment the database.
- · Additional  in-fill  drilling  at  the  Whistler  Deposit  to  upgrade  the  classification  of  Inferred  to Indicated with 50m drillhole spacing.
- · Top-of-bedrock grid drilling in the Whistler area to define new targets.
- · A new and full review of all exploration data, with an outlook to review and rank all targets for further exploration drilling.

Technical Report - NI 43-101 Resource Estimate for the Whistler Project, Alaska

## 2.0 Introduction

Brazil Resources Inc. ("BRI") is a public mineral exploration company who holds the rights to the Whistler gold-copper property located 150 km northwest of Anchorage, Alaska.

This document reports on maiden resource estimations for the Raintree West and the Island Mountain deposits located on the Whistler property. The property is also host to the Whistler Deposit, for which a resource estimate described in MMTS (2015) remains unchanged.

Giroux  Consultants  Ltd.  ("GCL")  was  retained  by  BRI to  produce  maiden  resource  estimations  on  the Whistler  Project  for  the  Raintree  West  and  Island  Mountain  deposits  and  to  complete  this  technical report.  The effective date for this estimate is March 24, 2016, the day the data was received.

Gary Giroux, M.A. Sc., P.Eng., is the qualified person responsible for the Resource Estimate.  Mr. Giroux is a qualified person by virtue of education, experience and membership in a professional association. He is independent of the company applying all of the tests in Section 1.5 of National Instrument 43-101.

The  previous  owner  of  the  property,  Kiska  Metals  Corporation  (Kiska)  completed  three  years  of exploration on the property (2009 through 2011) which includes 181 diamond drillholes, a large 2D and 3D IP survey in the Whistler area, an airborne EM survey at Island Mountain, as well as surface mapping and  sampling.    Previous  exploration  on  the  property,  by  Kennecott  and  Geoinformatics,  includes geological mapping, stream sediment sampling, soil sampling, airborne magnetic surveys and drilling.

Mr.  Giroux  conducted  a  site  visit  of  the  property  on  April  21,  2016.    During  the  site  visit,  sufficient opportunity  was  available  to  examine  drill  sites  and  drill  cores,  conduct  a  general  overview  of  the property, and the condition of existing project infrastructure.  Based on his experience, qualifications, and review of the site and resulting data, the author, Mr. Giroux, is of the opinion that the exploration has been conducted in a professional manner and the quality of data and information produced from the efforts meet or exceed acceptable industry standards.  All of the exploration work has been directed or supervised by individuals who are geologists.  No new sampling or drilling has been completed on the Whistler  Deposit  since  the  last  historic  resource  estimate  was  completed,  which  is  documented  in  a Technical Report by MMTS with an effective date of August 15, 2015 (MMTS, 2015).

While actively involved in the preparation of the report, GCL had no direct involvement in the collection of the data and information or any role in the execution or direction of the work programs conducted for the project on the property or elsewhere.  Much of the data has undergone thorough scrutiny by project staff as well as certain data verification procedures by GCL (included in Section 12).

Sources of information are listed in the references, Section 27.

## 4.0 Property Description and Location

The Whistler Project is located in the Alaska Range approximately 150km northwest of Anchorage.  The centre of the property is located at 152.57 degrees longitude west and 61.98 degrees latitude north.

Figure 4-1 Location of the Whistler Project (2016).  Modified from Roberts, 2011a.

<!-- image -->

The  Whistler  Project  comprises  304  State  of  Alaska  mining  claims  covering  an  aggregate  area  of approximately 172 km 2 in the Yentna Mining District of Alaska.  All of the claims are owned by BRIA.  The property boundaries have not been legally surveyed.

An  all  season  camp  facility  exists  near  the  confluence  of  Portage  Creek  and  the  Skwentna  River, approximately 15 km southeast of the Rainy Pass Hunting Lodge.  The camp is serviced with a 1000 m gravel  airstrip  for  wheel-based  aircrafts.    The  camp  is  equipped  with  diesel  generators,  a  satellite communication link, tent structures on wooden floors and several wood-framed buildings.

BRIA's rights to the Whistler Project were acquired in connection with an Asset Purchase Agreement on August  5,  2015,  whereby  Kiska  Metals  Corporation  transferred  to  BRIA  100  percent  interest  in  the

## Technical Report - NI 43-101 Resource Estimate for the Whistler Project, Alaska

Whistler  Project  in  exchange  for  the  issuance  of  3,500,000  common  shares  in  the  capital  of  BRI  as disclosed by news release on August 6, 2015.

The  first  underlying  agreement  is  a  Royalty  Purchase  Agreement  between  Kiska  Metals  Corporation, Geoinformatics Alaska Exploration Inc. and MF2, LLC, dated December 16, 2014.  This agreement grants MF2 a 2.75 percent NSR royalty over all 304 claims, and extending outside the current claims over an Area of Interest defined by the maximum historical extent of claims held on the project as indicated on Figure 4-1.  BRIA can purchase 0.75 percent of the NSR royalty for a payment of US$5,000,000 to MF2.

The second underlying agreement is an earlier agreement between Cominco American Incorporated and Mr. Kent Turner dated October 1, 1999.  This agreement concerns a 2.0 percent net profit interest to Teck Resources, recently purchased by Sandstorm Gold, in connection with an Area of Interest specified by standard township sub-division as indicated in Figure 4-2.

The third underlying agreement is a Purchase and Sale agreement between Kent Turner, Kiska Metals Corporation and Geoinformatics Alaska Exploration Inc., dated December 16, 2014 that terminates the "Turner Agreement" (an agreement that grants Kennecott and its successors a 30-year lease on twentyfive unpatented State of Alaska Claims; see Figure 4-2) and transfers to Kiska and Geoinformatics, and their  successors,  an  undivided  100  percent  of  the  legal  and  beneficial  interest  in,  under,  to,  and respecting the Turner Property free and clear of all Encumbrances arising by, through or under Turner other than the Cominco American net profit interest.

A full Claims List can be found in Appendix A at the end of this report.  Annual claim rental payments of USD $4.25 per acre and annual exploration expenditures ("Labor") USD $2.50 per acre are required to keep  the  claims  in  good  standing,  and  must  be  submitted  to  the  Alaska  Department  of  Natural Resources by November 30 th  of every year. Excess Labor from previous years may be carried forward and currently there are no Labor requirements until September 2018.  BRIA currently holds permits with the State of Alaska that allow for the presence of an exploration camp and the work proposed in this report,  primarily  exploration  diamond  drilling,  to  proceed.    These  include  a  Miscellaneous  Land  Use Permit for Hardrock Exploration and Reclamation, a Temporary Water Use Permit, and a Fish Habitat Permit.  These permits are good until December 31 st , 2020, and are renewable on multi-year basis.  BRIA has  no  other  surface  rights  to  the  property.  Legal  access  to  the  property  is  currently  provided  by  a permitted gravel airstrip large enough to support fixed-wing aircraft to deliver staff and supplies.

## 5.0 Accessibility, Climate, Local Resources, Infrastructure and Physiography

The Whistler Project is located in the Alaska Range approximately 150 km northwest of Anchorage and 76 km west of the township of Skwentna (Figure 4-1).  Access to the project area is by fixed wing aircraft to a gravel airstrip located adjacent to the Whistler exploration camp.  In the winter of 2011, Kiska had constructed  a  temporary  winter  trail  to  the  Whistler  Project  that  was  then  used  for  the  inbound transportation of fuel, earth moving equipment, and bulk items for the camp and exploration programs.

The project area is between regions of maritime and continental climate and is characterized by severe winters and hot, dry summers.  The maritime climatic influence provides for dry, mild and temperate summers.  Fog and low clouds are common in mid-summer and fall especially around higher elevation areas.  Average summer temperatures range between 5° and 20° C, whereas winter temperatures range from -15°  to  -5°  C.    Occasionally,  arctic  cold  fronts  will  propagate  across  the  Alaska  Range  from  the interior,  causing  cold  dry  air  to  seep  into  the  watershed.    These  infrequent  stationary  high  pressure systems can lead to clear days with temperatures dropping to a low of -35° C during the winter.  Strong winds persist during the winter months.  Annual precipitation ranges from 500 to 900 mm.  Winter snow accumulation usually begins in October and by mid to late May the snow has melted sufficiently to allow for fieldwork.

The  Whistler  Project  is  supported  by  a  fifty  person,  all  season  camp  located  on  the  banks  of  the Skwentna River approximately 2.7km from the Whistler Deposit and 22 km from the Island Mountain prospect.  The camp is connected to the Whistler Deposit by a 6 km access road.

The camp is served by a 38 kilowatt generator, water well, septic system, showers and flush toilets, and a modern kitchen.  A smaller 16 kilowatt backup and low peak need generator is also installed in the well/generator house.  The camp has 37 sleeper tents, 3 wood frame cabins, a cook tent, a recreational tent,  First  Aid  Tent,  a  wood  frame  well/generator  house  and  a  wood  frame  men's  and  women's shower/restroom building.

## Technical Report - NI 43-101 Resource Estimate for the Whistler Project, Alaska

Core processing facilities consist of one insulated core cutting tent that houses two core saws.  The core logging facilities consist of two 7 m by 14 m structures.  One is an insulated tent and the other is a well-insulated, well lit, wood-frame building.  All core cutting and logging facilities have decks that are designed for ease of handling large volumes of core with skid steer fork lifts.  All areas around camp have graveled travel ways that connect camp facilities with runway facilities.

There is a wood-frame shop building that is for general camp maintenance and all rolling stock.  The shop and core cutting facilities are supplied electricity by a separate generator building.  A 20 kilowatt generator supplies power during peak months when both saws are running.  A 16 kilowatt generator is available for lower peak needs and back-up.

Heavy  equipment  and  ground  transport  machines  at  the  Whistler  Project  include  one  Cat  D6 bulldozer;  one  Cat  226B  track  skid-steer;  one  Bobcat  skid-steer;  one  Volvo  A-30  haul  truck;  ten snowmobiles; five ranger-style ATVs; and three 4-wheeler "Quad" ATVs.

A  sports  field  sized  area  has  been  cleared  and  graveled  for  core  storage.    Adjacent  areas  can  be cleared for more storage as the project grows.  There are also two wooden-deck helicopter pads with a small building for helicopter support.

## CAMP FACILITIES

WHISTLER PROJECT ALASKA USA Figure No:

## 2011a.

A  1000  m  compacted  gravel  runway  provides  a  nearly  year  round  landing  surface.    The  runway  is capable of landing DC-3 class aircraft and smaller.  A 113,400 litre fuel storage facility is located at the north east end of the runway.  All tanks are stored in separate lined containments.  They are designed to contain at least 1.5 times the volume of the largest tank in the containment.  All pumping is done through  aircraft  approved  filter  systems.   Two  buildings  are located  just  off  the  runway  for  drilling company  shop/warehouses  and  there  is  ample  room  for  lay  down  areas  for  parts  and  materials storage.

Communications is provided by a wireless satellite system.  There is also a cell phone repeater at the satellite communications station located on Whistler Ridge.  It provides fair-quality cell phone service in camp.

The  nearest public infrastructure for the Whistler Project is the town  of Petersville, located approximately 100 km west of Whistler; Petersville is connected to Anchorage by an all-weather road and highway.  The project is also located approximately 150 km north of the Beluga coalfield project and the Tyonek gas power station on the Cook Inlet coast.

The  project  is located  in the  drainage  of  the  Skwentna  River  that  forms  a  large  network  of interconnected  low-elevation  U-shaped  valleys  cutting  through  the  rugged  terrain  of  the  southern Alaska Range.  Elevation varies from about 400 m above sea level in the valley floors to over 5,000 m in the highest peaks resulting in a quite spectacular landscape.  The Alaska Range is a continuation of the Pacific  Coast  Mountains  extending  in  an  arc  across  the  northern  Pacific.    Mount  McKinley,  North America's highest peak at 6,194 m, is located approximately 130 km northeast of the project area.

<!-- image -->

## Technical Report - NI 43-101 Resource Estimate for the Whistler Project, Alaska

The vegetation in the Whistler region is quite variable.  The valley floors and lower slopes are usually characterized  by  dense  vegetation  giving  way  above  about  750  m  elevation  to  dense  bushy  shrubs rendering  ground  access  difficult.    At  higher  elevations,  vegetation  is  absent  and  active  glaciers  with terminal  and  lateral  moraines  are  present.    The  timber  line  is  located  at  elevations  varying  between 800m to 1,100 m.  Bedrock exposures within the project area are scarce except at  elevations  above 1,000 m and along incised drainage.

The Whistler Project mineral claims provide the area that is sufficient for the development of a potential open pit project, including tailings storage, waste disposal, potential processing plant sites and water sources.  A source of power has yet to be determined and mining personnel would likely have to be housed in a camp.

## 6.0 History

During  the  late  1960s,  regional  mapping  and  geochemical  sampling  by  the  United  States  Geological Survey ("USGS") identified several base and precious metal occurrences over a very large area in the southern Alaska Range including southern portions of the Whistler project area.

Following the results of that work, limited exploration was conducted in the area during the 1960s and 1980s.  Falconbridge (or their operator St. Eugene) was involved in exploring the nearby Stoney Vein in the late 1960s.  A local prospector, Arne Murto (deceased), was active in the Long Lake Hills area from at least  1964 and AMAX staked at least four claims over the Lower Discovery showing at Mount Estelle (circa 1982).

Mineral exploration in the Whistler area was initiated by Cominco Alaska in 1986 and continued through 1989.  During this period, the Whistler and the Island Mountain gold-copper porphyry occurrences were discovered and partially tested by drilling.  In 1990, Cominco's interest waned and all cores from the Whistler region were donated to the State of Alaska.  The property was allowed to lapse.

In  1999,  Kent  Turner  staked  twenty-five  State  of  Alaska  mining  claims  at  Whistler  and  leased  the property  to  Kennecott.    From  2004  through  2006  Kennecott  conducted  extensive  exploration  of  the Whistler  region,  including  geological  mapping,  soil,  rock  and  stream  sediments  sampling,  ground induced  polarization  and  they  conducted  an  evaluation  of  the  Whistler  gold-copper  occurrence  with fifteen core boreholes (7,948 m) and reconnaissance core drilling at other targets in the Whistler region (4,184 m).  Over that period, Kennecott invested over USD$6.3 million in exploration.

In June 2007, Geoinformatics Exploration Inc. ("Geoinformatics") announced the conditional acquisition of the Whistler Project as part of a strategic alliance with Kennecott Exploration Company ("Kennecott"). Between  July  and  October  2007,  Geoinformatics  drilled  seven  core  boreholes  (3,321  m)  to  infill  the deposit to sections spaced at seventy-five metres and to test for the north and south extensions of the deposit.

In August 2009, Geoinformatics acquired Rimfire Minerals Corporation and changed its name to Kiska Metals Corporation ("Kiska").  In 2009 and 2010, Kiska completed three phases of exploration on the property  to  fulfill  the  terms  of  the  Standardization  of  Back-In  Rights  ("SOBIR")  Agreement  between Kennecott Exploration Company and Kiska Metals Corporation.

In total, Kiska completed 224 line-km of 3D induced polarization ("IP") geophysics, 40 line-km of 2D IP geophysics, 327 line-km of cut-line, geological mapping on the 3D IP grid, detailed mapping of significant Au-Cu prospects, collection of 109 rock samples and 61 soil samples, 8,660 m of diamond drilling from 23  drillholes  (all  greater  than  200  metres  in  total  length),  petrographic  analysis  of  mineralization  at Island Mountain, a preliminary review of metallurgy at the Whistler Resource, and metallurgical testing of mineralization from the Discovery Breccia at Island Mountain.  This program was executed by Kiska geologists, independent geologists and multiple contractors, under the supervision of Kiska personnel. All  aspects  of  the  exploration  program  were  designed  and  monitored  by  a  Technical  Committee comprised of two Kennecott employees and two Kiska employees.  In August of 2010, Kiska delivered a Technical  Report  (Roberts,  2010)  to  Kennecott  summarizing  the  results  of  the  completed  Trigger

Technical Report - NI 43-101 Resource Estimate for the Whistler Project, Alaska

Program.  In September of 2010, Kennecott informed Kiska that it would not exercise its back-in right on the project and hence retained a 2% Net Smelter Royalty on the property.

From this point forward, Kiska continued to drill and explore the Whistler Project for the duration of the 2010 and 2011 field seasons. The majority of this work included shallow grid drilling (25 m to 50 m top of bedrock drilling) in the Whistler Area (also referred to as the Whistler Corridor), conventional stepout drilling from prospects in the Whistler Area, step-out drilling at the Island Mountain Breccia Zone, an airborne  EM  survey  of  the  Island  Mountain  area,  reconnaissance  drilling  at  Muddy Creek,  and  minor infill  drilling  at  the  Whistler  Deposit,  followed  by  the  publication  of  an  updated  NI43-101  resource estimate (MMTS, 2011).

## 7.0 Geological Setting and Mineralization

## 7.1 Geological Setting

The  Whistler  Project  is  situated  within  the  Wrangellia  Composite  Terrane  ("WCT"),  one  of  three composite  terranes  accreted  to  the  Alaskan  portion  of  the  North  America  Cordilleran  margin  in  the Mesozoic and Cenozoic.  This margin records a complex history of terrane accretion, basin formation, basin exhumation, subduction, and multiple pulses of magmatism.

In  south-central  Alaska,  the  WCT  is  comprised  of  three  significant  tectono-magmatic  assemblages (Figure 7-1):  1) the Paleozoic-Triassic basement rocks upon which the Early to Late Jurassic Talkeetna island  arc  was  built,  including  volumetrically  significant  plutonic  rocks;  2)  the  Kahiltna  assemblage, consisting  of  Jura-Cretaceous  flysch  sediments  that  formed  in  basins  initiated  by  the  convergence  of Wrangellia with  the  former  continental  craton;  and  3)  voluminous Upper  Cretaceous  and  PaleoceneOligocene  igneous  rocks,  dominantly  plutons,  that  stitch  the  Wrangellia  composite  terrane  with  the inboard  autochthonous  terranes.  The  latter  two  assemblages  dominate  the  regional  geology  of  the Whistler area.

The Kahiltna assemblage occurs as a broad 100 km by &gt;300 km belt extending across the Alaska Range. This  assemblage  is  comprised  of mostly marine  sediments  with  fossils  indicating  deposition  from  the Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous.

The black inset box shows the location of Whistler area and map extent in Figure 7-1.

## Technical Report - NI 43-101 Resource Estimate for the Whistler Project, Alaska

Uplift and shortening of the Kahiltna basin was followed by the construction of a continental-margin arc as defined by an extensive belt of 80-60 Ma plutons extending from the Alaska Range south-eastwards into  the  Coast  Range  of  Canada.    In  the  Alaska  Range,  these  arc  rocks  are  dominated  by  plutons interpreted to be the deeper roots of subvolcanic and volcanic centres; however extrusive sections are locally preserved.

There  are  four  intrusive  suites  associated  with  this  epoch  of  magmatism  that  are  recognized  in  the Whistler region, including (from oldest to youngest): 1) the Whistler Intrusive Suite or "WIS" (host to the Whistler  Deposit);  2)  the  Summit  Lake  Suite;  3)  the  Composite  Suite;  and  4)  the  Crystal  Creek  Suite (Figure 7-1).

The  Whistler  Intrusive  Suite  consists  of  intermediate  to  mafic  extrusive  and  intrusive  rocks,  including diorite  porphyries.  These diorite porphyries are host to, and genetically associated with, gold-copper porphyry mineralization on the Whistler Project area.  This is the only suite where comagmatic extrusive rocks  and  shallow  subvolcanic  intrusive  rocks  are  recognized  in  the  region.    On  a  district  scale  the intrusions generally occur as sills and less commonly as dikes and small stocks.  New U-Pb age dating of zircons from the mineralized diorite porphyry in the Whistler Deposit, and other mineralized porphyries on the Whistler Project, indicate igneous ages of 76.36 Ma ±0.3 Ma (Hames, 2014).  One of the leastaltered diorite porphyry intrusions located on the Whistler Ridge has a hornblende Ar-Ar age date of 75.5 ± 0.3 Ma (Young, 2005).

The  Summit  Lake  intrusions  are  regionally  represented  by  74  to  61  Ma  calc-alkaline  granodiorite  to diorite, becoming more monzonitic and of alkali-calcic affinity in the Whistler area.  East and northeast from  Whistler,  these  intrusions  are  associated  with  local  gold  prospects  and  have  been  called  the Kichatna plutons and more locally, the 'Old Man Diorite'.

The Composite Plutons include the Emerald, Mount Estelle, Stoney, and Kohlsaat plutons, and are locally associated with gold mineralization.  The Composite Plutons are seen to be somewhat concentrically zoned magmatic series, with an early border phase of alkaline mafic to ultramafic rock, inwards towards less alkaline monzonites to granites.  The common age range is 67 to 64 Ma.

The  Crystal  Creek  sequence,  located  south  of  Whistler,  is  mainly  calc-alkaline  granite  or  rhyolite  and ranges in age from 61 to 56 Ma. More mafic rocks, including the 61Ma Porcupine Butte andesite and Bear Cub (diorite) pluton, may represent higher level/border phases to the Crystal Creek sequence.

Continental arc magmatism in the Latest Cretaceous is responsible for some of the most significant gold and copper-gold deposits in Alaska.  These include the Pebble gold-copper porphyry deposit (89 Ma; Schrader et al., 2001), the Donlin Creek gold deposit (70 Ma, Szumigala et al, 2000), the Fort Knox gold deposit (95 - 89 Ma, Mortenson et al., 1995), and the Livengood gold deposit (Late Cretaceous).

## 7.2 Property Geology

The property geology of the Whistler area is well documented and described in detail by Young (2005) and Franklin (2007).  The property can be subdivided into three main areas based on distinctive intrusive rocks and their association with gold-copper and gold-only mineralization: 1) The Whistler Corridor; 2) Island Mountain; and 3) Muddy Creek (Figure 7-3).

## 7.2.1 Whistler Corridor

The bulk of the Whistler property is underlain by flysch sediments of the Kahiltna assemblage, while the Whistler Corridor is dominated by a largely fault bounded block of andesitic volcanic rocks, interpreted to represent a local volcanic-dominated basin (Figure 7-4).  The sedimentary and volcanic rocks are host to a variety of dioritic to monzonitic dykes, sills and stocks of the WIS. Much of the low-lying areas in this region are covered by 5 to 15 metres of glacial till, and hence much of the geological map is based on drilling and interpretation of geophysical data.

Figure 7-4 Whistler Project Geology (2016). Modified from Roberts, 2011a.

<!-- image -->

The Whistler Deposit is hosted by a multi-phase diorite porphyry intrusive complex of the WIS nested within sediments of the flysch package, whereas prospects in the Whistler Area (Raintree, Rainmaker) are  hosted  by  similar  diorite  porphyry  intrusive  centres  within  the  volcanic  basin.    Age  dating  of mineralized and barren diorite porphyry units on the Whistler ridge indicates that magmatism occurred at  approximately  75  to  76  Ma  (Young,  2005;  Hames,  2011).    The  mineralogy  and  composition  of  the intrusive  rocks  and  the  andesitic  volcanic  rocks  are  quite  similar,  suggesting  that  they  are  broadly comagmatic (Young, 2005).  Inversion modeling of the airborne geophysical data suggests that there is a

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Technical Report - NI 43-101 Resource Estimate for the Whistler Project, Alaska large 5 kilometre diameter batholith possibly situated 1 kilometre below the surface and that some of the diorite porphyry intrusive centres are cupolas at the apices of the batholith.

The detailed geology of the volcanic stratigraphy remains uncertain, largely due to glacial cover and the extensive amount of texturally destructive, hydrothermal alteration.  Volcanic rocks are comprised of coherent  andesites  and  volcanic  breccias  that  define  a  variety  of  depositional  facies.    Based  on  the occurrence of common argillaceous interflow sediments Young (2005) inferred a sub-aqueous marine setting  for  the  bulk  of  the  volcanic  rocks.    In  the  eastern  Long  Lake  Hills  area,  volcanic  flows  are interbedded with Feldspathic Sandstones, and Young (2005) interpreted this to represent the onset of volcanism in  a  shallower  marine  setting.    In  addition  to  these  extrusive  rocks,  a  large  volume  of  the volcanic rocks are interpreted to be comprised of porphyritic, subvolcanic units, as either large sills or stocks. These  subvolcanic  units  can  be  difficult  to  differentiate  from  coherent  volcanic  rocks, particularly  porphyritic  flows,  and  in  areas  of  intense  texturally-destructive  phyllic  alteration.    The stratigraphy of the volcanic rocks are currently unresolved. The current geological map  only differentiates  'least-altered'  from  'altered'  volcanic  rocks  based  on  the  extrapolation  of  airborne magnetic data from the grid and scout drilling.  All of the volcanic and subvolcanic rocks encountered in drilling are magnetic when they are least-altered, and magnetism is generally destroyed by sulphidation during phyllic alteration.

In  addition  to  least-altered  volcanic  rocks,  magnetic  high  anomalies  also  occur  in  association  with northwest-elongated linear to oval-shaped diorite dykes and stocks hosted by flysch sediments and in association with zones of near-surface secondary magnetite alteration and veining, such as the Whistler Deposit, and the Rainmaker and Raintree North prospects.

The  bulk  of  the  flysch  sediments  on  the  Whistler  Project  area  have  north  to  northeast  striking  and steeply dipping bedding orientations due to compressional deformation that resulted in chevron-style folding.  These folds are north-east striking, and fold limbs are typically moderate to steep or overturned (Young,  2005).  A  dioritic  sill  exposed  on  the  Whistler  Ridge  is  likewise  folded,  suggesting  that  a component of dioritic magmatism pre-dated regional deformation.

Several northeast-trending faults have been interpreted based on topographic linear features and the truncation and offset of magnetic features.  These are considered to be the earliest structure features on the property since they are truncated by north-northwest-oriented faults with left-lateral offset, such as the Alger Peak Fault.

## 7.2.2 Island Mountain

The  Island  Mountain  area  is  comprised  of  a  suite  of  nested  intrusions,  ranging  compositionally  from hornblende diorite to hornblende-biotite monzonite, emplaced within flysch sediments of the Kahiltna assemblage (Figure 7-5).  Texturally, these intrusions range from equigranular to strongly porphyritic, suggesting  a  relatively  high  level  of  emplacement  typical  of  the  porphyry  environment.    Unlike  the Whistler  area,  no  coeval  volcanic  rocks  are  recognized.    Based  on  limited  whole-rock  geochemistry (Young, 2005) the Monzonite at Island Mountain plots within the silica-saturated alkalic field of Lang et al. (1995) and is the intrusive equivalent of trachy-andesite on a total alkali versus silica diagram.  This suite of intrusions is mapped as part of the circa 67 to 64 Ma Composite Suite of intrusions, similar to the Muddy Creek area, however recent age dating suggests some complexity with dates ranging from 77

Effective Date: March 24, 2016

## Technical Report - NI 43-101 Resource Estimate for the Whistler Project, Alaska

Ma down to 64 Ma (Gross, 2014).  Compared to Muddy Creek, the intrusive rocks at Island Mountain are generally more mafic (diorite and monzonites as opposed to quartz monzonite and granites at Muddy Creek), are magnetite-bearing rather than ilmenite-bearing, are commonly more porphyritic rather than coarse equigranular, lack the strong, pervasive gold-arsenic association, and lack the evenly distributed northwest-oriented sheeted fracture set that typifies mineralized structures at Muddy Creek.  For these reasons, it is  likely  that  igneous  rocks  at  Island  Mountain  represent  a  unique  intrusive  suite  separate from the Composite Suite.

This  unique  intrusive  centre  is  broadly  situated  at  the  intersection  between  the  regionally  significant northwest-striking Timber Creek Fault, which can be traced for 10's of kilometres, and the Skwentna River valley, postulated as a possible fault zone (Young, 2005).  The bulk of the nested intrusions occur on  the  southeast  side  of  Island  Mountain  and  this  is  where  sediments  in  the  contact  metamorphic aureole of these intrusions are hornfelsed.  The hornfels, especially on the southwest corner of Island Mountain, occur as irregular rafts and possibly roof pendants that appear to form a slope-parallel skin of country rock that demarks the roof zone of this intrusive complex.  Sediments consist of dark mudstone, shale, thinto medium-bedded  siltstone  and  dark  grey  sandstone  and  minor  dirty  calcareous sedimentary  beds  and  a  few  local  thin  pebble  conglomerate  units.  These  units  predominate  on  the northwest portion of Island Mountain.

## Technical Report - NI 43-101 Resource Estimate for the Whistler Project, Alaska

The  earliest  recognized  intrusive  phase  is  the  Island  Mountain  Diorite  Porphyry.  This  unit  has  been observed to be cut by all other igneous units and is  the host  to gold-copper porphyry mineralization associated with intrusive and hydrothermal breccias at the Island Mountain Deposit (previously referred to as the "Breccia Zone").

The next most volumetrically significant intrusive phase is a Monzonite Porphyry (IFMIP) that occurs in the northeast corner of Island Mountain, and which is generally the host of gold-copper porphyry-style mineralization  at  the  Cirque  and  the  Howell  zones.    Unlike  the  Diorite  Porphyry,  this  unit  contains magnetite phenocrysts and is thus well delineated by airborne magnetic survey data.

In the Breccia Zone, Diorite- and Monzonite-cemented intrusive breccias occur as sub-vertical, 100-150 metre diameter, sub-circular to irregularly shaped pipes that grade into actinolite-magnetite-cemented hydrothermal breccias with pyrrhotite-pyrite-chalcopyrite mineralization, which together define magmatic-hydrothermal conduits that host the bulk of gold-copper porphyry mineralization in this area. Not  all  the  Intrusive  Breccia  bodies  are  altered  or  mineralized,  suggesting  that  either  some  of  these breccias post-date the main phase of mineralization, or that some pre-mineral intrusive breccias were not affected by hydrothermal fluid.  Together, these intrusive and hydrothermal breccias have been the focus of the majority of the exploration drilling at Island Mountain since 2009. A series of these breccias extend discontinuously for 700 metres from the "Breccia Zone" on a north-northwest trend along the south-western slope of Island Mountain. The Breccia Zone also contains narrow, pencil-like bodies of Coarse Porphyritic Hornblende Diorite that are syn-to-post gold-copper mineralization.

This  corridor  of  breccias  is  flanked  by  strong  pervasive  albite  alteration  with  local  zones  of  vein  and disseminated  pyrrhotite  that  constitutes  significant  Au-only  mineralization  within  and  flanking  the Breccia  Zone.    Similar  intrusive  and  hydrothermal  breccias  with  peripheral  sodic  alteration  and pyrrhotite  mineralization  occur  in  areas  of  gold  and  copper  soil  anomalies  at  the  Howell  Zone, suggesting  the  occurrence  of  multiple  magmatic-hydrothermal  centres.  The  Howell  Zone  remains untested by drilling.

The last volumetrically significant phase of magmatism is represented by a coarse grained equigranular monzonite that occurs as a northwest-striking dyke or sill exposed near the base of slope on the southwestern side of Island Mountain.  This unit lies adjacent and strikes parallel to the regional Timber Creek Fault, suggesting a possible regional control on the emplacement of this unit.  Likewise, all of the abovementioned  units  are  cut  by  narrow,  post-mineral,  fine-grained  mafic  to  intermediate  dykes  that generally strike to the northwest and dip steeply.

## 7.2.3 Muddy Creek

Muddy  Creek  is  located  in  rugged  terrain  along  the  western  edge  of  the  Whistler  Project  and  is comprised of several steep,  north-east  facing  U-shaped  glacial valleys  separated  by  razor-back  ridges with  small  remnant  glaciers  at  the  heads  of  each  valley.  This  prospect  is  largely  underlain  by  a monzonitic  intrusive  complex,  part  of  the  Composite  Suite  (or  Estelle  Suite)  of  intrusions  that  were emplaced within sediments of the Kahiltna Assemblage in the late Cretaceous (Figure 7-6).  An argonargon analysis of igneous biotite from a granodiorite on the western margin of the intrusive complex returned an age date of 67.4 Ma ± 0.4 Ma (Solie et al., 1991a).  A steep, east-west trending contact between the intrusive complex and hornfels sediments is well-exposed in the ridgelines in the northern

portion of the prospect and is comprised of a conspicuous and extensive red-brown colour anomaly. Hornfels also comprises the eastern-contact of the intrusive complex.

The bulk of the geological mapping at Island Mountain was completed by Kennecott and the following descriptions are from Young (2005).  The core of the intrusive complex is monzonitic, grading outwards to progressively more mafic and older intrusive phases (Crowe et al., 1991), with pendants of ultramafic rocks at the margins (Millholland, 1998).  The pluton intrudes very steeply north-dipping sedimentary rocks of the middle Graywacke Sandstone subunit and Tabular Sandstone unit.  Local matrix-supported pebble  conglomerate  and  spherical  concretions  along  Muddy  Creek  support  a  correlation  with  the Tabular Sandstone unit.

The majority of the Mount Estelle pluton consists of biotite-monzonite, with an increasing proportion of augite  phenocrysts  towards  the  margins.    Monzonite  is  medium-  to  coarse-grained  and  idiomorphic granular and occurs at the central and southern portions of the mapped area at Muddy Creek. Mafics, principally biotite books (to 5 mm) and subordinate to absent stubby dark augite generally constitute 15 to  35%  of  the  monzonite.    Twinned  3  mm  to  1  cm  orthoclase  phenocrysts  are  a  fundamental component.  Groundmass  consists  of  a  medium-grained  equigranular  mixture  of  feldspar  and  quartz. Rounded  xenoliths  are  rare,  but  widespread,  and  consist  of  biotitized  sediments  and  more  strongly mafic (biotite and augite)-rich intrusive rock of earlier intrusive phases.  Intrusion breccia's with rounded clasts are a very local feature as are sinuous to linear aplitic dikes.

## 7.3 Mineralization

Exploration on the Whistler Project by Kennecott, Geoinformatics and Kiska has identified three primary exploration targets for porphyry-style gold-copper mineralization.  These include the Whistler Deposit, Raintree West, and the Island Mountain Breccia Zone (the "Island Mountain Deposit") (Figure 7-7).  The Whistler  and  Island  Mountain  areas  also  host  multiple  secondary  porphyry-like  prospects  defined  by drilling, anomalous  soil  samples,  alteration, veining, surface rock samples,  induced  polarization chargeability/resistivity anomalies, airborne magnetic anomalies and airborne electromagnetic anomalies.    These  include  the  Raintree  North,  Rainmaker,  Round  Mountain,  Puntilla,  Snow  Ridge, Dagwood,  Super  Conductor,  Howell  Zone  and  Cirque  Zones.    The  Muddy  Creek  area  represents  an additional  exploration  target  with  the  potential  to  host  a  low-grade,  bulk  tonnage,  Intrusion-Related Gold mineralization.

BRI is currently conducting a technical review of the secondary porphyry-like targets to ascertain their exploration potential and prioritize these targets for future exploration programs.

## 7.3.1 Whistler Area and Whistler Deposit Mineralization Overview

The Whistler Deposit and prospects in the Whistler Area (Raintree West, Raintree North and Rainmaker) display a common pattern of alteration, vein paragenesis, and mineralization styles that suggest these spatially separate porphyry centres share a common genetic association.  These features are hosted by, and genetically linked to, pulses of diorite porphyry intrusive bodies that are nested in pipe-like centres. Geophysical inversion models of the airborne magnetic data suggest that these pipes may be cupolas that  occur  above  a  common  batholith.    That  these  porphyry  centres  are  genetically  associated  is corroborated  by  common  alteration  assemblages,  vein  types,  mineralization  styles  and  paragenetic relationships.  At the Whistler Deposit, the earliest Diorite Porphyry phase (Main Stage Whistler Diorite Porphyry) is associated with the main stage of gold-copper mineralization, whereas subsequent phases are less mineralized, and thus are either weak metal contributors or diluting bodies.

The earliest recognized alteration event recognized at the Whistler Deposit and the porphyry prospects in  the  Whistler  Area,  referred  to  as  "Magnetite"  alteration,  occurs  as  patchy  magnetite  alteration  of mafic  minerals  (dominantly  hornblende  and  possibly  pyroxenes)  and  narrow,  irregular  magnetite veinlets ("M-veins").  Magnetite in this event is occasionally intergrown with trace chalcopyrite.  This stage  may  include  the  partial  replacement  of  feldspars  by  secondary  K-feldspar,  particularly  in  the selvages to M-veins, and hence may be part of the earliest, weakest stage of Potassic alteration (see below).    This  stage  is  recognized  in  both  the  Main  Stage  and  Intermineral  Stage  Diorite  Porphyry generally in the core zone of mineralization at the Whistler Deposit.  In addition, it has been observed to occur within andesitic volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks within 50 m of similarly altered diorite intrusions in the Whistler Area, however not within the Feldspathic Sandstones that host the Whistler Deposit.

<!-- image -->

The  subsequent  stage  of  alteration  is  "Potassic"  alteration,  defined  by  the  occurrence  of  pinkish  Kfeldspar replacing plagioclase and matrix, which generally occurs as halos to, or pervasively in zones of, A-style and B-style quartz veins.  Potassic alteration also includes the replacement of mafic phases by fine-grained  secondary  "shreddy"  biotite,  however  this  is  generally  difficult  to  observe  due  to overprinting Chlorite-Sericite alteration (see below).  Strong Potassic alteration (pink rock) is generally accompanied by strong patchy magnetite alteration, and overall this leads to strong textural destruction such that the rock is mottled pink-black without an obvious porphyritic texture.  Potassic alteration is associated with the bulk of gold-copper mineralization, which occurs as chalcopyrite and rare bornite in A- and B-style quartz veins and as fine-grained disseminations in adjacent wall rock.  At the Whistler Deposit, gold occurs predominantly as electrum associated with chalcopyrite.  There exists a spectrum of  A-  and  B-style  quartz  veins.  A-veins  are  millimetre  wide,  sugary  quartz  ±  magnetite  with  wormy margins.  These are generally observed to cut M-veins, however occasional M-veins have been seen to transition  into  A-like  quartz  veins.  B-veins  are  generally  comprised  of  slightly  coarser,  equigranular quartz with centre-line septa of chalcopyrite, and have straight sides.  Intense zones of B-style veining form  strong  stockwork  zones  are  associated  with  high-grade  zones  (&gt;1  gpt  Au,  &gt;0.5%  Cu).    Potassic alteration  and  quartz  veining  may  include  minor  pyrite,  yet  these  zones  have  relatively  low  total sulphide content (&lt;1-2%).

In  general,  core  zones  of  Potassic  alteration  and  Au-Cu  mineralization  are  partially  to  completely overprinted  by  "Chlorite-Sericite"  alteration,    This  "green  rock"  alteration  is  ubiquitous  and  the  most macroscopically  obvious  alteration  in  zones  of  Au-Cu  mineralization,  even  though  it  is  a  later  event. Here,  bright  green  chlorite  replaces  secondary  biotite  and  any  primary  mafic  phases  remaining,  and waxy green sericite  replaces  feldspars.    Pyrite  is  part  of  this  assemblage,  partly  replacing  mafics  and magnetite. Calcite or carbonate may be part of this assemblage, as well as trace epidote.  Kennecott referred  to  this  alteration  assemblage  as  "Intermediate  Argillic",  which  is  also  equivalent  to  SCC alteration in the porphyry literature (see Sillitoe, 2010).  Kiska interprets Chlorite-Sericite alteration to be  transitional  to  "Phyllic"  alteration,  overprinting  (telescoping)  and  immediately  peripheral  to  core zones of mineralization.  This pervasive style of alteration is not obviously associated with any veining event, however there is a continuum of glassy quartz veins with pyrite&gt;&gt;chalcopyrite + molybdenite that appears to only occur in zones of Chlorite-Sericite and Phyllic alteration.

<!-- image -->

Potassic  and  Chlorite-Sericite  alteration  is  variably  overprinted  by  "Phyllic"  alteration.  The  Phyllic assemblage  consists  of  sericite  +  pyrite  +  quartz.    Moderate  to  strong  Phyllic  alteration  is  typically bleached  grey-tan,  where  mafic  minerals  are  completely  to  strongly  replaced  by  sericite  and  pyrite, magnetite is  replaced  by  pyrite,  and  feldspars  are  replaced  by  sericite  (and  clays).    Phyllic  alteration commonly occurs in halos to pyritic stringers ("Dpy") and quartz + pyrite veins ("D-veins"). In areas with intense  D-style  veining,  phyllic  halos  coalesce  to  give  pervasive  Phyllic  alteration.    Strong  to  intense Phyllic alteration is texturally destructive, which often leads to difficulty in distinguishing intrusive from volcanic rocks.  It is also suspected that intense Phyllic alteration is grade-destructive.  At the Whistler Deposit and other prospects Phyllic alteration forms an outer and upper, commonly gradational halo to Chlorite-Sericite alteration, and is also preferentially developed in structural zones, including faults and hydrothermal breccias.  Hydrothermal breccias commonly occur along the boundaries of different units (sediment/diorite;  volcanic/diorite;  diorite/diorite)  and  are  comprised  of  variably  milled  wallrock fragments cemented by quartz-sericite-pyrite ("pyritic rock flour breccias").  These breccias occasionally contain tourmaline.

In the Whistler Area, strong Phyllic alteration and high pyrite content (10-15%) is common peripheral to individual porphyry centres extending for hundreds of metres into surrounding volcanic rocks.  This has led to significant demagnetization of the volcanic stratigraphy such that the magnetic signature in the Area  is  a  function  of  alteration  (dominantly  Phyllic)  rather  than  primary  rock  types.    In  contrast,  the Phyllic halo at the Whistler Deposit only extends 50 m into the surrounding Feldspathic Sandstone. In addition  to  pyrite,  porphyry  centres  in  the  Area  are  also  large  sulphur  anomalies,  in  the  form  of sulphates.  Anhydrite appears to span several alteration and vein types: anhydrite occurs within B-type quartz-chalcopyrite  veins  and  within  cross-cutting  D-veins  and  Dbm  veins  (see  below).    Fine-grained anhydrite, of an uncertain alteration affiliation, also replaces feldspars at the microscopic scale. Gypsum locally replaces vein anhydrite and also occurs as very narrow and abundant hairline veinlets in zones of strong to intense and pyritic phyllic alteration.

<!-- image -->

At the Whistler Deposit and other prospects in the Whistler Area, the latest stage of precious and base metal  mineralization  is  associated  with  quartz-carbonate  (dolomite  and  calcite)-sphalerite-galena  ± chalcopyrite veins ("Dbm" or "D-base metal veins").  These veins have been observed to cut Potassic and Chlorite  Sericite  alteration  (including  Au-Cu  mineralization  and  A-  and  B-vein  stockwork),  Dpy  and  D veins, and sericite-quartz-pyrite cemented hydrothermal breccias. In the Whistler Area, these veins are commonly most abundant in the outer, intense phyllic halo within volcanic rocks within 100-200m of the diorite intrusive centres.  The veins can range from narrow veins (0.5-1 cm wide) up to 2-5  metre  wide  (generally  as  vein  breccias).  Veins  minerals,  including  sulphides,  are  medium  to  very coarse-grained (Figure 7-12), have local colliform banding, and vein quartz is occasionally chalcedonic. Based  on  their  cross-cutting  relationships,  textures,  mineralogy  and  spatial  relationship  to  porphyry centres,  these  veins  are  interpreted  to  have  formed  syn-to  post-Phyllic  stage  alteration.    That  these veins  typically  cut  phyllic-stage  hydrothermal  breccias  and  have  open-space  fill  colliform  banding, suggests that these veins formed in a much different hydrologic/structural regime (hydrostatic, possible incursion of meteoric waters) relative to Magnetite through to Phyllic events. Relative to the Whistler Deposit,  these  veins  are much  more  abundant  in  the  host  rocks  to  porphyry  centres  in  the  volcanichosted prospects in the Whistler Area, particularly Raintree West.  This observation, in addition to the epithermal-like textures of these veins, supports the notion that porphyry centres in the Area may have formed at shallower stratigraphic levels compared to the Whistler Deposit.

<!-- image -->

The most significant style of post-mineral alteration is Fe-carbonate alteration.  This occurs as pervasive alteration of feldspars in structural zones and as selvages to ankerite veins.  Primary igneous magnetite and secondary magnetite is commonly altered to hematite in these zones.  Ankerite veins, typically as brittle tension gashes, cross-cut all vein styles, including the Dbm veins.  The degree and extent of this style  of  alteration  is  typically  not  obvious  until  the  core  has  weathered  for  a  year  or  more,  and  is therefore not well-documented in the core logs.

## 7.3.2 Mineralization: Whistler Deposit

Gold  and  copper  mineralization  at  the  Whistler  Deposit  is  hosted  by  a  Late  Cretaceous,  multi-phase diorite  porphyry  intrusive  complex  that  intrudes  the  Feldspathic  Sandstone  unit  of  the  Kahiltna assemblage (Figure 7-14).  The Feldspathic Sandstone is comprised of sandstone with minor interbeds of mudstone,  siltstone  and  conglomerate.    Sedimentary  bedding  in  the  vicinity  of  the  deposit  primarily strikes to the northeast and dips steeply to the northwest.

Figure 7-14 Geological Map of the Whistler Deposit (2016). Modified from AMC, 2012.

The diorite porphyry intrusive complex is ovoid-shaped and vertically plunging (Figure 7-16).  The long axis of the ovoid is 700 metres long and oriented in a northwest-southeast direction.  The short axis of the ovoid is 500 metres wide and oriented in a northeast-southwest direction.  Deep drilling indicates that the intrusive complex is open below a depth of 800 metres from surface.

As described in the historical resource report MMTS 2011, the intrusive complex is composed of at least three diorite porphyry phases that are compositionally and texturally similar: they are comprised of 60-

## Technical Report - NI 43-101 Resource Estimate for the Whistler Project, Alaska

80%, euhedral to  subhedral  blocks  of  plagioclase  feldspar  phenocrysts  (0.2-3.0  mm  diameter),  5-20% hornblende laths (0.2-3.0 mm) that are usually altered to sericite, chlorite, pyrite, or a combination of these, and a fine grained, granular groundmass of feldspar and minor quartz, that is usually altered to silica, chlorite, sericite, clay or potassium feldspar.  In places within the deposit, three intrusive phases are recognized on the basis of cross-cutting relationships with mineralization and alteration.  The oldest intrusive phase, the "main stage diorite porphyry", carries the earliest recognized veining and alteration associated  with  gold-copper  mineralization  (see  below);  the  second  phase,  the  "inter-mineral  diorite porphyry" is recognized where it clearly cuts main stage diorite porphyry mineralization (i.e. intrusive contact cutting mineralized veins), and is itself veined and mineralized.  The third and youngest phase, the "late stage diorite porphyry" is barren except for local mineralized xenoliths of main or inter-mineral porphyry.

Due to the compositional and textural similarity of the main stage and inter-mineral stage porphyries and  hence  the  difficulty  in  consistently  identifying  these  stages  in  areas  that  lack  clear  cross-cutting relationships  with  mineralization  or  alteration,  Kiska  geologists  modeled  these  phases  as  a  single mineralized porphyry unit.  For consistency these phases are therefore referred to as the "Main Stage Porphyry".    Further  re-logging  of  drill  core  and  future  in-fill  drilling  may  be  able  to  clearly  and consistently differentiate these phases.

The Main Stage Porphyry ("MSP") comprises the bulk of the volume of the intrusive complex and is cut by the Late Stage Porphyry.  This latter phase clearly post-dates mineralization and truncates grade. It occurs as narrow, sub-vertical dykes and pencil-like bodies, generally 2 to 10 metres wide but up to 150 metres wide on the north and western edges of the MSP.  This phase generally has strong pervasive phyllic alteration, and occasionally xenoliths or rafts of the MSP, which locally contribute grade.

Gold and copper mineralization in the Main Stage Porphyry is comprised of 1-3% chalcopyrite and trace bornite  as  grains  within  magnetite  and  quartz  veins  (see  below)  and  as  disseminations  in  the  host porphyry generally within the halos to these veins. Petrography indicates that gold occurs predominantly as electrum associated with chalcopyrite (Petersen, 2004).  This mineralogy and style of mineralization is typical of diorite-hosted gold-copper porphyry deposits (Sillitoe, 2010).

Recent, preliminary modeling has identified two zones within the MSP which should be incorporated with further resource modeling.  These  zones of gold-copper mineralization occur in two areas within the  Main  Stage  Porphyry:  the  East  Core  ("ECORE")  and  West Core  ("WCORE")  domains (Figure  7-16). These domains are interpreted as discrete, near-vertical, ovoid-shaped fluid flow conduits (interconnected  vein  networks)  that  delivered  and  trapped  the  bulk  of  the  metals  in  the  MSP.  The ECORE is defined by coincident 0.40 gpt gold and 0.20% Cu grade contours and extends approximately 500  metres  in  the  north-south  dimension,  250  metres  in  the  east-west  dimension  and is  600  metres deep (from surface). The WCORE is defined by a 0.30 gpt gold grade shell with lower and irregular Cu grades  relative  to  the  ECORE.  This  domain  is  approximately  400  metres  long  in  the  north-south

direction, 200 metres wide in the east-west orientation and is 450 metres deep in a vertical dimension starting from 75 metres below surface.

These domains have the highest gold-copper grades relative to the remainder of the MSP domain, yet the boundaries of the ECORE and WCORE domains with the MSP are geologically gradational. Outside of the  ECORE  and  WCORE  domains,  the  MSP  lacks  any  volumetrically  significant  zones  of  potassic  and magnetite  alteration,  or  significant  volumes  of  mineralized  quartz  veining.    However,  wide-spaced drilling in the northern portion of the deposit has encountered gold-copper mineralization association with  magnetite  and  quartz  veining,  suggesting  that  further  drilling  may  define  other  zones  of mineralization similar to the ECORE and WCORE.

Both the ECORE and WCORE domains contain inner zones of strong potassic and magnetite alteration (see below), which are dominantly overprinted by pervasive chlorite-sericite alteration and local phyllic alteration.  These domains are also defined by the consistent occurrence and highest concentration of M-veins  and  mineralized  quartz  veins  (A-  and  B-veins).    In  these  domains,  mineralized  quartz  veins generally range in volume from 1 to 5%. Local high grade mineralization within these domains occurs in zones of high density quartz vein stockwork (locally &gt;20% quartz vein volume) and quartz + magnetite + chalcopyrite cemented hydrothermal breccias.  Minor 1 cm to 10 cm wide quartz-carbonate (ankerite and  calcite)-barite-sphalerite-galena ± chalcopyrite veins (Dbm  veins) cross-cut mineralized and unmineralized  portions  of  the  Main  Stage  Porphyry and  are  interpreted  as  intermediate  sulphidation epithermal veins that have telescoped on the porphyry system.  These sparse veins contain minor Au, Ag, Pb, Zn, and Cu, yet do not contribute significantly to the economic resource.

The structure of the intrusive complex is not well constrained with the widely spaced drilling.  However, five faults that cross-cut the deposit are currently modeled (Figure 7-16): Big Gulley Fault, Little Gulley Fault,  Divide  Fault,  Conquer  Fault  and  Ridge  Fault.    All  of  these  faults  have  been  modelled  based  on topographic  features,  fault  textures  in  drill  core  intercepts,  breaks  in  the  airborne  magnetic  data  (50 metre  line-spacing)  and  breaks  in  the  drill  core  magnetic  susceptibility  readings.  These  faults  are generally between 0.5 and 5 metres wide, and display a variety of textures in drill core, included silica and/or  carbonate  cemented  fault  breccias,  shear  textures,  clay  gouge,  brittle  fractures  and/or  a combination of  these  features.  Fault  structures  in  the  deposit  are  commonly  associated  with  narrow zones of strong to intense sericite, clay, pyrite and carbonate alteration.  This generally results in the conversion of magnetite to either pyrite and/or hematite, and therefore leads to demagnetization.

The Big and Little Gulley Faults strike to the northeast and dip steeply to the northwest.  The strike of these  faults  is  based  on  a  prominent  set  of  northeast-trending  gulley's  that  traverse  the  northern portion of the deposit, whereas the dip of the faults is based on drill core intercepts.

The Ridge Fault is a steeply northwest dipping (80° dip), curvi-planar fault that strikes sub-parallel to the Gulley Fault and is coincident with a significant northwest-dipping break-in-slope near the apex of the Whistler Ridge. The irregular strike of the fault is modelled based on a best fit between faults in drill core and an axis of demagnetization along this fault from the magnetic susceptibility data.  Based on the staircase geometry of topography downwards across the Gulley and Ridge faults to the northwest, Kiska geologists  interpret  these  faults  as  possible  normal  faults  with  upper  plate  blocks  downs  to  the northwest.    These  faults  do  not  appear  to  truncate  Au-Cu  grade,  and  hence  they  have  not  been

Effective Date: March 24, 2016

modelled as hard boundaries. The actual  sense  of motion  and  amount  of  potential  offset  across  this fault zone is unknown.

The Divide Fault (modelled as two strands) and the Conquer Fault are northwest-striking faults that dip steeply  to  the  southwest  (70-80°  dip).    These  faults  are  modelled  based  on  drill  core  intercepts  and prominent breaks in the downhole magnetic susceptibility readings.  These faults likely comprise strands within a fault zone. Where these faults intersect the Gulley and Ridge faults, the latter have a kinked geometry suggesting possible right-lateral offset of approximately 25-50 metres.

All  of  these  faults  generally  show  evidence  that  the  latest  movement  within  these  faults  post-dates mineralization (i.e. clay altered gouge  and  wallrock overprinting higher temperature  alteration assemblages,  carbonate-filled  tension  veins).    However,  both  the  ECORE  and  WCORE  occur  near  the intersection of the Divide and Ridge Faults, suggesting that they may have been active prior to or during mineralization, and hence may have acted as important controls on mineralization.

## 7.3.3 Mineralization: Raintree West

The Raintree West prospect occurs 1500 metres to the east of the Whistler Deposit, just off the nose of Whistler Ridge.  This prospect occurs below a thin veneer of glacial till (5 to 15 metres) and hence is not exposed  at  surface.  Outside  of  the  Whistler  Deposit,  Raintree  West  is  currently  the  most  advanced prospect in the Whistler Area on the basis of drill metres, with a total of 8,538 metres since the original discovery  hole  drilled  by  Geoinformatics  in  2008.    The  discovery  drillhole,  RN-08-06,  targeted  an airborne  magnetic  high  anomaly  that  is  coincident  with  an  IP  chargeability  high  detected  on  a  2D  IP reconnaissance  line  that  crossed  the  Whistler  Area.    This  hole  discovered  a  significant  zone  of  near surface (below 5 metres of till cover) gold-copper porphyry mineralization (160 metres grading 0.59 gpt gold, 6.02 gpt silver, 0.10% copper).

<!-- image -->

## Technical Report - NI 43-101 Resource Estimate for the Whistler Project, Alaska

Mineralization  at  Raintree  West  occurs  as  two  main  types:  1)  early,  porphyry-style  gold-copper mineralization  hosted  by  diorite  porphyry  stocks  and  consisting  of  quartz  and  magnetite  stockwork veining, with vein and disseminated chalcopyrite associated with potassic alteration, and 2) later crosscutting silver-gold-lead-zinc mineralization in quartz-carbonate veins (Dbm)  that contain pyrite, sphalerite, galena and chalcopyrite, with occasional  banded epithermal-like textures.  The early goldcopper mineralization is best developed within, and controlled by, early diorite porphyry intrusions (akin to Main Stage Porphyry at the Whistler Deposit), whereas the later silver-gold-lead-zinc veins surround and locally overprint the porphyry mineralization, and are most abundant in the host volcanic rocks in zones of strong to intense phyllic alteration vertically above and adjacent to the diorite porphyries.  In places, 25 m to 50 m wide diorite porphyry dykes cut both types of mineralization and are barren (akin to Late Stage Porphyry at the Whistler Deposit).

Current drilling at Raintree West has defined two significant zones of gold-copper porphyry mineralization: 1) a near surface zone on the east side of the Alger Peak fault; and 2) a deep zone on the west side of the fault (Figure 7-21).

The near surface porphyry gold-copper mineralization is coincident with a northwest-elongate airborne magnetic  high  anomaly  that  measures  250  metres  long  and  150  metres  wide,  which  pinches  to  the northwest and southeast.   Drilling  has  only intersected  this  mineralization  on  two  100  metre-spaced east-west sections (6,871,350mN and 6,871,450mN).  Gold-copper mineralization occurs from the top of bedrock to a maximum depth of approximately 170 metres, where it is either truncated by post-mineral diorite porphyry intrusions or faulting, and has a true width of approximately 150 metres.  Gold-copper mineralization is closed to the north, and potentially open to the south, however grade diminishes and the airborne magnetic high anomaly pinches out just south of the most southerly hole (WH10-025).

The  deep  zone  of  porphyry gold-copper  mineralization  on  the  west  side  of  the  fault  has  a  maximum apparent width and vertical extent of 300 by 300 metres at its widest (6,871,650mN), is open to depth, and  occurs  at  its  shallowest  at  470  metres  below  surface.    This  deep  zone  of  mineralization  can  be traced along a northwest-trending strike extent for at least 325 metres where it appears fault bound to the  northwest  and  is  open  to  depth  to  the  southeast.    The  mineralization  is  essentially  blind  to  the airborne magnetic data and the 3D IP due to the limited depth penetration of these techniques.

Porphyry  mineralization  at  Raintree  West  is  essentially  similar  to  that  at  the  Whistler  Deposit  with respect to veining and alteration, although Raintree West is mantled by intensely altered volcanic rocks with epithermal-texture quartz-carbonate veins.  These veins (Dbm), interpreted to have formed in a shallow  environment  post-dating  the  main  phase  of  porphyry  gold-copper  mineralization,  may  have developed through hydrothermal/thermal downward collapse onto to earlier formed high temperature porphyry system, contributing base and precious metals to the mantle of volcanic rocks and porphyry mineralization.

## 7.3.4 Mineralization: Island Mountain

The  Island  Mountain  prospect  area  is  host  to  several  mineralized  zones  interpreted  to  represent  a cluster of individual porphyry centres within this large intrusive complex.  These include the Breccia (the "Island Mountain  Deposit"),  Cirque  and  Howell  Zones,  and  other  prospects  defined  by  surface geochemistry  and  geophysical  anomalies  that  require  further  field  assessment.    Recent  exploration activity  and  the  majority  of  diamond drilling  by  Kiska  have  concentrated on mineralization associated within  the  Breccia  Zone  on  the  southwest  slope  of  Island  Mountain.    Here,  at  least  three  styles  of significant  gold  and  copper  mineralization  are  currently  recognized:  1)  gold-copper  mineralization hosted  by  k-feldspar  altered  monzonitic  intrusive  breccia,  2)  gold-copper  mineralization  hosted  by intrusive  and  hydrothermal  breccias  associated  with  strong  sodic-calcic  alteration,  and  3)  gold-only mineralization associated with vein and disseminated pyrrhotite ("pyrrhotite-gold").

At the Breccia Zone, the first two styles of mineralization occur within a 300 m diameter, sub-circular, sub-vertical  breccia  pipe,  which  appears  to  have  been  a  conduit  for  inter-mingled  intrusive  and hydrothermal  breccias  hosted  by  the  Diorite  Porphyry.  Gold-copper  mineralization  hosted  by  the  kfeldspar altered monzonitic intrusive breccia is volumetrically smaller than the subjacent hydrothermal breccias and is interpreted as being the earliest stage of mineralization, since this breccia body is cut by actinolite  veinlets.    Mineralization  is  associated  with  trace  to  2%  disseminated  chalcopyrite  in  the  kfeldspar altered intrusive cement of the breccia.

Figure 7-24 Photo of monzonite-matrix intrusive breccia with patchy albite alteration, silicification and disseminated chalcopyrite

<!-- image -->

The bulk of gold-copper mineralization at the Breccia Zone is hosted by intrusive and hydrothermal breccias with strong sodic-calcic alteration with pyrrhotite as the predominate sulphide and trace to 1% chalcopyrite.    Chalcopyrite  is most  abundant  in  the  matrix  of  the  hydrothermal  breccias  and  is commonly intergrown with pyrrhotite and actinolite ± magnetite.  Pyrrhotite, ranging from 1 to 5%, occurs  as  disseminations  within  the  breccia  matrix  and  as  large  blebs  cementing  the  matrix.    The deportment of gold in the breccia zone is not known.  Weaker gold-copper mineralization extends 5075 metres beyond the breccia zone and is associated with actinolite stockwork veining.

<!-- image -->

Gold-only  mineralization  in  the  Breccia  Zone  (referred  to  as  'Pyrrhotite-Gold'  mineralization)  occurs 100-200 metres peripherally to the intrusive-hydrothermal breccia body and occurs in association with vein  and  disseminated  pyrrhotite  within  the  Diorite  Porphyry.  Pyrrhotite  veins  occur  in  irregular, possibly sheeted sets, and are typically 1-10 millimetres wide and have pyrrhotite-rich (up to 15-20%) net-textured vein selvages (i.e. replacing the igneous matrix of the Diorite Porphyry).  Petrography and SEM studies indicate that gold occurs as electrum intergrown within and marginal to pyrrhotite grains. The orientation and continuity of these veins is currently undefined.

The relationship between the breccia-hosted gold-copper mineralization and the pyrrhotite-associated gold-only mineralization is not fully understood.  The current working hypothesis is that the gold-copper and gold-only  mineralization  are  associated  with  the  same  hydrothermal  fluid,  such  that  copper  was precipitated in the hotter parts of the system within the hydrothermal breccia, and copper-depleted, gold-bearing  fluids  persisted  into  cooler,  structural  zones  beyond  the  breccia  and  were  subsequently precipitated (Rowins, 2011).

## 7.3.5 Mineralization: Muddy Creek

Gold  mineralization  at  Muddy  Creek  is  hosted  throughout  the  core  of  the  plutonic  complex  and  is controlled  by  northwest-striking  and  steeply  southwest-dipping,  mm-  to  locally  cm-wide  veinlets  of sulfides and quartz, manifest as rusty-weathering sub-parallel fracture sets, commonly spaced a metre or more apart (Figure 7-27).  These veinlets may contain any combination of chalcopyrite, arsenopyrite, pyrite, stibnite, pyrrhotite and native gold, with minor amounts of galena, sphalerite and molybdenite. Moderate sericitic alteration is typically restricted to cm-wide selvages to these veins, whereas the bulk of the interleaving rock is relatively unaltered and unmineralized.  Cone sheets and circular onion skintype joints that resemble bubbles or mariolites also carry gold mineralization, and elevated gold and copper  values  are  also  found in  cm-scale  pegmatites.   Coarse-  to  very  coarse-grained  feldspar-quartz pegmatite with chalcopyrite  and  subordinate molybdenite  occur  along  joint  planes  and intersections, centered in aplitic dikes and at the cores of circular joint sets or cone sheets.  Lastly, massive sulfide veins occur locally along Muddy Creek in hornfelsed sedimentary wall rock.  Previous workers report gold in all mineralization types to range from ppm to more than 1 oz/t in select samples (Millholland, 1998).

## Technical Report - NI 43-101 Resource Estimate for the Whistler Project, Alaska

Accessory minerals associated with mineralization in veins include vuggy quartz and K-spar, with greatly subordinate  ilmenite,  tourmaline,  apatite,  beryl,  and  possibly  corundum.    Unlike  most  other  mineral types  of  the  Whistler  region,  magnetite  is  completely  absent  and  the  only measurable  magnetism  in hand samples is imparted by ilmenite and pyrrhotite.

Previous exploration has largely been focused on areas where the vein/fracture density is highest.  This includes structural zones near the top of Discovery Creek, Phoenix Creek, Prospect Creek and Muddy Creek  that  occur  along  the strike extent  of  a  significant  northwest-striking  fault  zone.    Two  diamond drillholes drilled by Kiska in 2011 focused on a high density vein/fracture zone at the top of Prospect Creek.  Here drilling returned a highlight result of 0.44 gpt gold over 44.2 metres from 297.0 downhole (MC11-002). True widths on mineralization in this area may be approximately 80% of drilled widths, yet the full extent of mineralization down-dip or along strike is unknown due to a lack of drilling.

## 8.0 Deposit Types

Exploration on the Whistler Project by Kennecott, Geoinformatics and Kiska has identified three primary exploration  targets  for  porphyry-style  gold-copper  deposits.    These  include  the  Whistler  Deposit, Raintree  West,  and  the  Island  Mountain  Breccia Zone.    These  deposits  and  their  exploration  criteria, conform to the porphyry deposit model as described in Sillitoe (2010). All of the porphyry prospects in the Whistler Area share similar styles of alteration, mineralization, veining and cross-cutting relationships that are generally typical of porphyry systems associated with relatively oxidized magma series (A- and B-type quartz vein stockwork, chalcopyrite-pyrite ore assemblage, presence of sulphates, core of potassic alteration with well-developed peripheral phyllic alteration zones).  The Whistler area also  hosts  multiple  secondary  porphyry-like  prospects  defined  by  drilling,  anomalous  soil  samples, alteration,  veining,  surface  rock  samples,  Induced  Polarization  chargeability/resistivity  anomalies  and airborne  magnetic  anomalies.    These  include  the  Raintree  North,  Rainmaker,  Dagwood,  Round Mountain, Puntilla, Canyon Creek, and Snow Ridge prospects.

In  contrast,  Island  Mountain  has  significantly  different  alteration,  veining  and  sulphide  assemblages associated  with  mineralization, principally the occurrence  of  pyrrhotite  and  to  a lesser extent arsenopyrite associated with Au-Cu mineralization, Au-Cu association with strong sodic-calcic alteration, lack of significant sulphates, very minor hydrothermal quartz and weak to insignificant phyllic alteration. For these reasons, the porphyry system at Island Mountain may belong to the 'reduced' subclass of porphyry copper-gold deposits (see Rowins, 2000).

The  Muddy  Creek  area  represents  an  additional  exploration  target  with  the  potential  to  host  a  bulk tonnage,  Intrusion-Related  Gold  deposit.  Explorations  by  Millrock  Resources  Inc.  on  claims  directly adjacent  to  the  Muddy  Creek  area,  which  are  geologically  analogous,  have  returned  encouraging preliminary results.  Like Island Mountain, the Muddy Creek mineralization is distinct from the Whistler Porphyry systems and shares more similarity with Intrusion Related Gold (IRG) systems characteristic of the Tintina Gold Belt.  The intrusive complex at Muddy Creek is predominantly monzonitic grading to more mafic marginal phases, yet is generally more felsic in composition relative to the diorites of the Whistler Area.  Mineralization is restricted to sheeted vein zones with narrow millimetre scale veinlets and pegmatitic veinlets of quartz, feldspar, tourmaline and sulphides that include arsenopyrite, minor chalcopyrite  and  pyrite-pyrrhotite.  Gold  mineralization  is  largely  confined  to  the  minute  veinlets whereas the intervening intrusive rocks are largely unaltered and unmineralized.

GCL  considers  the  deposit  type  and  model  for  Whistler,  Raintree  West  and  Island  Mountain  to  be appropriate for a porphyry gold-copper deposit.

## 9.0 Exploration

A summary of all exploration work conducted by various operators from 1986 to present is summarized in Table 9-1.  Cominco Alaska Inc. is attributed with the discovery of the Whistler Deposit in 1986.  The only exploration activity documented by Cominco for which Kiska has records are 8.4 line-kilometres of 2D  Induced  Polarization  geophysics  over  the  Whistler  Deposit  and  sixteen  diamond  drillholes  (1,677 metres) in the Whistler Deposit.

## 9.1 Geological Mapping

The  bulk  of  the  detailed  geological  mapping  and  interpretation  on  the  property  was  undertaken  by Kennecott and summarized in a report by Young (2006).  This work laid the foundation for the geological interpretation of porphyry-style mineralization in the Whistler area (including the Whistler Deposit and the  Raintree  -  Rainmaker  prospects),  the  Breccia  Zone  at  Island  Mountain,  and  Intrusion-Related  Au mineralization in the Muddy Creek area.

## 9.2 Airborne Geophysics

An airborne helicopter geophysical survey was commissioned from Fugro Airborne Surveys ('Fugro') by Kennecott  during  2003.    This  survey  covered  the  entire  property  with  a  high  sensitivity  cesium magnetometer and a 256-channel spectrometer.

Technical Report - NI 43-101 Resource Estimate for the Whistler Project, Alaska

Additional airborne magnetic data were acquired by Kennecott in 2004 over two smaller areas using a helicopter equipped by a Rio Tinto bird operated by Fugro and a Kennecott geophysicist.  One area over the Snow Ridge target was investigated at 200 metres line spacing (79 line kilometres).  The other grid was  flown  over  the  Whistler  Deposit  and  surrounding  area  using  fifty-metre  line  spacing  (1,365  line kilometres).

Results  from  these  airborne  surveys  were  used  by  Kennecott  to  interpret  geological  contacts,  fault structures  and  potential  mineralization in  the  Whistler,  Island  Mountain  and  Muddy  Creek  areas.    In particular, the airborne magnetic data showed that the Whistler Deposit displays a strong 900 m by 700 m positive magnetic anomaly attributed to the magnetic Whistler Diorite intrusive complex (host to the Whistler  Deposit)  in  addition  to  a  contribution  from  secondary  magnetite  alteration  and  veining associated with Au-Cu mineralization.  This observation formed that basis for exploration targeting in the Whistler area, particularly those areas covered by a thin veneer of glacial sediments, such as the Raintree  and  Rainmaker  prospects.    These  surveys,  in  addition  to  2D  Induced  Polarization  ground geophysical  surveys  targeted  over  airborne  magnetic  anomalies,  were  instrumental  in  the  'blind' discovery of the Rainmaker and Raintree prospects by Kennecott in 2005 and 2006, respectively.

Kiska commissioned a helicopter-borne AeroTEM survey over the Island Mountain area by Aeroquest Airborne in June 2011. The principal geophysical sensor was an AeroTEM III time domain electromagnetic  system,  employed in  conjunction  with  a  caesium  vapour magnetometer.   Navigation was  provided  by  a  real-time  differential  GPS  navigation  system,  plus  a  radar  altimeter  and  a  video recorder mounted in the nose of the helicopter.

The survey was flown on east-west flight lines with a spacing of 100 metres.  Control lines were flown north-south,  perpendicular  to  the  survey  lines,  with  a  spacing  of  1000  metres.    The  nominal  terrain clearance  of  the  EM  bird  was  30  metres.    The  magnetometer  sensor  was  mounted  in  a  smaller  bird connected to the tow rope 33 metres above the EM bird and 20 metres below the helicopter.  Nominal survey speed was 75km/hr., resulting in a geophysical reading about every 1.5 to 2.5 metres along the flight path. The  total  survey  coverage,  including  tie  lines,  was  635km.  Mira  Geoscience  was subsequently  engaged  to  produce  a  3D  inversion  of  the  data.    The  survey  was  designed  to  target potential  zones  of  disseminated  and  net-textured  pyrrhotite  mineralization  similar  to  the  pyrrhotiteassociated gold-only zone of mineralization on the flanks of the Breccia Zone.  The survey did detect a large 1.5km long by 1.0km wide conductivity low anomaly on the southeast side of the Island Mountain area,  referred  to  as  the  Super  Conductor  target.    This  anomaly  was  subsequently  tested  by  three drillholes that  did  suggest  that  the  conductivity  anomaly  may  be  associated  with  disseminated pyrrhotite mineralization with elevated gold values, yet further drilling is required to be conclusive and fully test the target.

## 9.3 Ground Geophysics

Cominco acquired 8.4 line-km of 2D Induced Polarization geophysics from six east-west oriented lines centred over the Whistler Deposit discovery outcrops.  Anomalous results from these lines were used to target the deposit area with subsequent drilling. From 2004 to 2006, Kennecott  completed 39.4 linekilometres of 2D IP geophysics in the Whistler area.  Within this survey, two IP lines were run over the Whistler  Deposit  magnetic  anomaly  and  showed  that  mineralization  is  coincident  with  a  strong

chargeability anomaly.  Subsequent lines targeted magnetic anomalies at the Round Mountain, Canyon Creek, Canyon Ridge, Canyon Mouth, Long Lake Hills, Raintree and Rainmaker prospects.  In 2007-2008, Geoinformatics completed 8.8 line km of 2D IP from six separate reconnaissance lines in the Whistler area targeting airborne magnetic highs.  Anomalous results from this survey in the Raintree area led to the Raintree West discovery.

In  2009,  Kiska  undertook a significant 2D and 3D IP survey over most of the prospective areas in the Whistler, Island Mountain and Muddy Creek areas.  Kiska commissioned Aurora Geoscience to complete 224 line-kilometres of a 3D Induced Polarization geophysical survey.  This was executed on two grids (Round Mountain; Whistler Area) which were comprised of grid lines ranging from 4 to 9 km long with a line-spacing of 400 metres.  From November to December, 2009, the raw data was delivered to Mira Geoscience for detail data quality control and error analysis prior to the construction of a 3D inversion model.  This survey reaffirmed that the Whistler Deposit is coincident with a discrete 3D chargeability anomaly and showed that much of the Whistler area contains broad areas of anomalous chargeability (Figure 9-1).  In conjunction with the airborne magnetic data, these zones of anomalous chargeability formed the basis for exploration drilling in the Whistler Area in 2010.

In  2009  Kiska  commissioned  SJ  Geophysics  to  complete  40  line-km  of  a  2D  Induced  Polarization geophysical survey.  Survey lines were generally semi-straight reconnaissance-type lines over areas of interest at Alger Peak, Island Mountain and Muddy Creek.  The geophysical survey was acquired with a pole - dipole 2DIP technique with 100m dipoles.

## 9.4 Soil and Rock Sampling

From 2004 to 2006 Kennecott collected 1,300 rock samples, close to 2,500 soil samples and 103 stream sediments samples in the Whistler, Island Mountain and Muddy Creek areas.  Within this program, a soil grid  over  the  Whistler  Deposit  returned  anomalous Au-Cu  results  coincident  with  the  magnetic  high. Other  reconnaissance  soil  lines  in  the  Whistler  area  with  anomalous  Au-Cu  results  helped  to  define areas of interest at the Round Mountain, Canyon Creek, Canyon Ridge, Canyon Mouth, and Long Lake Hills  prospects.    In  addition,  soil  reconnaissance  lines  at  Island  Mountain  led  to  the  Discovery  of  the Breccia Zone and broad zones of anomalous Au at Muddy Creek.  In 2009 and 2010, Kiska collected 1417 soil  samples and 293 rocks samples, which largely confirmed areas of interest in the Whistler, Island Mountain, and Muddy Creek areas previously defined by Kennecott.

Rock  samples  consist  of  approximately  one  kilogram  of  rock  collected  over  a  small  area  surrounding each sampling site using a rock hammer. The sampling location is located using a hand held GPS unit and marked  in  the  field  with  a  metallic  tag.  Descriptive  information  about  the  geology  of  the  sample  is recorded and aggregated into the project database.

Soil samples are collected from the surface soils (generally the B-horizon) by extracting approximately one kilogram of soil into a plastic bag usually with a hand auger. Each sampling site is located using a GPS  unit.  Descriptive  information  such  sampling  depth  and  physical  attributes  are  recorded  and aggregated  into  the  project  database.  Typically  field  duplicates  are  collected  at  a  rate  of  one  every twenty samples.

Soil  samples  were  collected  along  traverses  as  part  of  multi-kilometre  reconnaissance  programs, generally at 100 metre spacing. In two areas (Whistler Deposit and Snow Ridge), samples were collected at a more regular 100 metre grid spacing.

## 9.5 Additional Modelled Potential - Whistler Area

- A  Technical  Report  made  effective  on  15  August,  2015  (MMTS,  2015)  reported  additional  modelled potential  for  the  Whistler  Resource  area.  The  details  of  this  potential  is  repeated  verbatim  from  this report below.

Currently there is additional potential of between 50 Mt to 90 Mt of mineralization grading between 0.47 to 0.59 g/t Au Eq as summarized in Table 9-2  that was interpolated in the Whistler Resource block model  but  remains  outside  of  the  reported  pit  constrained  resource.  This  mineralization  is  largely located below the pit constrained resource and is considered a significant exploration target that could potentially increase the Whistler Resource with additional infill drilling. Existing drilling in this area is wide spaced and infill drilling could identify higher grade mineralization and increase the overall average grade of this material.

- 1.  Gold equivalent grades are in situ using the same prices as for the NSP calculation but reporting at 100% recoveries.

The above-quoted figures are reported as an exploration target, based on reasonable assumptions made from compiled data. These figures should  not  be  construed  to  be  included  in  an  estimated  resource (Inferred, Indicated or Measured) under standards of NI 43-101.  The potential quantities and grades reported above are conceptual in nature and there has been insufficient work to date to include these with the NI 43-101 compliant resource.  Furthermore, it is uncertain if additional exploration will result in this material being added to the existing resource.

## 10.0 Drilling

A total of 70,198 metres of diamond drilling in 250 holes has been completed on the Whistler Project by Cominco, Kennecott, Geoinformatics, and Kiska from 1986 to the end of 2011 (Table 10-1).  Of these drillholes 19,870 metres in 48 holes have been drilled in the Whistler Deposit area, 33,532 metres in 157 holes have been drilled on exploration targets beyond the Whistler Deposit in the Whistler area, 15,841 metres in 42 holes have been drilled in the Island Mountain area, and 955 metres in 3 holes have been drilled in the Muddy Creek area.

## 10.1 Drilling by Cominco Alaska Inc.

There  are  partial  records  documenting  sixteen  shallow  core  boreholes  (1,677  metres)  drilled  on  the Whistler  gold-copper  deposit  in  1988  and  1989.    The  records  contain  descriptions  of  the  core,  with drilling logs with assay results.  The position of several holes was re-surveyed by Kennecott using either a hand held GPS or with a Trimble ProXr receiver providing real-time sub-metre accuracy.  Three holes could not be located.  Apparently the core from the Cominco holes was donated to the State of Alaska in 1990 and is probably stored at a core library in Eagle River, Alaska.

## 10.2 Drilling by Kennecott

Between  2004  and  2006,  Kennecott  drilled  a  total  of  thirty-five  core  holes  (12,449  metres)  on  the Whistler Project.  Fifteen of those core holes (7,953 metres) were drilled on the Whistler Deposit.  The Kennecott core is stored in part at the base camp and in part in a secured warehouse in Sterling, Alaska. The drilling was conducted by NANA-Dynatec and subsequently NANAMajor drilling from Salt Lake City, Utah, using up to three drill rigs supported by helicopter.  HQ-diameter core was recovered in 2004 and subsequently NQ in 2005 and 2006.

## Technical Report - NI 43-101 Resource Estimate for the Whistler Project, Alaska

Kennecott personnel used extensive documented procedures during drilling.  The collar position of each borehole was laid out with a hand GPS unit.  Azimuth and inclination determined with a compass.  Each collar was subsequently surveyed using a Trimble ProXr receiver providing real-time sub-metre accuracy. The casing was pulled after drilling.  Downhole deviation was monitored using Flex It Multi-shot readings at  twenty  foot  (six  metre)  intervals.    Magnetic  susceptibility  and  gravity  data  were  also  recorded. Drilling,  logging  and  sampling  were  conducted  under  the  direct  supervision  of  a  suitably  qualified geologist.    Core  retrieved  from  drilling  was  oriented  using  EzMark  or  an  ACE  device.    Core  recovery, geotechnical  point  load  test,  and  rock  quality  determination  were  collected  before  the  geologist recorded  elaborate  information  about  lithology,  mineralogy,  alteration,  vein  density,  and  structure. Magnetic  susceptibility  was  also  measured  on  core  at  regular  intervals.    All  descriptive  data  were recorded digitally and subsequently populated an acQuire database.

A total of twenty boreholes (4,746 metres) were drilled by Kennecott to investigate other exploration targets.    Targets  selected  for  drilling  were  typically  chosen  based  on  a  combination  of  geology, geochemical and geophysical criteria interpreted to be indicative of magmatic hydrothermal processes. The drilling strategy involved testing selected targets with vertical or angled drillholes to validate the geological model.  One or more boreholes were drilled, depending on results, in an attempt to vector towards  the  potassic  core  of  a  magmatic  hydrothermal  system  known  to  be  associated  with  better copper and gold sulphide mineralization in this area.

## 10.3 Drilling by Geoinformatics

From 2007 through 2008, Geoinformatics drilled twelve holes for 5,784 metres on the Whistler Deposit and six holes for 1,841 metres on other exploration targets in the Whistler area.  Geoinformatics used the  same  drilling  contractor  and  drilling  procedures  as  Kennecott  (note  that  oriented-core  was  not obtained by Geoinformatics).

Exploration  drilling  by  Geoinformatics  in  the  Whistler  area  targeted  geophysical  anomalies  in  the Raintree and Rainmaker areas, using the same basic porphyry exploration model as Kennecott.

## 10.4 Drilling by Kiska

During  the  2009-2011  Kiska  drilling  campaigns,  diamond  drilling  was  performed  by  Quest  America Drilling  and  Falcon  Drilling  Ltd.  following  industry-standard  diamond  drilling  procedures.    The  drilling was supervised by geological staff from Kiska.  Drilling was performed by helicopter-portable diamond drill  rigs  using  HQ  (6.35  cm)  and  NQ  (4.76  cm)  diameters  tools.    Drillholes  were  collared  with  HQ diameter tools and reduced to NQ diameter tools when the rig reached the depth capacity of the HQ equipment.    Collar  locations  were  captured  with  hand-held  GPS  devices  by  Kiska  staff.    Downhole surveys for all holes were conducted by the drill contractor every 60 metres down-hole using a Relflex EZ Shot down-hole camera.

All drillholes were logged by Kiska geologists within the core logging facility at the Whistler exploration camp.    Geologists  logged  lithology  type,  alteration  type  and  intensity,  vein  types,  percentage  vein volume and vein orientations (to core axis), structures (to core axis), and the percentage of sulphides and  oxides.    Logging  data  was  entered  on  paper  logging  forms  (2009)  and  directly  onto  laptop computers using LogChief software (2010-2011).  Magnetic susceptibility readings were also recorded

Technical Report - NI 43-101 Resource Estimate for the Whistler Project, Alaska for every metre of core using a hand-held device.  Detailed geotechnical logging was also performed and includes core recovery and rock quality designation ("RQD").

During the 2009-2011 Kiska drilling campaign a total of 181 diamond drillholes were completed for a total of 48,447 metres.  Table 10-1 shows the distribution of these drillholes relative to prospect areas on the Whistler Project.  Appendix B lists the location, azimuth, dip and TD for all holes on the Whistler Project.    There  are  no  drilling,  sampling  or  recovery  factors  that  materially  impact  the  accuracy  or reliability of the drill results described below.

## 10.5 Whistler Deposit

A total of five holes for 4,456 metres were drilled on the Whistler Deposit by Kiska in 2010.  These holes were targeted to in-fill gaps from the previous drill campaigns and to test the edges and depth of the intrusive complex that hosts the deposit.  Results from these holes are included in the updated resource estimate.

## 10.6 Raintree West Deposit

The Raintree West prospect is located 1800 metres to the east of the Whistler Deposit, just off the nose of  Whistler  Ridge.  Outside  of  the  Whistler  Deposit,  Raintree  West  is  currently  the  most  advanced prospect in the Whistler Area on the basis of drill metres, with a total of 8,538 metres since the original discovery  hole  drilled  by  Geoinformatics  in  2008.    The  discovery  drillhole,  RN-08-06,  targeted  an airborne magnetic high anomaly that is coincident with an IP chargeability high anomaly detected on a 2D IP reconnaissance line that crossed the Whistler Area.  This hole discovered a significant zone of near surface (below 5 m to 15 m of till cover) gold-copper porphyry mineralization (160 metres grading 0.59 gpt gold, 6.02 gpt silver, 0.10% copper).  Kiska expanded on this discovery in 2009 with a scissor hole drilled on the same section as RN-08-06 (WH09-02).  This scissor hole was successful at duplicating the gold-copper  mineralization  zone  in  RN-08-06,  and  discovered  a  second,  deeper  zone  of  porphyry mineralization on the west side of the Alger Peak fault zone.  In 2010, Kiska followed up on the shallow zone with an additional four drillholes, and in 2011 further tested the shallow zone and the deep zone with a total of eight holes for a total of 5,997 metres.  The majority of drillholes at Raintree West were drilled on east-west sections with section spacing of 100 m.  Results from these holes are included in the new resource estimate.

## 10.7 Whistler Area Exploration Drilling

A total of 133 exploration holes for 27,464 metres of drilling in the Whistler area were completed by Kiska in 2009-2011.  A majority of these holes were drilled in the "Whistler Area", an area that includes much of the broad valley  floor  to  the  north,  east  and  south  of  the  Whistler  Ridge,  that  includes  the Raintree and Rainmaker prospect areas (Figure 10-1).  Targeting for this drilling program was developed by a technical team comprised of Kiska and Kennecott geologists in 2009-2010 and Kiska geologists in 2011  based  on  blind  geophysical  targets  heavily  weighted  by  the  results  of  the  2009  3D  IP  survey (chargeability and resistivity anomalies), airborne magnetic anomalies, anomaly size, and proximity to areas  of  known  mineralization  or  anomalous  surface  geochemistry.    A  majority  of  these  holes  were drilled  in  the  Whistler Area  and  intersected  andesitic  volcanic  rocks with  moderate to strong sericite-

clay-pyrite alteration and occasional sphalerite- and galena-bearing quartz-carbonate veins with banded and colliform epithermal-like textures.  The alteration and veining from these wide-spaced drillholes (on average  &gt;500  metres  apart)  indicate  that  broad  areas  in  the  Whistler  Area  define  the  upper,  cooler margins of a large porphyry-related hydrothermal system or a cluster of smaller, coalescing porphyryrelated hydrothermal systems.  Within this broad area, drilling returned Whistler-like, porphyry-style AuCu mineralization with significant intercepts at the Raintree West, Raintree North, and the Rainmaker prospects, and anomalous alteration and geochemistry at the Dagwood prospect.

## 10.8 Island Mountain Exploration Drilling

The majority of the drilling completed by Kiska at the Island Mountain prospect between 2009 and 2011 targeted the Breccia Zone (35 out of 42 holes) and the remainder targeted zones of either anomalous surface  rock  geochemistry  and  alteration  (Cirque  Zone)  or  geophysical  anomalies  (Super  Conductor). Significant results were only returned from the Breccia Zone and are summarized below.  The alteration patterns and geochemical pathfinder elements from the other areas are currently being reviewed and may be used to target addition drilling in the future.

## 10.9 Island Mountain Deposit (Breccia Zone) Drilling

At the Island Mountain Deposit, drilling included in the resource estimate is comprised of 34 drill holes for  12,688  metres  of  drilling.  The  majority  of  these  holes  were  completed  on  seven  east-west  crosssections spaced 50 metres apart in a 300 square metre area from 6847600N to 6847900N (Figure 10-3). Interpretation  of  the  lithologies,  alteration  and  mineralization  of  the  breccia-related  mineralization indicates  that  the  magmatic-hydrothermal  breccia  complex  defines  an  irregular  pipe-shaped  body approximately  300  m  by  300  m  in  plan  and  extending  from  the  surface  down  500  metres,  where mineralization  is  open  to  depth.    This  breccia  complex  is  sub-vertical  and  appears  to  trend  in  a northwest-southeast orientation, similar to the strike of the faults in the area.  Results from these holes are included in the new resource estimate.

True widths of mineralization from these holes is currently poorly constrained due to limited geological information.

These zones of mineralization are generally associated with disseminated to breccia-fill pyrrhotite-pyrite ±chalcopyrite±arsenopyrite mineralization within albite-actinolite and/or chlorite altered hydrothermal and  intrusive  breccias  that  occur  along  or  near  steeply-dipping  panels  of  hornfels  hosted  by  diorite porphyry  (see  example  in  Figure  10-4).  They  are  interpreted  to  indicate  good  potential  for  further mineralization along strike and to depth.

Further exploration drilling should continue to test the breccia complex, aiming to expand the Breccia Zone by stepping immediately north of the resource area drilling.  This drilling should aim to link the mineralized zones summarized above with the main breccia complex.

## 10.10Muddy Creek Drilling

Three holes for a total of 955 metres were drilled at the Muddy Creek prospect in 2011 (Figure 10-5). The first two holes were designed to test targets highlighted by strong gold anomalies in both soils and rock samples within biotite monzonite.  These holes were successful in intersecting gold mineralization. The final hole drilled to test anomalous rock geochemistry at the Bonanza Zone where twelve selective rock  samples  of  outcrop  and  locally  derived  float  samples  averaged  9.0  gpt  gold  over  a  340  metre distance along slope, but failed to reach target depth due to drilling difficulties.

Holes  MC11-001  and  -002  were  situated  at  the  southwestern  edge  of  a  gold-in-soil  geochemical anomaly  that  returned  1.3  km  line  of  soils  running  &gt;1.4  ppm  Au  at  Arseno  Knob.    The  holes  were designed to drill across a zone of northwest-striking faults thought to control mineralization targeting the down dip portion of a vein zone up to 1.2 m thick quartz-arsenopyrite-chaclopyrite veins at surface and steep northwest striking sheeted vein arrays.  MC11-001 and -002 were collared 360 metres apart and drilled toward each other at -65 and -50 degree dip, respectively.

Technical Report - NI 43-101 Resource Estimate for the Whistler Project, Alaska

The dominate lithology in both MC11-001 and MC11-002 is a fine-medium grained, equigranular biotite monzonite.  The monzonite is generally fine-medium grained and composed of subhedral plagioclase and potassium feldspar, euhedral biotite and anhedral interstitial quartz.  This unit is intersected at or near surface and is host to the mineralized sheet vein sets seen at Muddy Creek.

Host rocks are generally fresh aside from weak patchy chlorite and ankerite, rare potassic alteration as k-feldspar and albite occurring as vein halos.  Thin, mm-wide mineralized veins occur as sheeted arrays with spacing at the metre scale at an average of 35 (MC11-001) and 50 degrees (MC11-002) to core axis and  up  to  5  mm  wide,  suggesting  an  almost  vertical  set  of  veins.  Veins  are  composed  of  quartz  ± carbonate  and  chlorite  sometimes  with  vugs  of  euhedral  quartz  crystals  later  infilled  by  carbonate. Arsenopyrite, chalcopyrite and occasional pyrrhotite occur as patchy vein fill. Arsenopyrite mineralization is stronger in wider veins, while chalcopyrite is dominant in hairline, chlorite-rich veins. Later planar carbonate veins cross-cut these veins and consist of dolomite, some calcite, and occasional ankerite, sometimes with strongly chlorite ± sericite altered, texturally destroyed mm-wide haloes.

The northeast directed hole, MC11-001 returned 38.8 metres averaging 0.51 gpt Au Eq. within a broader interval of 138.8 metres averaging 0.29 gpt Au Eq.  True widths are approximately 40% of the reported intervals  given  the  near-vertical  dip  of  the  veins.    The  southwest  directed  hole,  MC11-002,  returned intervals of 45.0 metres averaging 0.52 gpt Au Eq. and 44.2 metres average 0.51 gpt Au Eq. within a broad 338.1 metre interval averaging 0.30 gpt Au Eq. (true widths are approximately 75% of reported intervals).    Mineralization  remains  open  laterally  and  at  depth  since  both  holes  were  terminated  in mineralization.

MC11-001  and  -002  returned  encouraging  results  as  a  first  attempt  at  testing  the  Muddy  Creek prospect.    2011  drilling  tested  only  a  small  portion  of  the  western  edge  of  this  five  kilometre  wide diorite-monzonite  intrusive  complex  that  is  host  to  a  continuous  zone  of  sheeted  Au-bearing  veins. Results from MC11-001 and MC11-002, although low grade, suggest that mineralized veins sampled at surface have significant vertical continuity, and that there remains potential for higher grades at depth and laterally.  There remain numerous surface geochemical and geophysical targets at Muddy Creek that have excellent potential to host significant Au mineralization and none have yet to be drill tested.

## 11.0 Sample Preparation, Analyses, and Security

Sample preparation, analyses, and security protocols for exploration programs on the Whistler project, including drilling at the Whistler, Raintree West and Island Mountain Deposits, were initially developed by Kennecott and subsequently adopted by Geoinformatics and Kiska.  The following section is adapted from SRK 2008, "Mineral Resource Estimation Whistler Copper-Gold Project, Alaska Range, Alaska".

The core for the Cominco drilling was not available for data verification.  However, it represents 8% of the total drilling at the Whistler Deposit primarily within 100m of surface and comparisons of assayed grades with subsequent drilling did not indicate any material bias.

The sample preparation and analytical procedures used by Cominco Alaska Inc. are not known.  Core samples  were  assayed  for  gold,  silver  and  copper  and  occasionally  for  a  suite  of  eight  other  metals (arsenic,  cobalt,  iron,  manganese,  molybdenum,  nickel,  strontium  and  zinc)  at  an  undetermined laboratory.  It is not known if quality control samples were inserted into the sampling stream.

Kennecott  sampling  was  conducted  using  documented  procedures  describing  all  aspects  of  the  field sampling and sample description process, handling of samples, and preparation for dispatch to the assay laboratory.

Kennecott used a documented chain of custody procedure to monitor and track all sample shipments departing the base camp until the final delivery of the pulp to the assaying laboratory.  The procedures include the use of security seals on containers used to ship samples, detailed work and shipping orders. Each transfer point is recorded on the chain of custody form until the final delivery of the pulp to the assay laboratory.

All  soil,  rock  chips,  core,  and  stream  sediments  samples  were  organized into batches of samples of a same  type  and  prepared  for  submission  to  Alaska  Assay  Laboratories  Inc.  in  Fairbanks,  Alaska  for preparation using standard preparation procedures (preparation and assay procedures for core samples is  described below).  This laboratory is part of the Alfred H. Knight group an established international independent weighing, sampling and analysis service company.

Kennecott used two primary laboratories for assaying samples prepared by Alaska Assay Laboratories Inc.    The  samples  collected  during  2004  were assayed by Alaska Assay Laboratories Inc. in Fairbanks, Alaska.  All pulverized samples collected in 2005 and 2006 were submitted to ALS-Chemex Laboratory in Vancouver, British Columbia for assaying.  The ALS Chemex Vancouver laboratory is accredited to ISO 17025 by the Standards Council of Canada for a number of specific test procedures, including fire assay for gold with atomic absorption and gravimetric finish, multi-element inductively coupled plasma optical emission  spectroscopy  and  atomic  absorption  assays  for  silver,  copper,  lead  and  zinc.    ALS-Chemex laboratories also participate in a number of international proficiency tests, such as those managed by CANMET and Geostats.

Kennecott  used  two  secondary  laboratories  for  check  assaying.    ALS-Chemex  re-assayed  191  pulp samples  from  the  2004  sampling  programs.    Acme  Analytical  Laboratories  Ltd.  of  Vancouver,  British

Columbia  ("Acme")  was  used  as  a  secondary  laboratory  in  2005  and  2006.    Acme  is  an  ISO  17025 accredited laboratory.

Core samples were prepared for assaying using industry standard procedures.  Five hundred grams of coarsely  crushed  core  samples  were  pulverized  to  ninety  percent  passing  a  -200  mesh  screen.    Twohundred and fifty grams of rock samples were pulverized to eighty-five percent passing a -150 mesh screen.  Pulverized core and rock samples collected in 2004 were assayed by Alaska Assay Laboratories in Fairbanks for gold using a fire assay procedure and atomic absorption finish (method code FA30) on thirty grams charges and for a suite of nine metals using an aqua regia digestion and inductively coupled plasma scan (method code ICP-2A).  Core and rock samples collected after 2004 were assayed by ALSChemex for gold by fire assay and atomic absorption finish (Au-AA23) on thirty gram sub-samples and for  a  suite  of  thirty-four  elements  (including  copper  and  silver)  by  aqua  regia  digestion  and  ICP-AES (method code ME-ICP41) on 0.5 gram sub-samples.  Elements exceeding concentration limits of ICP-AES were re-assayed by single element aqua regia digestion and atomic absorption spectrometry (method code element-AA46).

For  the  drilling  samples,  Kennecott  used  comprehensive  quality  control  samples  with  all  samples submitted  for  assaying.    Each  batch  of  twenty  core  samples  submitted  for  assaying  contained  one sample blank, one of three project specific standards, a field duplicate and a coarse crushed duplicate. They were inserted blind to the assay laboratory except for the coarsely crushed sample duplicates that were inserted by the preparation laboratory.

All samples collected by Geoinformatics were submitted to Alaska Assay Laboratories for preparation. Pulps were submitted to ALS-Chemex by the preparation laboratory for assaying.  Geoinformatics used the sample preparation and assaying protocols and quality control measures developed by Kennecott. Gold was assayed by fire assay and atomic absorption finish (AuAA23) on thirty gram sub-samples and for  a  suite  of  thirty-four  elements  (including  copper  and  silver)  by  aqua  regia  digestion  and  ICP-AES (method code ME-ICP41) on 0.5 gram sub-samples.  Elements exceeding concentration limits of ICP-AES were re-assayed by single element aqua regia digestion and atomic absorption spectrometry (method code element-AA46).

In 2009, Kiska employed Alaska Assay in Fairbanks for drill core assay, but switched to ALS Chemex for the 2010 and 2011 drilling. The drill core preparation methods and analytical methods for all three seasons are listed below.

## 2009 Drilling (Alaska Assay):

- · Prep: dried, crushed to 70% -10 mesh, 250 gram split pulverized to 90% -150 mesh, and blended for assay.

Quality  control  measures  are  typically  set  in  place  to  ensure  the  reliability  and  trustworthiness  of exploration data.  This includes written field procedures and independent verifications of aspects such as  drilling,  surveying,  sampling  and  assaying,  data  management  and  database  integrity.    Appropriate documentation of quality control measures and regular analysis of quality control data are important as a safeguard for project data and form the basis for the quality assurance program implemented during exploration.

Analytical control measures  typically  involve internal and  external  laboratory  control measures implemented to monitor the precision and accuracy of the sampling, preparation and assaying.  They are also important to prevent sample mix-up and monitor the voluntary or inadvertent contamination of samples.    Assaying  protocols  typically  involve  regular  duplicate  and  replicate  assays  and  insertion  of quality  control  samples  to  monitor  the  reliability  of  assaying  results  throughout  the  sampling  and assaying  process.    Check  assaying  is  typically  performed  as  an  additional  reliability  test  of  assaying results.    This  typically  involves  re-assaying  a  set  number  of  sample  rejects  and  pulps  at  a  secondary umpire laboratory.

The  exploration  work  conducted  by  Kennecott  was  carried  out  using  a  quality  assurance  and  quality control  program  exceeding  industry  best  practices  as  documented  in  a  data  management  manual describing all aspects of the exploration data acquisition and management including mapping, surveying, drilling, sampling, sample security, assaying and database management.

For  drilling, Kennecott  implemented  comprehensive  external  analytical  quality  control  measures. Control  samples  were  inserted  in  all  batches  of  twenty  core  samples  submitted  for  preparation  and assaying at a rate of one blank, one project specific standard, one field duplicate, one coarsely crushed duplicate and one pulp replicate.  The pulp duplicates were organized in batches of twenty-five to fifty samples and submitted by Alaska Assay Laboratories to the Acme Assay Laboratories for check assaying and screen tests.  Kennecott also relied on the internal control measures implemented by the primary laboratory.

Two sample blanks were used by Kennecott.  A barren andesite rock (OPPBLK-1) collected on outcrop (522,399  metres  east  and  6874,144  metres  north;  Nad27,  zone  5)  and  a  barren  porphyritic  andesite (WP-BLK-1) intersected in borehole 04-DD-WP-01.  A blank sample (1-3 kilograms in weight) was usually inserted after a "mineralized" core sample at a rate of one in twenty samples.

For the Whistler Project, Kennecott fabricated three project specific standards (WPCO1, WP-MG1 and WP-HG1;  Table  11-1)  from  coarse  rejects  from  two  boreholes  drilled  at  Whistler  (WP04-04-17  and WH04-01-17).  Coarse rejects from core samples were aggregated to create three composite samples yielding low, medium and high copper and gold values.  Each composite sample was prepared by Alaska

Assay Laboratory to yield homogenized pulverized samples.  Five separate sub-samples of each standard were then submitted to five commercial laboratories for assaying.  Each standard sample was assayed twice  at  each  laboratory  yielding  fifty  assay  results  that  were  analyzed  to  determine  the  tolerance intervals reported in the table below for each standard.

In  the  opinion  of  GCL,  the  quality  control  procedures  used  at  Raintree  West  and  Island  Mountain generally  meet  or  exceed  industry  best  practices  for  a  drilling  stage  exploration  property  and  are adequate for a resource estimation.

## 12.2 Data Verification - Whistler Deposit

Data  verification  for  the  Whistler  Deposit  was  conducted  by  MMTS  (MMTS,  2015)  and  is  repeated verbatim  below.  In  the  opinion  of  GCL,  the  quality  control  procedures  used  at  the  Whistler  Deposit generally meet or exceed industry best practices and are adequate for a resource estimation.

MMTS has completed numerous verification steps, including:

- · Site visit on the 13 and 14 of September 2010, where the following jobs were observed, drilling, core logging, sampling, and database management.  Old drillhole collars were located by GPS, and drill core was examined.
- · Comparing original assay results against the database, a total of 1,258 entries for Au, Cu, and Ag.
- · Completing checks on the QA/QC program.

Kiska implemented a QA/QC program which included blanks, duplicates, field duplicates, and standards. The core for the Cominco drilling was not available for data verification.  However, it represents 8% of the total drilling primarily within 100m of surface and comparisons of assayed grades with subsequent drilling did not indicate any material bias.

Table 12-4 shows the number and type of QA/QC samples from the 2010 drilling program.

Table 12-4 2010 QA/QC Sampling Program

| Sample Type   |   No. Samples |   Percent of Totals |
|---------------|---------------|---------------------|
| Original      |          1171 |                79.7 |
| Standards     |            74 |                 5.1 |
| Blanks        |            77 |                 5.2 |
| Duplicates    |            75 |                 5.1 |
| Field Dups    |            72 |                 4.9 |
| Total         |          1469 |               100   |

Results  from  the  blank  sampling  program  are  shown  in  Figure  12-29  to  Figure  12-37.    For  gold,  the results  generally  show  very  low  gold  content,  with  highs  of  16ppb  in  2007,  400  ppb  in  2008  (one sample), and 325 ppb in 2010 (two samples).  For silver, there is a high of 1ppm in 2007, 5.5 ppm in 2008, and 1.8 ppm in 2010.  For copper, high values include 160 ppm in 2007, 1,800 ppm in 2008, and 3,250 ppm in 2010.

## 13.0 Mineral Processing and Metallurgical Testing

Metallurgical  testing  for  the  Whistler  and  Island  Mountain  Deposits  has  previously  been  reported  by MMTS (2015) and is repeated verbatim below. No metallurgical testing has been carried out on rocks from  the  Raintree  West  deposit,  however  given  the  similarities  in  geological  setting,  host  rock, mineralization  and alteration  between  Raintree  West  and  the  Whistler  Deposit,  it  has  been  assumed that metallurgical processes and metal recoveries determined for the Whistler Deposit are a reasonable approximation for the Raintree West Deposit at this time.

Metallurgical testing has been carried out in three phases starting with the 2004/05 preliminary testing in Salt Lake City under the general supervision of Kennecott and culminating in the two phases under Kiska Metals and conducted at G&amp;T Laboratories in Kamloops during 2010-2012.  These three phases are described separately below.

## 13.1 Summary of Preliminary Metallurgical Testing, Whistler Deposit (Phase One)

Preliminary metallurgical test-work was carried out at Dawson Metallurgical Laboratories Inc. (DML) in Salt Lake City, Utah from September 2004 until early 2005 with a final report being issued in March of 2005 by George Nadasdy.  Portions of that report are excerpted here to define the materials tested and the general approach to the testing.  The work was carried out under the direction of Rio Tinto Technical Services representing Kennecott.

Three different sample composites were tested.  The samples were differentiated by sample history and particle size and also by lead/zinc content.  The three designations were Original Composite, New Core Sample and Low Lead-Zinc Composite .

## 13.1.1 Sample Preparation

A total of approximately 180, coarse assay reject interval samples were received at DML on September 13, 2004 from Kennecott Exploration.  All of the individual samples from the entire drillhole WH-04-0521 (from 2.32 to 328.56 metres) were received.  Kennecott selected a mineralized interval (from 117.6 to 200.2 metres) from this drillhole for testing.

The original composite was produced by including every other individual assay reject sample from the 117.6 to 200.2 metre mineralized interval.  The original composite represented a total of 42.2 metres of material and weighed 88.7 kg.  The composite was air dried and stage crushed to minus 10 mesh in preparation for testing.  The minus 10 mesh composite was mixed in a "V" cone blender and split into batches.  A 50 kg test sample was rotary table split into 2.0 kg test charges.  A 37.6 kg reserve sample was also made.  All samples were kept in the DML freezers to reduce sample oxidation.

Initial  testwork  on  the  original  composite  produced  low  rougher  concentrate  copper  grades  due  to sulfide activation (pyrite, galena and sphalerite floating along with the chalcopyrite).  On November 10, 2004,  a  second  Whistler  mineralized  sample  was  received  for  testing.    This  second  sample  was  the remaining ½ of Kennecott's cut core from the same drillhole (WH-04-05-21) and represented material from  140.6  to  155.3  metres.    Some  of  the  higher  grade  lead-zinc  core  was  removed  by  Kennecott

Technical Report - NI 43-101 Resource Estimate for the Whistler Project, Alaska geologists and not included in this second sample.  This core sample was designated by as the "new core sample".  The new core sample weighed 20 kg; it was stage crushed to minus 10 mesh mixed in a 'V' cone blender and then rotary table split into 2 kg test charges.

A  third  Whistler  mineralized  sample  was  prepared  at  DML  at  the  end  of  November  for  continued testwork and was designated by as the low lead-zinc composite.  The low lead-zinc composite was made from  the  remaining  individual  coarse  assay  reject  samples  not  used  in  the  original  composite  (from 117.6  to  200.2  metres).    At  the  direction  of  Kennecott,  selected  high  grade  lead-zinc  samples  were omitted from this low lead-zinc composite.  The low lead-zinc composite weighed 71 kilograms and was prepared in a similar fashion to the original composite.

## 13.2 Testing

Three (3) separate mineralized samples from the gold-copper bearing Whistler Project in Alaska were tested from September 2004 through March 2005.  Preliminary metallurgical testwork included gravity concentration  or  flotation  to  recover  the  copper  and  gold.    The  three  (3)  mineralized  samples  were designated  as:  the  original  composite,  the  new  core  sample  and  the  low  lead-zinc  composite,  as previously described.

Testwork conducted on the three (3) Whistler mineralized samples included the following:

- 1. Original  Composite :  DML  comparative  (ball  mill)  grind  work  index  test;  a  gravity  centrifugal concentration and amalgamation test; a head assay screen at a (RM) P80=140 µm grind; rougher kinetic-reagent scoping tests; rougher kinetic-pH tests (pH 9.3, 10.0 and 10.8); three (3) stage cleaning tests at different primary and regrind sizes and cleaner tests at pH 9.3 or 11.0.
- 2. New Core Sample : a gravity concentration and amalgamation test; a rougher kinetic grind series P80=162, 111,  80  and  66  microns  and  a  three  (3)  stage  cleaner  test  at  a  P80=80µm  primary grind, a P80=48  regrind size and a cleaner pH of 9.3.
- 3. Low Lead-Zinc Composite : a rougher kinetic test at a P80=80 µm grind; three (3) stage cleaning tests at a P80=80 µm primary grind and P80=37 µm regrind and a cleaner pH of 9.3 or 11.0.  A cleaner test was also conducted with SO2 added to the first cleaner.  A final cleaner test was conducted to generate a third cleaner concentrate for a suite of assays for smelter evaluation.

## 13.2.1 Results from Preliminary Testing

The initial work on the Original Sample resulted in lower than expected rougher and cleaner grades and high levels of lead and zinc reporting to the cleaner concentrate.  This was attributed to both the high lead  and  zinc  in  the  feed  and  the  fact  that  the  composite  was  created  from  assay  rejects  that  had potentially aged at a relatively fine crush between core preparation and metallurgical testing.

The high lead and zinc values in the Original Sample were essentially concentrated in two of the twentyfive intervals used to make up the composite.  For the two subsequent composites the high lead-zinc intervals were left out of the mix.  In addition, the second sample to be tested (New Core Sample) was produced from ½ section core that provided less opportunity for the deleterious effects of ageing when stored under ambient  atmospheric conditions at finer sizes.

In general, it was found in the early work that gravity recovered gold was in the finer size ranges with an average gold grain size of minus 400 mesh (37 microns) so this avenue was not pursued in later testwork on the assumption that liberated gold would be recovered through flotation.

In  addition,  it  was  also found  that  a  primary  grind  of  ~80%  passing  80  microns  was  required  for  best recovery of both copper and gold.

Below  is  the  excerpted  table  from  the  Dawson  report  indicating  cleaning  test  results  for  the  three composites.  The 3 rd Cleaner copper grade increased from 16% to 21% to 23% for the Original, Low PbZn and New Core samples respectively.  Copper recoveries were 80% to 84% with gold ranging from 60% to 65%.

The  poor  performance  on  the  original  composite  material  was  attributed  to  the  high  lead  and  zinc content  and  the  effects  of  sample  size  and  ageing.    The  New  Core  material  responded  best  and  the results with the Low Pb-Zn were close but not up to the level of the New Core material.  Thus there was a significant improvement with the exclusion of the high Pb-Zn intervals and a further improvement with the  "fresh"  half  core.    Crushed  assay  rejects  are  generally  problematic  for  testwork  with  samples containing copper, lead and zinc minerals.

As per the table above, regrind sizes ranged from 34 to 53 microns.  This leaves some potential for finer regrinding  to  improve  cleaner  separations  if  necessary  in  the  future.    In  addition,  there  is  further potential for copper cleaner enhancement with a higher pH regime in that part of the circuit as long as it does not have a significant negative effect on gold recoveries.

The DML report further indicates that in an analysis of cleaner test products the gold values tend to track closely with the deportment of the copper as opposed to following the iron.

## 13.2.2 Preliminary Conclusions

In any future work care must be taken to ensure the material to be tested is as fresh as possible and has been stored in such a manner as to minimize the potential for surface oxidation.  The resource data must be analyzed to assess the presence, level and distribution of lead and zinc throughout the deposit and  appropriate  samples  selected  for  metallurgical  testing  so  that  they  reflect  the  nature  of  the resource and the likely plant feed.  Care must also be taken to ensure that the copper and gold grades of the feed for any further testwork reflect the expected levels in the resource.

For first  pass  metallurgical  testing  reasonable copper and gold recoveries were achieved at less than optimum  concentrate  copper  grades.    Care  and  attention  to  sample  preparation  and  handling  (as mentioned above) along with more in depth testing should allow for improvements in both recoveries and grades.  Further reagent screening should be carried out both to enhance recoveries and selectivity and to attempt to allow for processing at a coarser primary grind.

Combined cleaner and scavenger tails accounted for the loss of 29% to 35% of the contained gold and 10% to 14% of the copper.  These preliminary cleaning tests all involved open circuit cleaning.  In the normal course of more detailed flowsheet development (reagent and regrind optimization plus closure of the cleaning circuit) one could potentially expect to be able to improve copper recoveries to ~85% into  a  concentrate  with  a  copper grade in  the  range  of  25%  to  27%.    A  combination  of  the  flotation improvements and the application of additional gold recovery techniques in the cleaner circuit might potentially improve gold recovery to the 75% range.

In addition, as mentioned above, future test-work should be carried out on material with feed grades reflecting  the  likely  grade  that  would  be  mined  and  sent  to  the  plant.    Lower  feed  grades  tend  to somewhat reduce metal recoveries.

## 13.3 Summary  of  Preliminary  Metallurgical  Testing,  Island  Mountain  Deposit  (August  21, 2010) (Phase 2)

## 13.3.1 Introduction

Two holes (IM09-001 and IM09-002) were drilled at Island Mountain in 2009.  These holes produced interesting gold and copper values and also what appeared to be 'interesting' associations between the contained gold, copper, pyrrhotite and magnetite.  It was decided to carryout preliminary metallurgical testwork  on  the  available  sample  material  in  order  to  assess  the  mineralogical  associations  and  the potential  for  effective  treatment  of  the  rock  to  recover  gold  and  copper.    Core  logging  indicated  an apparent  difference  between  the  upper  and  lower  mineralized  intervals  of  the  drillhole.    The  upper mineralized  interval  had  higher  copper,  but  lower  gold  values,  and  the  lower    mineralized  interval tended to contain more pyrrhotite.  The lower region also represented the greater tonnage potential.

## 13.3.2 Sample Selection

The drill data had been assessed in terms of a gold equivalent whereby copper and silver values were added to the gold value based on assumed recoveries of 75% for Au and Ag and 80% for Cu.  Assumed prices  were  $550,  $8,  $1.50  respectively  for  the  three  metals.    A  simple  gold  equivalent  cut-off  of 0.30gpt ($5.30/tonne at $550/Oz) was taken.  Based on this cut-off, 72 out of 81 two metre intervals

were selected from the upper 162 metres of IM09-001 to form an Upper Composite.  Similarly 75 out of 111 two metre intervals were selected to form a Lower Composite from the lower 222 metres of the hole.  From hole IM09-002, only 20 of 99 two-metre intervals surpassed the selected cut-off.  As higher grade intervals were distributed erratically throughout the length of the hole none of this material was used for the metallurgical work.

Quarter  core  was  available  for  composite  preparation  and  it  was  shipped  to  G&amp;T  Metallurgical  in Kamloops BC for composite assembly and the metallurgical testing.

## 13.3.3 Feed Grade

The following table provides the analyses of the elements of interest in the two composites.

The copper values in the Upper Composite are on the lower side of normal feed grades whereas the copper  values  in  the  Lower  Composite  are  well  below  where  one  would  generally  expect  to  make saleable copper concentrate grades with any significant recovery.  The gold however, particularly in the Lower Composite, contributes a significant value to the feed.

## 13.3.4 Test Program

Various processing options were applied to the sample material in order to assess both the association between  the  gold  and  the  other  minerals  and  to  assess  the  potential  for  economic  recovery  of  the copper and gold.

The preferred and simplest option would be to produce a saleable copper concentrate containing the bulk of the copper and also the bulk of the gold.  Another possible route would be to leach the gold from the  whole  ore  with  cyanide.    The  leaching  approach  could  possibly  produce  good  gold  recovery  but would not recover copper values and would likely involve significant cyanide consumption due to the copper  content  of  the  feed.    Hybrid  approaches  would  involve  the  selective  flotation  of  a  saleable copper concentrate with some of the gold and leaching of some or all of the flotation tailings to recover un-floated gold values.

As well as recovery considerations, a significant concern  in cyanide leaching arises from  the consumption of cyanide by other metals and minerals in the feed material.  Of particular interest are copper and pyrrhotite.  Depending on the form and activity of the copper and iron minerals significant quantities of cyanide can be tied up as copper and iron cyanides.

The  current  test  program  included  bulk  flotation  of  copper  and  gold,  selective  flotation  of  copper, cyanidation of the feed material and cyanidation of the combined tailings from selective open circuit cleaning tests performed on each of the composites.  Due to the expectation that the Lower Composite likely  represented  the  greater  portion  of  'minable'  material  testwork  addressed  this  sample  with confirmatory work then being applied to the Upper Composite.

## 13.3.5 Metallurgical Results

## Bulk Flotation

Various grinds plus some pH modification were applied to the bulk rougher flotation of both composites. In  general  the  best  copper  recoveries  were  achieved  with  flotation  at  a  grind  of  ~80%  passing  100 microns and a pH of 10.  Gold recoveries were not as sensitive to the changes.

Table 13-3 Bulk Flotation Results

| Material                 |   Feed  % Cu |   Copper  Conc  % Cu |   Rec  % |   Feed  gpt |   Gold  Conc  gpt |   Rec  % |
|--------------------------|--------------|----------------------|----------|-------------|-------------------|----------|
| Upper Composite  Rougher |         0.15 |                 0.9  |    79.66 |        0.5  |              2.82 |    74.41 |
| Lower Composite  Rougher |         0.05 |                 0.41 |    89.15 |        0.96 |              7.12 |    80.41 |
| Lower Composite  Rougher |         0.05 |                 0.31 |    87.94 |        0.94 |              5.41 |    81.02 |
| Lower Composite  Cleaner |         0.05 |                 1.4  |    76.02 |        0.94 |             39.4  |    70.73 |

Copper recoveries were reasonable considering the low head grades - particularly in the case of  the Lower Composite.  However, given the value of gold in the feed, gold recoveries were considered to be too low.  In addition, a saleable copper concentrate would require a 15 to 20 fold increase in the copper grade which would further reduce the recovery of both metals.

The low gold recoveries also indicate that there is gold associated with some other mineral that is not floating in the non-selective bulk circuit.

## Selective Flotation

Reagent changes were made to try and float a cleaner copper concentrate using open circuit cleaning.

|------------|--------------|--------------|----------------|-----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Upper      |         0.14 |         22.5 |           63.4 |            77.3 |           0.5  |           51.3 |           42.7 |            61.5 |
| Lower      |         0.05 |         23.3 |           70.6 |            84.1 |           0.99 |          294   |           44   |            45.6 |

The  selective  flotation  produced  similar  but  somewhat  lower  copper  rougher  recoveries  than  those achieved in the bulk flotation circuit.  There is a potential to improve these with further optimization. The copper loss between roughing and cleaning was similar to that experienced in the bulk circuit.  Both

these  aspects  can  be  addressed  by  further  reagent  and  operating  condition  adjustments.    Further testwork with closed circuit cleaning will significantly reduce the cleaning circuit losses.  Gold recovery was  much  lower  during  roughing  and  was  significantly  reduced  during  cleaning  for  the  Upper Composite.  This confirms the earlier suggestion that there is a significant portion of  the gold that is associated with some mineral or minerals other than the copper bearing ones.

## 13.3.6 Whole Ore Leach

The whole ore leach approach worked well - particularly for the Lower Composite.

Table 13-5 Whole Ore Cyanidation

|                 |   Feed  (gpt) |   Residue  (gpt) |   Recovery  (%) |   Cyanide  Strength  (kgpt) |   Cyanide  Consumption  (kgpt) |
|-----------------|---------------|------------------|-----------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Upper Composite |          0.54 |             0.06 |           89.06 |                         2   |                           1.82 |
| Lower Composite |          0.82 |             0.08 |           90.22 |                         0.5 |                           0.46 |

For both composites ~90% of the gold was extracted in 48 hours.  Higher solution strength was required for the Upper Composite and this resulted in significantly higher cyanide consumption.

## 13.3.7 Leaching of Selective Flotation Tails

Based on the results of the whole ore leach and the selective cleaner flotation, the flotation tailings for both composites were leached in cyanide for 48 hours at solution strength of 0.50 kgpt.

Table 13-6 Cyanidation of Selective Flotation Tailings

|                 |   Feed  (gpt) |   Residue  (gpt) |   Recovery  (%) |   Cyanide  Strength  (kgpt) |   Cyanide  Consumption  (kgpt) |   Flotation +  Cyanidation  Recovery  (%) |
|-----------------|---------------|------------------|-----------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Upper Composite |          0.18 |             0.08 |           56.52 |                         0.5 |                           0.4  |                                     75.08 |
| Lower Composite |          0.51 |             0.09 |           81.44 |                         0.5 |                           0.38 |                                     89.6  |

Leaching  results  were  particularly good  for  the  Lower  Composite  at  81%  and  the  overall  recovery  by flotation and cyanidation was almost 90%.  Similar to the results of the whole ore leach, the leaching conditions for the Upper Composite can likely be optimized to improve the extent and rate of leaching for the flotation tailings from the Upper material.

## 13.3.8 Overall Recoveries

Potentially 90% of the gold in the Lower Composite can be recovered either by direct cyanidation or by flotation  followed  by  cyanidation  of  the  flotation  tailings.    Similarly  almost  90%  of  the  gold  can  be leached from the Upper Composite and further work should improve the overall gold recovery from this material by the combined flotation-leach approach.

More in depth work should be performed to improve flotation grades and recoveries.  In addition, once an optimized flotation approach has been established the opportunities to produce a high grade copper concentrate followed by the production of a low grade gold concentrate for subsequent leaching should

<!-- image -->

Technical Report - NI 43-101 Resource Estimate for the Whistler Project, Alaska be investigated.  This could substantially reduce the capital and environmental ramifications of whole ore or full tailings leaching.

## 13.3.9 Conclusions

The  preliminary  testing  Indicated  that  the  Island  Mountain  material  tested  is  amenable  to  copper recovery by flotation and that the gold is relatively free milling.  This is particularly true of the greater portion of the material represented by the Lower Composite.  The results indicate that in the range of 90% of the gold in the Lower Composite can be recovered by either whole ore leaching or a combination of flotation and leaching of the tailings.  With further development work, copper flotation recoveries will likely rise to the 80% range for the Lower Composite.

Similarly,  gold  recovery  in  the  range  of  90%  can  be  achieved  by  whole  ore  leaching  of  the  Upper Composite.    Further  flotation  work  on  the  Upper  Composite  will  improve  both  copper  and  gold recoveries to concentrate.

For both materials it was concluded that further metallurgical development and assessment work would still  be  required  to  develop  the  best  flowsheet  with  respect  to  capital  and  operating  costs,  metal recoveries and overall economics.

## 13.4 Summary of Whistler Deposit Testwork (2012) (Phase 3)

The  final  round  of  work  was  also  carried  out  at  G&amp;T  Metallurgical  Laboratories,  now  part  of  ALS Metallurgy,  there  being  continuity  of  personnel  and  experience  with  the  Island  Mountain  testwork previously reported.

The work commenced in August 2012 and was completed by year end and the results presented in its report KM3499 of January 2013.

## 13.4.1 Metallurgical Samples

Initial work was conducted on core from the 2008 drilling campaign, on sample 08-08 which had been kept in carefully controlled conditions and was believed to be still fresh. Arrangements had been made to obtain a sample from a similar hole planned for the summer 2012 drilling campaign as a 'calibration' check  to  validate  its  freshness,  especially  in  view  of  the  aging  effects  reported  in  the  Kennecott testwork.  Unfortunately  the  cancellation  of  the  2012  campaign  negated  this  process;  however,  as  is evident  from  the  results  presented  below,  there  is no  reason  to  suspect  any  impact  of  oxidation  on flotation response.

What was a greater concern with respect to this sample was that, following the update to the geological model  reported  in AMC's  letter report of November  2012,  it  might  have  been  insufficiently representative of the bulk of the mineralization being predominantly in the central quartz-breccia zone, representing only 20% of the tonnage, although 30% of the metal content.

Accordingly a second sample, 10-19 from the 2010 drilling campaign, more representative of the Main Stage Porphyry, although right on the margin of the proposed ultimate pit, was selected for additional tests and in fact became the basis for setting the predicted metallurgical parameters.

Technical Report - NI 43-101 Resource Estimate for the Whistler Project, Alaska

Both samples had been divided into high grade, medium grade and low grade samples in accordance with gold grades, with most of the work carried on the medium grade samples, being closer to Resource grades.

Sample grades are tabulated in the following table.

## Sample Head Grades

| Sample            |   %Cu |   %Fe |   %S |   Au gpt |   %C |
|-------------------|-------|-------|------|----------|------|
| 08-08 MG (master) |  0.12 |   5.8 |  3.6 |     0.53 | 0.76 |
| 08-08 HG          |  0.5  |   4.9 |  1.8 |     1.78 | 0.67 |
| 08-08 LG          |  0.08 |   4.1 |  2.7 |     0.34 | 1.3  |
| 10-19 MG          |  0.22 |   2.6 |  1.9 |     0.51 | 1.09 |
| 10-19 HG          |  0.17 |   3.3 |  1.1 |     0.96 | 1.42 |
| 10-19 LG          |  0.22 |   3.4 |  1.7 |     0.38 | 1.24 |

No mineralogical work was carried out.  However normative mineralogy calculations show that Sample 08-08 generally has almost twice the pyrite content of Sample 10-19.  Sample 08-08 was similar to Island Mountain in this respect.

The  testwork  program  focused  mainly  on  conventional  copper  flotation;  however  it  soon  became evident that improving gold recovery was key so, similar to the direction taken with Island Mountain, the  program  included  work  on  cyanidation  of  cleaner  tails  and  also  investigation  of  enhancing  gold recovery with pyrite concentrate production.

The flotation and cyanidation testwork flowsheets are shown in Figure 13-1 (abstracted from the ALS KM3499 report).

## 13.4.2 Results

The  results  of  the  metallurgical  testwork  for  a  conventional  comminution/flotation  flowsheet  are summarized below.

Technical Report - NI 43-101 Resource Estimate for the Whistler Project, Alaska

## 13.4.2.1 Comminution

A single standard Bond ball mill work index test was carried out on 10-19MG composite towards the end of the program, and at a closing size of 106µm.

The Bond ball mill work index (BWI) was found to be 19.9 kWh/t (compared to the Island Mountain value assumed for the initial flowsheet design of 18.5 kWh/t).  This result puts Whistler in the very hard range of ball mill hardness.

No SAG mill testing (e.g.) JK Drop weight or SMC tests were included in the program, nor indeed any Bond  rod  mill  work  index  tests.  The  QP  has  used  some  industry  benchmarks  and  approximations  in setting appropriate SAG mill design criteria (see Section 17.2.3) and recommends that these additional comminution tests be a high priority for the next stage of testwork.

## 13.4.2.2 Flotation

Key parameters in the copper flotation tests were:

- · Primary grind target was generally 100 µm (some later tests, following the receipt of the BWI result, were done in the 150-200 µm range).
- · Regrind target was generally 20 µm (test 1 at 76 µm was a procedural error).
- · Cytec  3418A,  a  specialist  copper/precious  metal  flotation  reagent,  was  used  as  the  primary copper sulphide mineral collector.
- · pH in the rougher and cleaner circuits was generally maintained at 10 and 11 respectively, using hydrated lime.

The key results are tabulated and graphed in Figure 13-2 (abstracted from the ALS metallurgy KM3499 report).

In summary the main findings were as follows:

- · Open-circuit  batch  flotation  testing  achieved  fairly  consistently  80-85%  copper  recovery  to  a 25% Cu concentrate grade; however gold recovery was lower (40-50%) due to lower rougher recoveries and also low cleaner recoveries with significant deportment of gold to cleaner tailings streams.
- · From the flotation results, the gold associations were inferred as follows:
- · 60% with chalcopyrite
- · 20% with pyrite (± chalcopyrite)
- · 20% with gangue minerals

## Technical Report - NI 43-101 Resource Estimate for the Whistler Project, Alaska

The  QP  strongly  recommends  that  mineralogical  studies  be  a  high  priority  for  the  next  phase  of testwork.

- · Some attempts were made at recovering gold to a pyrite concentrate for subsequent treatment (a possible alternative to cyanidation of cleaner tails), but overall recovery fell and later work focused  on  the  locked  cycle  tests  as  a  means  of  recovering  gold  reporting  in  recirculating streams that were not accounted for in simple batch tests.
- · Locked cycle tests on both the 08-08 and 10-19 samples proved to be the key to unlocking gold value with substantial improvements to gold recovery from the recycle of intermediate streams (short  of  pilot-plant  testing,  locked  cycle  tests  are  the  best  way  of  replicating  a  full  scale flotation plant).  Averaging the results from both and rounding numbers appropriately yielded the following:
- · 92% copper recovery to a 25% Cu concentrate grade
- · 70% gold recovery
- · On receipt of the higher than expected BWI results with a significant impact on both capex and opex,  some  final  open  circuit  batch  flotation  tests  were  conducted  at  coarser  primary  grinds (154 µm, 173 µm and 204 µm) but retaining the same 20 µm regrind size.  The results were analyzed in grade-recovery terms and are presented in graphical form in Figure 13-3 and Figure 13-4. Copper grade-recovery performance was retained up to 173 µ but showed a significant deterioration at the coarsest grind, whereas gold recovery seemed largely insensitive to primary grind  size.    Although  further  work,  including  definitive  locked  cycle  testing,  is  required  to validate this, the QP believes it is reasonable to assume a primary grind size of 175µm (in round figures) as an option for capex/opex sensitivities.
- · Some very preliminary variability tests (four in total) were carried out on the low grade and high grade samples for each main composite.  The results showed a high degree of variability in the 70-90%  range  for  copper  recovery  and  20-30%  Cu  in  final  concentrates.    Gold  recovery  was generally constant at around 50% although the 08-08 high grade sample did show a significantly higher recovery of 76%.  The QP does not attach much importance to this limited number of results,  their  having  no  spatial  relationship  to  the  deposit,  and  would  recommend that future variability work be based on spatial and mineralogical/textural parameters rather than grade.

## 13.5 Cyanidation

The batch flotation tests had indicated a substantial amount of the gold was reporting to cleaner tails and, pending the results of the locked cycle tests, some cyanidation tests were carried out on combined cleaner  tails  from  tests  6  and  7  on  10-19  samples  where  23%  of  the  gold  was  accounted  for  in  the cleaner tails.

Forty-eight hour gold extractions were 77% to solution, thus overall gold recovery would improve from 57%  to  approximately  74%.    However  although  cyanide  consumption  was  moderate  for  a  sulphidic stream, the absolute gold grades in cyanidation feed were still low and the marginal return versus costs at current gold and cyanide prices exactly that, marginal.  Also the use of cyanide requires a different level of onsite management and therefore is more complicated in terms of its cost benefit.

Given  the  excellent  locked  cycle  test  results  already  reported,  and  with  overall  gold  recoveries  by flotation being only in the region of 70%, it was decided not to pursue further cyanidation testwork.

## 13.6 Concentrate Specifications

The final bulk concentrates from cycles II-V of the locked cycle tests 12 (10-19 MG) and 17 (08-08 MG) were analyzed for potentially deleterious elements and the results are shown in Table 13-8.

Concentrates from both samples are remarkably clean and would indicate that the specifications would fall well within typical smelter limits for penalty elements, with no penalty payable.

Normative mineralogy calculations, assuming a simple chalcopyrite:pyrite sulphide blend, suggest the pyrite  concentrate  from  the  08-08  sample  to  be  almost  twice  that  of  10-19,  i.e.  similar  to  what  was observed in the head samples.

## 13.7 Conclusions

From the metallurgical testwork results and subsequent analysis it appears that the Whistler Deposit is metallurgically very amenable to a conventional flotation route to produce saleable high quality copper concentrates with gold credits, despite the low head grade, and that the levels of recovery and upgrade for  both  copper  and  gold  are  relatively  insensitive  to  feed  grade.  There  are  no  processing  factors  or deleterious elements that could have significant effect of potential economic extraction.

Expected grade-recovery parameters are 92% copper recovery to a 25% Cu concentrate and 70% gold recovery.

Although some late testwork on ore hardness revealed the ore to be harder than expected with a Bond Work Index of 19.9 kWh/t, some batch flotation work also showed that the primary grind size could be increased  from  100  µm  to  175  µm,  subject  to  confirmation  with  further  locked  cycle  tests,  with  net savings in comminution power.

## 14.0 Mineral Resource Estimates

At the request of Garnet Dawson, CEO of Brazil Resources Inc., Giroux Consultants Ltd. was retained to produce  maiden  resource  estimations  on  the  Whistler  Project  for  the  Island  Mountain  and  Raintree West  Deposits  located  approximately  150  km  northwest  of  Anchorage,  Alaska.  While  a  resource estimate has been completed on the Whistler Deposit by Moose Mountain Technical Services (MMTS, 2015), with an effective date of August 15, 2015, there have been no resource estimations done on the Island Mountain or Raintree West Deposits.  The effective date for this estimate is March 24, 2016, the day the data was received.

Gary Giroux is the qualified person responsible for the resource estimates contained herein.  Mr. Giroux is a qualified person by virtue of education, experience and membership in a professional association. He is independent of the company applying all of the tests in Section 1.5 of National Instrument 43-101. Mr. Giroux has visited the Property on April 21, 2016.

The  mineral  resource  estimates  discussed  below  for  Raintree  West  and  Island  Mountain  are  maiden estimates for both deposits. The Whistler Deposit resource estimate is unchanged from that described in MMTS (2015).

## 14.1 Raintree West

## 14.1.1 Geologic Solid

A  rough  greater  than  0.1  g/t  Au  Equivalent  grade  shell  was  used  to  constrain  the  mineralization  at Raintree West.  A total of 14 drill holes (shown in Appendix D) totalling 7,078 m were used to define this solid.

The grade distributions for each variable were examined in both the mineralized solid and within waste to determine if capping was required.  Within the mineralized solid a total of 5 gold assays were capped at 6 g/t Au, 4 silver assays were capped at 110 g/t Ag and 3 copper assays were capped at 0.6 % Cu. Within waste 9 gold assays were capped at 0.21 g/t Au, 2 silver assays were capped at 6.0 g/t Ag and 2 copper  assays  were  capped  at  0.62  %  Cu.    The  results  from  capping  are  shown  below  with  small reductions in mean grade but significant reductions in the coefficient of variation.

## 14.1.3 Composites

Assay lengths ranged from a low of 0.26 m to a high of 4.6 m within the mineralized solid with a mean of 2.52 m.  To help smooth grades and be a multiple of a possible bench height a composite length of 5.0 m was selected.  Composites were formed down drill holes starting and ending at the solid boundaries.  If a composite length at a boundary was less than 2.5 m it was combined with an adjacent sample.  In this manner composites formed a uniform support of 5 ± 2.5 m.

## 14.1.4 Variography

Pairwise  relative  semivariograms  were  produced  for  each  variable  in  the  four  principal  horizontal directions: Az 90, Az 0, Az 45 and Az 135 and the only direction with sufficient data to model was Az 90. Semivariograms were then produced for the vertical plane and a model was obtained.

For  each  variable  isotropy  was  assumed  in  the  horizontal  plane  as  there  was  insufficient  data  in directions  other  than  Az  90  to  disprove  this.    The  semivariogram  parameters  for  each  variable  are tabulated below.  Models for gold are shown in Appendix E.

semivariograms.  Pass 1 required a minimum of 4 composites with a maximum of 3 from any single drill hole to be found within a search ellipsoid with dimensions equal to ¼ of the semivariogram range.  For blocks not estimated in pass 1 a second pass was completed with search ellipsoid dimensions equal to ½ the semivariogram range.  A third pass using the full variogram range and a fourth pass using twice the variogram range completed the interpolation.  In all passes the maximum number of composites used was set to 12.  The search parameters used for gold are tabulated below.

## 14.2 Island Mountain

## 14.2.1 Geologic Model

The Island Mountain prospect covers a 5 by 6 km area that is characterized by a unique topographic dome-like shape that is divided in two halves by a prominent northeast-southwest oriented valley. It is this unique shape, which separates this area from other peaks and ridges in the region and from which it derives its name. The highest peak occurs on the southeast side of Island Mountain at an elevation of 1,620 metres, which is 1,100 metres above the Skwentna River Valley.

The Island Mountain deposit has been subdivided and modelled by Kiska geologists  based on 9 different lithologies.  The lithologies are described below.

- XHO -  Hornfels comprised of hornfelsed  fine-grained  sandstones,  siltstones  and  shales  that are the host rocks to the intrusive complex at Island Mountain.
- IIDIP -  Diorite  Porphyry - a white and green to green-grey unit with crowded, weakly porphyritic texture
- BXIIM -  Intrusion  Breccia  -  Monzonite  -  a  grey-pink  monomict  intrusion  breccia  with  a monzonitic cement.    The  fragments  are  generally  angular  and  made  up  of  lighter  grey  intrusive  rock  (Diorite Porphyry)
- BXM -magmatic-hydrothermal  breccia  with  matrix  varying  between  altered  igneous  cement (generally dioritic), rock flour with hydrothermal cement and local hydrothermal infill.
- BXMA -  magmatic-hydrothermal breccia actinolite-cemented equivalent to the BXM unit where the matrix  is  clearly  comprised  of  variably-mille  rock  flour  cemented  by  actinolite-albite-sulphides  rather than a similar altered igneous cement.

## Technical Report - NI 43-101 Resource Estimate for the Whistler Project, Alaska

- BXIID -  Intrusion  Breccia  -  Diorite  -  This  unit  is  green  -grey  to  dark  green  polymict  or  monomict intrusive-matrix breccia with sub-rounded fragments of hornfels or other intrusives in a diorite matrix of similar composition as IIDIP. Fragments are commonly albitized (ALB) with white-grey rims, sometimes biotite-altered  (BIO)  or  preferentially  mineralized  by  pyrrhotite  and/or  chalcopyrite.  This  unit  is interpreted as a barren intrusion breccia, which either post-dates BXM/BXMA or for spatial reasons was not mineralized. This unit is suspected as post-mineral based on local abrupt termination of grade and inclusion of strongly altered host fragments (albitized).
- APO -Actinolite-Pyrrhotite  Crackle  Breccia  -  This domain  in  the  geological  model  is  almost equivalent to BXMAc in that it is comprised of IIDP with stockwork-like actinolite-pyrrhotite veins (&gt;2%) that form an approximately 100-150 m wide shell that is well developed on the west side of the Breccia Zone, and which grades into BXMAc towards the core of the system. These veins contain actinolite + pyrrhotite ± quartz ± biotite ± magnetite ± chalcopyrite ± pyrite, and commonly have strongly albitealtered selvages. These veins are the outer expression of the BXM-BXMA breccias associated with the main stage of sodic-calcic alteration and are the source of low-grade Au-Cu mineralization peripheral to the core of the Breccia Zone.
- IIDIH -  Hornblende Porphyry - This unit is a fine to medium-grained diorite, green-grey with 12 to 20%  rounded,  tabular  black  4-10  mm  hornblende  megacrysts  and  20  to  30%  1-3  mm  plagioclase subhedral laths in a variably fine-grained groundmass of feldspar and often-chloritized (CHL) amphibole. This unit contains up to 3% fine-grained magnetite disseminated throughout groundmass. Hornblende is often partially altered to biotite (BIO) and feldspars are often albitized.
- IFMIC - Coarse-Grained Monzonite Porphyry - This unit is a coarse-grained monzonite, grey and black with idiomorphic equigranular texture. It consists of 10 to 20% grey-clear Carlsbad-twinned feldspars up to 20mm long which may be microcline, 45 to 50% 3-10 mm zoned white plagioclase laths, 25 to 35% 26 mm white orthoclase and 10 to 15 % mafic minerals consisting mainly of 3 to 6 mm black books of biotite  and  minor hornblende and magnetite. This rock is unaltered but weathers easily due to large grain size, and is mapped only on the southwest side of Island Mountain along the Timber Creek fault. It is not seen in diamond drill core. The coarse-grained monzonite is a late, post mineralization phase and is associated with a strong magnetic high.

The deposit was first modelled on a series of cross-sections, followed by longitudinal sections and plans for both lithology and alteration/mineralization. The results were then digitized and tied together into wire-framed 3D solids using Surpac v6.3.

## 14.2.2 Data Analysis

Assays from drill holes were back tagged by passing the drill holes through these modelled solids. Of the 42 drill holes in the Island Mountain Project area a total of 34 totalling 12,668 m were in the volume modelled.  Appendix C lists all the drill holes with the ones used in the estimate highlighted.  Table 14-7 shows simple statistics for Au, Ag and Cu for each modelled domain.

To  compare  the  grade  distributions  for  each  variable  lognormal  cumulative  probability  plots  were produced for each of gold, silver and copper comparing the various geologic domains.  These are shown as Figure 14-4 to Figure 14-6.

## Technical Report - NI 43-101 Resource Estimate for the Whistler Project, Alaska

For  modelling  and  estimation  the  domains  BXM,  BXMA  and  BXIIM  had  similar  gold  grades  and distributions  and  were  combined  with  soft  boundaries.    The  remaining  5  domains  were  treated separately with hard boundaries.

The grade distributions for Au, Ag and Cu were examined for each domain using lognormal cumulative frequency plots.  Where erratic high values were present cap levels were set and are shown below in Table 14-8.

## 14.2.3 Composites

Assay lengths ranged from a low of 0.37 m to a high of 6.0 m within the mineralized domains as shown in Figure 14-7.  To help smooth grades and be a multiple of a possible bench height a composite length of  5.0  m  was  selected.   Composites were formed down drill holes starting and ending at the domain boundaries.  If a composite length at a domain boundary was less than 2.5 m it was combined with an adjacent sample.  In this manner composites formed a uniform support of 5 ± 2.5 m.

## 14.2.4 Variography

For  each  variable  in  each  domain,  pairwise  relative  semivariograms  were  used,  to  model  grade continuity.  Due to the lack of data in some domains meaningful models could not always be obtained. As a result domains were combined based on the grade distributions for the three variables.  The diorite porphyry  domain  (IIDIP)  was  modelled  independently.    Three  of  the  breccia  units  (BXIIM,  BXM  and BXMA) were combined and modelled together.  The waste unit was modelled separately.  The remaining domains  had  insufficient  data  to  model  so  for  estimation  purposes  domain  XHO  and  IIDIH  used  the diorite porphyry model while domains BXIID and APO used the breccia model.

Semivariograms were first produced in the four horizontal directions corresponding to azimuths 90, 0, 45 and 135 degrees.  From these results the longest continuity for gold in the breccia units was found along azimuth 135.  A similar exercise was completed for variables in domain IIDIP where the direction of longest continuity was along azimuth 25 . o

The modelling exercise was completed for Ag and Cu in same manner as for gold. The semivariogram parameters are tabulated below and the models for gold are shown in Appendix E.

## 14.2.5 Bulk Density

For the Island Mountain deposit a total of 218 samples from 4 diamond drill holes (IM10-004, IM10-009, IM10-13 and IM11-020) were tested for specific gravity using the Archimedes method.  Samples were weighed in air (Wa) and weighed in water (Ww) with the specific gravity being equal to Wa / (Wa-Ww). The results are tabulated below in Table 14-13 sorted by domain.

## Technical Report - NI 43-101 Resource Estimate for the Whistler Project, Alaska

Domain IIDIH and Waste were assigned a specific gravity of 2.76 as no samples from these lithologies were measured.  A weighted average specific gravity was calculated for blocks containing more than one domain.

## 14.2.6 Block Model

A block model with blocks 10 x 10 x 10 m in dimension was superimposed over the geologic domains. For each block the percentage below surface topography and the percentage within each of the geologic solids was recorded.  The model was edited to insure the total percentages in the various geologic solids equalled the percent below surface topography.  The block model origin is shown below.

## 14.2.7 Grade Interpolation

Grades for  gold,  silver  and  copper  were  interpolated  into  blocks  using  Ordinary  Kriging.    The  kriging exercise was completed in a series of 4 passes using search parameters tied to the semivariograms.  Pass 1  required  a  minimum  of  4  composites  with  a  maximum  of  3  from  any  single  drill  hole  to  be  found within  a  search  ellipsoid  with  dimensions  equal  to  ¼  of  the  semivariogram  range.    For  blocks  not estimated  in  pass  1  a  second  pass  was  completed  with  search  ellipsoid  dimensions  equal  to  ½  the semivariogram range.  A third pass using the full variogram range was then completed.  Finally for blocks containing multiple domains that had an estimated grade for one domain but not for the others a fourth pass  was  completed  to  insure  all  domains  were  estimated.    In  all  passes  the  maximum  number  of composites used was set to 12.

For the three breccia units (BXM, BXMA and BXIIM) blocks were estimated for Au, Ag and Cu if they contained  any  percentage  of  these  breccia  units  using  soft  boundaries.    The  estimate  used  the semivariogram models developed for breccias.

For  blocks  containing  any  percentage  of  Actinolite-Pyrrhotite  Crackle  Breccia  (APO)  only  the  APO composites were used. The estimate used the semivariogram models developed for breccias.

For blocks containing any percentage of Intrusion Breccia - Diorite (BXIID) grades were kriged using only IIDIH composites and the semivariogram model for diorite porphyry.

For  blocks  containing  any  percentage  of  Hornblende  Porphyry  (IIDIH)  grades  were  kriged  using  only BXIID composites and the semivariogram model for diorite porphyry.

Blocks containing some percentage of Hornfels (XHO) were estimated using only XHO composites and the semivariogram model for diorite porphyry.

Blocks  containing  some  percentage  of  Diorite  Porphyry  (IIDIP)  were  estimated  using  only  IIDIP composites and the semivariogram model for diorite porphyry.

Finally any estimated blocks along the edges of the deposit that contained some percentage of external waste were estimated using waste composites from outside all the modelled solids and the isotropic semivariogram models for waste.

For blocks containing more than one domain a weighted average grade was calculated for each variable based on the percentages of each domain present in the block.

The kriging parameters used in each pass are shown for gold in Table 14-14.

## 14.3 Classification: Raintree West and Island Mountain

Based  on  the  study  herein  reported,  delineated  mineralisation,  at  the  Island  Mountain  and  Raintree West Deposits, is classified as a resource according to the following definitions from National Instrument 43-101 and from CIM (2014):

'In  this  Instrument,  the  terms  "Mineral  Resource",  "Inferred  Mineral  Resource",  "Indicated  Mineral Resource"  and  "Measured  Mineral  Resource"  have  the  meanings  ascribed  to  those  terms  by  the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum, as the CIM Definition Standards (May 2014) on Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves adopted by CIM Council, as those definitions may be amended.'

The terms Measured, Indicated and Inferred are defined by CIM (2014) as follows:

'A Mineral Resource is a concentration or occurrence of solid material of economic interest in or on the Earth's crust in such form, grade or quality and quantity that there are reasonable prospects for eventual economic  extraction. The location, quantity, grade or quality, continuity and other geological characteristics  of  a  Mineral  Resource  are  known,  estimated  or  interpreted  from  specific  geological evidence and knowledge, including sampling.'

'The  term  Mineral  Resource  covers  mineralisation  and  natural  material  of intrinsic  economic  interest which has been identified and estimated through exploration and sampling and within which Mineral Reserves may subsequently be defined by the consideration and application of Modifying Factors.  The phrase 'reasonable prospects for economic extraction' implies a judgement by the Qualified Person in respect of the technical and economic factors likely to influence the prospect of economic extraction.  The Qualified  Person  should  consider  and  clearly  state  the  basis  for  determining  that  the  material  has reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction. Assumptions should include estimates of cut-off grade  and  geological  continuity  at  the  selected  cut-off,  metallurgical  recovery,  smelter  payments, commodity price or product value, mining and processing method and mining, processing and general and administrative  costs.  The  Qualified  Person  should  state  if  the  assessment  is  based  on  any  direct evidence and testing.  Interpretation of the word 'eventual' in this context may vary depending on the commodity  or  mineral  involved.  For  example,  for  some  coal,  iron,  potash  deposits  and  other  bulk minerals or commodities, it may be reasonable to envisage 'eventual economic extraction' as covering time periods in excess of 50 years. However, for many gold deposits, application of the concept would normally be restricted to perhaps 10 to 15 years, and frequently to much shorter periods of time.'

## Inferred Mineral Resource

'An  'Inferred  Mineral  Resource'  is  that  part  of  a  Mineral  Resource  for  which  quantity  and  grade  or quality are estimated on the basis of limited geological evidence and sampling. Geological evidence is sufficient to imply but not verify geological and grade or quality continuity. An Inferred Mineral Resource has a lower level of confidence than that applying to an Indicated Mineral Resource and must not be converted to a Mineral Reserve. It is reasonably expected that the majority of Inferred Mineral Resources could be upgraded to Indicated Mineral Resources with continued exploration.'

Effective Date: March 24, 2016

Technical Report - NI 43-101 Resource Estimate for the Whistler Project, Alaska

'An  'Inferred  Mineral  Resource'  is  based  on  limited  information  and  sampling  gathered  through appropriate sampling techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes. Inferred  Mineral  Resources  must  not  be  included  in  the  economic  analysis,  production  schedules,  or estimated mine life in publicly disclosed Pre-Feasibility or Feasibility Studies, or in the Life of Mine plans and  cash  flow  models  of  developed  mines.  Inferred  Mineral  Resources  can  only  be  used  in  economic studies as provided under NI 43-101.'

'There  may  be  circumstances,  where  appropriate  sampling,  testing,  and  other  measurements  are sufficient  to  demonstrate  data  integrity,  geological  and  grade/quality  continuity  of  a  Measured  or Indicated Mineral Resource, however, quality assurance and quality control, or other information may not  meet  all  industry  norms  for  the  disclosure  of  an  Indicated  or  Measured  Mineral  Resource.  Under these  circumstances,  it  may  be  reasonable  for  the  Qualified  Person  to  report  an  Inferred  Mineral Resource if the Qualified Person has taken steps to verify the information meets the requirements of an Inferred Mineral Resource.'

## Indicated Mineral Resource

'An 'Indicated Mineral Resource' is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, grade or quality, densities,  shape  and  physical  characteristics  are  estimated  with  sufficient  confidence  to  allow  the application  of  Modifying  Factors  in  sufficient  detail  to  support  mine  planning  and  evaluation  of  the economic viability of the deposit. Geological evidence is derived from adequately detailed and reliable exploration, sampling and testing and is sufficient to assume geological and grade or quality continuity between points of observation. An Indicated Mineral Resource has a lower level of confidence than that applying to a Measured Mineral Resource and may only be converted to a Probable Mineral Reserve.' 'Mineralisation may be classified as an Indicated Mineral Resource by the Qualified Person when the nature, quality,  quantity  and  distribution  of  data  are  such  as  to  allow  confident  interpretation  of  the geological framework and to reasonably assume the continuity of mineralisation.  The Qualified Person must recognise the importance of the Indicated Mineral Resource category to the advancement of the feasibility  of  the  project.    An  Indicated  Mineral  Resource  estimate  is  of  sufficient  quality  to  support  a Preliminary Feasibility Study which can serve as the basis for major development decisions.'

## Measured Mineral Resource

'A Measured Mineral Resource is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, grade or quality, densities,  shape,  and  physical  characteristics  are  estimated  with  confidence  sufficient  to  allow  the application of Modifying Factors to support detailed mine planning and final evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit. Geological evidence is derived from detailed and reliable exploration, sampling and  testing  and  is  sufficient  to  confirm  geological  and  grade  or  quality  continuity  between  points  of observation. A Measured Mineral Resource has a higher level of confidence than that applying to either an Indicated Mineral Resource or an Inferred Mineral Resource. It may be converted to a Proven Mineral Reserve or to a Probable Mineral Reserve.'

'Mineralisation or other natural material of economic interest may be classified as a Measured Mineral Resource by the Qualified Person when the nature, quality, quantity and distribution of data are such that the tonnage and grade or quality of the mineralisation can be estimated to within close limits and that variation from the estimate would not significantly affect potential economic viability of the deposit.

This category requires a high level of confidence in, and understanding of, the geology and controls of the mineral deposit.'

## Modifying Factors

'Modifying  Factors  are  considerations  used  to  convert  Mineral  Resources  to  Mineral  Reserves.  These include, but are not restricted to, mining, processing, metallurgical, infrastructure, economic, marketing, legal, environmental, social and governmental factors.'

For  Island  Mountain,  the  geologic  continuity  was  established  from  surface  mapping  and  drill  hole logging.   Three  dimensional geologic  solids  were  constructed  to  constrain  the  resource  estimate.    At Raintree West the deposit was covered with overburden and a grade shell was used to constrain the estimate.

Grade  continuity  as  determined  by  semivariograms  was  used  to  orient  and  dimension  the  search ellipsoids during estimation at both deposits.

For the Island Mountain Deposit blocks estimated in Pass 1 or Pass 2 using up to ½ the semivariogram range for each domain were classified as Indicated.   All other blocks were classified as Inferred.  Only estimated blocks above the 900 elevation level were reported.

For Raintree West the density of drilling, at this time, did not allow for any blocks to be classified higher than Inferred.

Due  to  the  estimation  of  three  variables  a  gold  equivalent  (AuEq)  value  was  determined  for  both deposits.  Gold equivalent was determined for Island Mountain as follows:

Assume for Island Mountain Gold price of US$1250/oz Copper price of US$2.10 Silver price of US$16.50/oz

Gold Recovery by cyanide of 90% Copper Recovery by floatation of 80% Silver Recovery of 25% in copper concentrate

AuEq = (Au g/t * 1250 * .90 / 31.1035) + (Cu % * 2.10 * .80 * 22.0462) + (Ag g/t * 16.50 * 0.25 / 31.1035) (1250 * .90 / 31.1035)

For Raintree West the recoveries were taken from metallurgical studies at the nearby Whistler Deposit.

Assume for Raintree West

Gold price of US$1250/oz

Gold Recovery of 75% Copper Recovery of 85% Silver Recovery of 75%

Copper price of US$2.10

Silver price of US$16.50/oz

AuEq = (Au g/t * 1250 * .75 / 31.1035) + (Cu % * 2.10 * .85 * 22.0462) + (Ag g/t * 16.50 * 0.75 / 31.1035) (1250 * .75 / 31.1035)

There  have  been  no  economic  studies  done  on  either  deposit  so  an  economic  cut-off  at  this  time  is unknown.  In the author's judgement and experience the resource stated has reasonable prospects of

Technical Report - NI 43-101 Resource Estimate for the Whistler Project, Alaska economic extraction.  Based on the study completed on the nearby Whistler Deposit where a conceptual pit was produced (MMTS, 2015) a cut-off of 0.3 g/t AuEq has been highlighted as a possible cut-off for an open pit at Island Mountain.

Concentrate).  A 0.30 g/t Au Equivalent cut-off has been highlighted as a possible open pit cut-off based on studies completed at the nearby Whistler Deposit.

For Raintree West the significant mineralization occurs near surface in the south east and at depth.  The near surface material ( above 250 m  elevation) could be possibly minable by open pit using a 0.3 g/t AuEq  cut-off  similar  to  Whistler  and  Island  Mountain.    The  mineralization  at  depth  (below  100  m elevation)  might  be  minable  by  block  cave.    An  analogous  deposit  might  be  New Afton  in  Kamloops where resources are reported at a 0.4 % CuEq for a block cave operation. (http://www.newgold.com/investors/reserves-and-resources/default.aspx).  Considering the differences in infrastructure a AuEq cut-off of 0.6 g/t might be reasonable for the deep mineralization at Raintree West.

## 14.3.1 Block Model Verification

A check on the block model results has been completed by comparing the average composite grade for each domain with the average kriged grades for that domain (see Table 14-19 and Table 14-20).  For both deposits the results are reasonable with no bias indicated.

A second check of the block model was made using cross sections and visually comparing block grades with drill hole composite grades.  Again the results were reasonable with no bias indicated. The cross sections for both Island Mountain and Raintree West are shown in Appendix F and G respectively.

There  are  no  known  significant  environmental,  permitting,  legal,  title,  taxation,  socio-economic, marketing,  political,  or  other  factors  that  could  materially  affect  the  resource  estimates  for  Island Mountain or Raintree West.

Technical Report - NI 43-101 Resource Estimate for the Whistler Project, Alaska

## 14.4 Whistler Deposit

The Mineral Resource estimate for the Whistler Deposit was initially prepared by Susan C. Bird, P.Eng. of MMTS (see MMTS, 2015).  This estimate is identical to historic estimate previously prepared for Kiska in March, 2011 which is an update from the 2008 resource estimate based on 2010 drilling and updated geology.  GCL has reviewed the Whistler Deposit resource estimate and is of the opinion that the data, methods  and  results  are  appropriate  for  the  deposit  and  that  the  results  from  MMTS  (2015),  as described  verbatim  below,  are  current.    The  resource  model  is  built  using  MineSight  ,  an  industry standard  in  geologic  modeling  and  mine  planning  software.    The  three  dimensional  block  model  has block dimensions of 20 m x 20 m x 10 m to cover the extent of the mineralized zone, as well as all pit limits tested.  A three dimensional solid based on geology of the porphyry deposit is used to constrain the limits of mineralization in the block model.  Gold, copper, and silver grades are interpolated into each block based on ordinary kriging.  The resource is then classified as Indicated or Inferred based on CIM Definition Standards (CIM, 2014).

The Whistler Deposit is a structurally controlled porphyry deposit with Au, Cu and Ag as the primary economic metals.  There have been three major intrusive episodes, which define the mineralization at Whistler.    The  earliest,  Main  Stage  Porphyry  (MSP),  being  that  of  principal  mineralization.    A  major northwest trending  fault  (the  Divide  Fault) is  used  to  segregate  the  mineralization  into  two  domains prior to grade interpolation.  There is some evidence that lateral offsets of as much as 100 m may have occurred along this fault.

Statistical analysis (cumulative probability plots, histograms, classic statistical values) of the assay data is used to confirm the domain selection, to decide if capping is necessary, and to determine the extent of non-mineralized  zones  within  the  diorite  solid.    Assay  data  is  then  composited  into  5  m  intervals, honoring the domain boundaries, with composite statistics also compiled for comparison with assay and block model data.  The composites are used to create variograms for Au, Cu, and Ag, in order to help define rotation and search parameters for the block model interpolation.

Validation of the model is completed by comparison of the block values with de-clustered composite values, with values interpolated by inverse distance, by the use of swath plots, tonnage grade curves, and by visual inspections in section and plan across the property.

Specific gravity values are based on 21 measurements by ALS Chemex to give an average density of 2.72 for ore, and 2.60 for waste.

## 14.4.1 Assay Data - Whistler Deposit

Drillhole data includes all 48 holes drilled at the Whistler Deposit.  A 3D solid of the diorite intrusion has been created based on the logged geology.  The geology has also been used to define the Divide Fault as a major fault and domain boundary within the deposit.

## Technical Report - NI 43-101 Resource Estimate for the Whistler Project, Alaska

Within  the  mineralized  diorite  body,  non-mineralized  intervals  indicated  by  assay  data  have  been determined  to  be  of  insignificant  length  and  occurrence.    This  is  evident  from  Figure  14-9  which indicates the scarcity and discontinuity of any non-mineralized intervals.  Statistics of the assays for the mineralized and non-mineralized zones within the diorite (summarized in Table 14-21) also indicate the relative lack of non-mineralized intervals with only 532 in total, representing only 5% of the data.

Cumulative probability plots (CPP) are used to define the two domains as separate populations for block model interpolation.  Figure 14-11 and Figure 14-12 show the CPP plots for Au and Cu respectively, by domain.  The assay statistics of each domain are summarized in the Table 14-22.  These indicate that the domains have separate populations, with Domain 1 (east of the Divide fault) having higher mean grades of both Au and Cu.  Because these plots indicate a near linear trend even at higher grades, no capping of the assays data prior to compositing is deemed necessary.

## 14.4.2 Compositing

Compositing of Au, Ag and Cu grades have been done as 5 m fixed length composites.  Small intervals less than 2 m are merged with the up hole composite if the composite length is less than 5 m.  Domain boundaries are honored during compositing.  Table 14-23 summarizes the statistics of the composite data.

Correlation of Au with Cu grades is investigated with scatter plots of the composite data, as shown in Figure 14-13 and Figure 14-14.  These scatter plots indicate some broad correlation of Au and Cu grades, more defined for Domain 1.  Also of note, is the reduced slope for Domain 2, indicating lower Au grades. There  are  also  significant  spatial  differences  in  the  Cu-Au  ratio  which  will  be  discussed  in  the  block model results section.

## 14.4.3 Variography

Variograms are completed for each domain at 30 degree azimuth intervals and 10 degree plunges over the  entire  directional  sphere.    The  composite  data  set  for  Domain  2  is  not  large  enough  to  produce reliable variograms.  Therefore, the parameters found for Domain 1 are used throughout the deposit.  A summary of the spherical variogram parameters is given in Table  14-24.    The  Au  and  Cu  grades  are defined with a single spherical variogram model, with the Ag defined by two nested spherical structures.

Table 14-24 Variogram Parameters

| Parameter             |        |        | Ag          | Ag          |

## 14.4.4 Block Model Interpolation and Resource Classification

The block model limits and block size are as given in Table 14-25.

Table 14-25 Block Model Limits

| Direction   | Minimum   | Maximum   |   Block Dimension |   # of Blocks |
|-------------|-----------|-----------|-------------------|---------------|
| Easting     | 517,200   | 519,860   |                20 |           133 |
| Northing    | 6,870,000 | 6,873,000 |                20 |           150 |
| Elevation   | -50       | 1,280     |                10 |           133 |

Interpolation of Au, Cu and Ag values is done by ordinary kriging in two passes based on the variogram parameters.    Interpolation  was  restricted  by  the  Diorite  Solid,  with  composites  and  block  codes matching within each domain.  Search parameters are summarized in the table below.

Table 14-26 Search Parameters

| Search Parameter             | Pass 1    | Pass 2   |
|------------------------------|-----------|----------|
| Resource Classification      | Indicated | Inferred |
| Search distance              | ½ Range   | Range    |
| Minimum # comps              | 4         | 3        |
| Maximum # comps              | 9         | 9        |
| Maximum # Comps/Hole         | 3         | 2        |
| Max # Comps / Split Quadrant | 6         | 7        |

Classification is based on the variogram parameters, and restrictions on the number of composites and drillholes used in each pass of the interpolation, as Indicated in Table 14-26.  The definition of Indicated and Inferred used to classify the resource is in accordance with that  of the CIM Definition Standards (CIM, 2014).

## 14.4.5 Block Model Validation

## 14.4.5.1 Comparison of Mean Grades

Interpolation  is  also  done  by  Inverse  Distance  Squared  ("ID2")  weighting  using  the  same  search parameters to compare to the kriged values.  Table 14-27 gives a summary of the mean grades for declustered composites (NN interpolation), kriged and IDW, indicating no global bias.

Table 14-27 Comparison of De-clustered Composite, Kriged, and ID2 Mean Grade Values

| Interpolation     | Au     | Cu     | Ag     |
|-------------------|--------|--------|--------|
| Nearest Neighbour | 0.3697 | 0.1359 | 1.7537 |
| IDW               | 0.3754 | 0.1374 | 1.7212 |
| OK                | 0.3673 | 0.1359 | 1.6796 |
| Difference - IDW  | 1.5%   | 1.1%   | -1.9%  |
| Difference - OK   | -2.2%  | -1.1%  | -2.5%  |

## 14.4.5.2 Volume-Variance Correction

Cut-off grade plots (tonnage-grade curves) are constructed for each metal to check the validity of the change of support in the grade estimations.  The Nearest Neighbour grade estimates are first corrected by the affine method using the block variance.  The corrected NN values for Au and Cu are plotted and compared to both the kriged values and the inverse distance squared values (Figure 14-16 and Figure 14-17).  The distributions shows good correlation, and thus the change of support are valid.

## 14.4.5.3 Swath Plots

Swath plots through the diorite body are created in N-S, E-W and vertical directions for the three main metals to compare the kriged grades to those interpolated by the Nearest Neighbour method.  These are illustrated in Figure 14-18 through Figure 14-20.  The swath plots indicate no global bias in the kriged values, and good correlation in the main body of the data.

## 14.4.5.4 Visual Validation

A series of E-W, N-S sections (every 20m) and plans (every 10m) have been used to inspect the ordinary kriging block model grades with the original assay data.  Figure 14-21 and Figure 14-22 give examples of this comparison for the E-W section at 6871290N, for Au and Cu grades respectively.  Figure 14-23 and Figure  14-24  illustrate  the  grade  comparisons  at  the  690m  elevation.    Plots  throughout  the  model confirmed that the block model grades corresponded very well with the assayed grades.

Visual inspection of the Cu/Au ratio indicated spatial variation.  Although the scatter plots of these two grades showed some correlation (Figure 14-23 and Figure 14-24), section and plan plots reveal that the ratio changes throughout the deposit.  Figure 14-25 and Figure 14-26 illustrate this spatial variability for a section and plan view.  The ratio generally increases at the periphery of the deposit, and to the north. This is due primarily to higher Au grades in the center and the southern portion of the deposit.

## 14.5 Pit Delineated Resource: Whistler Deposit

As  defined  by  NI  43-101,  the  confining  pit  defines  a  boundary  for  continuous  mineralization  with suitable grades and with a reasonable expectation that an engineered plan will produce an economic plan.    The  required  assumptions  to  produce  a  Lerchs-Grossman  (LG)  pit  shell  using  MineSight®,  are summarized in the following section.

Process recoveries are based on preliminary metallurgical studies.  The recoveries used to determine the Net Smelter return are given in Table 14-28, with economic inputs summarized in Table 14-29.

Table 14-28 Process Recoveries

| Metal   |   Recovery (%) |
|---------|----------------|
| Au      |             75 |
| Cu      |             85 |
| Ag      |             75 |

*Indicated and Inferred resources are used for pit optimization.

*Pit slope angle is considered constant at 45 degrees for all cases.

The pit delineated resource is given in Table 14-30, for a range of NSR cut-offs with the base case cut-off of  $7.50/tonne  highlighted.  Process recoveries, as well as mining, processing and off site costs have been  applied  in  order  to  determine  that  the  pit  resource  has  a  reasonable  prospect  of  economic extraction.  The $7.50/tonne cut-off (an Au Equivalent grade of approximately 0.3 gpt  at the base case prices) yields an Indicated resource of 79.2 Mtonnes at 0.51 gpt gold, 0.17% copper and 1.97 gpt silver (2.25 Moz Au Eqv.) and an Inferred resource of 145.8 Mtonnes at 0.40 gpt gold, 0.15% copper and 1.75 gpt silver (3.35 Moz Au Eqv).  The mining, processing and off site costs used here are estimates and may not represent actual costs.

There  are  no  known  significant  environmental,  permitting,  legal,  title,  taxation,  socio-economic, marketing, political, or other factors that could materially affect the resource estimate.

Technical Report - NI 43-101 Resource Estimate for the Whistler Project, Alaska

The main impact of the revised BWI parameters and considering a coarser grind is on ball mill power, 6 MW less, with a small increase in both SAG and regrind power amounting to 2 MW.

The other significant impact from a design point of view is that, whereas formerly the ball mill size was beyond  what  is  currently  possible  with  one  mill  therefore  requiring  two  with  additional  circuit complexity, the revised parameters put the ball mill sizing comfortably within what is currently available as a single mill.

## 17.2 Proposed Process Flowsheet and Process Description

## 17.2.1 Overall Flowsheet

The  testwork  results  have  shown  that  the  Whistler ore  is  metallurgically  very  amenable,  despite  low head grades,  and  that  saleable,  high  quality  copper  concentrates  with  acceptable  recoveries  of  both copper and gold can be achieved with a conventional flowsheet comprising single stage crushing, a SAG, ball mill and pebble crushing (SABC) grinding circuit followed by rougher flotation, regrinding of rougher concentrate and finally two stages of cleaning.

The levels of recovery and upgrade for both copper and gold are relatively insensitive to feed grade, which is a very positive result of significance for a project like Whistler, where low head grades are often perceived as an obstacle to successful extraction.

## 17.2.2 Crushing

Detailed crushing circuit design has not been carried out, this not being critical to the crucial element of power consumption, and being in any case a very standard part of the flowsheet.  However based on industry comparable, it is reasonable to assume that, for the throughput envisaged of 11Mtpa, an 89' x 60' gyratory crusher with associated ancillary feeders and conveyors would be appropriate. This size selection recognizes the hardness of the Whistler ore (no crushing index data but assuming that the high BWI figure is an indicator of general hardness for comminution purposes).

## 17.2.3 Primary Grinding

The original grinding circuit design was based on the Island Mountain BWI data and a primary grind size of 100µm.  The power requirements were determined by simple Bond formulae, assuming a Rod Mill Work Index RWI (for SAG sizing) of 20% greater than the BWI (a common industry assumption for a hard competent ore), and allowing a SAG 'inefficiency factor' of 1.25 (again a common industry assumption). A 20% allowance was made for losses and design margin.

The QP considers that this approach to be adequate and appropriately conservative for early studies, although SAG-specific test data like JK drop weight tests or SMC tests would have been preferred and are essential for more definitive design at the next phase of study, as already mentioned.

The grinding power requirements have been tabulated in Table 17-2.

Effective Date: March 24, 2016

## Technical Report - NI 43-101 Resource Estimate for the Whistler Project, Alaska

The original design consisted of the following:

- · SAG mill of 17,000 HP
- · two ball mills of 13,500 HP each

With the Whistler-specific BWI test data and assuming a 175 µm primary grind size was to be validated by further locked cycle testing, the revised design would consist of the simpler configuration:

- · SAG mill of 18,000 HP
- · one ball mill of 18500 HP

## 17.2.4 Flotation

The flotation mass balance was based on the parameters tabulated in Table 17-1, together with upgrade ratios for the rougher and cleaner concentrates that matched with testwork results, in order to derive volumetric flow rates through the various stages of flotation and appropriate flotation cell volumes that observed industry standard convention for the minimum number of cells to avoid short-circuiting in a bank (typically five).

Accordingly it is envisage that the flotation circuit will consist of the following:

- · Rougher bank of 8 x 300 m  cells 3
- · First cleaner bank of 8 x 40 m  cells 3
- · Second cleaner bank of 6 x 10 m 3

Regrind circuit design still requires optimization. The testwork was based on 20 µm and no attempts have  been  made  at  this  stage  to  investigate  opportunities  for  coarsening  the  regrind  size  whilst maintaining separation performance in the cleaner circuit.

A regrind size of 20 µm probably requires vertical stirred mills to achieve this fine grind size; however only a slight coarsening to 30µm would bring this back into the range of conventional tumbling mills.

It  has  been  assumed  that  some  optimization  is  possible  and  that  conventional  tumbling  mills  (lower capital  cost  but  higher  power  consumption)  would  be  suitable.  On  this  basis  the  regrind  circuit  will consist of the following:

- · One regrind mill of 5700 HP for the original design (revised design would require a slightly larger mill of 7000 HP, reflecting the coarser regrind feed size).

## 17.2.5 Concentrate Dewatering

Given the fine size of the concentrate following the necessary regrinding, it has been assumed that a pressure filter (Larox or similar) would be required to achieve acceptable transportable moisture limits. The filter would be preceded by a conventional concentrate thickener.

## 25.0 Interpretation and Conclusions

GCL  has  reviewed  and  audited  the  exploration  data  available  for  the  Whistler  Project.    This  review suggests  that  the  exploration  data  accumulated  by  Cominco  Alaska,  Kennecott,  Geoinformatics,  and Kiska is generally reliable for the purpose of resource estimation.

Following  geostatistical  analysis  and  variography,  GCL  constructed  an  initial  mineral  resource  block model for the Raintree West and Island Mountain gold-copper deposits constraining grade interpolation using a grade shell model at Raintree West and geological domains at Island Mountain.

Mineral resources for the Raintree West and Island Mountain gold-copper deposits have been estimated in conformity with generally accepted CIM "Estimation of Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserves Best Practices"  Guidelines.    These  new  mineral  resources  are  in  addition  to  a  previous  mineral  resource estimate  that  exists  for  the  Whistler  Deposit.    There  is  insufficient  information  at  this  early  stage  of study to assess the extent to which the mineral resources will be affected by environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, socioeconomic, marketing or other relevant factors.

In the opinion of GCL, the block model resource estimate and resource classification reported herein are a  reasonable  representation  of  the  global  gold,  copper  and  silver  mineral  resources  found  in  the Whistler, Raintree West and Island Mountain deposits.  Mineral resources are not mineral reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability.  There is no certainty that all or any part of the mineral resource will be converted into mineral reserve.

## 26.0 Recommendations

For the Raintree West Deposit, the following recommendations are made:

- 1) Infill and step-out drilling to the north and south of the deposit. This drilling should be done to potentially  upgrade  the  classification  of  the  current  resource  estimate  and  to  potentially increase  the  resource.    Specifically  shallow  holes  (200  to  250  m)  dipping  east  on  sections 6871350 N and 6871400 N and 6871500 N should be drilled to increase the confidence in near surface mineralization.
- 2) In  concert  with  the  new  drilling,  the  previous  drill  core  should  be  relogged  and  a  robust geological model/domains should be constructed for future resource estimates.
- 3) Further specific gravity measurements should be collected from current and future drill holes.
- 4) Metallurgical testing should be conducted on Raintree West samples.

For the Island Mountain Deposit, the following recommendations are made:

- 1) Infill and step-out drilling to the north and south of the deposit. This drilling should be done to potentially  upgrade  the  classification  of  the  current  resource  estimate  and  to  potentially increase the resource. Drilling should aim to link the mineralized breccias drilled north of the resource area, with the main breccia complex. Deep drilling under the breccia complex is also warranted to potentially locate the causative, and potentially mineralized, intrusive driving the brecciation.

At the Whistler Deposit, the following recommendations from MMTS (2015) include:

- 2) A better understanding of the current known faults could be an opportunity for increasing the resource at Whistler.  Particularly in the south of the deposit (south of N6971200).  There is a paucity of drillhole data on both sides of the Divide fault in this area, resulting in blocks left uninterpolated within the diorite solid.  Furthermore, there is little evidence for the fault location. Previous interpretation  (Kennecott,  2007)  did  not  include  the  Divide  fault  extending  south  of approximately 6871280N.  Figure 26-1 and Figure 26-2 are plan and section views of the model and composite Au grades.  These plots indicate the area west of the interpreted Divide Fault with no drilling and Au grades not interpolated into the blocks, but within the LG pit resource (shown in black).  Drillhole WH-10-19 returned economic grades.  Targeting this area would both allow blocks to be interpolated in this area and better define the fault location.

- 3) Revision of the geologic model to provide a better understanding of how the three later stages of intrusion relate to the mineralization.  This would involve re-logging of core with the current knowledge of the assay values.  Through re-interpretation in section and plan it is the expected outcome that 3D solids of each intrusive phase could be constructed.
- 4) Similarly,  3D  solids  of  alteration  and  structural  domains  should  be  created  from  the  reinterpretation.
- 5) Additional specific gravity measurements should be obtained from existing drillholes to augment the current database.
- 6) The use of classical statistics (cumulative probability plots, histograms, box-plots, and contact analyses) should be used to define the final controlling factors to mineralization as being due to lithology, alteration, structure, or a combination of these.
- 7) Creation of a new block model in which the updated geologic domains are used in conjunction with indicator kriging to reduce smoothing of the mineralized and non-mineralized zones within the deposit would increase the accuracy of the model.
- 8) Additional  in-fill  drilling  to  upgrade  the  classification  of  Inferred  to  Indicated  would  require drillhole  spacing  of  50  m,  as  Indicated  by  Figure  26-3.    However,  this  is  recommended subsequent to the additional drilling outlined for the remaining deposits as discussed below.

Based on the interpretations and conclusions regarding the exploration potential on the property, an exploration program comprised of three phases is warranted (Table 26-2).

Phase 1 would consist of a full desktop review of all the geological, geochemical, geophysical and drilling data, concurrent with the review of drill core, in order to optimize strategic targeting in Phase 2. The specific design of Phase 2 is contingent on the results of Phase 1.

A possible Phase 2 might consist of a 'top-of-bedrock' grid drilling program in the Whistler area and further surface mapping, sampling and compilation work to rank and prioritize other exploration targets on  the  project  area  (Muddy  Creek,  Snow  Ridge,  Puntilla,  Round  Mountain,  Howell  Zone,  Super Conductor), with the aim to test one or more of these targets with deeper drilling (1,500 metres).

The  grid  drilling  program  would  penetrate  the  glacial  cover  and  drill  approximately  25  metres  into bedrock to obtain geological and geochemical data.  This data, in conjunction with the existing airborne

## Technical Report - NI 43-101 Resource Estimate for the Whistler Project, Alaska

magnetic data and 3D IP data, would considerably enhance exploration targeting.  Drilling on 200 metre centres from fifty holes (1,250 metres) would cover the most prospective areas in the Whistler area.

In  addition,  the  Phase  2  program  should  consist  of  follow-up  drilling  in  the  Whistler  area  to  target anomalies generated by the grid drilling program and to expand drilling at Raintree West (2,500 metres). Any  significant mineralized  intercepts  from  this phase  of  step-out  drilling should  be  sent  for metallurgical testing with particular focus on the impact of the relatively high lead-zinc concentrations.

Currently there is additional potential of between 50 Mt to 90 Mt of mineralization grading between 0.47 to 0.59 g/t Au Eq as summarized in Table 26-1  that was interpolated in the Whistler Resource block model  but  remains  outside  of  the  reported  pit  constrained  resource.  This  mineralization  is  largely located below the pit constrained resource and is considered a significant exploration target that could potentially increase the Whistler Resource with additional infill drilling.  Existing drilling in this area is wide spaced and infill drilling could identify higher grade mineralization and increase the overall average grade of this material.

- 1.  Gold equivalent grades are in situ using the same prices as for the NSP calculation but reporting at 100% recoveries.

The above-quoted figures are reported as an exploration target, based on reasonable assumptions made from  compiled  data.  These  figures  should  not  be  construed  to  be  included  in  a  calculated  resource (Inferred,  Indicated  or  Measured)  under  standards  of  NI  43-101.  The  potential  quantities  and  grades reported above are conceptual in nature and there has been insufficient work to date to include these with the NI 43-101 compliant resource.  Furthermore, it is uncertain if additional exploration will result in this material being added to the existing resource.

The  Phase  2  drilling  should  also  consist  of  2,500  metres  of  diamond  drilling  to  in-fill  and  expand mineralization at the Breccia Zone at Island Mountain.  Mineralization is open to south and north, and undrilled breccia bodies occur for 700 metres to the north of the Breccia Zone.

Concurrently with Phase 1 and 2, and after the results of this drilling, further geological and resource modelling and metallurgical studies (Phase 3), should be carried out as indicated above at the Whistler Deposit,  and  with  new  drilling  results  at  Island  Mountain  and  Raintree  West.  Phase  3  would  be contingent on positive results from Phase 2.

Metallurgical recommendations include:

- · Mineralogical studies to better understand the gold associations
- · Comminution testing specifically to address SAG mill power requirements and design
- · Variability testing
- · Confirmatory locked cycle flotation testing at the coarser primary grind size
