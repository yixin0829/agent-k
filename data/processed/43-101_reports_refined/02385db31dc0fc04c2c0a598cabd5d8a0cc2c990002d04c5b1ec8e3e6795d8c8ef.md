## 1 Summary

## 1.1 Introduction

Defense  Metals  Corp  (TSX-V:DEFN)  retained  SRK  Consulting  (Canada)  Inc.  to  conduct  a preliminary economic assessment (PEA) on the Wicheeda rare earth element (REE) project in British Columbia (BC), Canada, and to present its outcomes in this National Instrument (NI) 43-101 independent technical report. The PEA was part of a two-stage work program that began with a scenario analysis to identify the best saleable product strategy and production rate for the PEA.

SRK based the PEA on an updated mineral resource which also is documented in this report.

The  qualified  persons  (QPs)  for  the  PEA  and  mineral  resource  estimate  (MRE)  are  all  SRK consultants or Associates.

Site visits for the purposes of personal inspections of the Wicheeda property have been undertaken by Mr. AndrÃ© M. Deiss, resource QP and Dr. Anoush Ebrahimi, mining QP (separate visits, both in October 2021).

Note: Throughout this report, all currency is 2021, non-escalated United States dollars (USD) and all units are metric, unless otherwise specifically noted.

## 1.2 Property Description and Ownership

The Wicheeda Property is located in the Central Mining Division in central BC, approximately 80 km northeast of Prince George, BC and 50 km east of Bear Lake, BC. The property consists of seven contiguous mineral claims that cover approximately 2,008 hectares. Currently all but one claim are 100% owned by Spectrum Mining Corporation (Spectrum), under an option agreement with Defense Metals. The claims cover Wicheeda Lake and straddle a segment of Wichcika Creek. The principal area of interest is the Wicheeda REE Carbonatite Deposit.

## 1.3 Geology and Mineralization

The  Wicheeda  deposit  is  a  southeast-trending,  north  to  northeast  dipping  composite  layered syenite-carbonatite sill complex having dimensions of approximately 400 m north-south by 100250 m east-west. The carbonatite is intruded into syenite, mafic dikes, limestone and calcareous sedimentary wall rocks. The mineralization is interpreted as a moderately north-northeast dipping, shallowly north plunging, layered sill complex having low REE grade syenite at its base. It is overlain by transitional intermediate REE grade hybrid xenolithic carbonatite (fenite) as well as relatively higher  REE  grade  dolomite  carbonatite  rocks.  The  dolomite  carbonatite  zones  form  the  main mineralization of the Wicheeda REE deposit, outcropping at surface.

## 1.4 Exploration Status

Defense Metals has not conducted any surface exploration on the Wicheeda project other than diamond drilling and metallurgical testwork.

During 2019, Defense Metals conducted a diamond drilling exploration program consisting of 13 diamond drill holes, totalling 2007.5 m. These tested the southern, central, and northern zones of the  mineralized  carbonatite.  All  drill  holes  intersected  variable  lengths  of  significant  REE mineralization.  The  2019  diamond  drilling  program  was  successful  in  expanding  the  REE mineralized footprint of the Wicheeda deposit to the south and north respectively.

In 2020, Defense Metals completed a LiDAR survey of the project area. The increased resolution of the LiDAR allows for more robust mine planning, particularly when considering the high relief within the project area.

During 2020 and 2021, all the 2008 and 2009 original drill core pulps were reanalyzed, utilizing a REE lithium metaborate fusion with an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) finish  analytical  method,  to  reduce  the  uncertainty  regarding  the  historical  incomplete  X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analytical results.

During 2021, Defense Metals completed a 29-diamond drill hole program comprising, 5,349 m of drilling primarily for resource expansion and at Wicheeda. The results of drilling are expected during the first quarter 2022 and therefore have not been incorporated into the technical report. The drilling is expected to support ongoing advanced economic studies through the development of an updated geological model and MRE.

## 1.5 Metallurgical Testing

## 1.5.1 Flotation Processing

Metallurgical development programs have been conducted on test samples from the Wicheeda deposit  over  the  period  2011-2021  by  SGS  Canada  Inc.  (SGS),  a  respected  commercial metallurgical laboratory. These programs have included initial exploratory testwork conducted by SGS for Spectrum in 2011 to develop a flotation process for recovering the contained rare earth minerals  into  a  flotation  concentrate.  This  work  was  followed  by  flotation  optimization  testwork conducted  for  Defense  Metals  by  SGS  in  2019  and  flotation  pilot  plant  testing  in  2020. Hydrometallurgical testwork was conducted on bulk flotation concentrates to demonstrate process requirements to produce a mixed REE precipitate.

In the 2019 flotation optimization testwork, an extensive series of bench scale flotation tests was conducted on a 300 kg sample (4.8% total rare earth oxide - TREO) in an effort to optimize the flotation  process  parameters.  The  result  of  the  optimization  program  served  to  establish  the optimum conditions to be used in a subsequent locked-cycle flotation test. The locked-cycle test flowsheet resulted in the recovery of 85.7% of the rare earth oxides (REO) into a final concentrate containing 48.7% TREO from a test composite that contained 4.8% TREO

The 2020 pilot plant testing processed a total of 25.5 t of material (averaging 4.66% TREO). The pilot  plant  flowsheet  included  primary  grinding,  reagent  conditioning,  rougher  and  scavenger flotation and two stages of cleaner flotation. The grind size averaged about P80 114 Âµm. Pilot plant runs PP14 - 16C were considered confirmatory runs and averaged 77.3% REO recovery into final flotation concentrates of 51.6% TREO.

## 1.5.2 Hydrometallurgical Processing

The flotation concentrates produced in bench and pilot plant flotation work have been subjected to hydrometallurgical testwork generally focused on a caustic crack process.

Key aspects of the proposed flowsheet have been tested while the study of some more routine operations has been deferred to a more detailed stage of testing.  Several alternative processing routes and variations within a caustic crack flowsheet have been examined.

Several key design parameters were defined in the caustic crack testwork including a REE recovery of 87% from the flotation concentrate, the optimum terminal pH and acid demand for a gangue leach operation, caustic crack conditions and REE leach extraction.

Some preliminary work has been done on an acid bake route and results indicate higher REE recovery than that of the caustic crack route.  More acid bake work is planned.  A roast-leach process was also examined but did not hold any promise.

## 1.6 Mineral Resource Estimate

The Wicheeda MRE was prepared by Mr. Warren Black, M.Sc., P.Geo. of APEX Geoscience Ltd under the supervision of the QP, Mr. AndrÃ© M. Deiss, B.Sc. (Hons), Pri.Sci.Nat. of SRK Consulting (Canada) Inc., in accordance with CIM Definition Standards. The MRE are summarized in Table 1-1, with an effective date of November 7, 2021.  Findings are based on reviews of readily available data sources at the time of preparing this report. The mineral resources where constrained near surface utilizing Lerch-Grossman (LG) pit optimization algorithms. The SRK QP has reviewed and accepted the MRE and considers it to be in accordance with industry standard practices.

The MRE is predominately based on an unchanged geological model and methodologies used to calculate the 2020 MRE. Differences relate to the incorporation of pulp REE multi-element fusion inductively  coupled  ICP-MS  re-assay  of  the  2008  and  2009  drillholes,  updated  estimation parameters, and a 2020 LiDAR survey. The increased resolution of the LiDAR allows for more robust mine planning, particularly when considering the high relief within the Project area.

Factors that may affect the estimates include: metal price and concentrate payable assumptions, changes  in  interpretations  of  mineralization  geometry,  continuity  of  REE  mineralization  zones, changes to kriging assumptions, metallurgical recovery assumptions, operating cost assumptions, and confidence in the modifying factors, including assumptions that surface rights to allow mining infrastructure to be constructed will be forthcoming and that there are no delays or other issues in reaching agreements with regulatory authorities and stakeholders, and changes in land tenure requirements or in permitting requirements.

Based on the presence of high-grade carbonatite intrusion-hosted REE mineralization exposed at surface and intersected in drill core, which exhibits a reasonable prospect for economic extraction, and favourable geology; follow-up exploration and infill drilling is recommend for the Wicheeda Project.

- o The overall process recoveries: For TREO&gt;=2.3%, recovery is 69.6%; between 2.3% and 1.5% TREO, recovery is 65.3%; and less than 1.5% TREO, recovery is 52.2%. These assume variable flotation recoveries and a constant 87% hydrometallurgical recovery.
- o Overall pit slope angles vary by zone between 40 and 48 degrees

## 1.7 Mining Methods

The  Wicheeda  deposit  is  to  be  developed  as  an  open  pit  mining  operation.  The  pit  is  to  be developed in two phases, with Phase 1 targeting at-surface higher grade mineralization. Mining rates over the 16-year life-of-mine vary from 4 to 7 Mtpa to maintain a 1.8 Mtpa mill feed rate to the flotation concentrator.

Mill feed is to be delivered to a pad near the pit where it is crushed and then conveyed to the flotation concentrator. Waste rock from the open pit is to be disposed of in a waste storage facility immediately south of the pit as well as used in construction of the tailings storage facility (TSF) embankment.

The PEA resource by resource classification for the selected pit and PEA mine plan are provided in Table 1-2.

Table 1-2 Summary of the PEA resource and the waste rock in the Wicheeda PEA mine plan

| Materials Mined    | Tonnes Mined   | % TREO   |
|--------------------|----------------|----------|
| Indicated Resource | 5,073,464      | 2.86%    |
| Inferred Resource  | 21,055,737     | 2.20%    |
| Waste              | 45,658,098     | N/A      |
| Strip Ratio        |                | 1.75     |

## 1.8 Recovery Methods

Material from the Wicheeda rare earth deposit is to be processed in a flotation concentrator to produce a rare earth flotation concentrate containing 40-50% TREO. The flotation concentrate would then be processed in a hydrometallurgical plant to produce a mixed REE hydrate precipitate containing 76% TREO. In the PEA plan, only the flotation concentrator operates in the first four years, with the hydrometallurgical plant commencing in Year 5.

## 1.8.1 Flotation concentrator

The  concentrator  flowsheet  will  include  three-stage  crushing,  ball  mill  grinding,  rougher  and scavenger flotation and three stages of cleaner flotation at elevated temperature to produce a final flotation concentrate containing 40-50% TREO.  The flotation concentrate will be thickened to about 55% solids and then filtered to about 9% moisture.  The filtered concentrate will then be weighed, sampled and bagged in super-sacks containing 1,000- 2,000 kg of concentrate which will then be transported to customers for the concentrate or the hydrometallurgical plant.

For flotation recovery, in comparison to metallurgical tests conducted on composites containing 4.8% TREO that reported laboratory REO recoveries of 85% into flotation concentrates containing almost 49% TREO, the SRK QP has discounted REO recovery according to lower expected mill feed grades. Also, concentrate containing 43% TREO has been assumed. Confirmatory testwork on material  representing planned mine production grades and mineral content will be required

during  the  next  phase  of  metallurgical  testwork  to  confirm  achievable  REO  recovery  and concentrate grades.

## 1.8.2 Hydrometallurgical Plant

The general processing route that has been investigated comprises a hydrochloric acid gangue leach to remove gangue components of the concentrate such as dolomite and calcite followed by a high-temperature 'caustic crack' process using 50% NaOH solution to destroy the phosphate and fluorocarbonate rare earth minerals followed by a hydrochloric acid leach of the caustic crack residue to dissolve the REE.  Sodium hydroxide is regenerated using lime, evaporated back to strength and recirculated.

The hydrochloric acid leach solution containing the REE is treated with limestone to precipitate impurities followed by precipitation of the rare earths as hydrates using lime slurry. The precipitate would be dried and shipped to a separation plant.

The hydrochloric acid used in the gangue leach and the rare earth leach is converted to calcium chloride solution through reaction with the lime and limestone used in the process. The calcium chloride solutions are purified and evaporated then reacted with sulphuric acid which precipitates gypsum and regenerates the hydrochloric acid.

All residues and impurity precipitates are combined as a lime-limestone enriched hydrometallurgical tailings which is returned to the mine site and combined with the flotation tailings before storage.

## 1.9 Project Infrastructure

## 1.9.1 Off-Site Infrastructure

No 'fatal flaws' have been identified with respect to off-site project infrastructure. The engineering and costing assumptions are at a scoping or PEA level and will require additional engineering and estimating precision to confirm the assumptions for a pre-feasibility study (PFS).

Cost allowances are summarised in Table 1-3.

Table 1-3: Offsite infrastructure capex estimates

| Offsite Infrastructure Capex   | Total (USD $M)   |    |
|--------------------------------|------------------|----|
| Power Line                     | $35.7            |    |
| Substation and connection      | $9.6             |    |
| Water Supply                   | $6.0             |    |
| Access Road                    | $62.4            |    |
| Access Bridge                  | $7.9             |    |
| Offsite Infrastructure Total   | $121.6           |    |

## 1.9.2 On-Site Infrastructure

On-site  infrastructure  is  to  consist  of  a  plant  site  with  an  administration  building  and  facilities associated  with the flotation concentrator; a conveyor  feeding  the  concentrator; a mine maintenance facility with truck shop, mine offices, dry and refueling station; various site roads. An allowance of $25M was made to cover this infrastructure (excluding concentrator) .

No 'fatal flaws' have been identified with respect to on-site project infrastructure. The engineering and costing assumptions are at a scoping or PEA level and will require additional engineering and estimating precision to confirm the assumptions for a PFS.

## 1.9.3 Tailings Management

The Wicheeda project is to use a conventional slurry TSF for tailings management. The TSF is to be built in four stages, using a starter embankment followed by downstream construction method for each of the three raises. Construction material for the embankment, drain and filter zones, and rip rap are to come from the open pit as well as suitable, local borrow sources.

The TSF is located on the west side of Wichcika Creek - the side opposite other project operations (pit, concentrator, etc.). It is sized to hold the entirety of the Wicheeda flotation tailings as well as the hydrometallurgical residue. Supernatant water levels are to be managed in conjunction with a control pond east of Wichcika Creek.

## 1.9.4 Water Management

The Wicheeda project will consist of a water management strategy to separate contact and noncontact water and provide sufficient storage for water treatment. Contact water will include runoff and groundwater inflows to the open pit, runoff and seepage from the waste rock storage areas, and storm water collected in the TSF supernatant pond areas. The PEA assumes all contact water will require water treatment. Non-contact water management will include diversion channels around the TSF and waste rock storage area to reduce the volume of contact water to be treated.

## 1.10 Environmental and Permitting

The  Wicheeda  project  will  require  a  federal  and  provincial  environmental  assessment  prior  to receiving approvals to advance to the licensing and permitting phase of the regulatory process. The  assessment  process  will  be  a  coordinated  effort  between  the  provincial  and  federal governments with the goal of reducing duplication of effort and meeting the federal legislation's desire of 'one project, one assessment'.

Defense Metals has initiated early engagement with the First Nations and other rights holders associated with Wicheeda's location. In addition, they have initiated the baseline characterization necessary for the completion of an environmental assessment supporting the proposed project. Both steps are fundamental for a timely advancement of the project to producing mine.

To date, all potential impacts currently identified as being associated with the Wicheeda project can be  mitigated  through  the  implementation  of  accepted  engineering  good  practices  currently employed throughout Canada's mining industry.

## 1.11 Economic Analysis

## Certainty of Preliminary Economic Assessment

The PEA is preliminary in nature, in that it includes inferred mineral resources that are considered too speculative geologically to have the economic considerations applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves, and there is no certainty that the PEA will be realized.

## Mineral Resources are Not Reserves

Mineral resources are not mineral reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability.

The results of the preliminary economic analysis are summarised in Table 1-4.

## 2 Introduction

## 2.1 Issuer

The  Wicheeda  project  is  an  early  stage  REE  exploration  project,  located  in  British  Columbia, Canada. It is located approximately 80 km northeast of Prince George and 50 km east of Bear Lake. Defense Metals Corp. (Defense Metals), a publicly listed mining company trading under the ticker  'DEFN'  on  the  TSX  Venture  Exchange  and  headquartered  in  Vancouver,  BC,  is  the proponent of the project.

The original six claims totalling 1,708 hectares comprising the Wicheeda project are 100% owned by Spectrum, a privately held, BC-based mineral exploration company. On November 22, 2018, Defense  Metals  entered  into  an  option  agreement  with  Spectrum  to  acquire  ownership  of  the Wicheeda project, subject to certain terms. Under the terms of the agreement, Defense Metals can acquire  100%  ownership  of  Spectrum  (which  owns  the  six  mineral  claims  that  comprise  the property), less a 2% NSR royalty, by incurring $1.93 million in expenditures, and by making cash payments and issuing shares in Defense Metals to Spectrum and its shareholders within a threeyear period. Details of the agreement are presented in Section 4.2.

A  subsequent  single  contiguous  claim  package  comprising  300.4  hectares  was  acquired  on November 5, 2021, issued in the name of Kristopher J. Raffle, a Director of the Defense Metals, and is beneficially owned by Defense Metals.

## 2.2 Terms of Reference

In March 2021, Defense Metals commissioned SRK Consulting (Canada) Inc. (SRK) to conduct a scenario analysis followed by a preliminary economic assessment (PEA) for the Wicheeda project. The services were rendered between July and December, 2021 leading to the preparation of the PEA  reported  herein,  which  was  disclosed  publicly  by  Defense  Metals  in  a  news  release  on November 24, 2021.

This technical report documents an updated mineral resource statement for the Wicheeda project in  addition  to  the  results  of  the  PEA.  The  report  was  prepared  following  the  guidelines  of  the Canadian Securities Administrators' National Instrument 43-101 and Form 43-101F1. The mineral resource  statement  reported  herein  was  prepared  in  conformity  with  generally  accepted  CIM 'Estimation of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves Best Practice Guidelines.'

This technical report summarizes the technical information available on the Wicheeda project and demonstrates  that  the  Wicheeda  project  clearly  has  merit  warranting  additional  exploration expenditures and technical evaluation.

## 2.3 Work Program

In order to select a development strategy for the Wicheeda project, the SRK team conducted a scenario analysis that evaluated the impact of different saleable products (mineral concentrate, mixed rare earth carbonate precipitates, and separated REE hydrates, oxides and carbonates) and

different  mining  and  milling  rates.  SRK  generated  and  evaluated  dozens  of  mine  plans  under different pricing assumptions to arrive at a go-forward scenario that became the basis of the PEA. The work was performed from July to October 2021. The scenario analysis is described further in Section 16.2.

The PEA refined the mine plan and costing of the go-forward scenario. This work was completed in October and November 2021. The PEA described herein is preliminary in nature and is partly based on inferred mineral resources that are considered too speculative geologically to have the economic considerations applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves,  and  there  is  no  certainty  that  the  preliminary  assessment  based  on  these  mineral resources will be realized.

The mineral resource for Wicheeda was updated in advance of the scenario analysis and PEA. The mineral resource statement reported herein is a collaborative effort between APEX Geoscience Ltd. (APEX) and SRK personnel. SRK's qualified person (QP), Mr. Deiss, assumes responsibility for  the  mineral resources estimate.  The geostatistical analysis, variography and grade models were completed by APEX during April to June 2021.

The technical report was assembled in Vancouver during the months of November and December 2021.

## 2.4 Basis of Technical Report

This report is based on information collected during two site visits by SRK QPs (Section 2.6) and on  additional  information  provided  by  Defense  Metals  throughout  the  course  of  SRK's  QPs' investigations.  Other  information  was  obtained  from  APEX,  (geology,  exploration,  resource estimation),  SGS  (metallurgical  testing),  Adamas  Intelligence  (price  forecasts),  and  the  public domain. SRK's QPs have no reason to doubt the reliability of the information provided by Defense Metals.

Where QPs are not specifically named in the report and 'SRK QP' is used, this refers to those listed in Table 2-1 for the relevant report sections.

## 2.6 Site Visit

In accordance with National Instrument 43-101 guidelines, AndrÃ© M. Deiss (mineral resources QP) and Anoush Ebrahimi (mining QP) visited the Wicheeda property separately on October 5-6, 2021 and October 26-27, 2021, respectively. They were each accompanied by APEX employee, Mo Asmail.

The purpose of the site visits was to review the regional setting, terrain, drill hole core, geological quality control and quality assurance (QA/QC) and ongoing exploration activities. Mr. Deiss also conducted check sampling of drill hole core and coarse rejects..

The SRK QPs were given full access to relevant data, and they conducted interviews with Defense Metals and APEX personnel to obtain information on the past exploration work, to understand procedures used to collect, record, store and analyze historical and current exploration data.

## 2.7 Acknowledgement

SRK  would  like  to  acknowledge  the  support  and  collaboration  provided  by  Defense  Metals personnel for this assignment. Their collaboration was greatly appreciated and instrumental to the success of this project.

## 2.8 Declaration

SRK's QPs' opinions contained herein and effective November 7, 2021, are based on information collected by the QPs throughout the course of their investigations, which in turn reflect various technical and economic conditions at the time of writing. Given the nature of the mining business, these conditions can change significantly over relatively short periods of time. Consequently, actual results may be significantly more or less favourable.

This report may include technical information that requires subsequent calculations to derive subtotals, totals and weighted averages. Such calculations inherently involve a degree of rounding and consequently introduce a margin of error. Where these occur, the SRK QPs do not consider them to be material.

The SRK QPs are not insiders, or associates of Defense Metals, nor is SRK an affiliate, and neither SRK nor any affiliate  or  its  QPs  named  herein  have  acted  as  advisors  to  Defense  Metals,  its subsidiaries or its affiliates in connection with this project. The results of the technical review by SRK's QPs are not dependent on any prior agreements concerning the conclusions to be reached, nor are there any undisclosed understandings concerning any future business dealings.

## 3 Reliance on Other Experts

The SRK QPs have not performed an independent verification of land title and tenure information as summarized in Section 4 of this report. SRK QPs did not verify the legality of any underlying agreement(s) that may exist concerning the permits or other agreement(s) between third parties, but have relied on the Province of British Columbia's 'Mineral Titles Online' website (https://www.mtonline.gov.bc.ca/mtov/home.do).  As  of  Dec.  23,  2021,  the  six  mineral  claims comprising the Wicheeda property were shown to be active, in good standing and owned 100% by Spectrum. An additional mineral claim issued in the name of Kristopher J. Raffle, a Director of the Defense Metals, is beneficially owned by Defense Metals. This information is relied upon in the ownership description in Section 4.1 of the report.

SRK's QP for marketing has relied on a REE price forecast by Adamas Intelligence that was specific to the potential products at Wicheeda. This is discussed in Section 19.

SRK was informed by Defense Metals that there are no known litigations potentially affecting the Wicheeda project.

## 4 Property Description and Location

This section is largely replicated from the previous NI43-101 report (Raffle and Nicholls, 2020). Only a recent addition to the mineral claims and an update on agreement commitments differ.

## 4.1 Description and Location

The  Wicheeda  project  is  located  at  Wicheeda  Lake,  approximately  80  km  northeast  of  Prince George and 50 km east of Bear Lake, BC (Figure 4-1). The Property is situated within the 1:20,000 scale  British  Columbia  Geological  Survey  ('BCGS')  map  sheet  93J060  and  is  centered  at approximately latitude 54Â° 31' 48' N and longitude 122Â° 05' 12' W. The claims cover Wicheeda Lake and straddle a segment of Wichcika Creek. The principal area of interest, the Wicheeda Carbonatite, is centred between Wicheeda Lake and the Wichcika gravel pit.

The  property  is  comprised  of  seven  contiguous  mineral  claims,  covering  2,008  ha  within  the Cariboo Mining Division (Table 4.1; Figure 4.2). The claims are registered on the Province of British Columbia's Mineral Titles Online ('MTO') website and are listed as 100%-owned by Spectrum and Kristopher John Raffle. The individual claims and their respective anniversary dates are listed in Table 4-1.

## 4.2 Royalties and Agreements

The  project  is  subject  to  an  option  agreement  dated  November  22,  2018  ('Option  Agreement Effective  Date'),  whereby  Spectrum  and  its  shareholders  (collectively  the  'Vendors')  granted Defense Metals an option ('the Option') to acquire ownership of the original six Wicheeda project claims. In order to exercise the Option and to maintain good standing, Defense Metals is required to:

- (a) incur expenditures totaling $1,930,000 as follows:
- (i) $680,000 within 12 months of the Option Agreement Effective Date (met);
- (ii) an additional $625,000 within 24 months of the Option Agreement Effective Date (met) ; and
- (iii) an additional $625,000 within 36 months of the Option Agreement Effective Date (met) ;
- (b) pay to Spectrum:
- (i) $25,000 in cash during the negotiation of this Agreement (met), such funds to be utilized by Spectrum to expend approximately $70,000 of the $120,000 to be advanced to it by Defense Metals as provided to partially finance the collection of approximately thirty (30) tonnes of potential mill feed from the Property for sampling at the SGS laboratory in Peterborough, Ontario (met)
- (ii) $95,000 in cash within five (5) business days of the Option Agreement Effective Date (met)
- (iii) $50,000 in cash on or before the first anniversary of the Option Agreement Effective Date (met)
- (iv) $100,000 in cash on or before the second anniversary of the Option Agreement Effective Date (met)
- (v) $100,000 in cash on or before the third anniversary of the Option Agreement Effective Date (met)
- (c) issue to Spectrum:
- (i) 200,000 common shares of Defense Metals on the Option Agreement Effective Date (met)
- (ii) $50,000 in common shares of Defense Metals on or before the first anniversary of the Effective Date (met).

With respect to items (a) through (c), Defense Metals has exceeded the exploration expenditure requirements prior to the third anniversary of the agreement through the completion of multiple resource  definition  diamond  drill  programs,  MREs,  and  metallurgical  testwork  programs. Defense Metals has met all other cash payments and share issuances required to be advanced to Spectrum as of the effective date of this report.

From the date the expenditures, cash payment, and share payments were fulfilled, Defense Metals earned the right for a period of 90 , to exercise the Option (the 'Exercise Period') by written notice to  Spectrum  within  the  Exercise  Period  (the  'Exercise  Notice').  If  within  the  Exercise  Period Defense Metals delivers the Exercise Notice to Spectrum, it shall have exercised the Option and be deemed to have acquired registered and beneficial ownership of all of the Spectrum shares, and Defense Metals shall forthwith:

- (d)  issue to the Vendors on a pro rata basis, such number of common shares of Defense Metals equal to 49% of the aggregate of the following:
- (i) (the issued and outstanding common shares of the Defense Metals at the time of issuance of these common shares; plus
- (ii) the common shares of Defense Metals to be issued
- (e)  pay to the Vendors on a pro rata basis, a cash payment in the aggregate of $100,000. In the event Defense Metals exercises the Option and acquires an indirect 100% right, title and interest in and to the project, the Vendors shall thereafter be entitled to a 2.0% Net Smelter Returns royalty  ('NSR  Royalty')  with  respect  to  the  project,  payable  upon  the commencement of Commercial Production. Defense Metals has the right to purchase onehalf (1/2) of the NSR Royalty from the Vendors, also on a basis pro rata to their current shareholdings in Spectrum (being 1.0% of Net Smelter Returns) for $1,000,000, leaving the Vendors with an aggregate 1.0% NSR Royalty.

## 4.3 Community and Local Relations

Traditional lands of the McLeod Lake Indian Band ('MLIB') overlap the project. During 2020 and 2021, Defense Metals conducted several introductory information-sharing virtual meetings with the MLIB regarding its proposed exploration programs. The authors are not aware of any agreements that have been negotiated between Spectrum or Defense Metals and the MLIB. The authors are not aware of any other encumbrances, or potential encumbrances, that would negatively impact the future exploration of the project. In future, as the Wicheeda project advances, a Memorandum of Understanding agreement may be required with the MLIB.

## 4.4 Environmental Liabilities, Permitting and Significant Factors

The Wicheeda project currently has an active multi-year  permit  (Permit  MX-13-168),  issued  to Spectrum by the British Columbia Ministry of Energy and Mines ('BCMEM'). The permit approves mineral  exploration  work  on  the  Property  including  camp  building,  fuel  storage,  and  diamond drilling. Permit MX-13-168 was originally issued on September 18, 2008 and amendments were approved on February 26, 2019. The permit is valid until February 25, 2024.

Reclamation security funds totalling $19,000 were posted by Spectrum to be held under Permit MX-13-168 by the British Columbia Minister of Finance. The reclamation funds will only be released upon  reclamation  of  the  project  and  when  all  conditions  of  the  permit  are  met  in  a  manner satisfactory to the Chief Inspector of Mines.

No surface rights are held by either Spectrum or Defense Metals or, to the authors' knowledge, by any other parties. Should the project advance to the mining stage, Defense Metals will be required to  obtain  all  necessary  surface  rights  by  way  of  filing  an  application  for  mining  leases  for  the construction and operation of a mine on the project.

There are no known environmental liabilities associated with the project as a result of any previous exploration.

With respect to environmental and permitting risk and uncertainty the area surrounding Wicheeda Lake is known to have high recreational and ecological values, including native trout stocks in the lake.  The  lake  and  surrounding area is currently covered under recreational reserve REC6837 (Figure 4-2).

As of May 20, 2020 the BC Ministry of Forests Land and Natural Resource (FLNR) indicated that given its current priorities and capacity there is no intent to establish a recreation site at Wicheeda Lake in the near future.

At present there are no restrictions on mineral exploration activities within REC6837. During 2009 five diamond drill holes were completed within REC6837. Recreation reserves are map notations or  'an  indication  of  interests'  without  any  legal  designation,  as  opposed  to  legally  established recreational sites having specification of, or restriction against, permitted or specific uses. However, FLNR  has  requested  that  Defense  Metals  take  all  possible  steps  to  minimize  the  impacts  of exploration to the recreational ecological values associated with Wicheeda Lake.

## 5 Accessibility,  Climate,  Local  Resources,  Infrastructure and Physiography

This section is replicated, with the exception of sub-section 5.3, from the previous NI43-101 report (Raffle and Nicholls, 2020). Minor edits have been applied.

## 5.1 Accessibility

The  Wicheeda  project  is  located  at  Wicheeda  Lake,  approximately  80  km  northeast  of  Prince George and 50 km east of Bear Lake in the Cariboo region of British Columbia. Access to the Property from Prince George is facilitated via Provincial Highway 97 and two all-season gravel forest service roads. From Prince George, access is north on Highway 97 for approximately 80 km to the turn-off for the Chuchinka Forest Service Road (FSR), located just south of the community of Bear Lake. From there, access is east on the Chuchinka FSR to the Wichcika FSR; then south on the Wichcika FSR to the Wichcika gravel pit. The gravel pit was used as an equipment staging area and as a camp site during the 2019 drilling program. A cut trail, approximately 1,300 m in length, links the gravel pit and areas of diamond drilling.

## 5.2 Local Resources and Infrastructure

The property is located about 50 km east of a major paved provincial highway, the CN rail mainline, a  natural  gas  pipeline  and  a  power  transmission  line.  A  dormant  three-line  sawmill,  located immediately east of Highway 97 near its junction with the Chuchinka FSR, has adequate electric power,  a  railway  siding,  and  nearby  gas  pipeline  that  could  be  utilized  for  Wicheeda  project development.

The city of Prince George, BC, known as the 'Northern Capital of British Columbia', is located 80 km southwest of the project. The area's population of approximately 74,000 could provide a ready, nearby workforce. All goods and services required by the project, including industry services such  as  laboratory  services,  mining  equipment,  drilling  contractors,  skilled  labour  and  supply dealerships, are available in Prince George. The community of Bear Lake (population 151), located 50 km west of the property, has a small motel, convenience store and gas station, and may be a source for local labourers.

Daily  commercial air  service  is  available  between  Prince  George  and  Vancouver,  BC.  Multiple direct flights are available each week between Prince George and several destinations including Victoria, BC, Calgary, AB, and Edmonton, AB. Helicopter charter services are available year-round in Prince George.

## 5.3 Climate and Hydrology

The climate of the  project  area  is  typical  of  northern  continental  areas,  characterized  by  large seasonal  temperature  differences,  with  warm  to  hot  summers  and  cold  winters.  Climate characterization was completed using daily historical climate data for the project location using the

ClimateBC webtool and data from 1991 to 2019 (Wang et al, 2016) as well as point precipitation records from Prince George.

ClimateBC is a program to generate high-resolution climate data for climate change studies and applications  in  British  Columbia  and  western  North  America.  The  program  combines  historical climate records from Environment Canada and Climate Change with satellite climate data from PRISM and global circulation models to calculate gridded annual and seasonal climate for historical  and  future  conditions.  Datasets are downscaled using elevation adjustments into scale-free point data. The effects of climate change were considered using the ensemble global circulation  models  from  the  Coupled  Model  Intercomparison  project  version  6  (CMIP6)  for  the projection period between 2040 and 2070.

## 5.3.1 Temperature

Climate data indicate that temperatures have historically varied from an average of 14Â°C in July, the warmest month, to -8 Â°C in January, the coldest month, with an annual mean temperature of 2.4 Â°C. Increased temperatures are expected year-round with climate change. Figure 5-1 presents the monthly average temperature from historical data as well as three projections (low, medium and  high)  with  the  effects  of  climate  change  which  represent  three  shared  socioeconomic pathways.

Figure 5-1: Monthly average temperature based on historical data and climate change projections

<!-- image -->

## 5.3.2 Precipitation

The area has historically averaged 914 mm of precipitation annually with approximately 368 mm falling as snow from September through April (Wang et al, 2016). Climate change has the potential to increase precipitation rates year-round, with more precipitation falling as rain than historically observed. Figure 5-2 presents the monthly average precipitation from historical data as well as three projections with the effects of climate change.

Figure 5-2: Monthly average precipitation based on historical data and climate change projections

<!-- image -->

Short-duration precipitation events were characterized based on intensity-duration-frequency data for Prince George. The IDF-CC webtool (ICLR, 2021) was used to download both historical rainfall intensity  data  as  well  as  climate  change  adjusted  intensity  data  based  on  the  CMIP6  shared socioeconomic  pathway  3.70  (moderate  emissions  case).  The  rainfall  intensity  data  for  Prince George with climate change includes up to the 1 in 100-year return period and was extrapolated to include the 200-year and 500-year return period results. Longer duration events, including the 48hour  and  72-hour  rainfall  depths,  were  developed  based  on  the  Prince  George  Environment Canada rainfall depth duration data.

The  Probable  Maximum  Precipitation  (PMP)  was  estimated  using  the  Met  Portal  for  British Columbia  (DTN  2021).  This  webtool  provides  initial  estimates  of  the  PMP  across  a  grid  of transposition points across the province. The 24-hour PMP for an area less than 10 km 2  is 176 mm, and the 72-hour PMP is 308 mm in the vicinity of the project.

## 5.3.3 Potential Evaporation

Potential evaporation rates in the area have historically averaged 505 mm annually (Wang et al, 2016). Climate change has the potential to increase potential evaporation rates in summer months. Figure  5-3  presents  the  monthly  potential  evaporation  from  historical  data  as  well  as  three projections with the effects of climate change.

Figure 5-3: Monthly average evaporation based on historical data and climate change projections

## 5.4 Site Topography, Elevation and Vegetation

The Wicheeda project is located on the eastern flank of the Rocky Mountains, on the edge of the Central Interior Plateau in east central BC. The Property is characterized by subdued terrain in the southeast, moderate-steep hills in the north, and steep to cliffy topography in the east. Elevations range between 900 m and 1,520 m AMSL. Outcrops are sparse within the Property, even in hilly areas.

The area is covered with stands of alder and pine with variably thick undergrowth, or by logged areas. Forest plantations, buck brush and devil's club occur at lower elevations.

## 6 History

This  section  is  replicated  from  the  previous  NI43-101  report  (Raffle  and  Nicholls,  2020),  but includes updated figures and some content re-structuring.

## 6.1 Property History - Early Exploration

A regional aeromagnetic survey of the area, completed in 1961 by the Geophysics Division of the Geological  Survey  of  Canada,  identified  a  magnetic  high  feature  in  the  area  of  the  Wicheeda project.  Prospecting  of  the  area  in  1976  and  1977  by  Kol  Lovang  identified  minor  base  metal showings, which covered two mineral claims. No follow-up work was completed, and the claims were allowed to lapse. However, later assaying of Lovang's samples by Teck Explorations Limited ('Teck') revealed anomalous niobium (Betmanis, 1987), and Teck subsequently entered into a prospecting agreement with Lovang in early 1986 (Betmanis, 1987).

## 6.2 Property History - Teck Explorations Limited

Teck staked its initial claims in April 1986 and proceeded with a helicopter-supported stream silt geochemical survey of Wichcika Creek drainage. This work identified several anomalies, resulting in additional claims being staked (Betmanis, 1987).

Within  the  claim  group,  Teck  delineated  six  grids  (Lake,  George,  D,  F,  and  Prince  Grids)  for reconnaissance work. Only the 'Lake' and 'George' grids are covered by the extent of the current claims Figure 6-1).

Additional  exploration  completed  in  1986  and  1987  consisted  of  soil  and  rock  geochemical sampling,  geological  mapping,  trenching  and  ground  magnetic  surveying  (Betmanis,  1988  and 1987). Results from the soil geochemical surveys indicated a linear carbonatitic intrusion and a small syenite body hosted by limestone and calcareous fine-grained sedimentary rocks over a total strike  length  of  7  km  (Betmanis,  1987)  contained  within  the  'Lake'  and  'George'  grids.  Rock geochemical sampling and bedrock mapping led to additional claims being staked during 1986 as the location of intrusive zones became better defined (Betmanis, 1987).

Pronounced cerium in soil geochemical anomalies partially cover both the 'Lake' and 'George' grid areas. Locally, these anomalies coincide with barium and niobium highs and reflect the underlying intrusive rock. Intensely oxidized, coarse grained calcite carbonatite and fine-grained pyrochlorebearing, pink calcite carbonatite was identified in trenches at the 'Lake' grid by Greenwood and Mader (1988). Ground magnetometer surveys outlined modest magnetic highs on both grids that are thought to be reflective of relatively narrow dikes that may or may not be genetically related to the intrusive carbonatites (Betmanis, 1987).

Follow-up work outlined a deeply weathered carbonatite of unknown dimensions on the 'Lake' grid (Mader and Greenwood, 1988); and a semi-circular body of carbonatite, measuring about 250 m

across,  on  the  'George'  grid  (Lovang  and  Meyer,  1988).  A  circular  thorium  (Th)  radiometric anomaly, roughly 500 m in diameter, was found to coincide with the 'George' grid carbonatite and additional thorium radiometric anomalies 100- 200 m across followed a southeasterly trend (Lovang and Meyer, 1988; Mader and Greenwood, 1988). Soil geochemistry on the 'George' grid estimated the  circular  intrusive  body  at  approximately  400  m  in  diameter.  One  or  more  narrow  dike-like carbonatite bodies were located south of 'George' grid (Lovang and Meyer, 1988; Minfile 093J 014) partially covering the southern portion of the project area.

Lovang and Meyer (1987) found the carbonatites were generally anomalous in light rare earth elements (LREE) and niobium. A limited hand trenching program on the 'George' grid yielded encouraging values of lanthanum (La), neodymium (Nd) and cerium (Ce), modest values of niobium and yttrium, and anomalous values of samarium (Sm) and europium (Eu). Values for the principal LREE ranged from 202 to &gt;1000 ppm La, from 104 to &gt;1000 ppm Nd, and from 254 to &gt;10000 ppm Ce over sample lengths of 2-10 m and an aggregate sample length of 87 m in three trenches spaced across the carbonatite body (Lovang and Meyer, 1987).

The claims were later allowed to lapse, and the area was subsequently re-staked in March 2001 by Mr. Chris Graf. Mr. Graf, a principle of Spectrum Mining Corporation, did not conduct any work of significance on the claims, and in September 2008, he transferred ownership of the claims to Spectrum.

## 6.3 Property History - Spectrum Mining Corporation

From late September to mid-October 2008, Spectrum completed four diamond drill holes (WI08-01 to WI08-04) with an aggregate length of 866 m within the 'George' grid area (Lane, 2009; Figure 6.2). The holes were drilled from a single helicopter-supported drill pad and included one vertical hole and three inclined holes drilled on different azimuths. Each drill hole was collared in intrusive carbonatite  and  confirmed  the  presence  of  a  LREE-bearing  dolomite  carbonatite  body  of significance that outcrops on a west-facing slope 1 km south of Wicheeda Lake. Due to the limited amount of drilling, the overall geometry of the Wicheeda Carbonatite was not resolved; however, the 2008 campaign established an eastern structural footwall to the zone. The western, northern, southern and depth components remained open (Lane, 2009).

The Wicheeda Carbonatite was found to contain significant concentrations of the LREE, cerium (Ce), lanthanum (La), and neodymium (Nd) as well as anomalous concentrations of Nb, Pr, Y, As, Ba, Mo, Mn, Pb, Sr, and Th (Lane, 2009). Significant weighted averages (XRF data) for selected drill hole are presented in Table 6-1.

In 2009, Spectrum completed 15 additional drill holes (WI09-05 to WI09-20), totaling 1824 m (Lane, 2010; Table 6-1; Figure 6-2). Ten holes tested the Wicheeda Carbonatite from two different setups  (sites  A  and  B),  two  holes  were  drilled  northwest  of  previous  sites  to  intersect  a  small

carbonatite dike that outcrops on a trail leading to Wicheeda Lake (site C), and three holes tested a REE soil anomaly located northwest of site C and southwest of Wicheeda Lake (site D). All ten holes drilled on the Wicheeda Carbonatite intersected significant intervals of REE-bearing dolomite Â± calcite carbonatite from surface to variable depths (Table 6-1). The highest REE values correlated with dolomite carbonatite, dolomite carbonatite breccia and calcite carbonatite. To a lesser degree, high  REE  values  also  occurred  in  syenite  breccia  (later  recognized  as  fenite)  where  dolomite carbonatite, as matrix to clasts of syenite (fenite), formed &gt;50% of the rock mass (Lane, 2010).

Drill site C was positioned on a small knoll approximately 550 m south of the south end of Wicheeda Lake near an access trail that leads to the lake. Two holes targeted a narrow carbonatite dike that outcrops  on  the  trail,  one  of  which  intersected  27.20  m  of  dolomite  carbonatite  similar  to  that observed at the Main Zone. Only core from drill hole WI09-19 was sampled; while the carbonatite dike intersected was visually similar to that of the Main Zone, the former returned only weakly elevated concentrations of lanthanum with an individual high value of 523 ppm La over 3.0 m (Lane, 2010).

Drill site D was located 315 m southwest of the south end of Wicheeda Lake near an old Teck trench. Three holes were drilled from this site to evaluate a REE soil geochemical anomaly. Each drill hole (WI09-15 to WI09-17) intersected calcite carbonatite and breccia that was consistently elevated in lanthanum. Hole WI09-15 averaged 345 ppm La over 96.00 m; hole WI09-16 averaged 307 ppm La over 91.71 m, and hole WI09-17 averaged 307 ppm La over 146.30 m (Lane, 2010).

During the same year, a bench scale heavy liquid - magnetic separation was performed on a composite  sample  from  the  Wicheeda  Lake  carbonatite  to  separate  minerals  and  produce  a concentrate comparable to other well-known REE deposits around the world. The study achieved a high grade REE concentrate comparable with the Mianning bastnÃ¤site-bearing carbonatite ore from Sichuan, China (Mariano, 2009).

In 2010, Spectrum contracted Hendex Exploration Limited of Prince George to conduct a GPScontrolled soil sampling survey over a 5.5 km 2  area measuring approximately 2300 m north-south by 2200 m east-west (Graf, 2011; Figure 6.3). The survey covered the Wicheeda Carbonatite as well as other targets to the northwest that were drilled in 2009. A total of 977 soil samples were collected at stations spaced 50 m apart along east-west lines spaced 100 m apart. The survey data outlined three significant multi-element soil geochemical anomalies on the project: the Wicheeda Carbonatite soil anomaly, the Southwest soil anomaly, and the Northwest soil anomaly. Results from the Wicheeda Carbonatite anomaly indicated a strong correlation between cerium, lanthanum, yttrium, niobium, thorium, lead, manganese, molybdenum, iron and phosphorous (Graf, 2011).

The  Wicheeda  Carbonatite  is  outlined  by  the  approximately  coincident  contours  of  cerium (&gt;400 ppm), lanthanum (&gt;200 ppm), yttrium (&gt;25 ppm), niobium (&gt;100 ppm), thorium (&gt;100 ppm), lead  (&gt;100  ppm),  phosphorous  (&gt;2000  ppm),  molybdenum  (&gt;10  ppm),  barium  (&gt;2000  ppm), manganese (&gt;2000 ppm) and iron (&gt;50,000 ppm). The Wicheeda Carbonatite multi-element soil anomaly consists of a higher value north-south trending core area roughly 400 m long and 200 m wide east-west with a narrower northeast-trending (015Â° azimuth) extension that is 300 m long and 100 m wide. The entire multi-element anomaly extends from line 29+00N to 36+00N and is 700 m long by 100-200 m wide (Graf, 2011). The highest niobium and thorium values are restricted to the core area of the soil anomaly and are significantly lower along the northeast extension.

<!-- image -->

A second coincident multi-element soil geochemical anomaly lies 300 m southwest of the Wicheeda Carbonatite  anomaly  on  the  same  (195Â°  azimuth)  orientation  as  the  northeast  (015Â°  azimuth) extension of the Main zone anomaly. This Southwest soil anomaly is outlined by the approximately coincident contours for cerium (400 ppm), lanthanum (200 ppm), yttrium (30 ppm), niobium (40 ppm), thorium (30 ppm), lead (50 ppm), phosphorous (1000 ppm), molybdenum (4 ppm), barium (1,000 ppm), Manganese (1,000 ppm) and iron (40,000 ppm) and extends in a northwest direction from line 24+00N to 29+00N. The southwest anomaly is 500 m long by 50-150 m wide. The location of the southwest soil anomaly directly along strike with the northeast extension of the Wicheeda Carbonatite  anomaly  suggests  that  it  may  represent  a  southwest  extension  of  the  Wicheeda Carbonatite body.

A third coincident multi-element soil geochemical anomaly occurs roughly 400 m northwest of the Wicheeda Carbonatite soil anomaly. This Northwest soil anomaly is outlined by the approximately coincident contours for cerium (&gt;200 ppm), lanthanum (&gt;100 ppm), yttrium (&gt;15 ppm), niobium (&gt;100 ppm), thorium (&gt;30 ppm), lead (&gt;50 ppm), phosphorous (1500 ppm), molybdenum (&gt;4 ppm), barium (&gt;1,000 ppm), manganese (&gt;1,000 ppm) and iron (&gt;40,000 ppm). The niobium values of the Northwest soil anomaly are as elevated as the niobium values in the Wicheeda Carbonatite soil anomaly; however, the cerium and lanthanum values are more subdued. This contrasts with the Wicheeda Carbonatite anomaly that has extremely elevated cerium and lanthanum values. The Northwest niobium anomaly (&gt;100 ppm) contour is much larger than the Wicheeda Carbonatite niobium anomaly, measuring 600 m long north-south by 50-400 m wide east-west within a &gt;40 ppm niobium anomaly that is 1100 m long north-south by 400 m to 700 m wide east-west. Additionally, the  niobium  values  are  consistently  more  elevated  with  a  peak  value  of  901  ppm.  There  is  a narrower multi- element soil anomaly along the west side of the Northwest soil anomaly that may represent a separate mineralized carbonatite dike or sill emanating from a larger carbonatite body that may underlie the larger soil anomaly. It is 300-500 m long by 50-100 m wide and has peak values of 1,893 ppm niobium, 1,512 ppm cerium and 915 ppm lanthanum.

In June 2010, Spectrum submitted two composite samples from drill core, a Syenite Breccia (SB) and a Dolomite Carbonatite (DC), to the mineralogy department of SGS at Lakefield, Ontario, to determine the overall mineral assemblage and textural characteristics in each sample, and the liberation/association of the REE carriers (SGS, 2010). The mineralogical study of the samples identified dolomite, ankerite and K-feldspar as the dominant minerals and Ce carbonate/oxides, monazite and columbite as the main REE minerals. Liberation analysis indicates monazite and cerium carbonate/oxides are well liberated at 67 to 86% in the SB and DC samples respectively, where the liberation of monazite (79%) and Ce-carbonate/oxides (86%) are higher in DC by 12% than that of the SB composite. The REE grade averaged between 48 to 56% with recoveries of 72 to 92% (SB, coarse fraction); 85 to 96% (DC, coarse fraction) and up to 97% for fine fractions for both composite (SGS, 2010).

## 6.4 Property History - Spectrum Metallurgical Testwork

Exploratory  metallurgical  testwork  has  been  carried  out  on  Wicheeda  mineralized  dolomitecarbonatite by SGS in 2011 and 2012 using a representative composite sample created with core collected from seven separate drill holes at varying depths.

Prior  to  conducting  the  flotation  testwork,  SGS  carried  out  a  high  definition  ('QEMSCAN') mineralogical study of the drill core composite sample that identified the rare earth minerals as bastnÃ¤site and monazite and the main thorium mineral as thorite (SGS, 2010).

In 2011, Spectrum commissioned SGS to complete a testwork program to investigate the direct flotation of REO on samples from the Wicheeda Carbonatite (SGS, 2011). The laboratory work achieved a concentrate grade of 42% TREO and an average recovery of 83% (Table 6-2) (SGS, 2011).

Table 6-2: Locked cycle test recoveries

| REE   |   Recovery to Concentrate (%) |
|-------|-------------------------------|
| Ce    |                          82.5 |
| La    |                          84.6 |
| Nd    |                          83.8 |

In  2012, SGS conducted hydrometallurgical testwork on a composite of the Wicheeda flotation concentrates they had produced and then developed a conceptual hydrometallurgical flow sheet consisting  of  pre-leaching,  roasting,  leaching  and  precipitation  tests.  The  flotation  concentrate composite  grade  was  39.7%  TREO,  which  through  pre-leaching  was  upgraded  to  67%  TREO material and that in turn was further upgraded to 71% TREO by roasting the pre-leach residue. The hydrometallurgical tests were successful in removing 98% of the thorium from the concentrate (SGS, 2012).

Additional details regarding mineral processing and metallurgical testing are discussed in Section 13.

## 6.5 Third-Party Regional Airborne Radiometric and Magnetic Surveys

In 2011, Bolero Resources Corporation conducted a helicopter-borne radiometric and magnetic gradiometer survey over its vast Carbonatite Syndicate Property that encompassed the project (Koffyberg and Gilmour, 2012, Figure 6.4). The survey was flown over a portion of the project and outlined  a  potentially  significant  500  m  long  by  200  m  wide  radiometric  anomaly  inside  the southeastern most corner of the Wicheeda claims. There is incomplete soil sample coverage in this area, however, the existing soil sample data indicates that a multi-element geochemical anomaly may extend into this area and is potentially 400 m long.

The strongest airborne magnetic anomaly on the project trends in a northwest direction and is 600 m long by 200 m wide. This anomaly may be the expression of a magnetite-bearing syenitic intrusion(s) (Bird et al., 2019).

## 6.6 Property History - Academic Studies

Two academic studies were completed on the Wicheeda Carbonatite in 2014. One study focused on the nature and origin of the deposit; the principal results were:

- Â· The carbonatite comprises a dolomitic core and a thin outer calcitic facies.
- Â· BastnÃ¤site-(Ce) and subordinate monazite-(Ce) are the main REE minerals.
- Â· The REE mineralization was the product of magmatic hydrothermal fluids which also fenitized the surrounding metasedimentary rocks (Trofanenko et al., 2014).

The other study evaluated the application of portable XRF as an exploration tool for REE-enriched carbonatites.  It  concluded,  based  on  the  mineralogy  of  the  Wicheeda  carbonatite  complex (detectable concentrations of Nb, Ta, La, Ce, Pr, Nd, and Y), that monazite, REE-fluorocarbonates and carbonates, and pyrochlore (Â± columbite) are prospective indicator minerals  for  Wicheeda carbonatite-type REE deposits (Mackay and Simandl, 2014).

## 7 Geological Setting and Mineralization

This  section  is  largely  extracted  and  adapted  from  the  previous  NI43-101  report  (Raffle  and Nicholls, 2020) .

## 7.1 Regional Geology

The Wicheeda property is located in the Foreland Belt, a morpho geological belt of imbricated and folded miogeoclinal rocks that forms the eastern mountain ranges and foothills of the Canadian Cordillera (Gabrielse et al., 1991).

The regional geology of the area was mapped by Armstrong et al. (1969, McLeod Lake map sheet) and Taylor and Scott (1979, Monkman Pass map sheet). The regional geology map presented in Figure 7-1 is from a 1:250,000 scale digital compilation of the area (Digital Geology Map of British Columbia, BC MEMPR, Open file 2005-2).

The bedrock underlying the Wicheeda property and enclosing areas consists mainly of limestone, marble, siltstone, argillite and calcareous sedimentary rocks that have been assigned to the upper Cambrian to lower Ordovician Kechika Group. The strata generally strike 120-140Â°, with steep dips to the northwest or southeast. East of the property, rocks of the Kechika Group are in fault contact with  unassigned  carbonates,  slates  and  siltstones  of  Cambrian  to  Devonian  age.  West  of  the property,  rocks  of  the  Kechika  Group  are  in  fault  contact  with  quartzite  rocks  of  the  Upper Proterozoic  to  Permian  Gog  Group  and  an  unassigned  felsic  volcanic-dominated  package  of Devonian to Permian age.

The northwest-trending Rocky Mountain Trench, which follows the Parsnip River valley east of the Property, is the dominant structural and geographical feature in the area. Several major northwest trending faults occur in the area. One such structure is shown to transect the property and intersects a northeast trending fault near the area of interest.

In BC, a small number of carbonatite-related complexes occur. These complexes are typically subcircular  to  elongate  in  plan  and  commonly have well-developed metasomatic alteration haloes. Many  of  the  intrusions  that  follow  the  trend  of  the  Rocky  Mountain  Trench  are  Devonian  Mississippian in age (Pell, 1987). They were subjected to sub-greenschist facies metamorphism during the Columbian orogeny but behaved as inflexible and cohesive bodies during orogenesis and were rotated, tilted and/or transported eastwards in thrust panels (Pell, 1987).

## 7.2 Property Geology

Limited areas of the Wicheeda claim group have been covered by reconnaissance and/or gridbased bedrock mapping. The REE-enriched carbonatites located at the project are part of a narrow elongate, south-trending intrusive carbonatite-syenite complex cutting or occupying a structural panel within calcareous siltstones and limestones of the Cambrian to Ordovician Kechika Group. Some of the geological contacts observed in core are intrusive while others are almost certainly structural. The carbonatite complex extends southward from the south end of Wicheeda Lake for approximately 13 km.

Outcrop on a moderately steep, west-facing slope south of Wicheeda Lake, an area that coincides with part of the former 'George' grid, consists of a sequence of interbedded limestone, calcareous argillite and argillite with consistent northwest-trending attitudes and sub-vertical dips (Betmanis, 1987). A small intrusion cuts the sedimentary rocks in the southern part of the grid, just north of 'A' Creek. This feature was mapped as syenite in 1986 by Betmanis (1987), although during a reevaluation of the area (including trenching) the following year, it was concluded that the intrusion was a carbonatite (Lovang and Meyer, 1988).

Three types of narrow (0.5 m to 1.5 m), northwest-trending dikes were also observed in the gridded area, including: a K-feldspar phyric type with a fine-grained albite matrix and abundant Fe-rich biotite;  a  blue  sodalite-rich  (as  phenocrysts and matrix) type, and; a feldspar and augite-phyric intermediate type with aphanitic groundmass that appears to be the youngest of the three varieties (Mader and Greenwood, 1988).

Outcrop in the area covered by the former 'Lake' grid is rare, but consists of strongly weathered, medium to coarse-grained calcite carbonatite, a band of fresh, fine-grained calcite carbonatite and related syenite were exposed in trenches (Mader and Greenwood, 1988).

## 7.3 Wicheeda Carbonatite and Mineralization

The Wicheeda Carbonatite is comprised mainly of dolomite carbonatite (Figure 7.1), xenolithic dolomite  carbonatite  with  varieties  of  matrix  to  clast-supported  fenite  breccia  where  dolomite carbonatite  occurs  as  the  dominant  matrix  component,  and  minor  calcite  carbonatite.  This carbonatite  body  intrudes  into  syenite  and  minor  mafic  dikes,  limestone  and  calcareous sedimentary wall rocks. The upper part of the complex consists mainly of dolomite carbonatite, brecciated dolomite carbonatite and lesser calcite carbonatite with minor fenitized limestone, mafic dike and syenite xenoliths whereas the lower part of the complex is weakly constrained by drilling and mainly consists of xenolithic varieties of brecciated dolomite-carbonatite, fenitized limestone, syenite and country wall rocks.

The geometry of the Wicheeda Carbonatite was originally interpreted to be sub-circular in plan (Lovang and Meyer, 1988; Greenwood and Mader, 1988). Subsequent modeling of the carbonatite body following diamond drilling showed a more oblong or lens-shaped with a long axis that is approximately north-south (Lane, 2009; 2010), a subvertical dip and a plunge to the northwest. The main carbonatite body was intersected over the extent of 215 m thick and is in fault contact with unaltered  metasedimentary  rocks  of  the  Kechika  Group  on  its  western  edge,  and  in  intrusive

contact with fenitized argillaceous limestones of the Kechika Group on is eastern margin (Betmanis, 1987). As defined by drilling, the carbonatite body stretches over 360 m along a north-south strike, 160 m east-west width and up to 250 m deep in the central down-dip portion of the body.

In  their  study  of  the  Wicheeda  Carbonatite  on  the  Wicheeda  project,  Trofanenko  et  al.  (2016) proposed a preliminary model in which the carbonatite magma exsolved a fluid which fenitized the host metasediments near the intrusion to potassic fenite and heated formational water distal to the intrusion,  altering  the  metasedimentary  rocks  to  sodic  fenite.  The  REE  were  concentrated  by magmatic hydrothermal fluids, which partially dissolved the carbonatite, altered the dolomite, and lead to deposition of compositionally zoned dolomite and later bastnÃ¤site-(Ce) and monazite-(Ce) in veins and vugs in response to cooling and an increase in pH.

REE mineralization at the Wicheeda Carbonatite is zoned into high, moderate and low grade. High REE mineralization is directly related to dolomite-carbonatite, xenolithic dolomite carbonatite where country rock xenoliths are less than 20%, and around mafic dike xenoliths where columbite and pyrochlore  is  observed.  Moderate  REE  mineralization  is  typically  associated  with  mixed  zones where xenolithic dolomite carbonatite, fenitized limestone, syenite and mafic dike xenoliths exceed 30% and are less than 70%. These mixed zones have the potential to add size to the deposit with more  modest  grades.  Low  REE  mineralization  is  typically  encountered  in  fresh  and  fenitized limestone, calcareous sedimentary rocks, syenite and fresh, weakly brecciated mafic xenoliths.

Field observation of REE mineralization includes disseminated to clotty dark grey-bluish columbite, disseminated, inclusion and fractured pyrochlore, rare fluorite and sphene / rutile and a combination of bastnÃ¤site-parasite and monazite observed as aggregates and patches in veins and vugs. Veintype  mineralization  was  commonly  noted  in  amorphous  to  coarse-grained  dolomite-carbonate intersecting earlier fine-grained, dolomite carbonatite with disseminated  fine-grained REE mineralization  and  proximal  to  strongly  altered  -  brecciated  mafic  dike  xenoliths.  Vein-type mineralization range in width from a few centimeters to over a meter wide. On the other hand, vuggy and disseminated REE-mineralization was noted in all lithologies, except the fresh limestone and calcareous sedimentary rocks, in variable percentages throughout the drill core.

## 8 Deposit Types

This  section  is  largely  extracted  and  adapted  from  the  previous  NI43-101  report  (Raffle  and Nicholls, 2020) .

The principal  deposit-type  of  interest  on  the  Wicheeda  property  is  a  REE-enriched  carbonatite deposit.

Carbonatites and carbonatite-associated deposits are mined worldwide for REE and Nb, such as Bayan Obo mine, Inner Mongolia (Kynicky et al., 2012) and Araxa mine, Brazil (Biondi, 2005). Carbonatites  can  be  economic  targets  for  several  other  elements  and  mineral  commodities including F, P, Al, Fe, Ti, Zr, C, Cu, Ni, Au, PGE, Ta, Sr, U, Th, phlogopite, vermiculite, olivine, lime, and barite (Marioano, 1989; Pell, 1996).

Carbonatites  are  defined  by  the  International  Union  of  Geological  Sciences  (IUGS)  system  of igneous  rock  classification  as  having  more  than  50%  of  primary  carbonate  minerals  (such  as calcite, dolomite, and ankerite) and less than 20% SiO2 (Le Maitre, 2002).  Simandl and Paradis (2018) summarize the three main hypotheses regarding the origin of carbonatite melts:

- 1. Immiscible  separation  of  parental  carbonated  silicate  magmas  at  crustal  or  mantle pressures.
- 2. Crystal fractionation of parental carbonated silicate magmas such as olivine melilitites or kamafugites
- 3. Low-degree partial melting of carbonated mantle peridotite below 70 km depth

Hypotheses involving  a  possible  derivation  of  carbonatites  from  the  earth's  crust  (Lentz  1999; Ferrero et al. 2016) or from the earth's mantle with some crustal contribution (Cheng et al. 2017; Song et al 2017) have also been proposed.  It is likely that not all carbonate forming melts are of the same origin.

Most  carbonatites  and  alkaline-carbonatite  complexes  are  emplaced  in  continental  settings  in Archean and Proterozoic rocks, or in Phanerozoic rocks underlain by a Precambiran basement. They form in extensional tectonic settings along major linear trends related to large-scale intraplate fracture zones, in association with doming features or in relation to slab windows in subducting plates (Simandl and Paradis, 2018)

Birkett  and  Simandl  (1999)  provide  the  following  concise  description  of  carbonate  associated deposits.

Carbonatites are small, pipe-like bodies, dikes, sills, and small plugs or irregular masses.  The typical pipe-like bodies have subcircular or elliptical cross sections and are up to 3-4 km in diameter. Magmatic mineralization within pipe-like carbonatites is commonly found in crescent-shaped and steeply dipping zones, which metasomatic mineralization occurs as irregular forms or veins.  A fenitization halo (alkali metasomatized country rocks) commonly surrounds carbonatite intrusions. Alteration mineralogy depends largely on the composition of the host rock.  Typical minerals are sodic amphibolite, wollastonite, nepheline, mesopertheite, antiperthie, aegirine-augite, pale brown biotite, phlogopite and albite.  Desilisiciation with the addition of Fe3+ and K is also common.

The REE minerals form pockets and fill fractures within ferrocarbonaitite bodies.  Pyrochlore is disseminated; apatite can be disseminated or semi-massive; bastnÃ¤site occurs as disseminated to patchy accumulations; fluorite forms as veins and masses; hematite is semi-massive disseminations;  and  chalcopyrite  and  bornite  are  found  in  veinlets.    Principal  magmatic  ore mineralogy consists of one or more of: bastnÃ¤site, pyrochlore, apatite, anatase, zircon, baddeleyite, magnetite, monazite, parasite and fersmite.

In the Canadian Cordillera, carbonatites were emplaced episodically, at circa 810-700, 500, and 360-330 Ma, forming part of the British Columbia alkaline province, which defines a long (~1000 km), narrow (200 km) orogeny-parallel belt.  The circa 810-700 Ma and 500 Ma carbonatites were injected during protracted breakup of the supercontinent Rodinia and passive margin development on the western flank of Laurentia.  In contrast to these, the 360-330 Ma carbonatites were emplaced near the continental margin during subduction rather than in the cratonic interior during continentbuilding (Rukhlov et al., 2018).  The carbonatites on the Wicheeda project are believed to be part of this latter group.

In their study of the Wicheeda Main Zone, Trofanenko et al. (2014; 2016) proposed a preliminary model in which the carbonatite magma exsolved a fluid which finitized the host metasediments near the  intrusion  to  potassic  fenite.  It  heated  formational  water  distal  to  the  intrusion,  altering  the metasedimentary fluids, which partially dissolved the carbonatite, altered the dolomite, and lead to deposition of compositionally zoned dolomite and later bastnÃ¤site-(Ce) and monazite-(Ce) in veins and vugs in response to cooling and an increase in pH.

It is Mr. Deiss' opinion that the geology, structure and mineralization of the Wicheeda property is consistent with a REE-enriched carbonatite deposit. Mr. Deiss has reviewed and accepted the Wicheeda project deposit type description.

## 9 Exploration

Defense Metals has not conducted any surface exploration on the Wicheeda project other than diamond drilling, and metallurgical testwork. The results of the drilling campaigns are detailed in Section 10.

In 2020, Defense Metals completed a LiDAR survey. The increased resolution of the LiDAR allows for more robust mine planning, particularly when considering the high relief within the project area.

During 2020 and 2021, all the 2008 and 2009 original drill core pulps were reanalyzed, utilizing a REE lithium metaborate fusion with an ICP-MS finish analytical method, to reduce the uncertainty regarding the historical incomplete XRF analytical results.

In the opinion of Mr. Deiss, the exploration programs conducted on the project, as outlined, are appropriate for the style of mineralization identified. The current degree of geological knowledge and understanding of mineralization is considered to be adequate for a PEA level study.

## 10 Drilling

Mr.  Deiss  has  reviewed  and  accepted  the  drilling  information  provided  in  this  section.  Details pertaining to the verification of the respective information are contained in Section 12.

## 10.1 2019 Diamond Drilling

This  section  is  largely  extracted  and  adapted  from  the  previous  NI43-101  report  (Raffle  and Nicholls, 2020) .

During  2019,  Defense  Metals  retained  APEX  Geoscience  Ltd.  to  conduct  a  diamond  drilling exploration program at the Wicheeda property. The program directive was to test the extents of the Wicheeda deposit, and further delineate the relatively  higher-grade near surface dolomite unit. Thirteen  diamond  drill  holes,  totalling  2007.5  m,  were  drilled  from  three  different  drilling  pads, testing the southern, central and northern zones of the carbonatite (Figure 10-1). All drill holes intersected variable lengths of significant REE mineralization, mainly in the carbonatite dolomite body  and,  to  a  lesser  extent,  in  the  lithologies  enveloping  the  carbonatite  deposit.  The  2019 diamond  drilling  program  was  successful  in  expanding  the  REE  mineralized  footprint  of  the Wicheeda Deposit to the south and north respectively.

Drilling began at the location of the 2019 bulk sample (and 2008 drilling site). Prior to drilling, drill hole collars and drill sites were located by handheld GPS. Falcon Drilling Ltd. of Prince George, BC was contracted to complete the drilling. At each drill site, drill pads were constructed on steep mountain terrain. Once retrieved, drill core was removed from the core tube and placed directly into four row NQ-sized wooden core boxes with a 1.2 m standard length. The core boxes were then sealed with wooden lids, strapped tightly, and transported by a helicopter to the gravel pit camp site for logging purposes. At the drill camp, the drill core was carefully reconstructed and logged. The  information  recorded  from  drill  core  includes  geotechnical  logging  (depth  markers,  core recovery, rock quality designation (RQD)), geological logging (lithology, alteration and weathering, structure, veining, mineralization), specific gravity determination, taking scintillometer readings and core sampling. Once the drill core has been sampled, the core is cut, and each sample is placed in a sealed polybag and then shipped to the analytical laboratory in rice bags. Down-hole survey directional data was collected utilizing a Reflex EZ-Shot instrument.

All 13 drill holes intersected significant intercepts of REE-mineralized dolomite carbonatite rocks. Drilling  at  the  northern  extent  delineated  and  expanded  the  northern  margin  of  the  deposit  by 120 m, which represent a 50% increase in the strike length of the Wicheeda Carbonatite. The final drill hole (WI19-32) drilled during the 2019 drilling program, intersected a 130 m interval of REEmineralized dolomite-carbonatite, indicating that the deposit is still open towards north. Infill drilling southeast of the deposit expanded the deposit 40 m beyond the existing limit and delineation drilling in the southwest area of the deposit extended the limit of the dolomite-carbonatite a further 25 m.

Two diamond drill holes (WI19-20 and WI19-21) were collared at the 2018 Wicheeda bulk sample site (Pad 1). Drill hole WI19-20, drilled southwestward, intersected REE mineralized carbonatite from start of sampling at 4.6 m to a downhole depth of 64.2 m, with medium to coarse-grained REE minerals  (monazite  and  bastnÃ¤site-parasite)  forming  millimetre  to  centimeter-scale  aggregates interstitial to dolomite. Assay results returned 4.43% LREO over a drill core interval of 60 m. Drill hole  WI19-21,  drilled  northwest,  intersected  REE-mineralized  dolomite  carbonatite  containing visible REE mineralization from 3.9 m to a downhole depth of 114 m, with aggregates of medium to  coarse-grained  REE  minerals  (monazite  and  bastnÃ¤site-parasite)  observed  throughout  the interval. Assay results returned 3.35% LREO over a 110 m interval from surface.

Drill hole WI19-22 was collared at Pad 2, northeast of Pad 1 at a higher elevation, and is part of a cluster of seven drill holes (WI19-22 to WI19-28), drilled to increase the confidence of the REE mineralized  dolomite-carbonatite  within  the  deposit.  Drill  hole  WI19-22,  is  a  vertical  hole  that intersected REE-mineralized dolomite carbonatite from a depth of 7.0 m to a depth of 113 m with medium-to-coarse-grained  REE  minerals  forming  millimeter  to  centimeter  scale  aggregates interstitial to dolomite. Hole WI19-22 assayed 2.78% LREO over a drill core interval of 106 m.

Drill hole WI19-23 was drilled eastward and assay results returned an average grade of 3.21% LREO over an interval of 105 m, expanding the eastern drill-defined edge of the deposit a distance of 40 m beyond the limit of the previous model. Significantly, much of the WI19-23 mineralized intercept (a 39 m drill core interval) also occurs inside the 2019 LG resource pit shell within rocks previously defined as waste.

Drill hole  WI19-24  was  drilled  southeastward.  The  drill  hole  intersected  REE-mineralized carbonatite containing REE mineralization from the start of sampling at 2.9 m to a downhole depth of 83 m, and returned an average grade of 2.49% LREO over 81 m. This hole modestly expanded the eastern drill-defined edge of the deposit a distance of 8.0 m and provided an additional pierce point of the carbonatite envelope.

Drill  hole  WI19-25  was  drilled  southeastward  intersecting  dolomite  carbonatite  containing  REE mineralization from the start of sampling at 1.1 m to a downhole depth of 143.4 m. Assay results returned an average grade of 2.28% LREO over a 142.3 m interval, including 3.98% LREO over 23.9 m and 4.04% LREO over 23 m. This hole has also expanded the eastern drill-defined edge of the deposit and provided an additional pierce point of the carbonatite envelope.

Drill  hole  WI19-26  was  drilled  southwestward.  It  has  intersected  REE-mineralized  dolomite carbonatite containing REE mineralization from the start of sampling at 1.8 m to a downhole depth of 128 m. Assay results returned an average grade of 2.90% LREO over 126.2 m interval including 4.31% LREO over 48.0 m.

Drill  hole  WI19-27  was  drilled  westward.  It  intersected  REE-mineralized  dolomite  carbonatite containing REE mineralization from the start of sampling at 2.0 m to a downhole depth of 120.3 m. Assay results returned an average grade of 2.60% LREO over an interval of 118.3 m.

The last drill hole on Pad 2 was drill hole WI19-28. This definition drill hole was designed to cut through the northeastern contact of the dolomite-carbonatite. Assays returned values of 2.53% LREO over a drill core interval of 69.5 m.

Four diamond drill holes were collared from Pad 3 to test the potential of REE-mineralized dolomite carbonatite zones beyond the limit of the previous block model to the north. Drill hole WI19-29 drilled southward and returned assays values of 3.09% LREO over a drill core interval of 89 m. This hole successfully expanded the REE-mineralized dolomite carbonate a distance of 45 m. Drill hole WI19-30 was drilled westward and intersected a broad zone of mineralization returning 2.59% LREO over an interval of 130.8 m, including a 4.54% LREO over an interval of 27 m. Drill hole WI19-31 was drilled northwestward and due to technical challenges, the hole was terminated in mineralization at a downhole depth of 138.5 m. Assay values returned 4.54% LREO over an interval

of 83 m, including a 5.60% LREO over an interval of 33 m. Drill hole WI19-32 drilled northwestward and was the final hole of the 2019 resource definition program. This hole returned 4.11% LREO over an interval of 58 m, within a broader zone of mineralization assaying 3.71% LREO over an interval of 75 m, in addition to an upper mineralized intercept assaying 2.76% LREO over a 28 m interval. Figure 10-2 to Figure 10-4 show the 2019 diamond drill holes and highlight significant mineralization.

In the opinion of the SRK QP, there are no sampling or recovery factors that could materially impact the accuracy and reliability of the 2019 drill results.

## 10.2 2021 Diamond Drilling

During 2021, Defense Metals completed a 29-diamond drill hole program comprising 5,349 m of drilling primarily for resource expansion and at Wicheeda. The results of drilling are expected during the first quarter 2022 and therefore have not been incorporated into the technical report. The drilling is expected to support ongoing advanced economic studies through the development of an updated geological model and MRE.

## 11 Sample Preparation, Analyses, and Security

Mr. Deiss has reviewed and accepted the sample preparation, analyses and security as detailed in Section  11.  Details  pertaining  to  the  verification  of  the  respective  information  are  contained  in Section 12.

## 11.1 Sample Collection and Security

## 11.1.1 Bulk Sample (2019)

During September 2018, Spectrum received approval from the BC Ministry of Mines for a work permit to collect a 30-tonne bulk sample of rare earth mineralization from Wicheeda. Subsequently, BC  based  mining  contracting  company  Minconsult  Exploration  Services  (Minconsult)  was contracted to conduct the surface bulk sample blast trenching program and during October 2019 they  successfully  completed  the  collection  of  the  30-tonne  rock  sample  via  conventional compressed air drill and blast from a level area at the location of the 2008 diamond drill site. The 2008 diamond drill assay results provided geological and REE mineralization control for sample site  selection,  which  was  overseen  by  a  Minconsult  geologist.  Prior  to  blasting  the  shallow overburden was stripped using hand tool to expose the dolomite-carbonatite outcrop. After blasting, fragmented rock was further reduced using a demolition hammer and placed into one-tonne polywoven duffle top bulk bags and transported to a nearby logging road staging area and placed onto a commercial flatbed haul truck for transport to Prince George for secure storage prior to shipment to SGS. The 30-tonne Wicheeda deposit bulk sample was then trucked to SGS Lakefield, Ontario facility.  Upon receipt at SGS, the sample was inventoried (i.e., bag counts and gross weights), then placed in a containment area on a clean concrete pad.

## 11.1.2 Drill Core Samples (2008 and 2009)

## 2008 and 2009 Sample Collection and Security

In 2008, four BTW-diameter (40.7 mm diameter) holes totaling 866.06 m were drilled on the project. In 2008, drill core was transported to Prince George following the completion of all four holes and was  logged  and  sampled  in  a  secure,  gated  warehouse  located  on  the  premises  of  Allnorth Consulting Ltd.  After delivery of the core the driller's run blocks were converted to metric units, and recovery  and  RQD  were  measured  prior  to  logging.  The  core  was  logged  for  geological  and geotechnical properties by Jay W. Page, P.Geo.  Each section of core to be sampled was clearly identified and then marked with a centre line.  All drill cores were photographed, sawn and sampled using a nominal sample interval of 3 m.  Core splitting, using a water-cooled diamond saw, was conducted by competent, experienced technicians under the guidance of Page and Lane (Lane, 2009).

In 2009, 15 HQ (63.5 mm diameter) holes totaling 1,823.61 m were drilled on the project.  In 2009, drill core was transported to Prince George following the completion of each hole and was logged and sampled in a secure, gated warehouse located on the premises of Falcon Drilling Ltd.  After delivery of the core the driller's run blocks were converted to metric units, and recovery and RQD were measured prior to logging.  Geological logging in 2009 was performed by veteran geologist

Murray Morrison. All drill cores were photographed, sawn and sampled using a nominal sample interval of 3 m.  Core splitting, using a water-cooled diamond saw, was conducted by competent, experienced technicians under the guidance of Morrison and Lane (Lane, 2010).

The 2008 and 2009, a total of 583 core samples were labelled, cut, and bagged, and 74 quality control samples (blanks, duplicates and just two standards) were inserted into the sample stream at regular intervals following a prescribed sequence. All the bagged core samples were recorded on  shipment  forms,  packed  in  large  woven  nylon  'rice'  bags,  and  trucked  via  independent commercial transport to the Global Discovery Labs in Vancouver, BC.

During 2008 only, a total of 73 pulps from the upper part of each drill hole, prepared by Global Discovery Labs, were also shipped to Activation Laboratories Ltd. (Actlabs) in Ancaster, Ontario for secondary analysis.

## Re-analysis of Drill 2008 and 2009 Core Pulps (2020/2021)

During late 2020, APEX personnel travelled to the Prince George secure core storage facility to retrieve original 2008 and 2009 drill core prepared pulps. The prepared pulps were found to be in good condition, having been stored indoors within their original packaging, and affixed with labels consistent with their original sample IDs. A total of 743 samples were sent for analysis, including 91 QA/QC samples.

The samples were palletized in their original containers and transported by an APEX geologist to a commercial shipping company in Prince George, BC. Samples were then shipped via ground service to the ALS Minerals (ALS) laboratory in Vancouver, BC. Upon receiving the samples, the laboratory sorted and checked the samples received against the sample submission form.

APEX did not always monitor the samples during transport; however, the pallet was reportedly undamaged when received by ALS. Therefore, there is no reason to believe that the security of the samples was compromised in any way during transport or once they entered the ALS chain of custody

## 11.1.3 Drill Core Samples (2019)

A total of 717 samples were sampled and sent for analysis, including 145 QA/QC samples. Sample intervals were typically between 1 and 3 m. Sample intervals were marked out and tagged by APEX geologists, and the core was then photographed. Samples were sawed in half longitudinally using a core saw. For each sample, one half core was sent for analysis and the other was left in the box. Duplicate samples were cut into quarters, where one quarter of the core was used as the 'original' sample and the other quarter was used as the 'duplicate' sample. The remaining half core was left in the box.

The  samples  were  then  placed  into  woven  poly  (rice)  bags,  secured  using  cable  ties,  and transported by an APEX geologist to a shipping company in Prince George, BC. Samples were then shipped via ground service to ALS laboratory in Kamloops, BC. Upon receiving the samples, the laboratory sorted and checked the samples received against the sample submission form.

APEX did not always monitor drill core samples during transport, however, the sealed rice bags with unique identifiers were in place when received by ALS. Therefore, there is no reason to believe that the security of the samples was compromised in any way during transport or once they entered the ALS chain of custody.

## 11.2 Sample Preparation and Analysis

## 11.2.1 Bulk Sample and Metallurgical Testwork (2019 and 2020)

At SGS  the entire 30-tonne bulk sample was jaw crushed to nominal 1-inch, and homogenized/blended via backhoe. A 400 kg sample representative sample was then selected and further homogenized by tumbling and crushed to Â½ inch. Half of the 400 kg sample was retained for future testing. The primary 200 kg sample was then crushed to 6 mesh (3.36 mm), homogenized and split into 10 kg charges.  Two of the 10 kg charges were combined and split into 2 kg charges, from one of which 150 g was pulverized to 80% passing 75 microns. Major element, and lanthanum and neodymium oxides, and loss on ignition (LOI) were determined by whole rock analysis, via lithium-borate fusion of a 0.5-gram sample analyzed via wavelength dispersion X-ray fluorescence (WD-XRF).  The  remaining  REE  were  determined  via  0.5-gram  sodium-peroxide  fusion  multielement ICP-MS.

A sub-sample of the head sample was submitted for abrasion index testing, and the remainder crushed to 100% passing 12.7 mm and 25 kg sample was taken for Bond Rod Mill Work Index (RWI) AND Bond Ball Mill Work Index (BWI) testwork. The rest of the sample was further crushed to 100% passing 3.3 mm. The less than 3.3 mm sample was split into 2 kg and 10 kg charges for batch and bulk concentrate flotation production tests. Flotation charges were stage-ground to 100% passing 106 Âµm or 150 Âµm based on mineralogical data and SGS's prior experience with REE flotation testwork programs.

For the locked-cycle test, a stability check reveals that reasonable stability was achieved quickly for all elements, and three cycles were deemed suitable for projected mass balance calculation, to simulate the metallurgical performance that would be achieved in a continuous operation.

Head grade, batch, and locked-cycle concentrate products for cerium, lanthanum, neodymium, and praseodymium oxides were determined via lithium-borate fusion of a 0.5-gram sample analyzed via wavelength dispersion WD-XRF. The remaining REE for the head sample were determined via 0.5-gram sodium-peroxide fusion multi-element ICP-MS.

## 11.2.2 Drill Core Samples (2008 and 2009)

## 2008 and 2009 Sample Preparation and Analysis

The sample preparation procedures implemented by Global Discovery Labs (which was purchased by Acme Analytical Labs and subsequently Bureau Veritas) during the 2008 and 2009 programs

are not known. However, it is believed standard Acme Analytical Labs drill core sample preparation procedures were employed, which at the time comprised crushing 1 kg of sample to a minimum of 80% passing 10 mesh (2 mm). A 250-gram sample split was then pulverized to a minimum of 85% passing 74 microns. The 2008 and 2009 drill core samples were analyzed at Global Discovery Labs for selected light REE (La, Ce, Sm and Nd) and Nb by XRF (pressed pellet) analysis.

During 2008 only, a total of 73 pulps prepared by Global Discovery Labs, were subject to replicate lithium  metaborate/tetraborate  fusion  ICP-MS  analysis  (Actlabs  code  WRA4B2).  Samples  are mixed with a flux of lithium metaborate and lithium tetraborate and fused in an induction furnace. The molten melt is  immediately  poured  into  a  solution  of  5%  nitric  acid  containing  an  internal standard  and  mixed  continuously  until  completely  dissolved.  Major  oxides  and  selected  trace elements are then determined by ICP-MS.

Acme Analytical Labs, Bureau Veritas, and Activation Laboratories Ltd. are all ISO/IEC 17025 and ISO9001:2015 accredited geoanalytical services providers and are independent of Defense Metals and APEX.

## Re-analysis of 2008 and 2009 Drill Core Pulps (2021)

Re-analysis of all 2008 and 2009 original drill core pulps (less the 73 samples submitted to Actlabs during 2008 described above for which sample pulps no longer remain) was completed during 2020 and 2021 to reduce the uncertainty regarding the historical incomplete XRF analytical results.

Once received by ALS in Vancouver, the drill core pulps were logged in to the ALS computerized tracking  system and assigned bar code labels. The samples were then analyzed using lithium metaborate fusion with an ICP-MS finish (ALS code ME-MS81). Samples returning greater than 10,000 ppm Ce or La, or greater than 1,000 ppm Pr were subject to overlimit analysis of via high grade REE lithium metaborate fusion with an ICP-MS finish (ME-MS81h).

ALS is an ISO 9001:2008 certified laboratory and is also accredited by the Standards Council of Canada (SCC) and has been found to conform to the requirements of ISO/IEC 17025:2005. ALS is independent of Defense Metals and APEX.

## 11.2.3 Drill Core Samples (2019)

Once received by ALS, the drill core samples were logged in to the ALS computerized tracking system, assigned bar code labels. The samples were then air dried overnight or dried to a maximum of 120Â°C. The samples are then weighed, crushed to better than 70% passing 2 mm, and the whole sample  homogenized  before  taking  the  final  split  for  the  pulp.  Once  the  samples  were homogenized, a 250 g split was selected to be pulverized to better than 85% passing 75 microns. The prepped samples were then shipped to the ALS facility in North Vancouver, BC, for analysis for high grade REE. The samples were analyzed using lithium metaborate fusion with an ICP-MS finish (ALS code ME-MS81h).

ALS is an ISO 9001:2008 certified laboratory and is also accredited by the Standards Council of Canada (SCC) and has been found to conform to the requirements of ISO/IEC 17025:2005. ALS is independent of Defense Metals and APEX.

## 11.3 Quality Assurance - Quality Control

## 11.3.1 Bulk Sample and Metallurgical Testwork (2019 and 2020)

The SGS analysis included a QA/QC program including the insertion of REE standard and blank samples. APEX detected no significant QA/QC issues during review of the data.

## 11.3.2 Drill Core Samples (2008 and 2009)

Re-analysis of 2008 and 2009 original drill core pulps (less 73 samples submitted to Actlabs during 2008 for which sample pulps no longer remain) was completed during 2020 and 2021 to reduce the uncertainty regarding the historical incomplete XRF analytical results. A total of 743 samples were sent for analysis, including 91 QA/QC samples to ALS.

The current drill hole database used for the MRE comprises REEs determined by fusion ICP-MS analysis at Actlabs and ALS (2008 and 2009 drill core pulp re-analysis), in addition to the 2019 drill core samples (ICP-MS at ALS).

The QA/QC procedures implemented during the 2008 and 2009 diamond drill programs include the insertion of control samples (blanks, standards, and duplicates). In general, the 2008 drilling did not include adequate control samples as the percentage of certified reference standards fell below a recommended minimum level of 5%, but this was improved in 2009.  The control sample insertion rate is presented in Table 11-1 and shows an acceptable overall rate of more than 12%.

Table 11-1: Quality control sample insertion rate summary (XRF data)

| Type             | 2008   | 2009   |
|------------------|--------|--------|
| Field Blank      | 16     | 28     |
| Field Standard   | 2      | 28     |
| Field Duplicate  | 15     | 18     |
| Primary Samples  | 255    | 583    |
| Insertion Rates  |        |        |
| Blanks           | 6.3%   | 4.8%   |
| Field Standards  | 0.7%   | 4.8%   |
| Field Duplicates | 5.9%   | 3.1%   |
| Primary Samples  | 87.1%  | 87.3%  |

During 2008, a total of 73 sample pulps were analyzed for 43 elements including the light and heavy REE.  Nine  quality  control  samples  (blanks,  standards,  and  duplicates)  were  inserted  into  the sample stream at regular intervals. In addition to the control samples inserted by Spectrum, at Actlabs samples are prepared and analyzed in a batch system. Each batch contains a method reagent blank, certified reference material and 17% replicates.

The 73 Actlabs samples include nine QA/QC samples inserted by Spectrum (three blanks, two standards and four duplicates). A commercial granitic material pulp blank (CDN-BL-3) was used. All three blank values returned values of less than 20 ppm Nd, and less than 5 ppm Pr, well below the 50 ppm Nd and 20 ppm Pr thresholds set for 2019 drill core commercial coarse blank sample material. The commercial REE standard used is not known, however the two standards analyzed returned consistent values of 5.09% and 5.02% Nd, and 1.67% and 1.56% Pr, respectively. Field duplicate core samples returned a reasonable coefficient of correlation of 0.93.

No significant issues were detected during review of Actlabs internal QA/QC results, which included insertion of a single blank, eight certified reference standards, and five pulp duplicates within the sample sequence.

During re-analysis of the 2008 and 2009 drill core pulps, the number and position in the sample sequence of control  samples  were  retained.  That  is;  the  original  blank  and  field  duplicate  drill sample pulps from 2008 and 2009 were reanalyzed. The standards used during 2008 and 2009 were replaced with a modern commercial certified REE reference standard. QA/QC samples were inserted at a rate of approximately one standard, blank, and duplicate per 30 samples.

QA/QC measures at ALS include routine sample preparation duplicates (every 50 samples), and analytical quality controls (blanks, standards, and duplicates). Quality control samples are inserted with each analytical run, with the minimum number of QC samples dependant on the rack size specific to the chosen analytical method. Results for quality control samples that fall beyond the established  limits  are  automatically  red-flagged  for  serious  failures  and  yellow-flagged  for borderline results. Every batch of samples is subject to a dual approval and review process, both by the individual analyst and the Department Manager, before final approval and certification.

Detailed QA/QC results for the re-analysis of 2008 and 2009 drill core are presented below.

## Standards

Thirty analytical standards (CDN-RE-1201) were inserted into the 2008 and 2009 drill core pulp reanalysis sample sequence. Assay results show two Nd assays exceeded the acceptable three standard deviation from the certified value (311 ppm Â± 27 ppm, and two Ce assay results exceeded the acceptable standard deviation for the certified value (1327 ppm Â± 165 ppm). All La results were within the acceptable standard deviation (certified value; 959 ppm Â± 161 ppm), and all Pr assays were within the acceptable standard deviation from certified value (112 ppm Â± 11 ppm). QA/QC summary charts are presented in Figure 11-1.

## Blanks

Thirty-five CDN Resource Laboratories (CDN) granitic material pulps blanks (CD-BL-3 and CDNBL-4) were used. For the 35 blanks, no samples exceeded the established cut-off values of 50 ppm Nd, 150 ppm Ce, 100 ppm La, and 20 ppm Pr. QA/QC summary charts for the blanks are presented in Figure 11-2.

## Duplicates

Twenty-six quartered drill core samples were collected during the diamond drill program. Results of duplicate samples indicate good overall repeatability of the Nd, Ce, La, and Pr values. This is interpreted  to  indicate  a  low  'nugget'  effect  with  respect  to  REE  analysis.  Excluding  primary geological heterogeneity (quarter-core), the data show a homogenous distribution of Ne, Ce, La and Pr values within the Wicheeda drill core. QA/QC summary charts for duplicate samples are presented in Figure 11-3.

It  is  Mr.  Deiss'  opinion  that  the  sample  collection,  preparation,  security,  analytical  and  QA/QC measures used during the 2021 re-analysis of 2008 and 2009 drill core pulps were adequate for this stage of exploration at the Wicheeda Property. No significant QA/QC issues were detected during review of the drill core data and therefore, Mr. Deiss has accepted these results.

## 11.3.3 Drill Core Samples (2019)

The QA/QC measures employed by APEX geologist comprised inserting field standards, blanks, and duplicate samples. Analytical standards were inserted into the sample stream to verify the accuracy of the laboratory analysis. Barren coarse material was used for coarse 'blank' samples to monitor potential contamination during the sample preparation procedure. Duplicate samples were collected to assess the repeatability of individual analytical values. QA/QC samples were inserted at a rate of approximately 1 standard, blank and duplicate per 20 samples.

QA/QC measures at ALS include routine screentests to verify crushing and pulverizing efficiency, sample  preparation  duplicates  (every  50  samples),  and  analytical  quality  controls  (blanks, standards, and duplicates). Quality control samples are inserted with each analytical run, with the minimum number of QC samples dependant on the rack size specific to the chosen analytical method. Results for quality control samples that fall beyond the established limits are automatically red-flagged for serious failures and yellow-flagged for borderline results. Every batch of samples is subject to a dual approval and review process, both by the individual analyst and the Department Manager, before final approval and certification.

Further details on the QA-QC analysis of the 2019 drill core program were published with the 2020 technical report (Raffle and Nicholls, 2020)

It  is  Mr.  Deiss'  opinion  that  the  sample  collection,  preparation,  security,  analytical  and  QA/QC measures  used  during  the  2019  diamond  drilling  program  were  adequate  for  this  stage  of exploration at the Wicheeda Property. No significant QA/QC issues were detected during review of the diamond drilling data and therefore, Mr. Deiss has accepted these results.

## 12 Data Verification

## 12.1 Site Visits

## 12.1.1 Mineral Resource

Mr. Deiss completed a site visit to Defense Metals 2021 drill hole core processing facility, managed by APEX on October 5, 2021 and the Wicheeda project area on October 6, 2021. APEX's site geologist, Mr. Mo Asmail, accompanied Mr. Deiss during the site visit. Mr. Asmail provided a site geological overview as well as a summary of the procedures employed at the site. During the site visit, Mr. Deiss reviewed the drill hole core handing and chain of custody, logging, sampling, QA/QC and found the practices employed by APEX to be according to industry standard practices

Mr. Deiss reviewed the electronic logging and sampling with the drillhole core for drill holes WI1931 and WI19-32 mineralized intersections respectively and found no material differences. Two half core check samples were taken for verification purposes from these two drill holes. An additional four coarse rejects samples from the 2008 and 2009 drilling were also selected for check analyses. Mr. Deiss sealed the samples and couriered the samples to ALS, Vancouver.

The  samples  were  analyzed  utilizing  the  ME-MS81h  REE  analytical  technique.  Figure  12-1 represents the 60 analytes' absolute differences relative to means of the original and duplicate samples. Ideally, the error percent should be less than 20%. There are three samples that lie slightly above this tolerance limit. However, these differences were not deemed material based on the magnitude of the values analysed. Mr. Deiss determined that there was no obvious bias for either the drill hole core or the coarse rejects' duplicate samples. The REE original and duplicate results are presented in Table 12-1 and Table 12-2, respectively.

## 12.1.2 Mining

Dr. Ebrahimi conducted his site inspection on October 26-27, 2021. He was able to confirm and assess the site physiography in support of designing site and open pit accesses as well as siting various project infrastructure.

## 12.2 Additional Data Verifications

## 12.2.1 Mineral Resources

Mr. Deiss reviewed the drill hole information with regards to logging convention errors i.e., gaps, overlaps, duplicate intervals, and the analytical values were checked for anomalous or switching of values. No obvious errors were encountered. Drill hole collar positions were checked against the topographic digital terrain model (DTM). The collars matched the DTM position.

- Mr. Deiss compared the assay certificates to samples recorded in the drillhole database as supplied by Defense Metals. No transcription errors where encountered. QA/QC measures show favourable reproducibility  in  laboratory  standards,  blanks,  and  duplicates.  There  is  no  evidence  of  data tampering or contamination during collection, shipping, analytical preparation, or analysis.
- Mr.  Deiss  has  reviewed  the  drillhole  hole  samples  and  composites  used  for  the  estimation, estimation parameters used in the ordinary kriging (OK) process, estimation results and validations, and has accepted the MRE as he considers them to be in accordance with  industry standard practices.

It is Mr. Deiss' opinion that the data provided is adequate for the purposes used for the MRE.

## 12.2.2 Mining

Most  all  data  used  in  mine  planning  was  derived  or  verified  by  other  QPs  contributing  to  this technical  report.  For  cost  information,  Dr.  Ebrahimi  and  Mr.  McCarthy  relied  upon  engineering judgement and experience, supported by benchmarking with the cost service, CostMine.

## 12.2.3 Metallurgy

Eric Olin, the SRK QP for the mineral processing sections of this technical report, reviewed all relevant metallurgical reports prepared by SGS Lakefield  related to the beneficiation of material from the Wicheeda deposit. SGS is a respected commercial metallurgical laboratory, and all reports were found to be suitable and appropriate for a preliminary economic assessment of the project. Mr.  Olin  has  reviewed  and  coordinated  many  projects  with  SGS  and  is  very  familiar  with  the technical personnel at SGS and the quality of work that they perform.

The  SRK  QP  for  hydrometallurgy,  Mr.  John  Goode,  reviewed  all  available  reports  covering hydrometallurgical testwork as prepared by SGS.  The reports were found to be comprehensive and adequate for the stage of testwork and for a preliminary economic evaluation study.  Mr. Goode was not able to visit the SGS laboratories and examine the testwork as it was being performed. However, he is very familiar with the personnel, laboratory methods, analytical procedures used in the performance of the work by SGS.  This familiarity comes from numerous visits undertaken to the laboratory to supervise and monitor other similar rare earth projects over the last several years.

All other SRK QPs independently sourced or generated their own data in support of their analysis for the Wicheeda REE PEA.

## 13 Mineral Processing and Metallurgical Testing

## 13.1 General

Metallurgical development programs have been conducted on test samples from the Wicheeda project over the period 2011-2021 by SGS, a respected commercial metallurgical laboratory. These programs have included initial exploratory testwork conducted by SGS for Spectrum in 2011 to develop  a  flotation  process  for  recovering  the  contained  rare  earth  minerals  into  a  flotation concentrate.  This  work  was  followed  by  flotation  optimization  testwork  conducted  for  Defense Metals by SGS in 2019 and flotation pilot plant testing in 2020. Hydrometallurgical testwork was conducted on bulk flotation concentrates to demonstrate process requirements to produce a mixed REE precipitate.  The  results  of  these  metallurgical  investigations  are  fully  documented  in  the following SGS reports:

- Â· 'Recovery  of  REO  Minerals  from  the  Wicheeda  Deposit',  SGS  Canada  -  Project 12442-001, December 28, 2011.
- Â· 'Flotation  Optimization  on  Sample  from  Wicheeda  Rare  Earth  Deposit'  -  Project 17173-01, November 11, 2019.
- Â· 'Flotation Pilot Plant Testing on a Sample from the Wicheeda Rare Earth Deposit' Project 17173-03, January 5, 2021.
- Â· 'Bench-Scale Hydrometallurgical Testing (Phase-1B) on Wicheeda Flotation Concentrate' - Project 17173-02, February 25, 2020
- Â· 'An  Investigation  into  Bench  Scale  Hydrometallurgical  Optimisation  Testing  on Wicheeda Flotation Concentrate' - Project 17173-02 - DRAFT November 17, 2021.

It is noted that the flotation test program conducted for Spectrum in 2011 has been superseded by the more recent testwork and will not be discussed in this section.

Feed material for the 2019 and 2020 metallurgical testing was sourced from the approximately 30-tonne bulk sample collected from the Wicheeda deposit by Spectrum during October 2018. The 2019 SGS flotation testwork sought to establish a Wicheeda metallurgical process base case by confirming the reproducibility of previous 2011 metallurgical testwork. This was followed by process flowsheet  optimization  by  researching  the  effects  of  various  reagent  combinations  as  well  as varying  grind  size,  flotation  pulp  temperature,  and  pH.  Flotation  concentrate  samples  were subjected to hydrometallurgical testing to determine a suitable process for the recovery of REE in a readily marketable form.

## 13.2 Bench-Scale Beneficiation Testwork

In 2019, a bench-scale flotation optimization program was conducted on a 300 kg sub-sample of a 30 t  sample  that  was  received  at  SGS.  The  300  kg  sub-sample  used  for  the  bench  scale  test program was identified as the 'DM composite'.

## 13.2.1 Head Characterization

A representative subsample was split from the DM composite and submitted for REO and ICP scan analysis. Assays for As, Nb, Zr, Ta, Lu, Sc, K, Cr, V, and Mo were all below the detection limits. Details of the assay results are shown in Table 13-1. The REO grade in the DM composite was relatively high, at 4.8% total REO. The main REE were light REE, including cerium (Ce), lanthanum (La), neodymium (Nd), and praseodymium (Pr). Other minor LREE included samarium (Sm), and minor to trace amounts of heavy REE including europium (Eu), gadolinium (Gd), terbium (Tb), dysprosium (Dy), holmium (Ho), erbium (Er), thulium (Tm), ytterbium (Yb), and yttrium (Y) (ranging from 0.5 g/t to 400 g/t) were also present. The calcium content was very high (~20%) and the iron and magnesium contents were also relatively high (7% - 8%).

## 13.2.2 Mineralogical Analyses

QEMSCAN mineralogical analyses on the DM composite resulted in the following key findings:

- Â· The test sample was composed primarily of dolomite (45.7%) and ankerite (39.9%), with  other  gangue  phases  present  in  minor  and  trace  levels,  such  as  Fe-oxides (0.35%),  rutile  (0.17%),  quartz  (0.87%),  plagioclase  (0.62%),  micas/clays  (1.1%), calcite (1.5%), pyrite (0.28%), and apatite (0.47%).
- Â· REE minerals  included  monazite  (3.7%),  synchysite/parisite  (3.4%)  and  bastnÃ¤site (0.45%).
- Â· REE  mineral  distributions  by  size  fraction  were  quite  different.  Monazite  was preferentially concentrated in the -38 Î¼m size fraction, while synchysite/parisite was more evenly distributed across all size fractions.
- Â· Lanthanum  was  hosted  in almost equal amounts  by  monazite  (48.4%) and synchysite/parisite (47.7%), with a lesser amount in bastnÃ¤site (3.8%).
- Â· Cerium was hosted in almost equal amounts by monazite (51.7%) and synchysite/parasite (42.9%), with a lesser amount in bastnÃ¤site (5.1%).
- Â· Neodymium  was  hosted  in  almost  equal  amounts  by  monazite  (47.8%)  and synchysite/parisite (43.7%), with a lesser amount in bastnÃ¤site (8.3%).

## 13.2.3 Comminution Testwork

Bond rod mill work index (RWI), Bond ball mill work index (BWI) and Bond Abrasion (Ai) tests were conducted on the DM composite. The results of these tests are summarized in Table 13-2 to Table 13-4. The RWI was determined to be 7.5 kWh/t and the BWI was determined to be 9.3 kWh/t, which classifies the composite as very soft with respect to both rod mill and ball mill grinding. The Ai was determined to be 0.007 g, which classifies this composite as nonabrasive. These results indicate that grinding power and wear material costs will be relatively low in a commercial processing plant.

## 13.2.4 Flotation Optimization Testwork

An extensive series of bench scale flotation tests were conducted to optimize the flotation process parameters. These optimization tests evaluated a range of process parameters including:

- Â· Reagent usage
- Â· Flotation retention time
- Â· Slurry temperature
- Â· Grind size
- Â· High density reagent conditioning.

The result of the optimization program served to establish the optimum conditions to be used in a subsequent locked-cycle flotation test.

## 13.2.5 Locked-Cycle Flotation

A locked-cycle flotation test was run on the DM composite using the optimized test conditions that were established from the earlier testwork. Locked-cycle flotation tests serve to evaluate the impact of recirculating intermediate test products in a series of batch bench-scale tests. This evaluates the overall impact on recovery and concentrate grade and provide a reasonable estimate of recoveries and grades that could be achieved in a continuous processing circuit. The process conditions used for the locked-cycle test are included in Table 13-5.

Table 13-5: Process conditions used for the locked-cycle test

| Parameter                | Process Condition   |
|--------------------------|---------------------|
| Grind Size               | 100% passing 106 Âµm |
| Slurry Temperature       | 80Â°C                |
| Ro and Scav Flotation pH | 9.0 - 9.5           |
| Reagents                 |                     |
| Soda ash (pH modifier)   | 3,000 g/t           |
| F220 (depressant)        | 2,600 g/t           |
| Na2SiF6 (depressant)     | 800 g/t             |
| REEC5 (collector blend)  | 155 g/t             |
| AF3 (activator)          | 160 g/t             |

The locked-cycle flowsheet is shown in Figure 13-1 and included two stages of desliming, rougher flotation, scavenger flotation and three stages of cleaner flotation. The cleaner-scavenger tailing and the cleaner-2 tailing were recycled back to scavenger flotation and the cleaner-3 tailing was recycled  back  to  first  stage  cleaner  flotation.  The  results  of  the  six-cycle  locked-cycle  test  are summarized in Table 13-6 (average of the last four cycles). The locked-cycle test recovered 85.7% of the REO into a final concentrate containing 48.7% TREO. The locked-cycle test feed grade was reported at 4.81% TREO.

## 13.2.6 Bulk Concentrate Production

A bulk concentrate was produced from a series of twenty 10 kg open cycle flotation tests in order to generate a sufficient quantity of concentrate for downstream hydrometallurgical testwork. A total of 15.5 kg of REE concentrate were produced from these bulk flotation tests at an average grade of about 44% TREO. This concentrate was split into two groups:

- Â· Group A: High grade concentrate containing ~53% TREO (2.8 kg)
- Â· Group B: Moderate grade concentrate containing ~43% TREO (12.7 kg).

## 13.2.7 Mineral Sorting Testwork

The Saskatchewan Research Council (SRC) conducted a preliminary study of the amenability of Wicheeda mineralized material to coarse mineral sorting (SRC 2021) on a small number of pieces of drill core. SRC reported:

- Â· A strong correlation exists between the REE mineral content of the samples and the radiation levels.
- Â· X-Ray transmission (XRT) measurements can identify the REE minerals and the pyrite within the Wicheeda mineralized material.
- Â· Moderate  upgrading  of  the  Wicheeda  potential  mill  feed  is  achievable  using  XRT technology.

## 13.3 Flotation Pilot Plant Program

In June-July 2020, a pilot plant test program was conducted on a 25.5 t composite. This program included initial characterization of the composite and bench scale testwork to confirm the results of the previous metallurgical program. The pilot plant was operated at the rate of ~140 kg/hr.

## 13.3.1 Head Characterization

A representative subsample was split from the DM composite and submitted for REO, whole rock analysis, Nb2O5, ZrO2, Ta2O5, U3O8, ThO2, and ICP scan analysis. Details of the assay results are included in Table 13-7. The TREO grade in the pilot plant head sample was relatively high, at 4.84% TREO. The main REE were LREE, including cerium (Ce), lanthanum (La), neodymium (Nd), and praseodymium (Pr).

## 13.3.2 Comminution Testwork

A confirmatory Bond ball mill work index (BWI) test was conducted on the pilot plant composite and the results are summarized in Table 13-7, The BWI was determined to be 9.2 kWh/t, which was nearly identical to the 2019 bench scale test composite, again demonstrating that this material is very soft with respect ball mill grinding.

## 13.3.3 Bench-Scale Laboratory Flotation Testwork

The  objectives  of  the  laboratory  bench-scale  flotation  program  were  to  confirm  previously established flotation conditions, to further optimize the flowsheet for REE recovery, and to provide benchmark results for pilot plant testing.

The testwork was mainly focused on evaluating the metallurgical performance at lower temperature and a coarser grind size. These studies indicated that the grind size could be coarsened to 100% passing (P100) 150 Âµm, which was coarser than the previously established grind size of P100 106 Âµm, and that the slurry temperature could potentially decreased from 85Â°C to about 65-70Â°C. A single locked-cycle flotation test was conducted at the P100 150 Âµm grind size while maintaining slurry temperatures at about 70Â°C during rougher and scavenger flotation and about 65Â°C during cleaner flotation.

The results of this locked-cycle test are summarized in Table 13-6 and resulted in 84.9% REO recovery into a final flotation concentrate containing 45.5% TREO from a sample of the pilot plant composite that contained 4.81% TREO. This compares to the previous locked-cycle test (Section 13.2.5) which was conducted at a finer grind of P100 106 Âµm and slurry temperature of 80Â°C in which 85.7% REO recovery into a final flotation concentrate containing 48.7% TREO was reported.

## 13.3.4 Pilot Plant Testing

Pilot plant testing was conducted during June-July 2020 and processed a total of 25.5 t of material. The  purpose  of  the  pilot  plant  program  was  to  confirm  metallurgy,  generate  data  to  support engineering studies, and produce a large amount of high-grade concentrate (&gt;45% TREO) for downstream hydrometallurgy testing.

The  pilot  plant  flowsheet  is  shown  in  Figure  13-2,  which  included  primary  grinding,  reagent conditioning, rougher and scavenger flotation and two stages of cleaner flotation. The grind size averaged about P80 114 Âµm. Rougher and scavenger flotation temperatures averaged about 80Â°C and cleaner flotation temperatures ranged from 83-88Â°C. The results of the pilot plant campaigns are summarized in Table 13-10.

Pilot plant runs PP14 - 16C were considered confirmatory runs and these runs averaged 77.3% REO recovery into final flotation concentrates that averaged 51.6% TREO from pilot plant feed that averaged 4.66% TREO. These results are compared to bench scale locked-cycle tests that resulted in about 85% REO recovery into flotation concentrates that contained 45.5-48.7% TREO from feed grades that ranged from 4.40 to 4.66% TREO.

## 13.4 Hydrometallurgy

## 13.4.1 Preliminary Program of Testwork

In 2012, Spectrum Mining Corporation engaged SGS to investigate the extraction of rare earths from a 2 kg sample of Wicheeda flotation concentrate. (SGS 2012). The concentrate contained 39.7% TREO with calcium, magnesium and iron as the dominant non-REO elements and likely associated with dolomite and ankerite.

A four-hour leach at 90ÂºC with HCl held at 100 g/L free acid dissolved 68% of the REE (Test AL2). A pre-leach test, intended to remove gangue minerals while leaving REE in the residue, was done with HCl at a pH of 1 for four hours at 90ÂºC (Test AL3). This removed almost all (&gt;95%) of the Mg, Fe and Mn and 82% of the Ca with REE dissolution of about 6%. The feed to the test was 39.3% TREO  and  the  leached  material  assayed  67.0%  TREO.  The  acid  demand  was  310  kg/t  of concentrate (100% HCl basis). Although not tested, it will be appreciated that the HCl could be regenerated using lower cost H2SO4.

Pre-leached residue was roasted and leached to determine if a pre-leach - roast - leach was viable. Roasting was done in air for four hours at 62ÂºC. Two HCl leach tests were done, both at 30ÂºC for four hours, one at 10% solids and the other at 20% solids (Tests AL5 and AL6). REE extraction in both tests were about 85%.

The  pregnant  leach  solutions  (PLS)  from  the  roast  -  leach  procedures  were  combined  and subjected  to  REE  recovery  tests  which  yielded  a  precipitate  containing  70%  TREO  with  some contamination by Na, Ca, Cl, F, and Si. The Th assay was reported at 0.002%.

## 13.4.2 PEA Program of Testwork

A second program of hydrometallurgical testing was started in mid-2019 using flotation concentrate produced by SGS from a 30 t bulk sample which was received at SGS in early 2019 as described in Section 13.3.4. A report on hydrometallurgy was issued in early 2020 (SGS 2020) and a paper describing the beneficiation and hydrometallurgical work was published the same year (Verbaan, Liu, Johnson, Gunning, Aghamirian, and MacNeil, 2020). Testwork continued through to late 2021 and is recorded in another SGS report (SGS 2021c).

The emphasis of the testwork conducted on flotation concentrate was to investigate and optimize the hydrometallurgical flowsheet illustrated in Figure 13-3, which was extracted from an SGS report (SGS 2020).

As  indicated  in  Figure  13-3,  the  process  includes  a  pre-leach  ('gangue  leach')  step  that  uses hydrochloric acid to dissolve gangue minerals away from the REE-carrying minerals. The REE containing  leach  residue  is  subsequently  processed  in  a  caustic  crack  step  to  convert  REE phosphates and fluorides into acid soluble REE hydroxides. The REE hydroxides are leached in hydrochloric acid and the leach solution is treated to remove impurities such as iron, aluminium, phosphorous  and  thorium.  A  purified  mixed  REE  product  suitable  for  REE  separation  can  be produced  either  by  hydroxide  or  oxalate  precipitation  although  hydroxide  precipitation  using calcium oxide best fits the overall circuit. Final filtrates from gangue leaching and REE precipitation are combined, concentrated by evaporation, and reacted with sulphuric acid to produce 20% (w/w) hydrochloric acid for re-use.

In  the  PEA  program  of  testwork,  approximately  14  gangue  leach  tests  were  performed  under various conditions and using different flotation concentrate samples generated in the flotation pilot plant work. The tests were aimed at maximizing gangue removal whilst leaving REE in the residue. The results of a 6 kg test (BGL1) are reasonably typical and cover a concentrate containing 46% TREO which was leached for two hours at 50ÂºC at a pH held at 3.0. The HCl consumption was 152 kg/t, REE dissolution was about 1%, mass loss was 21%, with dissolution of Mg and Mn about 86%, 71% iron dissolution, and 57% Ca dissolution.

Gangue leach residues were subjected to caustic cracking and acid leaching procedures under a wide range of conditions. In all, about twenty-eight (28) caustic crack procedures and thirty-four (34)  leach  tests  on  caustic  cracked  products  were  completed.  Tests  explored  various  flotation concentrates, gangue leach parameters, caustic crack and acid leach conditions.

Typical results are exemplified by caustic crack test BCC1 followed by acid leach test AL4-BCC1 on that caustic crack residue. In caustic crack test BCC1, the BGL1 residue (discussed above) was cracked using 50% NaOH solution at 150ÂºC for four hours with a ratio of NaOH (100% basis) to BGL1 residue of 2 t/t. The BCC1 residue was well washed then leached with hydrochloric acid at 50ÂºC for  hours with a target free acid level of 50 g/L. The extraction of the key REE were 90% and acid added and consumed 724 kg/t and 472 kg/t of caustic cracked product respectively.

The  extraction  of  90%  is  lower  than  is  normally  seen  in  caustic  cracked  material  and  SGS investigated a second stage of cracking on acid leached residue to see if higher extractions were possible using such a process. The process of gangue leach, caustic cracking, and acid leaching leads to an acid leach residue that is typically about 11% of the original concentrate mass. Thus, a second caustic crack of such a small mass is not that onerous. Results showed that overall REE extractions could be increased to 95%.

The undiluted AL4-BCC1 pregnant leach solution contained 98 g/L of REE along with 1.6 g/L Fe, 0.1 g/L Mn, 0.25 g/L Th and 0.06 g/L U. Solution purification tests on similar solutions, for example test PN5 using CaCO3 for pH adjustment to ~pH 2.5 and Na2SO4 addition to precipitate Ba and Ra, showed that REE losses could be kept below 1% and impurities of concern (Al, Fe, P, Ba, and Th) could be effectively removed.

Rare earth precipitation from purified leach solutions was examined in six tests using either lime slurry or oxalic acid as the precipitant. Parallel precipitation tests (RP3 and RP5) were performed on purified pregnant leach solution with the results summarized in Figure 13-3.

Figure 13-3: Impurities in REE oxalate and hydrate precipitates

<!-- image -->

In general, oxalic acid made a purer product but the impurity levels are very low and reasonable with either reagent. CaO is preferred since it allows for near complete recovery of the HCl used in the acid leach step.

The regeneration of NaOH and HCl will be important steps in the selected flowsheet. The NaOH used in the caustic crack step becomes partially converted to sodium compounds with fluorine, carbonate, and sulphate being the main components and phosphate, aluminium, silicate and zinc being  of  lesser  importance.  Many  of  these  components  can  be  precipitated  using  CaO  in  a causticization process similar to that practised in Bayer alumina production plants and elsewhere.

SGS completed two causticization tests at 90ÂºC on spent caustic crack solution. CaO was added over a four-hour period at progressively higher levels up to as high as 500% of stoichiometric as calculated  for  reaction  with  the  Na2SiO3,  Na3PO4,  Na2SO4,  NaAlO2,  NaF,  and  Na2CO3  in solution as indicated by assay. The solutions generally contained very low levels of impurity and only a few changes were detectable. The tests showed between 20 and 40% of the F was removed

from solution. CO3 was only followed in one test and that showed about 50% removal at 75% stoichiometric and a slow decrease as more CaO was added reaching 70% at 200% stoichiometric. Both  tests  showed  more  than  95%  removal  of  phosphorous  at  a  CaO  addition  of  100% stoichiometric or less.

The other component of NaOH regeneration is evaporation and that was not tested.

The test results suggest that impurity elimination from spent NaOH solution by causticization will be effective. However, an integrated pilot operation is needed to confirm that this is the case.

Hydrochloric acid regeneration requires that all or most cations other than Ca be removed from the regeneration  process  feed.  This  in  turn  means  that  the  gangue  leach  liquor  and  the  REE precipitation filtrates be processed to eliminate Mg, Mn and other species and that Na be kept out of the acid leach circuits. Suitable solution must then be evaporated to give at least 400 g/L CaCl2 in solution and the strong solution reacted with sulphuric acid to form gypsum and HCl solution containing at least 20% HCl. Tests and data are insufficient to prove this circuit but issues are not likely.

SGS has recently undertaken three acid bake tests on flotation concentrate.  These gave promising results  with  extraction of key REE such as Pr and Nd at 95% or greater.  More testing of this alternative to the caustic crack approach is planned.

## 13.5 SRK Comments

## 13.5.1 Beneficiation

The metallurgical test programs that have been conducted are suitable for a PEA study. These programs have been conducted on relatively high grade test composites containing about 4.8% TREO. It is noted, however, that actual mined grades will be significantly lower. During the first 10 years of production the plant feed will range from about 2.1% to 3.0% TREO and will continue to decline during production years 11-16 from about 1.9% to 1.2% TREO. It is likely that the lower mined mill feed grades will result in lower REO recoveries and concentrate grades than have been indicated  during  the  PEA  metallurgical  programs.  During  the  next  phase  of  study  metallurgical testwork  will  need  to  be  conducted  on  test  composites  representing  planned  mine  production grades and mineral content in order to confirm achievable REO recovery and concentrate grades.

## 13.5.2 Hydrometallurgy

Sufficient hydrometallurgical testwork has been done for a PEA study of the Wicheeda project. The work has been performed using reasonable procedures.

The hydrometallurgical work was conducted on flotation concentrate generated from a high-grade sample. It is important that future work be conducted on concentrates obtained from mill feed that is representative of production grades and that these concentrates be generated from pilot flotation operations  conducted  under  expected  production  conditions.  It  is  also  essential  to  examine

variability samples and to conduct prolonged hydrometallurgical pilot plant campaigns to ensure that long-term accumulation of material in the closed-loop circuits is fully understood.

The  proposed  caustic  crack  flowsheet  is  reasonable  for  a  PEA  stage  of  development.  Future development work should critically examine the merit of the pre-leach process. It might be best to process the flotation concentrate by caustic conversion directly without using a pre-leach.

The recovery of REE from the caustic conversion residue by acid leaching is low at 89% for Pr and Nd. Methods of increasing this are worth investigating. All process steps need further study but especially the regeneration and recirculation of NaOH and HCl.

It is noted that liquid-solid separation (LSS) tests have not yet been performed. These critical unit operations need careful evaluation prior to further studies.

It is also noted that sulphuric acid baking should be further examined as an alternative to the caustic cracking route. Acid baking or REE concentrates is extensively used in China and also in Malaysia with another such plant under construction in Australia (Goode, 2019).

Finally, the stability of the residues generated by the hydrometallurgical plant need to be evaluated both as individual materials and when combined with flotation tailings.

## 14 Mineral Resource Estimate

## 14.1 Introduction

This section details the statistical analysis, geological modelling, and resource estimation work for the  updated  MRE  completed  for  the  Wicheeda  REE  project  located  near  Prince  George,  BC, Canada. The MRE detailed in this report now supersedes the MRE reported in the previous NI 43101 report (Raffle and Nicholls, 2020). The estimated metals include cerium (Ce), dysprosium (Dy), europium (Eu), gadolinium (Gd), holmium (Ho), lanthanum (La), neodymium (Nd), praseodymium (Pr), samarium (Sm), and terbium (Tb).

The MRE is predominately based on an unchanged geological model and methodologies used to calculate the 2020 MRE. Differences relate to the incorporation of pulp REE multi-element fusion ICP-MS, re-assay of the 2008 and 2009 drillholes, reducing the uncertainty regarding the historical incomplete XRF analytical results, updated estimation parameters, and a 2020 LiDAR survey. The increased  resolution  of  the  LiDAR  allows  for  more  robust  mine  planning,  particularly  when considering the high relief within the project area.

The MRE was prepared by Mr. Warren Black, M.Sc., P.Geo. of APEX Geoscience Ltd under the supervision of the QP, Mr. AndrÃ© M. Deiss, B.Sc (Hons), Pri.Sci.Nat. of SRK Consulting (Canada) Inc.,  in  accordance  with  CIM  Definition  Standards.  Mr.  Deiss  has  reviewed  the  drillhole  hole samples and composites used for the estimation, estimation parameters used in the OK process, estimation  results  and  validations,  and  has  accepted  the  MRE  as  he  considers  them  to  be  in accordance with Industry standard practices. The workflow implemented for the calculation of the MRE  was  completed  using  the  commercial  mine  planning  software  MICROMINE  v  21.0 (Micromine).  The  Anaconda  Python  distribution  (Continuum  Analytics,  2019)  was  used  for supplemental data analysis.

Definitions  used  in  this  section  are  consistent  with  those  adopted  by  the  Canadian  Institute  of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum ("CIM") Council in 'Estimation of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves  Best  Practice  Guidelines'  dated  November  29,  2019  and  'Definition  Standards  for Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves' dated May 10, 2014 and prescribed by the Canadian Securities  Administrators'  NI  43-101  and  Form  43-101F1,  Standards  of  Disclosure  for  Mineral projects.  Mineral  resources  that  are  not  mineral  reserves  do  not  have  demonstrated  economic viability.

## 14.2 Drillhole Data Description

Defence Metals provided APEX with the historical drillhole database for the Wicheeda project that comprised  of  data  collected  from  2008  to  2009,  before  involvement  with  the  program.  APEX reviewed the data in 2019 to ensure it was suitable for resource estimation. Data from the recent 2019 drilling program was captured and validated by APEX during the 2019 drilling program, after which APEX compiled the results with the historical data.

The drillhole database used to calculate the MRE comprises 27 exploration diamond drillholes completed in 2008 and 2009 by previous operators (14 holes totalling 2,244 meters) and in 2019 by  Defence  Metals  (13  holes  totalling  2,005  m),  containing  a  total  of  1,315  drill  core  samples analyzed for REE by multi-element fusion ICP-MS. Sample intervals ranged from 0.5 to 7.1 m in length, with 96% of the intervals having a length of 3.0 m or less. Drillhole collars are snapped to the LiDAR surface.

Contained in the drillhole database are 33 intervals that were not analyzed. These blank intervals are commonly found at the top of drillholes before mineralization is first encountered or at the end of the drillhole after exiting the mineralized zone. APEX evaluated supporting documents to assess if  these blank intervals were either identified as waste material and, therefore, not analyzed on purpose or if there was not enough material returned during drilling to allow the interval to be analyzed. It is  essential  to  distinguish  between  these  two  cases  as  they  are  treated  differently during resource estimation. Intervals classified as "no sample" (NS) are assigned a nominal waste as described in Table 14-1. Intervals classified as "insufficient recovery" (IR) are left blank. APEX was conservative when classifying the type of blank interval as NS and IR. If  APEX could not confidently determine that a blank interval was IR, it is assumed NS. All 33 blank intervals are classified as NS, totalling 414.5 m, and were assigned a nominal waste value.

All data was validated using the Micromine validation tools at the time the data was imported into the software. No validation errors were encountered. A detailed discussion on the verification of both historical and 2019 drillhole data is provided in Section 11 and 12 of this report. The APEX authors of this report consider the current Wicheeda drillhole database to be in good condition and suitable to use in ongoing resource estimation studies.

## 14.3 Estimation Domain Interpretation

## 14.3.1 Geological Interpretation of Mineralization Domains

REE-enriched carbonatites of the Wicheeda Deposit are part of a narrow, elongate, northwestsoutheast  trending  intrusive  carbonatite-syenite  sill  complex.  The  carbonatite  is  intruded  into syenite, mafic dikes, limestone and calcareous sedimentary wall rocks. The Wicheeda REE Deposit has dimensions of approximately 400 m north-south by 100-250 m east-west. Diamond drilling data supports  the  interpretation  of  a  moderately  north-northeast  dipping,  shallowly  north  plunging, layered sill complex having syenite at its base. It is overlain by hybrid matrix to clast-supported limestone or mafic intrusive xenolithic  carbonatite  (fenite),  as  well  as  significantly  REE-bearing dolomite-carbonatite rocks, which form the main body of the Wicheeda REE Deposit outcropping at surface. This layered sill complex occurs within an unmineralized limestone waste rock. There is no near-surface oxidized material due to recent glaciation.

A north-northwest striking moderately northeast (approximately 60Â°) dipping fault is interpreted to transect the Wicheeda deposit. The drill data supports an approximately 100 m reverse eastsideup  offset  of  the  modelled  base  of  the  dolomite  carbonatite  and  xenolithic  carbonatite  contacts across the fault. The presence of the fault is inferred based on limited drill  hole data and it is uncertain whether the apparent offset of the sill complex occurs as a result of a discrete fault (as currently modelled), composite deformation zone, blind thrust, or recumbent fold. It is considered likely that the reality is a hybrid of one or more of these; all of which are consistent with the regional geologic setting with the Foreland Belt. Based on the drill results to date, the eastern margin of the Wicheeda REE Deposit is marked by a north-northwest trending sub-vertical lithologic contact.

The drill pads considered in the MRE detailed in this report are in areas of very high relief. Drillholes from them were collared directly into outcrop or minor amounts of talus/rubble material. There is not enough overburden material within the resource area to materially impact the MRE. However, glacial material does cover bedrock as you move west from the resource area down-slope, which is  beyond  the  extent  of  the  resource  pit  detailed  in  this  section.  Future  resources  will  need  to consider that material if mining or resources extend further west.

## 14.3.2 Estimation Domain Interpretation Methodology

For the purposes of calculating the MRE, the syenite-carbonatite complex geology was simplified into four lithologic domains within the 3-D rock model that have different mineralization controls and styles that contain varying grades of REE. These domains (and there short name for charts and tables) are:

- Â· Dolomite Carbonatite (DC)
- Â· Xenolithic Carbonatite (Xeno)
- Â· Syenite (Syn)
- Â· Limestone (Lim)

Drillhole  intervals  were  classified  as  one  of  the  four  lithologic  domains  based  on  their  logged lithology.  There  are  instances  where  a  small  interval  contained  within  a  dominant  domain  was simplified  to  the  dominant  lithology.  Relatively  high-grade  REE  mineralization  occurs  within Dolomite-Carbonatite (where country rock xenoliths are &lt;20%). Xenolithic Carbonatite represents a  hybrid  mixed  lithology  where  discontinuous  narrow  dikes  and  breccia-zones  of  dolomitecarbonatite intrude fenitized limestone, syenite, and mafic dike xenoliths comprising between 3070% of the rock volume. Syenite rocks are interpreted to represent the earliest intrusive phase of the  intrusive  complex.  REE-poor  host  rocks  include  fresh  and  fenitized  limestone,  calcareous sedimentary rocks, and volumetrically minor mafic dikes.

The geological model was created by first modelling a 3-D surface of the Central Fault and contacts between the domains using implicit modelling. Contacts on either side of the Central Fault were modelled independently, creating distinct domains for the east and west fault block. The surfaces were  projected  from  drilling  to  the  geological  model's  boundary  based  on  their  interpreted orientations. The model's extents were defined by ensuring that any resource pits would be fully contained within it, allowing waste blocks to be assigned the correct density. 3-D wireframe solids were constructed using the bounding contact surfaces and ultimately cut to the LiDAR topography surface. The final 3-D geological model is composed of a solid on either side of the Central Fault for  each of the four domains, totalling eight solids. The 3-D rock model was used to discretize drillhole  data  and  the  volume  of  the  deposit  into  distinct  zones  (domains)  that  were  treated separately during exploratory data analysis and resource estimation.

## 14.4 Exploratory Data Analysis and Compositing

## 14.4.1 Bulk Density

APEX completed an analysis of the available density data to determine what bulk density value to apply to the block model. The Wicheeda project database contains 795 density measurements within  the  estimation  domains.  Table  14-2  details  summary  statistics  of  the  measurements categorized by which estimation domain contains each collected sample. Figure 14-4 illustrates the variation in the measurements within each of the estimation domains coloured the sample intervals Ce assay to evaluate the relationship between density and grade.

Within the violin plot, the white points represent the median value while the while tail and whiskers represent the median value's 95% confidence interval. All the domains illustrate a single population besides the Xenolithic Carbonatite domain, which appears to have multiple rock types with different densities. However, there currently isn't enough high-resolution data to be able to separate the Xenolithic Carbonatite into sub-domains for more representative density assignment; therefore, it is treated as a single population. The median (50 th -percentile) density value from each domain was

used to assign density to each block based on its dominant rock type. Density values applied to the block model were: 2.94 g/cm 3  (Dolomite Carbonatite), 2.87 g/cm 3  (Xenolithic Carbonatite), 2.70 g/cm 3  (Syenite), and 2.74 g/cm 3  (Limestone).

| Domain                  |   Count |   Mean |   Std |   Min |   25% |   50% |   75% |   Max |

| Xenolithic  Carbonatite |      46 |   2.85 |  0.2  |  2.45 |  2.73 |  2.87 |  2.94 |  3.74 |

## 14.4.3 Contact Analysis

The mineralization profile at the contact between different estimation domains can occur in a soft, hard, or  semi-soft  manner. Soft boundaries occur when mineralization at the contact gradually changes from high to low as you cross into the neighbouring domain. Hard boundaries occur when mineralization at the contact abruptly changes as you cross into the neighbouring domain. Semisoft boundaries occur when mineralization changes gradually within a small window as you cross into the neighbouring domain. APEX completed a contact analysis to evaluate the mineralization profile  at  each  estimation domain contact using plots of grade as a function of distance to the contact to determine the type of mineralization profile.

Within the geological model used for this MRE, there are 16 different domain-domain contacts, eight  within  each  of  the  two  fault  blocks.  There  are  no  drillholes  that  pierce  the  Xenolithic Carbonatite and Limestone contact in both fault blocks, and the syenite-limestone contact in the west fault  block.  There  are  also  eight  different  contacts  defined  by  the  fault  surface;  of  which, drillholes pierced only the Dolomite Carbonatite to Dolomite Carbonatite contacts (Figure 14-6).

Drillholes that pierce each contact are identified and plotted as downhole contact plots that display Ce assays as a function  of  distance  from  the  contact.  As  illustrated  in  Figure  14-6,  there  are instances of both hard and soft boundaries that do not provide a definitive answer on how to treat the contact during estimation. The current interpretation of the geological model suggests that the orientation of mineralization on either side of the fault is different. Therefore, all contacts between the fault blocks were treated as hard boundaries.

Contact  analysis  of  all  the  domain-domain  contacts  within  each  of  the  fault  blocks  illustrated instances of both hard and soft boundaries. However, the contacts' mineralization profile would predominantly display a hard boundary profile. This agrees with the current interpretation of how mineralization occurs at the contacts between the domains. Therefore, all contacts between the domains were treated as hard boundaries.

## 14.4.4 Compositing Methodology

Downhole sample length analysis  shows  sample  lengths  range  from  0.50  to  7.05  m,  with  the dominant sample length being 3.00 m. A composite length of 3.00 m is selected as it provides adequate resolution  for  mining  purposes  and  is  equal  to,  or  larger  than  96.0%  of  the  drillhole samples. Of the 1,315 core samples, 52 are larger than the composite length and are all from intervals dominated by rubbly core recovery and were the minimum appropriate sample length.

The length-weighted compositing process starts from the drillhole collar and ends at the bottom of the hole. However, the final composite intervals along the drillhole cannot cross contacts between estimation domains that demonstrate a hard boundary. Therefore, composites extending downhole

are  truncated  when  one  of  these  contacts  are  intersected.  A  new  composite  begins  at  these contacts and continues to extend downhole until the maximum composite interval length is reached, or another truncating contact is intersected.

There are very few instances where two estimation domains are in contact, and when this happens, the contact is treated as a hard boundary. Therefore, the resulting composites are fully contained within  their  respective  estimation  domains  or  are  classified  as  waste  if  they  lie  outside  of  the estimation domain wireframes.

Note: Intervals that were not sampled or had insufficient recovery are not considered

## 14.4.5 Orphan Analysis

Composites that do not reach their  maximum allowed length are called orphans. Orphans are created during the truncation processes at contacts, as described in Section 14.4.4, or when a drillhole ends before the last composite reaches its final length. Considering all the orphans during the  estimation  process  may  introduce  a  bias.  Therefore,  the  distributions  of  each  metal  were examined with and without orphans to determine if they should be deemed equivalent in importance to the estimation process as full-length composites are. Three configurations are examined for this analysis:

- 1. Composites that are 3.00 m in length without any orphans
- 2. Composites and orphans greater than or equal to 1.50 m in length
- 3. All composites and orphans

It  is  common to observe a decrease in the mean when comparing the composite values to the original raw assay statistics. This decrease in the mean is typical as large un-sampled intervals (that  are  assigned a nominal waste value, as discussed in  Section 14.2) are split into multiple smaller intervals. Also, by not snapping truncating contacts of the estimation domain wireframes to the start or end of raw sample intervals, many orphans can be created that create redundant data that is not representative that may skew the resource estimate.

APEX completed orphan analysis for all metals estimated for the MRE.

Figure 14-8 illustrates little difference between the distribution of composited metal grade with the various composite length scenarios. When comparing only the composites that are equal to 3.00 m to all composites, including the orphans, all metals illustrate a mean change of Â±1% except for Nd, which  shows  an  increase  of  2.94%  when  orphans  are  considered  (Table  14-4).  The  28  to  38 orphans that are â¥1.50 m in length are used when calculating the MRE. However, the 22 to 29 orphans that are &lt;1.50 m in length are not used to calculate the MRE as they are considered redundant.

## 14.4.6 Declustering

It is typical to collect data in a manner that preferentially samples high valued areas over low-value areas. This preferential sampling is an acceptable practice; however, it produces closely spaced measurements that are likely statistically redundant, which results in under-represented sparse data compared to the closer-spaced data. Therefore, it is desirable to have spatially representative (i.e.,  declustered)  statistics  for  global  resource  assessment  and  to  check  estimated  models. Declustering techniques calculate a weight for each datum that results in sparse data having a higher  weight  than  closely  spaced  data.  The  calculated  declustering  weights  allow  spatially repetitive summary statistics to be calculated, such as a declustered mean.

Cell  declustering  is  performed  globally  on  all  composites  within  the  estimation  domains,  which calculates a declustering weight for each composite. Cell declustering works by discretizing a 3-D volume into cells that are the same size. The sum of the weights of all the composites within the cell must equal 1. Therefore, the weight assigned to each composite is proportional to the number of composites within each cell. For example, if there are four composites within a cell, they are all assigned a declustering weight of 0.25.

APEX calculated declustering weights for each estimation domain separately. Visual evaluation of the sparsely sampled areas in Micromine suggests similar cell sizes as the 90-percentiles from the distance block model for each estimation domain (Figure 14-9 and Figure 14-10). APEX used plots comprised of a series of declustered means for a range of declustering cell sizes to inform the final cell sizes. For example, Figure 14-10 illustrates the sequence of declustered Sm means for each rock type within the eastern fault block. Table 14-5 details the cell sizes used, and all were very close to the size indicated by the visual evaluation and distance block model

Table 14-5: Cell sizes used to calculate declustering weight in each estimation domain

## 14.4.7 Capping

To  ensure  metal  grades  are  not  overestimated  by  including  outlier  values  during  estimation, composites are capped to a specified maximum value. Probability plots illustrating all values are used to identify outlier values that appear higher than expected relative to the composite population of  each  metal  with  the  estimation  domains.  Cumulative  probability  plots  used  to  select  the respective capping levels are shown in Figure 14-11. Visual inspection of the potential outliers revealed they have no spatial continuity with each other. The capping levels detailed in Table 14-6 were applied to the composites for the MRE.

## 14.4.8 Final Composite Statistics

Cumulative  histograms  and  summary  statistics  for  the  declustered  and  capped  composites contained within the interpreted estimation domains, without orphans &lt;1.5 m, are presented in Figure 14-12 and tabulated in Table 14-7. The assays within each domain generally exhibit a single population for all metals. The large number of waste values within the Limestone domain are due to  discretization  of  large  intervals  of  unsampled  rock  being  that  were  assigned  a  nominal  into smaller composites.

Note: Capped values are highlighted in red

## 14.4.9 Variography and Grade Continuity

Experimental semi-variograms for each lode are calculated along the major, minor, and vertical principal directions of continuity that are defined by three Euler angles. Euler angles describe the orientation of anisotropy as a series of rotations (using a left-hand rule) that are as follows:

- 1. A rotation about the Z-axis (azimuth) with positive angles being clockwise rotation and negative representing counter-clockwise rotation
- 2. A rotation about the X-axis (dip) with positive angles being counter-clockwise rotation and negative representing clockwise rotation
- 3. A rotation about the Y-axis (tilt) with positive angles being clockwise rotation and negative representing counter-clockwise rotation

At this stage of the project, representative experimental variograms can only be calculated for the eastern  fault-block  Dolomite  Carbonatite  domain.  Therefore,  it  is  assumed  that  the  range  and standardized covariance contribution and nugget effect parameters for each metal are the same across all rock types.

Utilizing a correlogram algorithm, experimental semi-variograms are calculated for all the estimated metals  using  the  composites  within  the  eastern  fault-block  Dolomite  Carbonatite  domain.  A variogram model was fitted to each metal's experimental variogram. Examples for La, Pr, Nd, Sm, Tb and Dy are represented in Figure 14-13 to Figure 14-18 respectively. Each metal's variogram nugget  effect  and  covariance  contribution  parameters  are  standardized  and  reported  as  a percentage to allow them to be scaled to each estimation domains variance for kriging purposes (Table 14-8).

## 14.5 Wicheeda Block Model

## 14.5.1 Block Model Parameters

The  block  model  used  for  the  Wicheeda  MRE  fully  encapsulates  the  estimation  domains  as described in Section 14.4. When determining block model parameters, data spacing is the primary consideration,  ensuring  the  volume  of  the  3-D  estimation  domain  wireframes  is  reasonably reproduced while considering potential mining equipment parameters.

Estimation errors are introduced when kriging is used to estimate a grade for blocks with a size larger  than  25%  of  the  data  spacing.  The  data  spacing  of  irregularly  spaced  samples  can  be approximated by the 90-percentile of a high-resolution block model populated with the distance to each block  nearest  composite.  As  illustrated  in  Figure  14-9,  the  90-percentiles  are  as  follows: Dolomite Carbonatite - 60.6 m; Xenolithic Carbonatite - 77.9 m; Syenite - 77.3 m; and Limestone - 89.7 m. Therefore, a block size of 3 m by 3 m by 3 m is used, as it is less than 25% of the approximated data spacing. The coordinate ranges and block size dimensions used to build the Wicheeda 3-D block model are presented in Table 14-9.

A  block  factor  (BF)  representing  the  percentage  of  each  block's  volume  that  lies  within  each estimation domain was calculated and used to:

- Â· flag what the estimation domain is for each block.
- Â· calculate the volume of mineralized material and waste for each block.
- Â· calculate the tonnes of mineralized material of each block when calculating the MRE.

## 14.5.2 Volumetric Checks

A comparison of estimation domain wireframe volumes versus block model volumes  illustrates there is no considerable over- or under-stating of tonnages (Table 14-10). The calculated block factor for each block is used to scale its volume when calculating the block model's total volume within each estimation domain.

## 14.6 Grade Estimation Methodology

OK was used  to  estimate  REE  metal  grades  into  the  block  model.  Grade  estimates  are  only calculated for blocks that contain more than 12.5% mineralized material by volume.

A single-pass method was used based on the range of the variogram model, search ellipsoid and kriging  parameter  configurations  (Table  14-11).  Volume-variance  corrections  are  enforced  by restricting the maximum number of conditioning data to 15 and the maximum number of composites from each drillhole by 3. These restrictions are implemented to ensure the estimated models are not over smoothed, which would lead to inaccurate estimation of global tonnage and grade. These corrections  cause local conditional  bias but ensure the global estimate of grade and tonnes is accurately estimated.

Estimation  of  blocks  is  completed  with  locally  varying  anisotropy  (LVA),  which  uses  different rotation angles to define the principal directions of the variogram model and search ellipsoid on a per-block basis. Blocks within the estimation domain are assigned rotation angles using a trend surface wireframe. This method allows structural complexities to be reproduced in the estimated block  model.  Variogram  and  search  ranges  are  defined  by  the  variogram  model  described  in Section 14.4.9.

## 14.7 Model Validation

APEX completed visual and statistical validation to ensure that the estimated block model honors directional trends observed in the composites and that the block model is not over-smoothed or over- or under-estimated. However, as discussed in Section 14.7.1, the only economical estimation domains are the Dolomite Carbonatite and Xenolithic Carbonatite. Because no blocks from the Syenite and Limestone domains are above the cut-off grade, the validation completed for those domains is not detailed in this section to keep the discussion focused.

## 14.7.1 Visual Validation

The block model was visually validated in plan view and in cross-section (Figure 14-19 and Figure 14-20) to compare the estimated metal values versus the conditioning composites. Overall, the model  compares  well  with  the  composites.  There  is  some  local  over-  and  under-estimation observed. Due to the limited number of conditioning data available for the estimation in those areas, this is the expected result. Overall, the estimated block values compare well with composite metal values.

## 14.7.2 Statistical Validation

## Swath Plots

Swath plots verify that the estimated block model honours directional trends and identifies potential areas of over- or under-estimation. They are generated by calculating the average metal grades of composites and estimated block models within directional slices. All three directional slices used a window of 30 m.

Swath  plots  for  all  metals  estimates  in  the  Dolomite-Carbonatite  and  Xenolithic  Carbonatite estimation domains are illustrated in Figure 14-21 to Figure 14-24 respectively. There are minor

instances of localized over- and under-estimation; however, it is believed to be a product of a lack of conditioning data in those areas and the smoothing effect of kriging. Overall, the block model adequately reproduces the trends observed in the composites in all three directions.

## Volume-Variance Validation

As  described  in  Section  14.6,  volume-variance  corrections  are  used  to  ensure  the  estimated models are not over-smoothed, which would lead to inaccurate estimation of global tonnage and grade. To verify that the correct level of smoothing is achieved, theoretical histograms that indicate the anticipated variance and distribution of each estimated metal at the selected block model size are calculated and plotted against the estimated final block model. Various amounts of smoothing are observed in each of the four estimation domains. The eastern fault block Dolomite-Carbonatite is particularly over-smoothed. APEX believes this is mainly due to the sparsely sampled areas of the estimation domain because limited drilling is informing a large volume of rock. As described in Section 14.8, these sparsely sampled areas are classified as inferred resource. Smoothing within the Xenolithic Carbonatite estimation domains and the west fault block Dolomite Carbonatite are adequate, given the limited number of conditioning data. Continued infill drilling and more refined estimation domain interpretations will help control smoothing in future work. For example, if lowgrade zones within the Dolomite Carbonatite can be isolated from high-grade zones based on mappable geological characteristics, creating estimation domains for each will likely provide the most benefit. However, at this time, there is not enough drilling to be able to identify and map those zones confidently at a scale appropriate for resource estimation.

## 14.8 Mineral Resource Classification

The Update Wicheeda Project MRE discussed in this report has been classified in accordance with guidelines established by the CIM 'Estimation of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves Best Practice  Guidelines'  dated  November  29,  2019  and  CIM  'Definition  Standards  for  Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves' dated May 10, 2014.

A measured mineral resource is that part of a mineral resource for which quantity, grade or quality, densities, shape, and physical characteristics are estimated with confidence sufficient to allow the application  of  Modifying  Factors  to  support  detailed  mine  planning  and  final  evaluation  of  the economic  viability  of  the  deposit.  Geological  evidence  is  derived  from  detailed  and  reliable exploration,  sampling  and  testing  and  is  sufficient  to  confirm  geological  and  grade  or  quality continuity  between  points  of  observation.  A  measured  mineral  resource  has  a  higher  level  of confidence  than  that  applying  to  either  an  indicated  mineral  resource  or  an  inferred  mineral resource. It may be converted to a proven mineral reserve or to a probable mineral reserve.

An indicated mineral resource is that part of a mineral resource for which quantity, grade or quality, densities, shape and physical characteristics are estimated with sufficient confidence to allow the application of modifying factors in sufficient detail to support mine planning and evaluation of the economic viability  of  the  deposit.  Geological  evidence  is  derived  from  adequately  detailed  and reliable exploration, sampling and testing and is sufficient to assume geological and grade or quality continuity  between  points  of  observation.  An  indicated  mineral  resource  has  a  lower  level  of confidence than that applying to a measured mineral resource and may only be converted to a probable mineral reserve.

An inferred mineral resource is that part of a mineral resource for which quantity and grade or quality are estimated on the basis of limited geological evidence and sampling. Geological evidence is sufficient to imply but not verify geological and grade or quality continuity. An inferred mineral resource has a lower level of confidence than that applying to an indicated mineral resource and must not be converted to a mineral reserve. It is reasonably expected that the majority of inferred mineral resources could be upgraded to indicated mineral resources with continued exploration.

The 2021 Wicheeda MRE update is classified as an indicated and inferred resource according to the  CIM  Definition  Standards.  The  classification  of  the  Wicheeda  resource  does  not  include measured resources as there is not enough drilling to be able to:

- Â· define the boundary of mineralization at a high enough level of accuracy and precision for production planning
- Â· provide a high-level of confidence in the geological interpretation
- Â· define the physical properties and density of both waste and mineralized Xenolithic Carbonatite, Syenite, and Limestone for production planning
- Â· determine if the Dolomite-Carbonatite can be subdivided into more detailed estimation domains or not

The  indicated  resources  within  the  MRE  are  restricted  to  the  eastern  fault  block  DolomiteCarbonatite as it is the only domain that:

- Â· contains sufficient composites to allow a variogram to be specifically modelled
- Â· contains sufficient drilling to have a reasonable understanding of its extents and the directions of grade continuity

A search neighbourhood method is used to flag blocks as indicated if a set of search criteria are met. The search is completed by centring an ellipsoid on each estimated block centroid, orientating it, modifying its ranges, and determining the number of composites and drillholes found within it. If the criteria outlined in Table 14-12 are met, the block is classified as indicated.

Table 14-12: Search criteria used to flag blocks as indicated resource

| Run  No.   | Classification   |   Min No.  Holes |   Max  Comps  Per Hole |   Min No.  Comp |   Major  Range  (m) |   Minor  Range  (m) |   Vertical  Range  (m) |
|------------|------------------|------------------|------------------------|-----------------|---------------------|---------------------|------------------------|
| Run 1      | Indicated        |                5 |                      3 |              15 |                  90 |                  60 |                      9 |

All blocks within the other three reported estimation domains are classified as inferred as they do not meet the minimum criteria detailed above.

Mineral resources are not mineral reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability.

## 14.9 Evaluation of Reasonable Prospects for Eventual Economic Extraction

To demonstrate that the Wicheeda REE Deposit has the potential for future economic extraction, the unconstrained resource block model was subjected to a LG pit optimization. The cut-off grade is  calculated,  and the LG pit is optimized based on the assumption that the hydrometallurgical processes  can  produce  mixed  REE  precipitates.  The  parameters  used  include  the  following considerations:

- Â· TREO price: USD18.66/kg
- Â· Exchange rate of 1.30 C$:USD
- Â· Processing cost includes USD21.47/t of mill feed for flotation plus a variable cost for hydrometallurgical  plant  that  varies  based  on  the  feed  grade.  The  average  cost  of hydrometallurgical plant is assumed to be USD1,204/t of concentrate.
- Â· Mining cost of C$2.00/t for mill feed and waste
- Â· G&amp;A Costs included in the processing cost is C$6 M/yr
- Â· The overall process recoveries: For TREO&gt;=2.3%, recovery is 69.6%; between 2.3% and 1.5% TREO, recovery is 65.3%; and less than 1.5% TREO, recovery is 52.2%. These assume variable flotation recoveries and a constant 87% hydrometallurgical recovery.

## Â· Overall pit slope angles vary by zone between 40Â° and 48Â°

Estimated  operating  costs  are  based  on  similar  sized  mine,  mill,  and  site  operations.  The  Wicheeda resource  was  constrained  by  a  long-range  LG  pit  limit  utilizing  130%  input  prices  for  a  mixed  REE precipitates  product,  which  is  considered  appropriate  to  evaluate  the  reasonable  prospect  for  future economic extraction utilizing open pit mining methods (Note: Blocks below the reported cut-off of 0.5% TREO are not displayed

Figure 14-25).

Note: Blocks below the reported cut-off of 0.5% TREO are not displayed

<!-- image -->

Mineral resources are reported at a cut-off grade of 0.5% TREO (sum of 10 oxides: CeO2, La2O3, Nd2O3, Pr6O11, Sm2O3, Eu2O3, Gd2O3, Tb4O7, Dy2O3 and Ho2O3). The cut-off grade was established based on consideration of the LG pit optimization, metal price, concentrate payable, metallurgical recovery, and operating cost assumptions and uncertainty. TREO prices were established based on  a  review  of  publicly  available  price  data  and  comparable  carbonatite  intrusion-hosted  REE deposit NI 43-101 MREs.

The SRK QP considers the LG pit parameters appropriate to evaluate the reasonable prospect for future  economic  extraction  of  the  Wicheeda  project  for  the  purpose  of  providing  a  MRE.  The resources  presented  herein  are  not  a  mineral  reserve,  and  they  do  not  have  demonstrated economic  viability.  The  level  of  exploration  drilling  is  insufficient  to  define  measured  mineral

resources. However, with continued drilling increasing the confidence of the geological model and grade estimation, certain inferred and indicated regions could potentially be upgraded to measured mineral resources.

## 14.10  Sources of Risk and Uncertainty in the Mineral Resource Estimation

Factors that may affect the estimates include: metal price and concentrate payable assumptions, changes  in  interpretations  of  mineralization  geometry,  continuity  of  REE  mineralization  zones, changes to kriging assumptions, metallurgical recovery assumptions, operating cost assumptions, confidence  in  the  modifying  factors,  including  assumptions  that  surface  rights  to  allow  mining infrastructure to be constructed will be forthcoming, delays or other issues in reaching agreements with  regulatory  authorities  and  stakeholders,  and  changes  in  land  tenure  requirements  or  in permitting requirements.

There are currently no known additional legal, political, title, taxation, socio-economic, marketing, political or other relevant factors that could materially affect the potential development of the mineral resources. As the project develops and economic studies are completed, more information on these factors will become available.

REO price assumptions are based on the available TREO price information. However, rare earth offtakes are established with long term contracts to a limited number of refineries - primarily in Asia. The  likely  terms  of  these  contracts  are  not  public  information.  Offtake  term  assumptions  are indicative  only.  It  is  not  possible  to  accurately  forecast  these  assumptions,  and  there  is  no guarantee that these terms will be realized. Assumptions on the product sales are indicative of potential market values but moving forward should be confirmed via commercial negotiations with refineries.

Refining charges used to establish reasonable prospects for economic extraction were based on a survey of comparable carbonatite intrusion hosted REE deposit NI 43-101 MREs.

With respect to environmental and permitting risk and uncertainty, the area surrounding Wicheeda Lake has been known to have high recreational and ecological values. The lake and surrounding area  are  currently  covered  under  recreational  reserve  REC6837  established  by  FLNR.  The northern limit of the LG pit lies approximately 400 m southeast of the southern limit of Wicheeda Lake, and approximately 50 m within REC6837 (Figure 4.2). At present there are no restrictions on mineral exploration activities within REC6837. However, FLNR has requested that Defense Metals take all possible steps to minimize the impacts of exploration to the recreational ecological values associated with Wicheeda Lake.

Specific  to  the  calculation  of  the  MRE  detailed  in  this  report,  there  are  several  sources  of uncertainties, particularly within the Xenolithic Carbonatite and the western fault block Dolomite Carbonatite domains, all of which are restricted to an inferred resource classification. These include in decreasing order of importance, in the opinion of APEX, the following:

- Â· Insufficient  data  density  to  confidently  determine  the  boundary  of  the  XenolithicCarbonatite and western fault block dolomite-carbonatite domains

- Â· Insufficient data to calculate variograms for the Xenolithic-Carbonatite and the western fault block Dolomite Carbonatite domains

However, the QP considers that these sources of uncertainty are minor given that approximately 94% of the current resource is hosted within Dolomite Carbonatite rocks, and no current resources of any category occur within the Syenite or Limestone domains.

As described in Section 14.8, the MRE does not include measured resources as there is not enough drilling to:

- Â· define the boundary of mineralization at a high enough level of accuracy and precision for production planning
- Â· provide a high enough level of confidence in the geological interpretation
- Â· define the physical properties and density of both waste and mineralized XenolithicCarbonatite, Syenite, and Limestone for production planning
- Â· determine if the Dolomite-Carbonatite unit in particular can be subdivided into more detailed estimation domains or not

The  SRK  QP  is  unaware  of  any  other  risks  or  uncertainties  that  could  affect  the  accuracy  or confidence of the MRE.

## 14.11  Mineral Resource Reporting

The  updated Wicheeda  MRE  is  reported in accordance  with the Canadian  Securities Administrators NI 43-101 rules for disclosure and has been estimated using the CIM 'Estimation of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves Best Practice Guidelines' dated November 29, 2019 and CIM 'Definition Standards for Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves' dated May 10th, 2014.

A block model with a regularized cell size of 3 m (X) by 3 m (Y) by 3 m (Z) was used to estimate grade  by  OK  for  each  REE  metal.  The  percentage  of  the  volume  of  each  block  below  the topographic surface and within each rock type was calculated using the 3-D geological model and the surface topography digital terrain model (DTM). The search ellipsoid size used to estimate each metal was defined by the modelled variograms, which range from 130 to 140 m in the major axis, 100 m in the minor axis, and 9 to 18 m in the vertical axis. Block estimation employed LVA, which uses different rotation angles to define the principal directions of the variogram model and search ellipsoid on a per-block basis. Blocks within estimation domains are assigned rotation angles using a modelled 3-D mineralization trend surface wireframe, which allows structural complexities to be reproduced in the estimated block model. A total of 795 density measurements were used to assign density to each block based on its dominant rock type. Density values applied to the block model were: 2.94 g/cm 3  (Dolomite Carbonatite), 2.87 g/cm 3  (Xenolithic Carbonatite), 2.70 g/cm3 (Syenite), and 2.74 g/cm 3  (Limestone). The final grade estimates are validated visually by comparing each block's metal estimates to the raw downhole assay data and statistically by generating swath and volume-variance plots.

The updated Wicheeda MRE comprises 5.0 million tonnes indicated mineral resource, averaging 2.95% TREO (Total Rare Earth Oxide: CeO2, La2O3, Nd2O3, Pr6O11, Sm2O3, Eu2O3, Gd2O3, Tb4O7, Dy2O3 and Ho2O3), and 29.5 million tonnes inferred mineral resource, averaging 1.835% TREO, reported at a cut-off grade of 0.5% TREO within a conceptual LG pit shell and is provided in Table 14-13.

Table 14-14 illustrates the sensitivity of each MRE to different cut-off grades for a potential openpit operation scenario with reasonable outlook for economic extraction. The reader is cautioned that  the  figures  provided  in  these  tables  should  not  be  interpreted  as  a  statement  of  mineral resources. Quantities and estimated grades for different cut-off grades are presented for the sole purpose of demonstrating the sensitivity of the resource model to specific cut-off grades.

Notes for Resource Table

- Â· The MRE was prepared by Mr. Warren Black, M.Sc., P.Geo. of APEX Geoscience Ltd under the supervision of the QP, Mr. AndrÃ© M. Deiss, B.Sc. (Hons), Pri.Sci.Nat. of SRK Consulting (Canada) Inc., in accordance with CIM Definition Standards.
- Â· The MRE is classified according to the CIM "Estimation of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves Best Practice Guidelines" dated November 29th, 2019 and CIM "Definition Standards for Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves" dated May 10 th , 2014.
- Â· Mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. There is no guarantee that any part of the mineral resources discussed herein will be converted to a mineral reserve in the future.
- Â· All figures are rounded to reflect the relative accuracy of the estimates. Total may not sum due to rounding.
- Â· Median (50 th -percentile) supported by 795 measurements applied: 2.94 g/cm 3  (Dolomite Carbonatite), 2.87 g/cm 3  (Xenolithic Carbonatite), 2.70 g/cm  (Syenite), and 3 2.74 g/cm 3 (Limestone).
- Â· The reasonable prospect for eventual economic extraction is met by reporting the mineral resources at a cut-off grade of 0.50% TREO (total rare earth oxide, sum of 10 oxides: CeO2, La2O3, Nd2O3, Pr6O11, Sm2O3, Eu2O3, Gd2O3, Tb4O7, Dy2O3 and Ho2O3), contained within a Lerchs-Grossman (LG) optimized pit shell
- Â· The cut-off grade is calculated, and the LG pit is optimized based on the assumption that the hydrometallurgical processes can produce mixed REE precipitates. The parameters used include the following considerations:
- o TREO price: $18.66/kg
- o Exchange rate of 1.30 C$:USD
- o Processing cost includes $21.47/t of mill feed for flotation plus a variable cost for hydrometallurgical plant that varies based on the feed grade. The average cost of hydrometallurgical plant is assumed to be $1,204/t of concentrate.
- o Mining cost of C$2.00/t for mill feed and waste
- o G&amp;A Costs included in the processing cost is C$6 M/yr
- o The overall process recoveries: For TREO&gt;=2.3%, recovery is 69.6%; between 2.3% and 1.5% TREO, recovery is 65.3%; and less than 1.5% TREO, recovery is 52.2%. These assume variable flotation recoveries and a constant 87% hydrometallurgical recovery.
- o Overall pit slope angles vary by zone between 40Â° and 48Â°

## 14.12  Previous Mineral Resource Estimates

The previous MRE was completed by APEX with an effective date of 27 June 2020 (Table 14-15). APEX considered five LREE which differs from the 2021 MRE, which considers 10 REO's, including heavy REO's. The 2020 Wicheeda MRE comprised an indicated mineral resource of 4,890,000 tonnes averaging 3.02% LREO, in addition to an inferred mineral resource of 12,100,000 tonnes averaging 2.90% LREO reported at a cut-off grade of 1.5% LREE (sum of Ce, La, Nd, Pr, and Sm; in  addition  to  Nb  percentages).  The  2020  Mineral  Resource  was  constrained  by  applying  a conceptual LG pit shell (Raffle and Nicholls, 2020). The 2021 Mineral Resource uses a lower cutoff grade based on TREO rather than a LREE metal cut-off grade. The 2021 MRE cut-off value was based  on  consideration  of  metal  price  and  concentrate  payable,  metallurgical  recovery,  and operating  cost  assumptions  and  uncertainty.  The  resulting  cut-off  difference  produces  a  36  % increase in mineral resources on a contained metal basis as reported in this technical report.

- Â· Mineral  resources  that  are  not  mineral  reserves  do  not  have  demonstrated  economic  viability. There has been insufficient exploration to allow for the classification of the indicated and inferred resources tabulated as a measured mineral resource, however, it is reasonably expected that the

majority  of  the  indicated  and  inferred  mineral  resources  could  be  upgraded  to  indicated  or measured mineral resources with continued exploration. There is no guarantee that any part of the mineral resources discussed herein will be converted into a mineral reserve in the future.

- Â· Mineral resources are reported at a cut-off grade of 1.5% LREE (light rare element, sum of Ce, La, Nd, Pr; in addition to Nb, and Sm %).
- Â· The cut-off grade includes the following considerations:
- o Metal prices: Ce = USD2.11/kg; La = USD2.10/kg; Nd = USD51.44/kg; Pr = USD56.96/kg; Nb = USD30.29/kg; Sm = USD2.07/kg

- o Concentrate payable of 80%
- o Hydromet refining charges of C$0.70/kg concentrate
- o Offsite Transport costs of C$180/t
- o No royalties have been applied (A 2% royalty payable to the Vendor adds LREE 0.02% to the cut-off item which is beyond the accuracy of the cut-off item and has no material impact to the resource estimate.
- Â· The resources are constrained by resource pit shell generated using the following inputs:
- o Mining cost of C$3.50/t
- o Waste mining costs of C$3.25/t
- o Process Costs of C$40/t (includes $10/t for transporting from pit to mill);
- o G&amp;A Costs of C$7/t
- o Process Recoveries: Ce = 85.7%; La = 85.7%; Nd = 85.7%; Pr = 85.7%; Nb = 57.0%; Sm = 85.7%
- o Overall pit slope angles of 45Â°

## 15 Mineral Reserve Estimates

There are no current mineral reserve estimates for the Wicheeda project.

## 16 Mining Methods

## 16.1 Introduction

To conduct an effective mine design exercise, all input parameters from the mine to point of sale were considered. These parameters were verified and provided by related QPs of each section.

The REE are a group of 17 elements with similar chemical properties that are found as oxides in nature. The Wicheeda deposit contains 10 different recoverable REE, as listed in Table 16-1.

Table 16-1 Recoverable REE in Wicheeda deposit

|   # | Name         | Symbol   |   Atomic Weight |
|-----|--------------|----------|-----------------|
|   1 | Lanthanum    | La       |         138.905 |
|   2 | Cerium       | Ce       |         140.116 |
|   3 | Praseodymium | Pr       |         140.907 |
|   4 | Neodymium    | Nd       |         144.242 |
|   5 | Samarium     | Sm       |         150.36  |
|   6 | Europium     | Eu       |         151.964 |
|   7 | Gadolinium   | Gd       |         157.23  |
|   8 | Terbium      | Tb       |         158.925 |
|   9 | Dysprosium   | Dy       |         162.5   |
|  10 | Holmium      | Ho       |         164.93  |

In general, the chain of production in the REE industry consists of three stages of beneficiation. Once mined, REO are milled and processed in a flotation plant to produce a REO concentrate, which at Wicheeda is estimated to be approximately 43% TREO. This concentrate is then treated at a hydrometallurgical plant to produce a high-grade (70% to 80%) mixed REE precipitate product. The high-grade precipitate is then processed in a separation plant to produce high-grade individual REE products up to 99.9% purity. While the flotation plant is usually located at the mine site the other two stages of beneficiation can be located elsewhere in the world.

To determine the best path forward for the Wicheeda project, the SRK team undertook an intensive scenario  analysis  exercise,  whereby  different  saleable  products  (i.e.  concentrate,  precipitate, separated products) and different production rates were assessed for the project. In addition, hybrid cases were considered whereby the project would start with one production rate and saleable product and transition to a final production rate and product.

The SRK Scenario Analysis is briefly discussed herein (Section 16.2), but the focus for the PEA and the report is the go-forward scenario from this analysis.

In the end, the PEA for the Wicheeda project was based on a 1.8 Mtpa flotation plant located at the Wicheeda site producing a 43% TREO concentrate. The concentrate will be trucked to an offsite hydrometallurgical facility in the region (central BC) for treatment. The resulting hydrometallurgical precipitates will then be shipped overseas as the final product.

The foregoing describes the final production configuration, but it is preceded by a four-year interim period whereby only the 1.8 Mtpa flotation concentrator is constructed and only concentrate is produced and sold.

The Wicheeda deposit will be mined as a conventional open pit operation. Mining will be on sixmetre benches and mill feed material will be hauled to a crusher close to the pit rim. Crushed mill feed will  be  conveyed  to  the  nearby  flotation  concentrator.  There  is  allowance  for  a  low  grade stockpile near the pit rim; however, at the level of the PEA, this was not needed. Future detailed mine planning will likely result in stockpiling lower grade materials, to be processed at the end of the mine life.

Waste rock will be mined and hauled to the waste storage facility (WSF) located adjacent to the pit or to the TSF for embankment construction.

It  is  assumed  that  the  Wicheeda  mine  will  be  owner-operated, with  contractor  engagement for secondary earthworks (e.g. TSF embankment).

## 16.2 Scenario Analysis

To determine the most appropriate approach for the PEA, the SRK team adopted its 'Scenario Analysis' approach to consider different saleable products and production rates for the project.

Scenarios included the three levels of saleable product (REE mineral concentrate; carbonate precipitate; and separated REE hydrates, oxides, and carbonates) and three different flotation milling rates (0.8 Mtpa, 1.2 Mtpa and 1.8 Mtpa). This resulted in a total of nine primary scenarios assessed. These scenarios are mapped out in Figure 16-1. Note that the recoveries in the graphic represent the cumulative recoveries from mill feed to final product.

Pit optimizations were set up in Whittle to run these scenarios. Each scenario used its own set of parameters, including:

- Â· Revenue assumptions based on final saleable product
- Â· All operating costs scaled based on production rate
- Â· All capital costs scaled based on production rate

Figure 16-1: Primary scenarios assessed for Wicheeda

An early conclusion from the pit optimization analysis of the primary scenarios was that investing in a new separation plant was not value accretive. Thus, those scenarios (3, 6, and 9 in Figure 16-1) were dropped from further assessment.

Subsequent scenario analyses were conducted by creating high level costed schedules with the following further considerations:

- Â· Move from a fixed flotation recovery to a variable recovery based on mill feed grade (also impacted pit optimizations)
- Â· Form mill feed selection sensitivity in the schedules, assume different product pricing (75%, 100% and 200%)
- Â· Consider starting with a smaller 0.8 Mtpa flotation concentrator and transition at various years in the mine plan to the larger 1.8 Mtpa mill with concentrate feeding a project hydrometallurgical plant

The final outcome, after discussion with Defense Metals, was a go-forward scenario that starts with the 1.8 Mtpa flotation concentrator producing concentrate only, and in the fifth year of mining, a hydrometallurgical plant begins operation. All the concentrate from the flotation concentrator is trucked to the hydrometallurgical plant in the region.

The remainder of this section discusses the inputs, pit optimizations, and schedules for this go forward scenario.

## 16.3 Pit Geotechnical Assessment

SRK conducted a high-level geotechnical assessment which included:

- Â· Review of the available geotechnical information
- Â· Core photo logging to supplement the historical data
- Â· Data processing and quality assurance checks of the historical data
- Â· Formulating pit slope recommendations

## 16.3.1 Information Review

Mr. Thomas reviewed the geotechnical information provided by Defense Metals. Data gaps were noted and recommendations for future studies are provided in Section 26.3.1. A summary of the reviewed information types is presented in Table 16-2.

## 16.3.2 Core Photo Logging

SRK conducted core photo logging for quality assurance and to supplement the historical data. Five drillholes were selected to provide representative coverage of the area of interest and the main lithology units. Photo logging was done on the portions of the drillholes for which photos were available of full core (i.e., not half core).

Photo  logging  included  collecting  RQD,  joint  count  (for  FF/m),  and  micro-defect  intensity parameters. Also logged was a qualitative  estimate  of  the  quality  (Class  rating  0  [lowest]  to  3 [highest]). Class values were used to assign assumed ratings for joint conditions and intact rock strength. These were needed to calculate rock mass rating in accordance with RMRL(90). Class values also allow useful comparison with the quantitative metrics.

## 16.3.3 Data Processing

Historical RQD data was visualized and modelled in Leapfrog Geo to investigate possible trends. Most of the data is within the range of 0 to 50% which covers the categories of very poor (0 to 20%), poor (20 to 40%), and fair (40 to 60%). Due to the sparse data, the findings from this exercise were limited but concluded that the Xenolithic Carbonate unit is the least competent and the Limestone unit is the most competent.

Mr. Thomas also noticed differences in the ranges for each unit between the 2018 and 2019 logging campaigns, most significantly  in  the  Syenite  unit.  For  further  evaluation,  SRK  plotted  the  data against photo logged fracture frequency (FF/m) and limit envelopes of their theoretical correlation (Priest &amp; Hudson, 1976). This indicated that approximately half of the data points are below the theoretical lower bound. Assuming that the FF/m values are correct, this would suggest that in these cases, the RQD values are too low. A common reason for this in early-stage projects is due to  breaks  from  core  handling  erroneously  being  considered  as  natural  discontinuities  for  RQD measurement.  These  observations  highlight  the  need  for  more  detailed  interrogation  of  the historical RQD data in future studies.

Using the historical and photo logged data, SRK calculated RMRL90 (Laubscher, 1990) values for each  lithology.  The  value  ranges  are  shown  in  Figure  16-3.  The  data  is  broadly  distributed, particularly in the Dolomite Carbonatite units. This leads to the possibility of other genesis controls on the rock mass than lithology (such as structural or chemical) that may warrant sub-domaining of these units. From a rock mass strength perspective, Syenite appears to be the most competent, while Dolomite Carbonate is the least.

Recommendations on pit slope angles are provided in Section 16.4.4.

## 16.4 Pit Optimization Parameters

This section describes the input parameters used for pit optimization and mine design. The main inputs are metal prices, the resource model, geotechnical parameters, operating costs, mineral processing recoveries, and offsite costs and charges. The parameters have been reviewed and provided by QPs in each technical area.

## 16.4.1 Commodity Price Inputs

The commodity selling price is the most influential factor in the mine design process. Forecasting a reliable selling price for the life of mine is often difficult and involves many uncertainties.

The REE market is not as transparent as base and precious metals. As such, SRK retained a marketing specialist to prepare a pricing forecast for REOs. This is described further in Section 19 of this report.

The REO pricing used in this PEA, USD, is:

â¢ REO concentrate - $5.75/kg TREO in concentrate

â¢ Mixed REE precipitate

- $14.04/kg TREO in precipitate

## 16.4.2 Resource Model

The resource model was developed by a third party (APEX) in collaboration with SRK's QP. The SRK mining team was provided with a  reviewed  resource  block  model  in  CSV  and  Datamine

formats. The model was regularized using 3 m by 3 m by 3 m blocks and was not rotated in any direction. The model included grade, density and geological classification data.

Table 16-3 includes a summary of the block model. Note that the original resource model was extended outside the mineralized zone to the north to allow for pit expansion.

Figure 16-3 shows a plan view and cross section of the Wicheeda deposit. The TREO grade varies from 0 to 8%, distinguished by a high-grade zone in the center of the deposit. The cross section (A-B) shows that this high-grade zone outcrops to surface, which allows for mineralization to be targeted early in the mine life, to the benefit of the project.

The Wicheeda resource (Figure 16-4) has been classified into indicated and inferred categories there is no material classified as measured.

Dr. Ebrahimi notes that ongoing exploration work, including in-fill drilling, will result in an adjustment to the classification of material used in this study.

The range of bulk densities at Wicheeda include:

- Â· Waste (mainly limestone): 2.74 t/m 3
- Â· Low grade mineralization: 2.87 t/m 3
- Â· High grade mineralization: 2.94 t/m 3

## 16.4.3 Topography

The topography of the Wicheeda property consists of several small peaks on the east and south sides of the property, where the potential pit will be located, plus small hills elsewhere. Wichcika Creek  passes  through  the  middle  of  the  property  from  the  southeast  to  the  northwest,  while Wicheeda Lake is located in the northeast of the property. The surface elevation of the pit area varies from 1,270 masl on the east side of the pit to 940 masl on the west.

Figure 16-5 shows a general view of the Wicheeda project topography, with notable elevations and waterways labeled.

## 16.4.4 Pit Slope Criteria

Using  the  average  RMRL(90)  values  and  the  resource  estimate  ultimate  pit,  the  Mr.Thomas selected  overall  pit  slope  angles  using  industry-recognised  empirical  charts  (e.g.,  Haines  and Terbrugge, 1991). The charts provide guidance on empirical data of slope angles and relate them to Mining Rock Mass Rating (MRMR) values. MRMR values are obtained by applying modification factors to account for mining influence. Blasting is the only modification factor that could be relevant in this mining scenario; however, the Mr. Thomas considered the application of careful controlled limit blasting and hence made no modification.

Consistent  with  standard  industry  practice  for  overall  pit  slopes  (for  moderate  consequence  of failure), a Factor of Safety (FoS) of 1.3 was adopted as the design acceptance criteria. The resultant angles for ranges of the expected overall wall heights are provided in Table 16-4.

Table 16-4: Overall pit slopes for Wicheeda project

| Rock Type               | Height   |   Maximum Overall Slope Angle |

## 16.4.5 Processing Method and Recoveries

As previously described, the processing methods to produce precipitate products consist of two main stages:

- Â· Stage 1 - Flotation separation methods to produce a concentrate of blended REOs
- Â· Stage 2 - Hydrometallurgical processes to produce a high-grade mixed REE precipitate product

Recovery of REO by flotation can varies based on the TREO grade fed to the flotation concentrator. The SRK flotation QP's (Mr. Olin) flotation recovery assumptions are shown in Table 16-5.

Table 16-5: TREO recoveries by flotation

| TREO Grade   | TREO Recovery   |
|--------------|-----------------|
| >=2.3%       | 80%             |
| 2.3-1.5%     | 70%             |
| <1.5%        | 60%             |

The SRK flotation QP assumed that the above recoveries by flotation (Stage 1) would produce a 43% TREO concentrate

For  the  hydrometallurgical  processes  (Stage  2),  the  SRK  hydrometallurgical  QP  (Mr.  Goode) assumed a constant 87% REO recovery.

## 16.4.6 Off-Site Costs

The offsite costs for the movement of concentrate (rail, port and ocean freight) were assumed to total CAD180/t (USD138/t) of concentrate.

The  offsite  costs,  including  transport  of  product,  were  built  into  the  processing  costs  for  the hydrometallurgical plant (Section 16.4.8).

## 16.4.7 Mining Dilution

Due to the shape and high-grade nature of the Wicheeda deposit, a moderate to low amount of dilution is expected. Mining dilution is a function of cut-off grade; therefore, all parameters that contribute to the cut-off grade definition including recovery, price and operating costs are variables that affect the degree of mining dilution in this deposit.

At Wicheeda the overall processing cost is a function of the TREO grade. The average grade sent to the mill varies by bench and period; therefore, the cut off grade varies by period. Preliminary investigations show that the cut-off grade varies between USD50/t for the low-grade mill feed and

up to USD90/t for the high-grade mill feed. Figure 16-7 shows plan views of the deposit colored by block value (NSR) - dark blue are resources below the minimum cut-off grade.

Dr. Ebrahimi recommends further work estimating dilution by bench and mining zones in a future study.

3% for the overall mining dilution and 2% for the overall loss were assumed in the study.

## 16.4.8 Mining and Processing Operating Cost Inputs

Operating  costs  for  the  mine,  mill  and  general  and  administration  based  on  recent  mining projects and QP experience in the region.

Operating costs vary based on the scale of the mining and milling operation. For pit optimization, a life-of-mine (LOM) average mining cost of USD3.70/t was assumed.

The optimization model considers variable milling operating costs based on the feed grade and the final product (depending on the stage of beneficiation).

Table 16-6 summarizes the operating costs used in the pit optimization assuming a 1.8 Mtpa mill rate and an average feed grade of 2.3% TREO.

## 16.5 NSR and Cut-off Grades

## 16.5.1 NSR Calculation

Due to processing complexity and the value chain of the final saleable products, a net smelter return  (NSR)  calculation  was  used  to  perform  the  pit  optimization  and  the  mine  production schedule. The NSR for each block is calculated using the formula:

NSR = grade * recovery (price-selling cost)

Considering that the price of the final product varies based on the level of beneficiation assumed for each scenario, three different NSRs were calculated, one for each saleable product.

The steps taken to calculate the NSR are explained below:

- 1. The grade of TREO is calculated for each block:

TREO = CeO2 + Dy2O3 + Eu2O3 + Gd2O3 + Ho2O3 + La2O3 + Nd2O3 + Pr6O11 + Sm2O3 + Tb4O7 (Note: oxides are expressed as percentages)

- 2. The price of each kg of TREO in the concentrate is set to USD4.735/kg after Chinese VAT and off-site costs (moisture adjusted)

USD5.76/kg TREO / (1+13% VAT) - USD138/twet / (1-10% H2O) / 430 kg/t = USD4.735/kg TREO (Note: while Chinese VAT was considered in optimization, it is not for economic analysis)

- 3. The value of each tonne of concentrate which contains 43% TREO is calculated:

## USD4.735 x 43% x 1000 kg/t = USD2,036.11/t

- 4. A mass pull (to concentrate) for each block is calculated using the formula below, which provides the amount of concentrate produced per tonne of mill feed in each block based on the grade:

## %TREO x Recovery / 43%

- 5. The NSR for the concentrate produced in each block is calculated by multiplying the amount of concentrate produced (4) by the unit price of the concentrate (3)
- 6. The amount of hydrometallurgical precipitate produced is calculated by multiplying the amount of concentrate produced in (4) by the hydrometallurgical recovery of 87% and divided by the precipitate purity (81.09%)
- 7. The price of the precipitate is estimated to be USD10,075.86 per tonne.

USD14.04/kg TREO / (1+13% VAT) * 81.09% * 1000 kg/t = USD10,075.86/t (Note: while Chinese VAT was considered in optimization, it is not for economic analysis)

- 8. The value of the hydrometallurgical precipitate product for each block is calculated by multiplying the tonnages of the precipitate produced in each block (6) by the price of the precipitate (7)

Notes: on Product Quality

Although the marketing study that was the basis of REE price forecasting (Section 19.5) was based around a precipitate quality assumption of 81.09%, subsequent analysis indicated that a quality of approximately 76% may be more realistic. The gross revenue estimates for mine optimization were based only on contained REO and are unaffected by this variation. There may be some adjustment in  offsite  costs  as  a  consequence of a lower concentrate quality, but this is not material in the context of a PEA-level study. Similarly, some variation in concentrate quality is possible, but as concentrate sale prices are based on contained REO, the variation in the NSR calculations and consequent cut-off grades associated with varying concentrate grades is not material, provided acceptable  grades  can  be  achieved.  Optimization  of  processing  strategies  to  balance  costs, throughputs, recoveries, product qualities and sales terms will be ongoing through subsequent studies and into construction and operation.

## 16.5.2 Cut-off Grade Calculation

A cut-off grade is where two different courses of action can be taken if the grade is below or above that grade. A milling cut-off grade is the minimum grade that a milled product can pay off all milling and related general and administrative costs.

The Wicheeda project has added complexity, as the total operating cost of processing a tonne of mill feed varies based on the level of beneficiation and the average feed grade, while revenue is based on the feed grade and the level of beneficiation.

SRK developed NSR values for each block using the input parameters defined above and the optimization  scenarios  described  previously.  Block  values  were  then  used  as  the  basis  for mineable resource selection. As the total operating costs vary for each block, the cut-off grade also varies accordingly.

For precipitate production, the total processing cost varies by the tonnages of concentrate which in turn is a function of the feed grade.

## 16.6 Pit Optimization

Pit optimization was conducted with Geovia's Whittleâ¢ software using the resource block model along with technical and economic data recommended by the QPs (Section 16.4).

Pit optimization produces pit shells that show how the mineable resource reacts to various market conditions. They are also an aid for production scheduling. Pit shell sizes are dictated by revenue factors, which represent a multiplier of the base case metal pricing.

Pit shells were generated based on revenue factors ranging from 0.3 to 1.2 in 0.02 increments, as well as additional revenue factors at 1.50, 1.75 and 2.00, to produce a total of 48 pit shells per run.

## 16.6.1 Pit Optimization Results

Table  16-7  summarizes  pit  optimization  at  a  1.8  Mtpa  milling  rate  and  a  hydrometallurgical precipitate  product.  The  highlighted  rows  show  the  base  case  scenario  (revenue  factor  1.00  yellow)  and  the  optimum  pit  shell  selected  for  the  production  schedule  (revenue  factor  0.82  orange).

Figure 16-8 shows the tonnages of mill feed at various revenue factors. At revenue factor 1.00 (the base case) 30.6 Mt of mineable resource would be mined at average grade of 2.1% TREO.

Figure 16-8: Pit optimization results for the 1.80 Mtpa mill feed and precipitate product scenario

<!-- image -->

Table: 16-7: Pit optimization results for 1.80 Mtpa and variable recovery

Figure 16-9 shows the total rock mined as well as the stripping ratio (waste:mill feed) for various revenue factors. It shows that the size of the pit increases with the revenue factor. The stripping ratio has a different relationship with revenue factor, as after an initial increase, it stays around 1.60 beyond  revenue  factor  0.80.  This  indicates  that  lower  revenue  factors  exclude  substantial mineralized, low grade material which becomes mill feed with higher revenue factors.

The revenue factor 1.00 shell includes 79.3 Mt of total rock with a stripping ratio of 1.59.

Figure 16-9: Strip ratio and total material mined versus revenue factor

<!-- image -->

## 16.6.2 Ultimate Pit Selection

Selecting the ultimate pit shell requires the running of two schedules for each pit shell from the pit optimization (Table 16-7). In one schedule, called the Best Case, each pit shell, up to the assessed one, is mined sequentially, similar to a series of pushbacks. In the other schedule, called the Worst Case, the assessed pit shell is mined in its entirety a bench at a time.

The economics of the schedules are assessed using the base pricing assumptions in the resource model. The resulting net present values (NPV) are reported for each pit shell (revenue factor). Convention in selecting the optimum pit is to average the Best Case and Worst Case NPVs for each pit shell and then select the pit shell that is the maximum of this average. Averaging the Best Case and Worst Case is intended to approximate standard pushback designs.

For  Wicheeda,  Figure  16-10  shows  the  Best  Case,  Worst  Case  and  Average  estimation  of discounted pit value across a range of revenue factors

Figure 16-10: Nested pit analysis - discounted pit value versus revenue factor

<!-- image -->

The revenue factor 0.82 pit shell has the maximum of the average Best Case and Worst Case discounted pit value (vertical line in Figure 16-10). That pit shell includes 71.8 Mt total material of which 28.8 Mt is mill feed and 43.0 Mt is waste, representing a strip ratio of 1.49 (waste:mill feed). Further data is included in Table 16-7 above.

Figure 16-11 shows the dimensions of the selected pit shell as well as key elevations in plan and cross-sectional views. The pit is round with an average diameter of 650 m. The highest wall is on the east side of the pit at 427 m in height.

Figure 16-11: Dimensions of the selected pit shell at revenue factor 0.82

<!-- image -->

## 16.7 Mine Scheduling

Upon selection of a hybrid scenario, with precipitate production starting in Year 4 of mining, a new schedule for the PEA was generated. The following adjustments were made:

- Â· Select an initial Phase 1 in a two-phase pit development sequence
- Â· Adjust the cut-off grade in the initial four years to reflect concentrate-only production
- Â· Ensure smoother overall production levels (more forwarding waste mining than was done in the Scenario Analysis scheduling)
- Â· Continue to carry two pricing levels (100% and 75% of base) for mill feed selection. Two schedules resulted which were evaluated in the economic analysis.

With respect to the last item, it was demonstrated that reducing the product pricing to 75%, which results in mill feed selection at elevated feed grades, produced the higher value schedule. This is the schedule described in this section.

It should be noted though that there would be additional low-grade material that would have been mined  at  the  base  pricing  assumption  (100%  of  product  pricing).  This  material  has  not  been included in the PEA, but in practice would be placed in a low-grade stockpile for feeding at the end of the mine life. Not having this marginal material at the end of a 16-year mine plan has no impact on the financial results of this PEA.

## 16.7.1 Two Phase Design

To minimize upfront mining costs and to advance the mining of high-grade mill feed in the early mine life, the pit waspit was split into two phases (pushbacks). The first phase of mining will focus on the high-grade area in the center of the deposit and avoids mining the high wall. The stripping

for the second phase of mining will start in Year 3, after the first phase of mining has established steady mill feed levels.

Figure 16-12 shows the two phases of mining in both plan and cross-sectional views.

## 16.7.2 Mine Production Schedule

Figure 16-13 shows the tonnages of mill feed and waste rock mined by year and phase for the Wicheeda project. The maximum mining capacity required for the first four years is approximately 4 Mtpa. This can be achieved with nine 61-tonne trucks and one excavator.

Mill feed mining for Phase 2 requires long-term preparation and waste removal. Waste removal for Phase 2 starts as early as Year 1 but is significant by Year 3. Mill feed mining from Phase 1 ends in early Year 9, whereas mill feed mining for Phase 2 starts in late Year 8. Maximum mining capacity peaks  at  8.0  Mtpa  in  Year  8.  Afterwards,  starting  in  year  10,  the  amount  of  stripping  drops significantly. The last three years of operation are mainly mill feed mining with limited waste mining.

Part of the waste mined in first few years will be used to construct the TSF embankment.

Figure 16-13: Production schedule for 1.8 Mtpa - Pit RF 0.82

<!-- image -->

Table 16-9: summarizes the tonnages and grades of mill feed and waste mined for each period and phase. Further comments on the schedule:

- Â· The 'Year' column in Table 16-9: is colour-coded for concentrate-only production to Year 4 and precipitate production thereafter.
- Â· There is a small amount of waste in Year -1 from the pit which combines with quarried rock and glacial till in the project area to commence the TSF embankment construction.
- Â· Year 1 represents only 0.2 Mt of mill production but a full year of waste movement. It is portrayed as a production year, but with shorter schedule periods, there would be a clearer distinction between pre-production/pre-stripping activities and mill production.
- Â· Years 9 and 10 are high haulage demand years which required adjustments to waste volumes, forwarding waste into prior years.

## 16.7.3 Equipment Requirements

Based on a first principles approach to equipment selection, the following primary equipment was selected for Wicheeda:

- Â· Drill: 160 mm - DTH drill (e.g. Epiroc-Flexiroc D64)
- Â· Shovel: 8 m3 Excavator (e.g. Cat 6015B)
- Â· Truck: 60 t rigid frame (e.g. Cat 775)

Assuming these equipment sizes, the fleet requirements are provided in Figure 16-14.

Figure 16-14: Primary production equipment requirements

<!-- image -->

In addition to the primary production equipment, the following support equipment is specified for Wicheeda:

â¢

Dozer (Cat D8 size): 4 units

â¢

Grader (Cat 14 size): 2 units

â¢

Water Truck (40 t articulated): 2 units

## 16.7.4 Blasting Requirements

It is anticipated that all waste in the pit area will require drilling and blasting, and it is assumed that hole loading and blasting will be a contracted service for Wicheeda.

## 16.8 Waste Rock Facilities

Waste rock will be sent to three destinations on site including:

- Â· TSF as construction material
- Â· Contact water pond (CWP) as construction material
- Â· WSF storing the remaining waste rock adjacent to the pit

A volumetric breakdown of the waste rock destinations is in Table 16-10.

Table 16-10: Waste destinations

| Facility   | Waste (tonnes)   |
|------------|------------------|
| TSF        | 10,202,000       |
| CWP        | 1,283,000        |
| WSF        | 34,173,000       |
| Total      | 45,658,000       |

The WSF is described here; for details on the TSF and CWP, refer to Section 18. The WSF is located in the valley immediately south of the open pit (Figure 16-15). This location is selected to minimize the haulage cost as well as to minimize the environmental footprint. The WSF is designed to an overall 2.5H:1V slope angle. It will be built in 50 m lifts with 37Â° face angles. Upper bench waste rock will be end-dumped at the uppermost 1200 m elevation, but most of the WSF will be constructed in lifts from the bottom-up.

Surface water upstream of the WSF is to be intercepted and directed away from the WSF. Water passing through the WSF will either be captured in the CWP downstream of the WSF or intercepted by a collection ditch at the lower perimeter of the WSF and directed to the CWP. Contact water is to be treated at the CWP before being released. Section 18 provides more details on the site water management plan.

## 16.9 General Site Layout

Figure 16-17 shows the general site layout of the project. This includes the open pit, WSF (Section 16.8), stockpiles, plant site, tailings pipeline, TSF (Section 18.2.2), maintenance shop, crusher, conveyor lines and access roads. Water management infrastructure, including the Contact Water Pond, seepage ponds and collection channels and diversions are also included (Section 18.3). Important  water  features  are  also  included.  The  figure  includes  5  m  contours  and  the  project property boundary.

## 17 Recovery Methods

Material from the Wicheeda project is envisioned to be processed in a flotation concentrator to produce a rare earth flotation concentrate containing 40-50% TREO. The flotation concentrate would then be sold into the market for the first four years of operation and then be processed in a hydrometallurgical  plant  to  produce  a  mixed  REE  precipitate.  The  flotation  concentrator  and hydrometallurgical process plant are briefly discussed in this section.

## 17.1 Flotation Concentrator

Material from the Wicheeda deposit will be processed in a flotation concentrator. The concentrator flowsheet will include three-stage crushing, ball mill grinding, rougher and scavenger flotation and three stages of cleaner flotation at elevated temperature to produce a final flotation concentrate containing 40-50% TREO. The flotation concentrate will be thickened to about 55% solids and then filtered to about 9% moisture. The filtered concentrate will then be weighed, sampled and bagged in  super-sacks  containing  1,000-2,000  kg  of  concentrate  which  will  then  be  transported  to  a purchaser (first four years) or to the hydrometallurgical plant for further processing to produce a mixed REE precipitate. The conceptual flotation concentrator flowsheet is shown in Figure 17-1, and preliminary process design criteria are shown in Table 17-1.

## 17.1.1 Flotation Concentrator Description

## Crushing

Run-of-mine (ROM) material from the mine will be hauled to the primary crusher and either dumped directly  into  the  primary  crusher  feed  hopper,  which  will  be  fitted  with  an  oversize  grizzly,  or stockpiled on the ROM stockpile. Primary crushed material will then be conveyed to the doubledeck  secondary  screen.  Secondary  screen  oversize  will  be  conveyed  to  the  secondary  cone crusher and discharge from the secondary crusher will be conveyed to the tertiary screen. Oversize from the tertiary screen will be conveyed to the tertiary cone crusher, which will be operated in closed circuit with the tertiary screen. Secondary and tertiary screen undersize (-9.5 mm) will be conveyed to the fine material bin which will feed the grinding circuit.

## Grinding Circuit

The grinding circuit will consist of a single stage ball mill operating in closed circuit with a cluster of hydrocyclones to produce a final grind size of 80% passing (P80) 106 Âµm. Material will be fed from the fine material bin with a variable speed belt filter which will be controlled by the ball mill feed conveyor at the set feed rate. The cyclone overflow will be advanced to the three-stage reagent conditioning circuit and then to rougher and scavenger flotation.

## Reagent Conditioning and Flotation Circuit

The flotation circuit will consist of rougher and scavenger flotation circuits followed by three stages of  cleaner  flotation  to  produce  a  final  flotation  concentrate  containing  40-50%  TREO.  Cyclone overflow from the grinding circuit will be conditioned in a three-stage conditioning circuit with the required reagents at 80-85Â°C. The first stage conditioner will serve to adjust the slurry pH to 9.510 with soda ash, the second stage conditioner will serve to condition the slurry with depressants for the gangue minerals (F220 and Na2SiF6) and the third stage conditioner will serve to condition the slurry with the mineral collector and activator. The conditioned slurry will then advance to the rougher flotation circuit. The rougher tailing will be further conditioned with the required reagents prior to advancing to the scavenger flotation circuit. The rougher and scavenger concentrates will be combined and further conditioned with the required reagents prior to advancing to three stages of cleaner flotation.

## Concentrate Thickening and Filtration

The final flotation concentrate will be thickened in a high-rate thickener to about 55% solids and then filtered with a pressure filter to about 9% moisture. The filtered concentrate will be sampled, bagged  and  weighed  and  stored  in  the  load-out  area  pending  transport  to  market  or  to  the hydrometallurgical plant.

## Tailing Thickening

The final flotation tailing will be thickened to about 60% solids in a high-rate thickener and then pumped to the TSF. The thickener overflow will be recycled to the process water tank where it will be heated back to 80-85Â°C with steam heat prior to distribution back to the process.

## 17.1.2 Recovery Estimate

Metallurgical test programs have been conducted on test composites containing about 4.8% TREO and have reported laboratory REO recoveries of 85% into flotation concentrates containing almost 49% TREO. It is noted, however, that actual mined grades will be significantly lower. During the first 10 years of production the plant feed will range from about 2.1% to 3.0% TREO. Due to the lower plant feed grades, Mr. Olin has discounted REO recovery to 80% into concentrates containing 43% TREO for the first 10 years of production. Plant feed grades will continue to decline during production  years  11-16  from  about  1.9%  to  1.2%  TREO.  On  this  basis,  Mr.  Olin  has  further discounted REO recovery per Table 16-5. Confirmatory testwork on material representing planned mine production grades and mineral content will be required during the next phase of metallurgical testwork to confirm achievable REO recovery and concentrate grades.

## 17.2.1 Plant Flowsheet and Design Criteria

Flotation concentrate is received as a moist filter cake produced in the flotation concentrator. The filter cake  is  processed  in  a  flowsheet  as  depicted  in  Figure  17-2.  Design  criteria  for  the hydrometallurgical plant are provided in Table 17-2.

A brief description of the hydrometallurgical plant follows:

## 17.2.2 Gangue Leach Circuit

Flotation concentrate is received at the hydrometallurgical plant at a nominal rate of 290 t/d, passed through  a  surge  system  with  a  nominal  capacity  of  1000  t,  and  conveyed  by  a  metering  feed conveyor into  the  first  of  a  series  of  gangue  leach  tanks  providing  a  two-hour  residence  time. Regenerated acid is fed to the tanks at a rate controlled to maintain a terminal pH of 3.0 and the temperature increased to 50ÂºC. The tanks are provided with extra height to accommodate foam and an off-gas scrubbing system to handle the gas evolved during the leach reaction. Leached slurry is thickened, pressure filtered, and washed in the filter to separate the solids and solution. The filter cake is feed to the caustic crack circuit.

The gangue leach pregnant solution is reacted with limestone slurry in a series of agitated tanks to a pH of 5. The slurry is combined with the REE filtrate and sent to the Mg-Mn precipitation step which is the first process in the HCl regeneration circuit.

## 17.2.3 Caustic Crack Circuit

The  gangue  leach  residue  is  slurried  with  regenerated  50%  NaOH  solution,  the  temperature increased to 150ÂºC, and the slurry passed through a series of agitated tanks providing four hours retention time. The discharge slurry is diluted with water, cooled to below 80ÂºC, and filtered and washed in pressure filters. The filter cake is feed to the REE acid leach circuit.

The filtrate, which is a NaOH solution with dissolved F, CO3, and P extracted from the concentrate, is reacted at elevated temperature with slaked lime in a series of causticization reactors providing six hours residence time. The causticization precipitate, comprising calcium fluoride, carbonate, silicate and other contaminants is removed from solution using pressure filters and sent to waste. The  filtrate  is  evaporated  back  up  to  50%  NaOH  using  a  triple-effect  evaporation  system  and recirculated back to the caustic crack circuit. Minor losses of Na from the caustic crack circuit are replaced with NaOH purchased as 50% NaOH solution.

## 17.2.4 Rare Earth Leach Circuit

The caustic crack residue is reacted with regenerated HCl at 50ÂºC in a series of reactors providing four hours residence time. Acid is added to maintain a terminal free acid concentration of 30 g/L. At the end of the leach process, the leach slurry is treated with H2O2, finely ground limestone to a pH of about 3, and SO4, to precipitate all impurities which are thereby combined with the leach residue, then removed by filtration and sent to waste. The filtrate is pregnant leach solution (PLS) and is treated with NaHS to remove Pb and Zn and filtered to complete the purification process.

The impurity-free PLS is reacted with a slurry of high-purity lime to precipitate a REE hydrate which is  filtered,  washed,  partially-dried,  and  placed  in  FIBC  (flexible  intermediate  bulk  container)  for transportation to market.

## 17.2.5 HCl Regeneration

The CaCl2 solution generated in the gangue leach and REE leach circuits are at natural pH values of 5 and 7 respectively. In the first step of the HCl regeneration circuit, they are combined and agitated with lime slurry to a pH of 9 to precipitate all Mg, Mn, and other metals, which are then removed  by  thickening  and  filtration  leaving  a  high-purity  CaCl2  solution  suitable  for  HCl regeneration. The Mg-Mn precipitate is sent to waste.

The purified CaCl2 solution is evaporated to a concentration of about 450 g/L CaCl2, cooled and reacted with H2SO4 which leads to the precipitation of CaSO4 and formation of HCl. The precipitated CaSO4 is removed by filtration and sent to waste and the resulting 20% HCl solution used in the gangue leach and REE leach circuits.

## 17.2.6 Waste Handling

Waste streams are generated in the gangue leach circuit (mainly hydrated Fe oxides/carbonates), in causticization (excess CaO, CaF2, CaCO3, minor calcium phosphates and silicates), during REE impurity removal (mainly hydrated Fe oxides/carbonates, BaSO4, minor phosphates and Th, minor sulphides), during Mg/Mn removal ahead of HCl regeneration (excess CaO, Mg and Mn hydrates) and during conversion of the concentrated CaCl2 solutions to HCl (gypsum). The net acid-base balance will be strongly basic because of the excess CaO and CaCO3 used, as well as basic precipitated compounds such as magnesia hydrates, in the mixed material. The filter cakes will be blended and transported back to the mine site where they are combined with flotation tailings for storage.

## 18 Project Infrastructure

## 18.1 Offsite Project Infrastructure

## 18.1.1 Power

Power is assumed to be supplied via a new high-voltage line connecting to the BC Hydro 138 kV line (1L 365) running to the west of the project to the project site. Costing has been derived from benchmarks and no detail design has been undertaken. The alignment has not been selected, although a combination of using the access road alignment and more direct routes is likely.

An allowance for a site substation and the connection costs at the supply end was made. No design was undertaken.

## 18.1.2 Access Road and Bridge

The existing forestry road from Bear Lake to the project site is assumed to be upgraded for logistics access. At site, the road crosses Wichcika Creek. The construction of a bridge is required, and this has been costed at a conceptual level. The bridge is also required for the backhaul of rock from the mine for the construction of the TSF.

## 18.1.3 Water Supply

Water  is  relatively  abundant  in  the  project  area  with  multiple  streams, lakes and  rivers  within proximity. An allowance for a local source was made in the costing.

## 18.2 Onsite Project Infrastructure

## 18.2.1 General Site Layout

Refer back to Figure 16-17 for the following discussion.

Mineralized material exiting from the pit will be sent to either the crusher pad, located west of the pit, or to the stockpile located southwest of the pit. The stockpile as designed has a capacity of approximately 1M tonnes; however, there is potential to expand the short and long term capacity of stockpiling with a larger footprint or additional facilities. The crusher pad will facilitate the crushing and transporting of mill feed northwest to the processing plant via a conveyor installed along the crest of the northern embankment of the Contact Water Pond (Section 18.3.2).

A plant site, with flotation concentrator, will be located on a hill northwest of the pit and Contact Water Pond, west of Wicheeda Lake. The facility has been designed to ensure water runoff will report  to  the  Contact  Water  Pond  to  the  south.  A  water  treatment  plant  (Section  18.3.7), administration offices and other buildings will also be located at the plant site. In addition, a small lined and drained pit will be located near the flotation concentrator to receive hydrometallurgical residue filter cake (processed off-site).  Hydrometallurgical residue filter cake will be re-slurried for co-disposal in the TSF (Section 13.4).

A mine maintenance shop, with mine offices and dry, will be located south of the Contact Water Pond. Water runoff will be directed to the Water Control Pond to the north.

Tailings generated by the flotation concentrator will be transported to the TSF via pipeline (Section 18.2.2).

## 18.2.2 Tailings Storage Facility

## Tailings Impoundment

Tailings generated in the flotation concentrator will be transported via pipeline to a conventional (slurry) TSF located west of Wichcika Creek. The TSF embankment containing the tailings is to be constructed by downstream methods.

The TSF will have the capacity to store up to 20.7M m 3  tailings produced over the 16-year mine life, with an ultimate crest height of 932 masl. A starter embankment will be constructed at 913 masl, followed by an additional three downstream raises spread out over the life of the mine.

Approximately ten percent of the TSF capacity accounts for hydrometallurgical residue, whereby the residue, in the form of moist filter cake, will be mixed on-site with a portion of the tailings slurry to sufficiently re-slurry the residue so that it can be transferred by pipeline to the TSF.

Tailings  will be  deposited  from  the  embankment  crest  as  a  conventional  slurry  (30:70  solids:liquids, by weight), via deposition pipelines (from the main tailings delivery pipeline), and then allowed to settle and consolidate. As this occurs, supernatant water will be pumped via a barge to the Contact Water Pond (Section 18.3.2), where the water will be stored before it is sent to  the  flotation  concentrator  and/or  to  the  water  treatment  plant  for  treatment and  discharge  to Wichcika Creek. Two locations for water reclaim may be required, given the shape of the TSF. An allowance has been made for this in the tailings and water management operating cost estimates. Further details on water management around the TSF are included in Section 18.3.7.

Due  to  the  anticipated  geochemistry  of  the  tailings  solids,  including  co-disposal  with  the hydrometallurgical residue, the facility is currently planned to include an impermeable liner system in the impoundment basin and on the upstream embankment face slopes. This low-permeability liner will incorporate an above-liner drain to allow entrained slurry water to be removed at any stage of development of the TSF.

Due  to  very  limited  data  on  the  foundation  conditions  of  the  TSF  area  and  lack  of  detailed geotechnical studies to date, the potential impacts on the geotechnical stability and design of the TSF remains a potential risk that should be addressed by future studies and design phases.

## Tailings Embankment

The  tailings  embankment  is  designed  for  the  PEA  using  downstream  embankment  raise construction. Embankment slopes will be 2H:1V on the upstream and 3H:1V on the downstream faces. A dry freeboard of 3 m will be maintained throughout the mine life.

Based on the current selected site, the embankment is a sidehill fill utilizing natural topography to the extent possible with a storage ratio of 2.5 tailings:1 waste.  Siting and geometry of the TSF may be optimized during future design phases in order to reduce construction material requirements,

For the purposes of this PEA, the SRK team assumed that the TSF dam embankment will be constructed with an even split of mine waste, transported via mining truck, and locally sourced glacial till material, along with crushed material to make up the filter and internal drain zones.  Future studies are required to confirm the suitability and mix of construction materials, whether from the open pit or nearby borrow sources.

The tailings embankment will be constructed in four main stages, including a starter dam at 913 masl to facilitate the first three years of mine life. The stages are detailed in Table 18-1.

Table 18-1: TSF embankment stages

| Stage        | Years Utilized   |   Embankment  Elevation (masl) |   Tailings Elevation  (masl) |   Impoundment  Capacity (Mm 3 ) |

## 18.3 Water Management

## 18.3.1 Overview

The Wicheeda project will consist of infrastructure on the east and west extents of Wichcika Creek, and upstream of Wicheeda Lake. Water management infrastructure are required to capture the surface water runoff and seepage from the open pit, waste rock dumps and stockpiles.

Water management for the TSF will include pumping systems to remove both supernatant water and entrained tailings solution from the TSF, with pumping to the separate Contact Water Pond for storage prior to being pumped back to the flotation concentrator. In order to maintain an adequate beach at the TSF, supernatant water will be pumped (immediately and continually) to the dedicated separate storage facility (Contact Water Pond sized as such) where it will be stored before it is sent to the process plant and/or to the water treatment plant for treatment and discharge into Wichcika Creek.

Removal of supernatant water to the separate contact water storage pond may require reclaim water  infrastructure  at  two  locations,  against  the  native  topography,  based  on  the  current siting/layout of the TSF as shown in Figure 18-1.

## 18.3.2 Contact Water Pond

The WSF was sited to ensure all runoff and seepage water could be captured at a single collection point, downstream of the open pit, WSF and stockpiles. This location, named the Contact Water Pond (CWP in Figure 18-2), will include two earth dams to provide sufficient storage capacity to manage the combined monthly inflow volumes from the WSF and the supernatant water reclaimed from the TSF during a 1 in 25-year wet freshet condition, with surge capacity to store the 1 in 200year 72-hour rainfall storm event from the direct catchment area.

A secondary berm will be positioned around the extents of the planned crusher pad. This berm will only pond water during extreme events and is expected to be above the normal operating level. The design capacity requirement of the Contact Water Pond is 850,000 m 3 ; however, the proposed dam  configuration  provides  approximately  1,000,000  m 3   of  capacity  while  maintaining  1  m  of freeboard to the dam crest, increasing flexibility in the operations of contact water for the project.

Figure 18-2: Site layout showing water management infrastructure

<!-- image -->

Inflows to the Contact Water Pond will be pumped to the processing plant or will be treated and discharged to Wichcika Creek. Water collected in the open pit will also be directed to the Contact Water Pond, along with runoff from the processing plant pad. The dewatering system from the Contact Water Pond to the water treatment plant was sized based on a monthly water balance and the  1  in  25-year  monthly  runoff  inflows,  calibrated  to  a  regional  Water  Survey  of  Canada hydrometric station (WSC Station 07EE009 Chuchinka River at the Mouth). A pumping system equipped to discharge up to 2,300 gpm to the water treatment plant will be installed with an 18' DR17 HDPE pipeline to the plant site area. Based on this pumping capacity, the 200-year 72-hour storm volume could be dewatered to the treatment plant in 12 days.

An emergency spillway will be constructed along the abutment of the east dam and will convey the Inflow Design Flood for the dam classification of the facility. The spillway will be excavated into bedrock, where possible, or lined with riprap for erosion protection. Discharge via the spillway will be utilized in emergency situations only.

The ML/ARD potential of tailings waste is described in Section 20.1.7. Tailings are expected to have low potential for ARD but some potential for metal leaching. Specifically, during operations,

TSF reclaim water is expected to be dominated by process water chemistry.  Process water is expected to contain elevated fluoride from processing reagent use, and elevated molybdenum from reaction between process reagents and mineralized rock. As such, the Contact Water Pond will be lined with an HDPE liner to limit infiltration and seepage. Seepage collection sumps are planned at the downstream toe of each earth dam for the Contact Water Pond. Any seepage water or runoff collected in these sumps will be pumped back into the Contact Water Pond. Three sump stations are planned, each equipped with a 1000 gpm pumping system.

## 18.3.3 Tailings Water Management

Water management for the TSF will include:

- Â· Installation of an emergency spillway at starter and downstream raise configurations to ensure no overtopping of the TSF embankment can occur
- Â· Pumping systems to remove both supernatant water and entrained tailings solution from the TSF (Section 18.2.2)
- Â· Provision for interception of seepage water, including embankment drains
- Â· A series of seepage collection stations located along the downstream toe of the TSF dam to pump seepage back into the TSF pond.

As noted in Section 18.2.2, water stored in the TSF will be minimized. Supernatant water will be immediately and continuously pumped to the Contact Water Pond (sized for storage) or reclaimed to the processing plant. Storage capacity at the TSF will be maintained to manage the Inflow Design Flood based on the dam classification.

For  management  of  seepage  water,  four  sump  stations  are  planned,  each  equipped  with  a 1000 gpm pumping system.

## 18.3.4 NORM Management

The occurrence of radionuclides in waste rock and tailings is described in Section 20.1.8. Waste rock and tailings are likely to fall within a restricted naturally occurring radioactive materials (NORM) classification and require a site review to determine NORM management program requirements.

## 18.3.5 Collection Channels and Diversions

Open channels will be situated downstream of proposed infrastructure to collect contact water, as well as upstream of infrastructure to divert non-contact water. All channels were designed to convey the 100-year return period 24-hour peak flow using the rational method, with an additional 0.3 m of freeboard.

All channels will have a base width of 2 m and side slopes of 2:1 H:V, and will be lined with an HDPE geomembrane, a non-woven geotextile and a layer of riprap erosion protection. Access

roads  along  the  downgradient  channel  bank  will  be  constructed  for  channel  inspection  and maintenance.

Three channels are planned to manage runoff:

- Â· Contact water from the WSF will be conveyed to the Contact Water Pond. A portion of the facility will drain by gravity directly to the pond while the majority will drain into the South Collection Channel which will follow the west toe of the WSF and discharge in the Contact Water Pond.
- Â· Non-contact water upstream of the WSF will be diverted in the Waste Rock Diversion Channel, which will discharge towards Wicheeda Creek. The Waste Rock Diversion Channel will consist of two open-channel segments and a pipeline conveying water through the steeper section of the hillslope. The pipeline section will be 160 m in length and consist of two parallel 1000 mm diameter HDPE pipes, which will convey water down the steeper section of the hillslope.
- Â· Non-contact water upstream of the TSF area will be diverted in the TSF Diversion Channel, which will discharge around the south abutment of the TSF dam.

## 18.3.6 Open Pit Dewatering

Inflows to the open pit will include surface runoff and groundwater. All water within the pit footprint will be collected in the floor of the pit and pumped to the Contact Water Pond. The dewatering system was sized to dewater the 100-year 24-hour rainfall event inflow volume over a seven (7) day duration. Costs assume two 1000 gpm pumping systems will be in-place with a 12' DR17 HDPE pipeline to the Contact Water Pond along the pit access ramp alignment.

Characterization of groundwater inflows to the open pit will be developed in further studies. It is assumed that during the design event for pump sizing, groundwater inflows would represent a small fraction of total inflows and would not significantly change pumping requirements.

## 18.3.7 Water Treatment Plant

Waste rock and pit wall runoff are expected to have low potential for ARD but some potential for metal leaching. Tailings are also expected to have low potential for ARD but some potential for metal leaching. Specifically, during operations, TSF pond water is expected to be dominated by process water chemistry. Process water is expected to contain elevated fluoride from processing reagent use, and elevated molybdenum from reaction between process reagents and mineralized rock.

A water treatment plant has been sized based on a monthly water balance with the 1 in 25-year annual runoff contributions to the waste rock areas, open pit, and TSF. The plant is expected to treat for molybdenum, arsenic, uranium, radium and fluoride and will be situated at the processing area. The plant is sized to treat up to 2300 gpm of water and will discharge excess water from the water management facilities to Wichcika Creek.

The water treatment process includes reverse osmosis with three stages of chemical treatment for the  concentrate.  The  first  stage  of  chemical  treatment  will  include  co-precipitation  with  iron hydroxide  to  remove  uranium,  molybdenum  and  arsenic  with  the  addition  of  ferric  sulphate. Secondary treatment with the addition of barium chloride will facilitate co-precipitation to remove radium. The final stage will include lime addition to precipitate fluoride as CaF2. Sludge from the chemical treatment will be settled in a clarifier and disposed of in a dedicated repository of the TSF.

Long-term  water  quality  predictions  from  project  area  will  be  developed  in  future  studies  to determine the duration of water treatment requirements. Closure strategies will be implemented to reduce the long-term water treatment requirements.

## 19 Market Studies and Contracts

## 19.1 General

The marketing of rare earths is complex and relatively novel, and compared to base metals or precious metals projects, there exists significant uncertainty about the way the market is expected to function in the future. In general, there is an expectation of a growing market as investment in renewable  energy  infrastructure  and  electric  vehicles  continues  to  grow.  Similarly,  there  is increased interest in investment in supply-side mining and processing operations.

Marketing and price risk must be considered as significant in these commodities.

## 19.2 Rare Earth Flotation Concentrates

The processing of rare earth concentrates takes place predominantly in China, and few, if any, other customers are readily available to ensure a competitive and transparent international market. The concentrates themselves are subject to variation in composition, and certain concentrates may be more difficult to place in the market.

## 19.3 Mixed Rare Earth Precipitates

The processing of concentrates into a mixed REE precipitate using a hydrometallurgical plant as discussed in Section 17.2 is a step towards the 'commoditization' of the rare earth elements in the market. Less variation in specification of the mixed REE precipitate would be expected than would be the case for marketing concentrates, and additional customers may be available across more diversified geographical regions.

It is noted that it is relatively unusual to tie downstream processing facilities to minerals projects. The key strategy is typically to concentrate the minerals at or near the mine site to reduce freight costs, and to then assume that the concentrate would be sold or toll-treated by others.

## 19.4 Other Processing Options

It  is  possible  that  additional  processing  facilities  to  produce  separated  rare  earths  could  be constructed, but it was considered that this strategy is inappropriate for a PEA and would assume the commitment of significant additional capital. These options were not developed after some preliminary analysis indicated that they were unlikely to be value-accretive.

## 19.5 Adamas Market Study

A  specialist  firm,  Adamas  Intelligence  was  contracted  to  conduct  a  marketing  study  into  the potential options and pricing for the Wicheeda project (Adamas, 2021).

## 19.6 Strategy Adopted

The economic analysis indicated that the step of processing the concentrates into a precipitate would add significant value due to the higher realized prices. In order to manage financing risk, the decision was made to defer construction of the hydrometallurgical pant until it could be partially funded by cashflow from concentrate sales.

It is observed that the significant value creation associated with the construction of downstream, processing  infrastructure  such  as  the  hydrometallurgical  plant  contemplated  may  indicate  a disfunction in the market, and that the spreads between concentrate pricing and precipitate pricing is unsustainable in the long-term as investments seek to profit from the spread. This can happen in two ways:

- 1) The price for concentrate may be bid up by the presence of a competing hydrometallurgical options or,
- 2) The price for precipitate may be bid down by investment and an expansion in the availability of hydrometallurgical process providers.

In practice, the likelihood may be that both things occur.

The  barriers  to  entry  in  terms  of  third-parties  constructing  hydrometallurgical  plants  are  not insignificant, and the closing of this spread may take some time. However, due to the timeframe for this project, a conservative approach may be to assume that the precipitate premium will shrink.

## 19.7 Political Strategy and Risk

The current concentration of markets and processing options in China may lead to intervention by 'western' governments in terms of securing independent supplies of REEs. This has the potential to influence the markets significantly.

## 19.8 Pricing Assumptions

Pricing was taken from the Adamas report. Because no specific timeframe for the project to be developed is available, the long-term equilibrium prices were used. The prices are expressed in USD per kg of contained REE oxide. The prices used are shown in Table 19-1. Because of the wide range of uncertainty around the long-term pricing of REE, a wide sensitivity range was used in the economic analysis.

Table 19-1: Long-term REE price assumptions (USD)

| Product                          | Price per kg of  Concentrate/  Precipitate   | Concentrate/  Precipitate quality  basis   | Price per kg REO   |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| Rare earth oxides in concentrate | $2.93                                        | 50.87%                                     | $5.76              |
| Rare earth oxides in precipitate | $11.39                                       | 81.09%                                     | $14.04             |

Although  the  marketing  study  was  based  around  a  precipitate  quality  assumption  of  81.09%, subsequent analysis indicated that a quality of approximately 76% may be more realistic. The gross revenue calculations for the PEA were based only on contained REO and are unaffected by this variation. There may be some adjustment in offsite costs as a consequence of a lower concentrate quality,  but  this  is  not  material  in  the  context  of  a  PEA-level  study.  Similarly,  some  variation  in concentrate quality is possible, but as concentrate sale prices are based on contained REO, the variation  in  the  economics associated with varying grades is not material, provided acceptable grades  can  be  achieved.  Optimization  of  processing  strategies  to  balance  costs,  throughputs, recoveries, product qualities and sales terms will be ongoing through subsequent studies and into construction and operation.

## 20 Environmental Studies, Permitting, and Social or Community Impact

## 20.1 Environmental Setting

## 20.1.1 Introduction

The Wicheeda project, is a green fields project located approximately 80 kms northeast of Prince George, BC. Although, a portion of the project overlaps a Recreational Reserve (REC6837), there are  no  additional  exploration  restrictions  within  the  reserve  area.  The  region  is  well  known  for commercial activities such as logging and exploration activities. Mineral exploration and mining projects  are  a  large  component  of  the  social  fabric  of  this  region  of  northern  BC.  Exploration activities conducted by various companies on the property have essentially been ongoing since at least the early 1960s.

## 20.1.2 Regulatory Setting

The  environmental  assessment  and  permitting  framework  for  metal  mining  in  Canada  is  well established. The federal and provincial environmental assessment processes provide a mechanism for reviewing major projects to assess their potential impacts. Following a successful environmental assessment ('EA'), the operation undergoes a licensing/permitting phase in order to  allow  operations  to  proceed.  The  project  is  then  regulated  through  all  phases  (construction, operation, closure, and post-closure) by both federal and provincial departments and agencies.

Where both  a  federal  and  provincial  assessment  are  required,  the  Impact  Assessment  Act  of Canada  allows  for  the  coordination,  delegation  and/or  substitution  of  some  of  the  federal requirements  to  the  Province  in  order  to  facilitate  a  single  environmental  assessment  for  one project. This process is also structured to allow for interested members of the public or special interest groups to review and provide comment throughout the entire process.

## 20.1.3 Federal process

The Canadian Impact Assessment Act (2020) states a new REE mine with an mill capacity of 2,500 t/day or more is required to complete a federal environmental assessment. Wicheeda is scheduled to produce 1.8 M tonnes/year and therefore is a reviewable project under the Physical Activities Regulations: SOR/2019-285. In addition, the federal Minister of Environment and Climate Change Canada has the ability to designate a physical activity that is not prescribed by regulation as one requiring an environmental assessment if, in the Minister's opinion, either the carrying out of that physical  activity  may  cause  adverse  environmental  effects  or  public  concerns  related  to  those effects.

## 20.1.4 Provincial process

The British Columbia Environmental Assessment Act (SBC 2018) Chapter 51 and its Reviewable Projects Regulations Reg, 67/2020 states that a new mine facility that, during operations, will have

a  production  capacity  of  greater  than  or  equal  to  75,000  tonnes/year  of  mill  feed  requires  an environmental  assessment.  The  projected  production  of  the  Wicheeda  project  will  exceed  this threshold and therefore a provincial environmental assessment will be required. When both a BC and federal assessment are required, the Province typically takes the lead role throughout the assessment. This is expected to be the case for the Wicheeda project.

The Assessment Office will establish a technical advisory committee (TAC). The TAC is made up of  subject  matter  experts  from  the  provincial  and  federal  government  departments  as  well  as representatives from the First Nations and other rights holders. The role of the TAC is to act as a single reviewing body of all technical submissions by Defense Metals and their agents throughout the assessment process.

In  accordance with all BC environmental assessments the following must be considered in the environmental assessment:

- Â· Positive and negative direct and indirect effects including environmental, economic, social, cultural, and health effects
- Â· Adverse cumulative effects
- Â· Risks and uncertainties associated with those effects including any interaction between effects
- Â· Risks of malfunctions or accidents
- Â· Disproportionate effects on distinct human populations including populations identified by gender
- Â· Effects on biophysical factors that support ecosystem function
- Â· Effects on current and future generations
- Â· Consistency with any land-use plan of the government or an indigenous nation that is relevant to the EA and any applicable regional or strategic assessments
- Â· Greenhouse gas emissions including the potential effects on the province being able to meet its targets under the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Targets Act;
- Â· Alternative  means of carrying out the project that are technically and economically feasible including using the best available technologies, and the potential effects, risks, and uncertainties of those alternatives;
- Â· Potential changes to the reviewable project that may be caused by the environment

## 20.1.5 Current Status

Permit MX-13-168 was originally issued on September 18, 2008 and amendments were approved on February 26, 2019. The permit is valid until February 25, 2024. In addition, Permit Mx-13-168 also required a $19,000 reclamation bond, which is currently held by the BC Ministry of Finance.

Should the  project  advance  to  the  mining  stage,  Defense  Metals  will  be  required  to  obtain  all necessary surface rights by way of filing an application for mining leases for the construction and operation of a mine on the project.

With respect to environmental and permitting risk and uncertainty, the area surrounding Wicheeda Lake has known to have high recreational and ecological values. The lake and surrounding area (Figure 4-2) is currently covered under recreational reserve REC6837 (Raffle and Nicholls, 2020). As of May 20, 2020, FLNR indicated that given its current priorities and capacity there is no intent to establish a recreation site at Wicheeda Lake in the near future. The northern limit of the open pit lies approximately 400 m southeast of the southern limit of Wicheeda Lake, and approximately 50 m within REC6837 (Figure 4.2). At present there are no restrictions on mineral exploration activities within REC6837. However, FLNR has requested that Defense Metals take all possible steps to minimize the impacts of exploration to the recreational ecological values associated with Wicheeda Lake (Raffle and NIcholls, 2020).

Both the federal and provincial environmental assessment processes require the submission of an Initial Project Description and an early engagement plan in order to initiate the assessment process. Following  early  engagement  with  rights  holders  and  other  stakeholders  the  proponent  is responsible for the completion of a Detailed Project Description that incorporates findings, concerns and recommendations identified in the early engagement phase. The acceptance of the Detailed Project Description by the regulators is considered the formal start of the assessment process. Using recently assessed projects both provincially and federally as a benchmark one can expect the full assessment of this proposed project to require approximately 4- 6 years from initiation to completion. Assuming the project receives assessment approval, it is then allowed to advance to the licensing phase of the regulatory process.

A number of permits, licenses and authorizations are required from both the federal and provincial regulators in order to advance the project through licensing to operations. Although the licensing and permitting phases can commence prior to the completion of the environmental assessment, the process will require approximately an additional one to two years following the completion of the assessment prior to advancing to full construction and operations.

To  date,  all  potential  impacts  currently  identified  as  being  associated  with  this  proposed development can be mitigated through the implementation of accepted engineering good practices currently employed throughout the mining industry.

## 20.1.6 Environmental Studies

In support of any environmental assessment a full environmental and social baseline dataset is required. The contents of the baseline report, and ultimately how the potential impacts the proposed project  may  have  on  these  components  are  assessed,  are  guided  by  the  regulators.  In  the Provincial process the proponent receives an Application Information Requirement which describes the  information  a  proponent  is  required  to  supply.  In  the  case  of  a  federal  assessment  these requirements are provided to the proponent in the form of Impact Statement Guidelines.

These guidance documents will identify all of the physical, biological and social aspects of the environment that are required to be characterized (existing conditions). The potential impacts the proposed  project  will  have  on  these  components  is  then  assessed,  and  if  required,  mitigation measures  to  eliminate  or  reduce  these  potential  impacts  are  developed  and  included.  The assessment documentation is ultimately submitted to the regulatory agencies for their review prior to determining whether the project should be allowed to proceed. The following are the baseline studies Defense Metals has initiated or is in the process of initiating in support of the project's environmental assessment:

- Â· Meteorological data
- Â· Hydrogeological studies
- Â· Hydrology studies
- Â· Terrestrial and aquatic biological studies
- Â· Social baseline
- Â· Geochemical characterization
- Â· Geotechnical characterization
- Â· Soils characterization
- Â· Endangered species assessment
- Â· Archeological/heritage investigation

The  hydrogeological,  hydrological  and  geochemical  characterizations  required  to  support  the assessment process are discussed in more detail Sections 20.1.7 and 18.3.

Generally, a minimum of one to two full years of data is required to support an EA application.

It is recommended that the design of the majority of the baseline characterization programs seek design input from the First Nations and other rights holders of the immediate and regional areas as part of the early engagement process.

## 20.1.7 Metal Leaching/Acid Rock Drainage (ML/ARD) Potential

To  date,  there  have  been  no  studies  to  characterize  the  ML/ARD  potential  of  the  waste  rock. Exploration geochemistry data from drill core provides some insight into ML potential, although the suite of parameters analysed, and number of samples representing waste rock are only sufficient to provide a very preliminary assessment. Exploration data from mineralized zones provides some insight into ML potential of tailings; however, the suite of parameters analysed is again limited. Published mineralogical data (Trofanenko et al. 2016) and mineralogical analysis of mill feed and flotation tailings during metallurgical testing (SGS 2021a), are valuable for indicating trace minerals that may be a source of trace element leaching upon weathering. Process water analysis, and static and kinetic testing of a flotation tailings sample produced during metallurgical testing, provide initial

characterization  of  ML/ARD  potential  of  flotation  tailings  and  associated  process  water  (SGS 2021b). A discussion on the ML/ARD potential of the waste rock and mineralization/tailings follows.

## Waste Rock

The ARD potential of waste rock has not been characterized; however, the predominant waste rock lithology  is  limestone,  therefore  due  to  high  carbonate  content,  waste  rock  contact  water  is expected  to  be  mildly  alkaline  and  ARD  potential  is  low.  Other  waste  rock  lithologies  include syenite, below grade dolomite carbonatite, and below grade xenolithic carbonatite, all of which are expected to be present in the pit walls and may comprise a minor component of the waste rock dump.

Minerals that are a concern for metal leaching potential and are present in carbonatite (Trofanenko et al., 2016), include pyrite (trace to a few %), molybdenite (trace), fluorocarbonates (trace to a few %), and pyrochlore (trace).

A summary of key trace element concentrations from the exploration assay database are provided by lithology  in  Table  20-1.  Sulphur  is  an  important  element  to  consider  but  was  not  analysed; however, in lieu of sulphur results, the presence of visible pyrite was logged for some (but not all) drill holes, and therefore provides some indication of whether ML may be expected due to pyrite oxidation.  Arsenic,  molybdenum,  and  selenium  are  important  elements  to  consider  due  to occurrence in water as oxyanions and subsequent enhanced mobility under alkaline conditions, and their expected source as a trace component of pyrite. Molybdenum is also a major component of  molybdenite.  Arsenic  and  molybdenum  data  only  exist  for  a  limited  number  of  dolomite carbonatite  intervals,  and  selenium  was  not  analysed.  Uranium  is  a  ML  consideration  due  to enhanced  mobility  in  the  presence  of  dissolved  carbonate  and  the  potential  for  leaching  from pyrochlore. Fluorine was not analysed but as a component of the REE-bearing carbonates, it is a ML consideration. Elements typically associated with sulphides that occur as cations in water (e.g. cadmium, cobalt, copper, nickel and zinc) are expected to have low mobility at mildly alkaline pH.

As indicated in Table 20-1, visible pyrite is a common occurrence in all rock type and was logged in  a  significant  number  of  drill  intervals.  Arsenic  and  molybdenum  data  are  only  available  for dolomite carbonatite, and indicate enrichment compared to average crustal abundances (using 10 times  average  crustal  abundance  as  a  screening  tool),  suggesting  potential  for  ML  through oxidation of sulphides (pyrite and molybdenite). Uranium does not show enrichment, compared to average crustal abundances, in any of the rock types; however, uranium mobility will need to be assessed through kinetic testing. Thorium is enriched in all rock types. Thorium mobility is expected to be low; however, radium-228 is a decay product of thorium-232 and may be leachable and mobile in a carbonate environment.

The data suggest that there is ML potential from the waste rock and pit walls. The various lithologies will  need  to  undergo  kinetic  testing  to  further  inform  ML  potential  and  aid  in  project  planning. Recommendations for further testing are provided in Section 26.

## Tailings

Flotation tailings are non-potentially acid generating (non-PAG) based on static testing of a pilot plant  sample  from  the  metallurgical  test  program  (SGS  2021b).  Hydrometallurgical  tailings  are expected  to  be  alkaline  based  on  high  carbonate  content  of  the  hydrometallurgical  feed  and significant lime use in the hydrometallurgical processing.

A summary of key trace element concentrations from the flotation tailings sample are shown in Table 20-1. Mixed hydrometallurgical tailings have not been characterized; however, exploration geochemistry results for dolomite carbonatite and xenolithic carbonatite can be used to represent the mineralization (Table 20-1). With processing, the majority of trace elements (other than the REE) are expected to report to the tailings (either flotation or hydrometallurgical tailings, or both), with potential for some dilution from reaction with process reagents. Based on these datasets, arsenic, molybdenum, and selenium are expected to be enriched in tailings and may have potential for ML through sulphide oxidation occurring on tailings beaches in the TSF. Sulphide oxidation should be limited in subaqueous tailings. Thorium is enriched in the mineralization and enriched in the  flotation  tailings  sample,  compared  to  average  crustal  abundances.  Thorium  mobility  is expected to be low at mildly alkaline pH; however, the radium-228 decay product may be leachable. Uranium does not show enrichment in flotation tailings or mineralized rock, compared to average crustal  abundances;  however,  uranium  is  expected  to  be  concentrated  in  hydrometallurgical tailings. The stability of mineral precipitates in hydrometallurgical tailings will need to be determined through kinetic testing as uranium is typically mobile in a carbonate environment. Fluorine will also likely be enriched in tailings based on fluorocarbonate content of the mineralized units and hence is  a  ML consideration. Blended tailings (combined flotation and hydrometallurgical) will need to undergo kinetic testing to further inform ML potential and aid in project planning.

During  operations,  TSF  pond  water  is  expected  to  be  dominated  by  process  water  chemistry. Process water from flotation testwork has undergone multi-element analysis (SGS 2021b) which indicated elevated fluoride (38 mg/L), due to use of a fluorine-rich processing reagent. Molybdenum was  also  elevated  in  filtered process  water  (3  mg/L),  compared  to  10  times  Canadian Environmental Quality Guidelines concentrations, suggesting reaction between process reagents and mineralized rock.

Recommendations for further testing of tailings are provided in Section 26.

## 20.1.8 Radionuclide Activity

Radionuclide activity of the solid phase materials was assessed through converting uranium and thorium concentrations in each rock type to radionuclide activity of uranium-238 and thorium-232 respectively, and assuming radioactive equilibrium between the parent and daughter radionuclides, which is reasonable for rock prior to mineral processing. For flotation tailings, the radionuclides were measured (SGS 2021b). The radionuclide activities were then compared to Health Canada (2011) unconditional derived release limits (UDRL) for diffuse NORM sources (Table 20-1). Where more than one long-lived radionuclide is detected, the 'sum of ratios' needs to be applied whereby the  radionuclides  are  compared  to  their  specific  guideline  and  these  ratios  are  summed  and

compared to the sum of ratios limit. As indicated in Table 20-1, all rock types, and flotation tailings exceeded the UDRLs for diffuse NORM sources for radium-228, thorium-228, and the sum of ratios. This  indicates  that  waste  rock  and  flotation  tailings  are  likely  to  fall  within  a  restricted  NORM classification and require a site review to determine NORM management program requirements.

Activity of thorium-232 in hydrometallurgical tailings is estimated at approximately 10 Bq/g, based on 0.24% predicted thorium content of mixed hydrometallurgical tailings. This is at the UDRL for diffuse NORM sources. Equilibrium between parent and daughter radionuclides is not expected for mineral processing residues, therefore, these cannot be calculated with confidence; however, it is likely that activities of radium-228 and thorium-228 will exceed their specific UDRLs, and NORM management program requirements will need to be determined.

Recommendations for further testing are provided in Section 26.

## 20.2 Social Setting

Defense  Metals  acknowledges  the  Tse'khene,  a  southwesterly  extension  of  the  Athapascan speaking  people  of  northern  Canada.  Defense  Metals  also  acknowledges  that  the  traditional territory  of  the  McLeod  Lake  Tse'khene  is  approximately  108,000  square  kilometers  under Treaty 8's MLIB Agreement (the MLIB Treaty No. 8 Adhesion and Settlement Agreement):

Defense  Metals  is committed  to using BC's guidance  for relationship building: Building Relationships with First Nations - Respecting Rights and Doing Good Business. To that end, they initiated engagement with the MLIB council, staff, and elders in September 2020. Regular face to face engagement activities were not possible at the time due to the global Covid 19 pandemic. Defense Metals is committed to continuing to engage the MLIB through virtual meetings and/or face to face meetings when it is safe to do so on a frequency agreed to by both parties.

Defense Metals has committed to working cooperatively with the MLIB towards implementing a Capacity and Benefit Agreement or a Memorandum of Understanding to develop a Capacity and Benefit Agreement.

## 20.3 Closure

A  conceptual  closure  plan  will  be  required  for  the  assessment  of  the  Wicheeda  project.  If  an assessment certificate is granted and the project is advanced to the licensing and permitting phase, a more detailed closure plan will be required. In accordance with BC environmental legislation, that closure plan and the associated cost estimate to implement it will need to be updated on a five year cycle through to its implementation. Following regulatory acceptance of the closure plan and cost estimate Defense Metals will be required to post a corresponding closure bond with BC's Ministry of Finance. Part of the intent of developing a closure plan as part of the environmental assessment is to allow the mine planers to 'design for closure'.

Closure of the Wicheeda project will be done in accordance with BC environmental legislation with the fundamental considerations being to ensure physical and chemical stability of the site in order to protect human health and the environment.

Within a standard closure plan the five main closure activities consist of:

- Â· De-contamination
- Â· Asset removal
- Â· Demolition and disposal
- Â· Rehabilitation/revegetation
- Â· Monitoring and reporting

In addition, progressive reclamation will be completed throughout the full life cycle of the project when feasible.

## 21 Capital and Operating Costs

## 21.1 Capital Costs

All costs are expressed in U.S. dollars.

## 21.1.1 Mining Capital Cost Estimate

## Pre-Production Activities

Pre-production  activities  are  key  components  of  the  mining  capital  cost  expenditure  (Capex) estimate and consist of the following:

- Â· Logging and grubbing of pit and WSF areas
- Â· Topsoil salvage for reclamation purposes of pit and WSF areas
- Â· Capitalized mining expenses prior to the commencement of processing operations

Pre-production activities for logging, grubbing, and topsoil salvage are estimated at $5,000,000 and are to be expensed in Years -1 and 1.

Capitalized mining expenses are captured under the TSF Capex as initial mining is to provide embankment material for the TSF.

Contingency on pre-production activities is assigned at 15%.

## Mine Equipment

The mine equipment capital cost is estimated for both primary and ancillary equipment. The primary equipment includes items such as drills, loading equipment, haul trucks, track dozers, graders, and water  trucks.  The  ancillary  equipment  includes  light  vehicles,  service  vehicles,  and  lighting equipment.

The  primary  equipment  requirement  estimate  is  based  on  the  mine  schedule  quantities, determinations of productivities and therefore equipment requirements. Costs are derived from vendor quotations and recent SRK studies.

The ancillary equipment capital cost estimate is based on assessed requirements and factoring of the primary mine equipment requirements (20% of initial purchase value).

The Capex estimate for mine equipment is summarized on Table 21-1. New equipment costing has been assumed for the full mine production period. Initial Capex is calculated for the equipment required  to  reach  maximum  production  (to  end  Year  2).  Freight  and  commissioning  costs  are included in the equipment pricing. Spare parts and first fills are assumed at 10% of equipment costs.

Contingency on equipment costs is assigned at 15%.

## Mine Infrastructure

Mine operations infrastructure for the Wicheeda project is to include:

- Â· Mine maintenance shop
- Â· Mine office/dry
- Â· Refueling station for mine equipment

The costing for the above is included in the overall site infrastructure estimate (Section 0)

Explosives storage and garage facilities will also be required; however, since explosive loading is a  contracted  service,  the  explosives  provider  will  be  responsible  for  the  construction  of  these facilities.

## Summary of Mining Capital Costs

The summary of mining capital costs is provided in Table 21-2.

## 21.1.2 Flotation Concentrator Capex Cost Estimate

The capital cost for the 5,000 tpd Wicheeda flotation concentrator is estimated at USD78.9 million and the cost details are presented in Table 21-3. The capital cost estimate is based on InfoMine's 2020 Costmine model for a 5,000 tpd single-product flotation concentrator and has an estimated accuracy of +/-50%. The flotation concentrator Capex estimate includes a 30% cost adjustment that  was  applied  to  Costmine's  model  based  on  Mr.  Olin's  experience.  In  addition,  a  25% contingency has been applied.  Costs for the TSF and working capital have been excluded as these cost items are treated separately in the cash flow model.

## 21.1.3 Hydrometallurgical Plant Capital Cost Estimate

The capital cost for the hydrometallurgical plant is estimated at USD300 million and the cost details are presented in Table 21-4. The capital cost estimate is based on an analysis of detailed capital

cost estimates for similar projects.  Factoring for time, location and process details have been made as appropriate.  The capital cost has an estimated accuracy of +/-50%. As for the flotation plant, costs  for  the  TSF  and  working  capital  have  been  excluded  as  these  cost  items  are  treated separately in the cash flow model.

## 21.2 Operating Costs

## 21.2.1 Mining Operating Cost Estimate

Given  the  final  selection  of  mining  equipment  (8  m 3 excavator  and  61  t  truck),  Mr.  McCarthy selected a unit mining cost of USD4.30/t mined. This cost was based on similar scale operations in recent SRK studies.

The mining cost was split into haulage and non-haulage components. The non-haulage portion (65% assumed) was applied to the USD4.30/t cost, while the haulage cost was re-estimated using conceptual haulage routes and average speeds. Estimated haulage hours were multiplied by an assumed truck operating cost of $300/hr to derive the haulage cost.

Table 21-8 provides the estimated operating expenditures (Opex) for Wicheeda over the life of mine.

Table 21-8: Mine operating costs

It needs to be highlighted that these mining costs exclude mining and hauling waste rock to the TSF for embankment construction. That cost is captured under the TSF Capex estimate.

## 21.2.2 Flotation Concentrator Operating Cost Estimate

Concentrator  operating  costs  are  summarized  in  Table  21-9and  are  estimated  USD18.34/t  of material processed. Labor costs are based on a manpower schedule and labor rates for a similar

project  in  the  region.  Reagent  costs  are  based  on  usage  rates  determined  from  metallurgical testwork and recent unit reagent pricing and includes a freight allowance for shipping to site. Wear material costs are based consumption rates that have been estimated from the abrasion index that has been determined for the material. Process water heating costs are based on fundamental energy input requirements as well as assumptions with respect to heat loss and process water recycle within the plant. Maintenance, laboratory and tailings costs are based on unit costs from inhouse data for similar projects. Reagents, labor and process water heating are the major process cost items and represent 84% of the concentrator operating costs.

## Hydrometallurgical Plant Costs

Maintenance costs have been taken as 5% of the capital cost of maintainable items.

Hydrometallurgical tailings, generated at a rate of about 1.7 t/t concentrate, are taken back to the mine. An allowance of USD50/t has been assumed for this activity.

General and administration costs for the hydrometallurgical plant have been taken to be USD5 million/year.

The cost to ship mixed REE precipitate from the hydrometallurgical plant to a toll processor or purchaser has been taken to be USD138/t of REO shipped.

## 21.2.4 General and Administration Costs

Site general and administration costs (G&amp;A) were estimated at $6M per year.

## 21.2.5 Infrastructure Operating Cost

## Off-Site Infrastructure

No specific provisions for operating costs for off-site infrastructure were made. It is expected to be minimal and assumed to be included in G&amp;A operating costs.

## On-Site Infrastructure

No specific provisions for operating costs for on-site infrastructure were made. It is expected to be minimal and assumed to be included in G&amp;A operating costs.

## Tailings Management

Tailings management costs were estimated at $1.50/t of flotation tailings produced.

## Water Management

Water management operating costs were estimated at $2.4M per year.

## 22 Economic Analysis

## 22.1 Cautionary Statements

## 22.1.1 Certainty of Preliminary Economic Assessment

The PEA is preliminary in nature, in that it includes inferred mineral resources that are considered too speculative geologically to have the economic considerations applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves, and there is no certainty that the PEA will be realized.

## 22.1.2 Mineral Resources are Not Reserves

Mineral resources are not mineral reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability.

## 22.2 General

Economic analysis was undertaken using a discounted cashflow model that was constructed in MS ExcelÂ®. The model primarily used constant (real) 2021 USD and modelled the project cashflows in annual periods.

The model assumes a 3-year physical construction period.

Between the date of this report and the commencement of construction, a period of time sufficient for the study engineering and characterisation work program to be executed must be allowed.

Important Note: The economic model considered only cashflows from the point of commitment to construction forward. Schedule and expenditure for the engineering and study, including technical and economic studies, detailed engineering studies, early procurement activities, cost estimating, resource delineation and infill drilling, geotechnical characterization, metallurgical sampling and test-work,  associated  exploration,  strategic  optimization,  mine,  plant  and  infrastructure  design, permitting and other pre-construction activities were NOT modelled.

## 22.3 Summary

The economic analysis of the estimated  cashflows  for  the  project  indicate  the  potential  for  an economic project across a fairly broad range of input assumptions. The NPV calculated at an 8% discount rate is positive, and the Internal Rate of Return (IRR) calculated for the project is within a favourable range.

A high level of risk with respect to product pricing, marketing and processing strategy remains. This risk is compounded by uncertainty around the structure and function of the markets for rare earth oxides. There is no definitive project timeline for development of the project and it is likely that the structure of the market will continue to evolve.

## 22.4 Revenue

## 22.4.1 Production and Processing Plans

The  production  schedule  mines  26  million  tonnes  of  mill  feed  over  a  period  of  16  years.  The assumption is that for the first four years, the concentrate produced by the mill is sold directly. During this period a hydrometallurgical plant is assumed to be built and from Year 5 onwards, a mixed REE precipitate is the product sold.

## 1.1.1 Offsite Costs and Assumptions

Metallurgical recovery, freight and royalty assumptions are shown  in Table 22-2. The hydrometallurgical plant is assumed to be built locally i.e. within a $100 per-tonne-of-concentrate freight-cost radius. Freight costs for transport of precipitate from the hydrometallurgical plant are included in the operating cost assumptions for the plant and reflect an average value of possible freight costs for various potential customer locations.

Table 22-2: Offsite assumptions

| Sales                     | Value   | Comments              |
|---------------------------|---------|-----------------------|

| Royalty Rate              | 2%      | Of revenue            |

## 22.4.2 Pricing

The pricing assumptions are shown in Table 22-3.

Table 22-3: Long-term REE price assumptions

| Product                          | Units   | Price   |

| Rare earth oxides in concentrate | $/kg    | $5.76   |
| Rare earth oxides in precipitate | $/kg    | $14.04  |

Additional discussion of marketing and pricing risks is contained in Section 19.

## 22.5 Operating Costs

The overall operating costs, per tonne of mill feed are summarized in Table 22-4. Note that the hydrometallurgical cost is for when that plant is in operation, while the overall total operating cost is the average over the life of mine and includes years where that plant was not in operation.

## 22.7 Working Capital

A simplified estimate of working capital was made. Operating costs (minus a 35% allowance to exclude labour) were used as a basis for accounts payable and stores inventory. Revenue was used as a proxy for accounts receivable and WIP. No opening balance for any working capital was assumed.

Mining pre-strip costs were not capitalised, with the exception of some pre-production expenditure.

## 22.8 Tax Calculations

A  simplified  tax  model  was  created  to  estimate  tax  payable.  The  model  uses  an  accelerated resource  depletion  approach  to  estimate  the  capital  depreciation  allowances.  Specific  tax treatments are a function of corporate structure and pre-existing tax and depreciation allowances.

These were not considered for the PEA, and the tax estimate should be considered preliminary. Provincial and Federal tax rates of 13% and 12% respectively were used.

## 22.10  Foreign Exchange

As the timeline for project development is not yet defined, forecasting foreign exchange rates and their  effect  on  the  project  cashflows is not possible. For the conversion of values in this report between USD and CAD an exchange rate of 1.30 CAD per USD was used.

## 22.11  Sensitivity Analysis

A simple sensitivity analysis was undertaken. The results are shown in Table 22-9, Table 22-10, Table 22-11 and Figure 22-1 (USD); and Table 22-12, Table 22-13, Table 22-14, and Figure 22-2 (CAD). Breakeven assumptions for pricing and costs can be inferred from the information provided. The  project  NPV  is  break-even  at  approximately  a  23%  reduction  in  pricing  assumptions.  A combination of approximately a 30% increase in Opex assumptions AND a 30% increase in Capex assumptions are required for a break-even NPV to be indicated.

## 23 Adjacent Properties

Adjacent properties to the project in the Foreland Belt include the Wicheeda North, and Wicheeda properties to the north of the Wicheeda property owned by Marvel Discovery Corp. and spin-out Power-One Resources Corp., and the Prince and Cap properties held by Eagle Bay Resources Corp. (to the south of the Defence Metals claims). The Gambier Gold property claims are owned by Canadian International Minerals Inc. All of these are exploration properties.

## 24 Other Relevant Data and Information

To update the history of the Wicheeda property through to the current operator (Defense Metals), the following is provided (it was previously Section 6.6 of the 2020 technical report [Raffle and Nicholls, 2020]).

Exploratory  metallurgical  testwork  has  been  carried  out  on  Wicheeda  mineralized  dolomitecarbonatite by SGS in 2011 and 2012 using a representative composite sample created with core collected from seven separate drill holes at varying depths.

Prior  to  conducting  the  flotation  testwork,  SGS  carried  out  a  high  definition  ('QEMSCAN') mineralogical study of the drill core composite sample that identified the rare earth minerals as bastnÃ¤site and monazite and the main thorium mineral as thorite (SGS, 2010).

The Wicheeda carbonatite mineral deposit has fairly uniform mineralization, and as a result, very little variability flotation tests are anticipated in the future. The process testwork produced a rare earth oxide concentrate suitable for further treatment in a hydrometallurgical process. The SGS testwork successfully produced a 42% REE concentrate with recoveries shown in Table 6.2 (SGS, 2011).

Table 24-1: Locked cycle test recoveries

| REE   |   Recovery to Concentrate (%) |
|-------|-------------------------------|
| Ce    |                          82.5 |
| La    |                          84.6 |
| Nd    |                          83.8 |

In  2012, SGS conducted hydrometallurgical testwork on a composite of the Wicheeda flotation concentrates  they  had  produced  and  developed  a  conceptual  hydrometallurgical  flow  sheet consisting  of  pre-leaching,  roasting,  leaching  and  precipitation  tests.  The  flotation  concentrate composite grade was 39.7% total rare earth oxides, which through pre- leaching was upgraded to 67% total rare earth oxide material and that in turn was further upgraded to 71% total rare earth oxides by roasting the pre-leach residue. The hydrometallurgical tests were successful in removing 98% of the thorium from the concentrate (SGS, 2012).

In October 2018, Defense Metals collected a 30-tonne surface bulk sample at the Wicheeda project for a multi-phase program of bench-scale metallurgical testwork (SGS, 2019). The sample was submitted  for  metallurgical  testing  with  SGS.  Select  head  assay  results  for  the  30-tonne  bulk sample  include:  1.77%  lanthanum-  oxide,  2.34%  cerium-oxide,  0.52%  neodymium-oxide,  and 0.18% praseodymium-oxide, for a total of 4.81% LREO (light rare-earth oxide).

## 25 Interpretation and Conclusions

## 25.1 Introduction

Based on the review of all relevant reports and data, the QPs for this report have provided the interpretations and conclusions in the sub-sections that follow.

## 25.2 Mineral Tenure, Surface Rights and Agreements

Information  provided  by  Defense  Metals  and  available  and  registered  through  the  Province  of British Columbia's Mineral Titles Online, regarding the mineral tenure over the project area supports that Defense Metals (through Spectrum) has a valid title that is sufficient to support the estimation of mineral resources.

To the extent known, there are no other significant factors and risks that may affect access, title, or the right or ability to perform work on the property that are not discussed in this report.

## 25.3 Geology, Mineralization and Exploration

The descriptions of geology, mineralization and exploration contained in this report (Sections 7, 8, 9) and the recommendations for future work that follow in Section 26.1 are based on results from diamond drilling, geophysical surveys, geochemistry, and geological mapping. The QP foresees no specific risks that would impact continued exploration and development on the property.

## 25.4 Mineral Resource

The  MRE  reported  herein  is  predominately  based  on  an  unchanged  geological  model  and methodologies used to calculate the 2020 MRE. Differences relate to the incorporation of pulp REE multi-element fusion ICP-MS to re-assay of the 2008 and 2009 drillholes, thereby reducing the uncertainty  regarding  the  historical incomplete  XRF  analytical  results,  updated  estimation parameters, and a 2020 LiDAR survey.

The current MRE represents a 36% increase on a contained metal basis in comparison to the 2020 MRE. Primarily, due to the estimation of additional economically significant medium and heavy REEs and a lower cut-off grade established based on consideration of TREO and concentrate payable, metallurgical recovery, and operating cost assumptions. The 2020 MRE estimated and considered five LREE metals, compared with ten REO, including HREO, in the 2021.

There are currently no known additional legal, political, title, taxation, socio-economic, marketing, political or other relevant factors that could materially affect the potential development of the mineral resources. As the project develops and economic studies are completed, more information on these factors will become available.

Mr. Deiss identified the following risks associated with the Wicheeda project:

- Â· Factors that may affect the mineral resources include: metal price and concentrate payable assumptions, changes in interpretations of mineralization geometry, continuity of REE mineralization zones, changes to kriging assumptions, metallurgical recovery assumptions,  operating  cost  assumptions,  confidence  in  the  modifying  factors, including  assumptions  that  surface  rights  to  allow  mining  infrastructure  to  be constructed will be forthcoming, delays or other issues in reaching agreements with regulatory authorities and stakeholders, and changes in land tenure requirements or in permitting requirements.
- Â· TREO  price  assumptions  are  based  on  the  available  TREO  price  information. However,  rare  earth  offtakes  are  established  with  long  term  contracts  to  a  limited number of refineries - primarily in Asia. The likely terms of these contracts are not public information. Offtake term assumptions are indicative only. It is not possible to accurately forecast these assumptions, and there is no guarantee that these terms will be realized. Assumptions on the product sales are indicative of potential market values.
- Â· Refining charges used to establish reasonable prospects for economic extraction were based on a survey of comparable carbonatite intrusion hosted REE deposit NI 43-101 MREs.
- Â· With respect to environmental and  permitting risk and  uncertainty, the area surrounding  Wicheeda  Lake  has  known  to  have  high  recreational  and  ecological values.  The  lake  and  surrounding  area  are  currently  covered  under  recreational reserve  REC6837  established  by  FLNR.  The  northern  limit  of  the  LG  pit  lies approximately  400  m  southeast  of  the  southern  limit  of  Wicheeda  Lake,  and approximately 50 m within REC6837. At present there are no restrictions on mineral exploration activities within REC6837. However, FLNR has requested that Defense Metals take all possible steps to minimize the impacts of exploration to the recreational ecological values associated with Wicheeda Lake.
- Â· No measured mineral resources were classified in the MRE due to drilling density, therefore affecting the confidence and positioning of the geological interpretation as well as the inability to establish whether additional estimation domains are required within the Dolomitie Carbonatite.
- Â· There is insufficient understanding of the density of both waste and mineralized zones. Median densities were applied to each major modelled unit for the 2021 MRE.
- Â· Several sources of uncertainties exist with regards to the 2021 MRE, particularly within the Xenolithic Carbonatite and the western fault block Dolomite Carbonatite domains, all  of  which  are  restricted  to  an  inferred  resource  classification.  These  include,  in decreasing order of importance, the following:
- o Insufficient data density to confidently determine the boundary of the Xenolithic Carbonatite and western fault block dolomite-carbonatite domains.
- o Insufficient data to calculate variograms for the Xenolithic Carbonatite and the western fault block dolomite-carbonatite domains.

However, Mr. Deiss considers that these sources of uncertainty are minor given that approximately  94%  of  the  current  resource  is  hosted  within  Dolomite  Carbonatite rocks, and no current resources of any category occur within the Syenite or Limestone.

## 25.5 Metallurgy

## 25.5.1 Flotation Processing

Metallurgical testwork has been conducted on a single test composite containing about 4.8% TREO and has shown that the material can be readily upgraded by flotation to produce concentrates containing 40-50% TREO. It is noted, however, that the test composite grade was significantly higher than planned mine production grades that will range from about 2.1-3.0% TREO during the first 10 years of mining and then decrease to about 1.9-1.2% TREO during later years of mining. REO recovery and concentrate grades have been reduced to allow for the lower planned mine grades; however, during the next phase of metallurgical testwork achievable REO recovery and concentrate grades must be confirmed on test composites that reflect the actual estimated mine grades. It should be anticipated that process requirements such as flotation reagent usage and conditioning  requirements  for  lower  grade  material  will  be  significantly  different  than  has  been determined to-date on the single high-grade composite.  The next phase of metallurgical testwork will also need to conduct variability testwork in order to assess variability with respect to grade, lithology and mineralogy within the deposit.

## 25.5.2 Hydrometallurgical Processing

The testwork completed to date has been done on flotation concentrates sourced from a single bulk sample that was of higher grade than that expected of production-mined material.  Future testwork must examine flotation concentrate derived from mineralized material taken from several areas  of  the  deposit  and  of  different  grades.    The  flotation  concentrate  grades  should  have appropriate grades.

Regardless of the flowsheet carried forward, caustic crack or acid bake, risk needs to be eliminated through a detailed program of testwork including pilot plant operations.

## 25.6 Mining

## 25.6.1 Pit Geotechnical

The following summarizes the opinion of SRK's pit geotechnical QP, Mr. Thomas, on the major risks and opportunities for pit geotechnical:

- Â· Overall pit slope angles were selected based on experience and using guidance from widely  used  empirical  charts.  This  is  standard  industry  approach  to  PEA  level assessments. It  is  an  overly  simplistic  way  to  approach  a  complex  situation  but  is compatible and reasonable for the current project geomechanical knowledge.

- Â· The historical geotechnical data is sparse and was supplemented by way of photo logging.  Although  this  successfully  expanded  the  data  set,  photo  logging  has significant limitations in comparison to physically logging core. Mr. Thomas considers the approach taken to be reasonable at PEA level, but photo logging should not be used as a primary data source for more advanced studies.
- Â· The high-level data quality check highlighted possible areas of concern in the historical data,  namely  possible  inconsistencies  between  different  field  campaigns,  and  poor correlation between RQD and FF/m parameters. These findings cast some doubt over the reliability of the historical data.
- Â· Typical of early-stage studies, most of the data is in close vicinity to the mineralized zone.  There  are  significant  spatial  data  gaps  in  the  vicinity  of  the  ultimate  pit  wall forming rock, most significantly in the east where pit walls will be the highest.
- Â· The rock mass that will form the ultimate pit walls is highly variable and mostly in the 'Poor' and 'Fair' categories in which steep slope are unlikely to be achieved. Slope stability of the proposed pit is likely to be controlled by rock mass strength and major structures. Review of the core photos indicated significant brittle structure content and control on rock mass strength. Thus, there are likely more major structures than are represented in the current 3-D model. Measures such as careful limit blasting and depressurization may be effective in designing and achieving steeper angles.

## 25.6.2 Mine Planning

The Wicheeda project is to be an open pit mining operation that feeds a flotation concentrator on site  at  1.8  Mtpa.  SRK  generated  a  mine  plan  that  incorporated  two  mining  phases  that  took advantage of near surface, higher grade mineralization. The mine plan did not however incorporate low grade mill feed. In future, there is an opportunity to optimize the cut-off grades for Wicheeda and thereby stockpile low grade material for mill feed later in the mine plan.

Further opportunities and risks associated with the mining aspects of the Wicheeda project include:

- Â· There are limited pit structural and geotechnical data gathered to this point for the project.  Pit  slope  design  criteria  are  based  solely  on  reviews  of  core  photos. Consequently,  there  is  the  risk  that  current  slope  assumptions  may  be  optimistic, necessitating shallower slopes, higher strip ratios and higher costs. This could put at risk some of the mineable resources.
- Â· Conversely, acquisition of further rock strength and structural geotechnical data may allow refinement of pit slope design criteria that may result in overall steepening of wall angles. This can provide opportunities to add mineable resources to the project.
- Â· The flotation concentrator recoveries in this PEA are based on limited metallurgical data. Further testing is required to assess the recovery of lower grade resources. While the current PEA recoveries are reasonable, it is possible that they understate actual recoveries.  If  that  were  the  case,  in  addition  to  more  recovered  REO  in  current resources, there is the potential to increase the pit size and mineable resources.

- Â· Of course, the converse is true that the flotation recoveries may in fact be lower, and thus, there could be a risk that mineable resources may reduce.
- Â· Presently, the TSF embankment is constructed approximately 50/50 with pit rock and locally sourced till. The optimum mix of these materials has yet to be worked out, both from a TSF performance perspective and an overall cost perspective. At present, the costing of the pit rock component of the TSF embankment construction is 20% less than the till. Thus, if there is potential to increase the rock portion of the construction, there is an opportunity to reduce TSF construction costs.
- Â· While some positive results have been demonstrated in limited mineral sorting testing (Section 13.2.7), there is potential to explore mineral sorting further. If viable, mineral sorting  could  upgrade  lower  grade  resources  currently  not  considered  mineable.  It could also reject waste and thereby reduce tailings management requirements.

None of the above has the potential to compromise the economic viability of the Wicheeda project. Of the items listed, the flotation recovery has greatest impact on overall project economics.

## 25.7 Waste Management

## 25.7.1 Geochemistry

Although  ML/ARD  potential  of  waste  rock  (including  pit  walls)  have  not  been  characterized, geological, mineralogical, and exploration assay data indicate:

- Â· ARD potential of waste rock is low due to high carbonate content
- Â· There is some potential for metal leaching associated with sulphide oxidation based on a significant number of drill intervals containing pyrite, and enrichment of arsenic and molybdenum in dolomite carbonatite.
- Â· Other parameters that may be a metal leaching concern based on the presence of a mineralogical source, or enhanced mobility under alkaline conditions, include fluorine, selenium, uranium, and radium.

The ML/ARD potential of tailings based on geological, mineralogical, and exploration assay data, and initial characterization work on flotation tailings and process water indicate:

- Â· ARD potential of tailings is low due to high carbonate content
- Â· There is some potential for metal leaching associated with sulphide oxidation in tailings disposed  on  tailings  beaches,  based  on  enrichment  of  arsenic,  molybdenum,  and selenium  in  flotation  tailings.  Sulphide  oxidation  should  be  limited  in  subaqueous tailings.
- Â· Fluorine is expected to be elevated in process water due to flotation process reagent use and may also leach from process residues.

- Â· Molybdenum is expected to be elevated in process water due to reaction between mineralized rock and process water.
- Â· Thorium enrichment in tailings may result in mobility of the radium-228 decay product in tailings water.

Thorium data from the exploration assay database, and radionuclide data available for flotation tailings indicate:

- Â· NORM management program requirements will need to be determined for the project.

## 25.7.2 Tailing Management

The SRK team has developed a preliminary design concept for slurry TSF. It is to be constructed of waste rock from the open pit and appropriate glacial till sourced in the project area. A downstream construction method so to be adopted. The following risks relate to TSF at this time:

- Â· No  geotechnical  assessments  have  been  performed  in  the  area  of  the  TSF.  The presence  of  deleterious  foundation  conditions  could  pose  risk  to  the  viability  or construction cost of the facility.
- Â· The use of glacial till  for  certain  embankment  components  is  at  risk  if  a  source  or sources of appropriate material cannot be found in the project area or nearby.
- Â· Tailings are to be sub-aerially deposited to form a beach sloping 1-2%. No studies have been undertaken to confirm this assumption. If this beach slope is not achieved, design storage capacities and the water management plan may be put at risk.
- Â· The stability of the hydrometallurgical tailings has yet to be determined and could affect tailings management.

Given the preliminary nature of the PEA TSF design, there is opportunity for optimize the following:

- Â· The mix of pit waste rock and other sourced materials (e.g. more local rock quarry or glacial till sources)
- Â· The integration of the TSF, its seepage ponds, and the Contact Water Pond operations to manage excess water in storm events

## 25.8 Water Management

The following risks have been identified related to water management for the project:

- Â· Radioactivity of the sludge from the water treatment plant is unknown, which could affect sludge management disposal options and costs.
- Â· The duration of water treatment after mine closure is unknown. A water quality model is required, combining geochemical source terms with expected water volumes across the mine site, to evaluate long-term treatment requirements.

The following opportunities have been identified related to water management for the project:

- Â· Parameters identified for water treatment are based on screening of geochemical data. Dilution from natural runoff contributions into the Contact Water Pond and TSF could prove that treatment for some parameters are no longer required. In addition, a mixing zone in Wicheeda Creek could also reduce on-site water treatment requirements after consideration of in-stream dilution.
- Â· The capacity of the Contact Water Pond assumes all water collected in the TSF is dewatered regularly, maintaining as close to dry conditions as possible in the TSF for dam safety reasons. Further studies may increase water storage allowance in the TSF, which  could  reduce  the  volumes  required  in  the  Contact  Water  Pond.  Similarly, adjustments in the configuration of the seepage sumps along the toe of the TSF dam could  be  made  to  provide  additional  storage  of  contact  water,  further  reducing  the storage requirements at the Contact Water Pond.
- Â· Advancing the geochemical source terms of pit wall and waste rock runoff and the predictive water quality model may provide justification for segregating different types of water to reduce water treatment requirements. If waste rock runoff, for example, was found to require sediment control only, the size of the water treatment plant could be reduced by approximately 50%.

## 25.9 Offsite Infrastructure

No 'fatal flaws' have been identified with respect to offsite project infrastructure. The engineering and costing assumptions are at a scoping or PEA level and will require additional engineering and estimating precision to confirm the assumptions for a PFS-level study.

## 25.10  Environmental and Social

Defense  Metals  has  initiated  early  engagement  with  the  First  Nation  and  other  rights  holders associated with Wicheeda's location. In addition, they have initiated the baseline characterization necessary for the completion of an environmental assessment supporting the proposed project. Both steps are fundamental for a timely advancement of the project to a producing mine.

To date all potential impacts currently identified as being associated with this proposed project can be  mitigated  through  the  implementation  of  accepted  engineering  good  practices  currently employed throughout Canada's mining industry.

## 25.11  Economic Analysis

## Certainty of Preliminary Economic Assessment

The PEA is preliminary in nature, in that it includes inferred mineral resources that are considered too speculative geologically to have the economic considerations applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves, and there is no certainty that the PEA will be realized.

## Mineral Resources are Not Reserves

Mineral resources are not mineral reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability.

The economic analysis of the estimated  cashflows  for  the  project  indicate  the  potential  for  an economic project across a fairly broad range of input assumptions. The NPV calculated at an 8% discount  rate  is  positive,  and  the  Internal  Rate  of  Return  calculated  for  the  project  is  within  a favourable range.

A high level of risk with respect to product pricing, marketing and processing strategy remains. This risk is compounded by uncertainty around the structure and function of the markets for rare earth oxides. There is no definitive project timeline for development of the project and it is likely that the structure of the market will continue to evolve.

## 26 Recommendations

The following is recommended to advance the Wicheeda REE project to the next stage.

## 26.1 Exploration and Mineral Resource

Mr. Deiss recommends the following actions and considerations for future develop of the Wicheeda project, by improving the confidence in the MRE:

- Â· Update the geological litho-stratigraphic model and MRE with the 2021 drilling results.
- Â· Incorporate  an  overburden  lithological  layer into the geological model  with  a representative density applied. It is recommended that the overburden be tested for anomalous  values  of  REE  and  estimate  the  grades  if  applicable.  Should  there  be sufficient material present, the recoveries should be tested to establish whether the material could be considered for mineral resources purposes.
- Â· Expand exploration drilling into areas where current drilling indicates the Wicheeda deposit is still open-ended.
- Â· Consideration given to geotechnical and ground water monitoring drilling to facilitate future higher levels of study to address geotechnical and environmental risk, which affect the reasonable prospects of eventual economic extraction of mineral resources.
- Â· Continue with infill drilling to improve the confidence in the MRE, which could facilitate a higher mineral resource category (i.e. indicated or measured resources).
- Â· Estimate the concentration of deleterious elements such as thorium in the MRE.
- Â· Estimate  terbium  and  holmium  grades,  even  though  they  exist  at  very  low  ppm concentrations based on current drill hole analytical results.
- Â· Develop variograms from the 2021 drillhole results to assist in the kriging process of domains that  could  not  produce  robust  experimental  variograms  in  the  2021  MRE process.
- Â· Drill hole core density measurements should be routinely taken to build-up a density database that can be utilized to assign a representative density values, to the different waste rock and mineralized lithologies.
- Â· Confirm product sales via commercial negotiations with refineries to ensure that the mined product has reasonable prospects of being sold.

Defense Metals proposed budget for 2022 exploration drilling totals USD2,000,000.

## 26.2 Metallurgy

## 26.2.1 Flotation Processing

Mr. Olin makes the following recommendations for testwork to be conducted during the next phase metallurgical program:

- Â· Develop metallurgical master composites and variability composites that represent the grades and mineralogy of the material to be mined
- Â· Conduct metallurgical testwork to further evaluate process requirements, including:
- o Comminution requirements
- o Reagent usage and conditioning requirements
- o Reagent conditioning and flotation slurry temperature
- o Flotation feed grind size
- o Need for desliming prior to flotation
- o Concentrate thickening and filtration requirements
- o Tailing thickening and filtration requirements
- o Evaluate grade-recovery relationships such as:
- âª REO recovery versus feed grade
- âª REO recovery versus concentrate grade
- âª REO concentrate grade versus feed grade
- Â· Conduct  a  bulk  flotation  test  or  a  pilot  plant  to  generate  flotation  concentrates  for confirmatory hydrometallurgical testwork.
- Â· SRC completed an initial evaluation of mineral sorting on a small number of drill core pieces.  These  tests  were  not  sufficient  to  endorse  or  dismiss  mineral  sorting.  It  is recommended that mineral sorting receive a more thorough study in the future.

The  cost  for  the  next  phase  of  metallurgical  testwork  is  estimated  at  about  USD1,000,000  1,250,000 (excluding mineral sorting).

## 26.2.2 Hydrometallurgical Processing

To progress the project further, Defense Metals should conduct much more testing on concentrate samples generated  from  mineralized  material  samples  from  different  areas  of  the  deposit  and different lithologies and grades.

Additional testwork should be done on the partially developed gangue leach - caustic crack - REE leach route.  However, the acid bake route provided some encouraging preliminary results and should also be further investigated.

All  testwork  should  start  with  further  bench  scale  testing  with  limited  pilot  plant  testing  prior  to deciding on the process route to be followed.  Once that has been determined, additional benchscale and extensive pilot plant testing will be needed to confirm the suitability of the selected route and to develop design criteria and REE recovery values.

The environmental properties of the hydrometallurgical plant residues alone and when combined with flotation plant tailings need to be determined.

Mr. Goode makes the following recommendations for testwork to be conducted during the next phase of the hydrometallurgical program:

- Â· Examine flotation concentrates representing different mineralogy or lithology types across a range of concentrate grades
- Â· Further investigate process alternatives such as acid baking. Test the economics of any technically viable alternatives
- Â· Subject the selected flowsheet to a rigorous series of bench and pilot plant tests to define recovery and reagent/consumable demand

The cost for the next phase of hydrometallurgical testwork and pilot plant operations will be in the range of USD2,000,000-2,500,000.

## 26.3 Mining

## 26.3.1 Pit Geotechnical

The SRK pit geotechnical QP  provides these recommendations for future studies:

- Â· Detailed  quality  assurance  checks  of  the  historical  data  to  identify  the  causes  of problems and 'engineer' the data set to address them.
- Â· Diamond-cored, triple-tube oriented drillholes (approximately five to seven) providing coverage of the proposed ultimate pit wall forming rocks and major geological units. Downhole televiewer survey of selected drillholes for high-quality structures information.
- Â· Targeted  hydrogeological  testing  (e.g.,  air-lift, packer)  for  characterization  and definition of hydraulic properties. Hydrogeology installations (e.g., standpipe piezometers, vibrating wire piezometers) for groundwater monitoring.
- Â· Geotechnical logging and sampling of the recovered core. In addition to the standard logging parameters, micro-defect intensity and parameters of possible geomechanical

controls (e.g., weathering, alteration) will be important for improved characterization and classification.

- Â· Field  (estimated  strength  and  point  load),  and  laboratory  (UCS,  triaxial  and  direct shear) testing of recovered samples to determine intact rock and discontinuity strength properties.
- Â· Structural geology study, including the development of a 3-D model. Major structures are critical to understanding the geotechnical conditions, and slope stability controls.
- Â· Define geological controls on the geotechnical properties and develop 3-D models of rock mass and structural domains.
- Â· Conduct numerical kinematic and slope stability analyses of pit design sectors to assist with selection of bench geometries and configurations for more detailed pit design.

Expected costs for these recommendations, including drilling is USD500,000-700,000. Note that geotechnical drillholes could potentially be multi-purposed with resource drillholes to reduce this cost.

## 26.3.2 Mining Studies

The SRK mining QP recommends that upon further exploration and development of an updated MRE, with sufficient indicated mineral resources, a PFS should be undertaken on the Wicheeda project. In addition to exploration and MRE update, other areas of required data collection and analysis commensurate for a PFS are described in this Section 26. The suggested budget for the PFS, after all related data has been gathered, is USD750,000-1,000,000.

## 26.4 Waste Management

## 26.4.1 Geochemistry

As the project advances, additional characterization of both the waste rock and tailings will be required. This information will be used to support more detailed mine planning and environmental permitting.

SRK typically recommends a staged approach to waste rock characterization, with static testing of a moderate number of samples from the waste rock (in the range of 50 to 100), and then kinetic testing - including both laboratory and field-based tests on a representative subset of samples. The initial static testing can be conducted on finely pulverized assay rejects from existing drill core, assuming that existing drill core provides suitable coverage of waste rock units representing the open pit. Kinetic tests will require jaw crushed material, and likely will require further sampling from core boxes. The analysis suite for both solids and leachate samples will need to be comprehensive, and in addition to the complete suite of major and trace elements usually required for ML/ARD characterization,  it  should  include  fluorine,  and  where  appropriate,  radionuclides.  Mineralogical characterization should also be conducted on samples undergoing kinetic testing. Costs for static testing,  including  a  site  visit  to  examine  drill  core,  sample  selection,  data  interpretation,  and reporting are expected to be on the order of USD70,000. Kinetic testing, including sample selection,

set up  and  analysis  of approximately  eight  field and  eight laboratory-based  tests, data interpretation, and reporting, is expected to be on the order of $250,000.

For  tailings,  static  and  kinetic  testing  will  need  to  be  conducted  in  conjunction  with  further metallurgical testing. Samples would ideally include a few composites representing the range of mineralization  that  will  be  encountered  over  the  mine  life  and  would  include  tailings  solids  in addition to associated process water. Tailings would include flotation and blended hydrometallurgical  and  flotation  tailings  to  represent  tailings  disposal  prior  to  and  following implementation of the hydrometallurgical plant. Kinetic testing  will need to simulate disposal of subaqueous tailings and tailings in beaches and will therefore require subaqueous column and humidity cell testing. Tailings solids, process water, and leachates from kinetic testing should be analyzed  for  a  complete  suite  of  major  and  trace  elements,  and  appropriate  radionuclides. Mineralogical characterization should also be conducted on tailings solids, which should include methods that are appropriate for identification of amorphous hydrometallurgical precipitates. Costs for these programs are estimated at USD200,000.

Glacial till  and/or other borrow sources for TSF embankment construction should also undergo geochemical characterization, estimated at USD50,000.

## 26.4.2 Tailings Management

The following investigations are recommended for tailings management:

- Â· Perform a field investigation of the foundation conditions for the TSF. Two objectives should be targeted: to confirm suitable insitu foundation conditions for impoundment and  embankment  construction,  to  identify  borrow  sources  for  the  embankment construction.
- Â· Conduct a broader search for borrow sources, focusing first on the Wicheeda property and if necessary looking off property.
- Â· Perform  material  characteristic  investigations  on  flotation  tailings  (with  and  without hydrometallurgical residue).
- Â· Conduct  analyses  of  alternate  tailings  management  strategies.  While  a  high  level trade-off study between slurry TSF and dry stack tailings showed preference to slurry TSF for economic reasons and reduced geotechnical risk, further study is warranted at the PFS stage.

Expected costs for these recommendations, including field programs is USD600,000-850,000.

## 26.5 Water Management

The following studies are recommended in order to develop the water management designs for the project:

- Â· Hydrometeorological baseline characterization to refine climatic and hydrologic inputs for  infrastructure  design  and  water  quality  modeling.  The  baseline  program  should include installation of local hydrometric stations for streamflow characterization and local meteorological stations for climatic characterization.
- Â· Climate change assessment to evaluate effects to climate and associated parameters (i.e. streamflow and evaporation rates) and the associated impacts on infrastructure, mine operations and closure planning.
- Â· Baseline water quality monitoring program to characterize the baseline concentrations in the receiving environment.
- Â· Mixing zone assessment in the receiving environment of Wicheeda Creek to establish baseline conditions and available dilution capacity for project discharge.
- Â· Advance the geochemical characterization to establish expected and worst-case water quality estimates from mining area including the pit wall, waste rock and tailings.
- Â· Predictive water and load balance model to develop expected and worst-case water quality and water volumes in the Contact Water Pond and TSF under average, wet and dry conditions. Modeling should consider flow rates and water quality in the receiving environment and have the ability to simulate climate change conditions.
- Â· Hydrogeological  model  to  establish  potential  effects  of  the  project  on  the  regional groundwater system and magnitude of inflows to the open pit and from the TSF.
- Â· Dam breach assessment to establish the dam classifications for all water and tailings storage dams.

The expected costs for the noted recommendations as required for a PFS is USD240,000-400,000.

## 26.6 Infrastructure

## 26.6.1 Water Supply

Identify  alternate  sources of water and progress the permitting process and engineering of the infrastructure required.

## 26.6.2 Power Supply

Commence discussion with BC Hydro regarding the feasibility of access in the BC Hydro 138 kV line (1L 365) transmission line. Obtain budget quotes for that connection .

## 26.6.3 Road access

Survey the access route to confirm its suitability or to identify an alternate route. Commence more detailed engineering design and cost estimation for the road upgrade. The required geotechnical characterisation program should be scoped.

No other specific recommendations are indicated, other than to advance design, engineering and cost estimation in parallel with the work on the mining and processing aspects.

## 26.6.4 Site Geotechnical

Conduct a subsurface geotechnical investigation to understand foundation conditions for the WSF, plant site, crusher pad, maintenance shop and Contact Water Pond. Estimate cost is $250,000$400,000.

## 26.7 Environmental and Social

Formalize the engagement plan and advance these discussions in order to obtain and integrate the concerns and traditional knowledge of the rights holders for the immediate and regional areas associated with the proposed project. This will only serve to build social capital for the project as well as meet the requirements of both provincial and federal environmental assessments.

In addition, all components of a comprehensive environmental and social baseline characterization program  should  be  continued  and/or  initiated  in  order  to  support  the  project's  environmental assessment requirements. The development and implementation of these studies should include recommendations obtained during the early engagement sessions with the project's First Nation rights holders. Efforts to engage representatives of the MLIB into the various field teams required to complete the environmental baseline studies is also recommended.

## 26.8 Economics

The economic analysis supports the proposition that the project may have economic merit across a reasonably wide range of assumptions. Additional precision in terms of analysis is indicated if the study  moves  to  PFS.  Costing  inputs  should  (will)  be  refined.  Additional  resolution  in  terms  of production scheduling should be achieved by moving to quarterly scheduling for mine planning, processing and construction activities.

The tax model should be updated to reflect the detailed tax  environment in BC, as well as to incorporate the existence of any opening balance for tax losses, prior expenditure and depreciation balances.

Due  to  the  high  level  of  market  risk  associated  with  REE  marketing,  the  Mr.  Winkelmann recommends that Defense Metals maintain an active process to track and analyse the markets for REE. The risk profile for the project may change significantly as the markets continue to evolve. Technical marketing studies that focus on the expected product qualities potentially produced by Wicheeda can assist in refining pricing forecasts. The marketing assumptions in this study are suitable for a PEA-level study but should be considered as preliminary.

The strategic decision to defer the construction of the hydrometallurgical plant should be reviewed, as additional value may accrue by re-optimising this strategy as market conditions evolve.

## 26.9 Summary
