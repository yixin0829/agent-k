## 1.0 SUMMARY

## 1.1 General

The Whabouchi property is located in the James Bay area of the Province of Quebec, approximately 30 km east of the Nemaska community and 300 km north-northwest of the town of Chibougamau. The Property is accessible by the Route du Nord ,  the  main  allseason gravel road linking Chibougamau and Nemaska, and crossing the Property near its center. The Nemiscau airport is 18 km west of the Property.

The  Property  is  composed  of  one  (1)  block  containing  33  map-designated  claims covering a total of 1,716 ha. The claims are 100% owned by Nemaska and were acquired via a purchase agreement with Victor Cantore Group, a purchase agreement with Golden Goose Resources Inc. and directly by map designation. The ten (10) claims acquired from Golden  Goose  are  subject  to  a  2%  NSR  royalty  and  the  claims  acquired  from  Victor Cantore and four (4) of the seven (7) claims acquired by map designation are subject to a 3% NSR royalty in favour of Victor Cantore Group.

## 1.2 Geology

The Whabouchi property is located in the northeast part of the Superior Province of the Canadian Shield craton, in the Lac des Montagnes volcano-sedimentary formation which is  principally  composed  of  metasediments  and  mafic  and  ultramafic  amphibolites.  A spodumene-bearing  pegmatite  swarm  occurs  in  the  center  of  the  Property  and  is composed  of  a  series  of  sub-parallel  and  general  sub-vertical  pegmatites  up  to  130  m wide  in  total.  The  mineralized  pegmatite  swarm  has  a  generally  NE-SW  orientation, extends 1.3 km along strike and reaches a depth of more than 300 m below surface. The lithium  mineralization  occurs  mainly  in  medium  to  large  spodumene  crystals  (up  to 30 cm in size) but petalite also occurs, averaging less than 2% in the deposit. Muscovite also contains minor lithium.

Nemaska completed exploration programs in 2009, 2010 and early 2011 on the Property. A total of 143 surface channels for 944 samples and 115 drill holes for 22,085 m were completed by Nemaska. In addition to drilling, 14 line-km of ground magnetic surveying covering the main mineralized occurrence and 670 line-km of helicopter-borne magnetic surveying covering the Property were completed.

## 1.3 Mineral Resource Estimate

SGS Geostat completed the mineral resource update using the digital database supplied by Nemaska which included channel data from trenches and drill hole data completed by Nemaska since 2009. The database used to produce the mineral resource estimate was

<!-- image -->

derived from a total of 460 channels and diamond drill holes and contained the collar, survey, lithology, and analytical results information.

The mineral resource estimate was derived from a computerized resource block model. Once  the  modeling  was  complete,  the  analytical  data  contained  within  the  wireframe envelopes is normalized to generate fixed length analytical composites. The composite data was used to interpolate the grade of blocks regularly spaced on a defined grid that fills the 3-D  wireframe  envelopes. An  optimized  pit shell model  using the pit optimization  software  Whittle  was  produced  using  the  completed  block  model.  The interpolated  blocks  located  below  the  bedrock/overburden  interface  and  within  the optimized pit shell comprise the mineral resources.

Table 1.1 shows a summary of the estimated mineral resource for a cut-off grade of 0.4% Li2O.

Table 1.1 - Estimated Mineral Resources (0.4% Li2O Cut-off grade)

| Category               | Tonnes     |   Li2O Grade  (%) |
|------------------------|------------|-------------------|
| Measured               | 11,294,000 |              1.58 |

| Inferred               | 4,401,000  |              1.5  |

## 1.4 In-Pit Mineral Resources Estimate

BBA  prepared  the  in-pit  mineral  resources  estimate  for  the  PEA  Report,  based  on  a conventional  open  pit  operation.  The  mining  engineering  work  required  for  the  Study, such as the pit optimization, engineered pit design, mine planning, and economic analysis is  based  on  the  resource  block  model  prepared  by  SGS  Geostat  (' Geostat ')  and  only used the blocks classified as either a measured or indicated resource in order to generate revenue.

After multiple simulations on in-pit resources estimation, the concentrator cut-off grade was  established  at 0.4%  Li2O.  The  average  grades,  using  cut-offs  ranging  from 0.4% Li2O and 0.8% Li2O are very close and therefore the 0.4% Li2O has been selected. Table 1.2 shows a summary of the estimated In-Pit mineral resources for a cut-off grade of 0.4% Li2O.

## 1.5 Mineral Processing and Testing

## 1.5.1 Concentrator Process Testing

Bench scale testing was carried out on core from four (4) NQ holes drilled by Nemaska through the central portion of the main pegmatite in order to obtain approximately one (1) tonne of mineralized core exclusively for metallurgical test work. The core was sent by truck to the SGS Lakefield Laboratories in July of 2010. The head grade of the sample was reported as 1.72% Li2O. The material collected from the pegmatite was 5.5% higher in  Li2O  than  the  average  grade  determined  by  Geostat  and  used  in  their  resource estimation.  This  was  considered  to  be  within  acceptable  limits  and  appropriate  for  the metallurgical work for the PEA Study. The following tests were carried out:

- · Mineralogy;
- · Crushing and Grinding Tests;
- · Dense Medium Test Work, and
- · Bench Scale Flotation Tests.

Dense  Media  Separation  (' DMS ')  pilot  testing  was  carried  out  on  two  (2)  separate samples from the Whabouchi deposit. The first being a 25 tonnes blasted outcrop sample and  the  second  was  a  5  tonnes  mine  representative  sample  consisting  of  a  blend  of outcrop and drill core materials. Testing was carried out in several stages consisting of crushing, scrubbing, screening, DMS, magnetic separation, and dewatering. Based on test data  during  processing  of  the  blasted  sample,  the  mine  representative  sample  was processed  using  a  simplified  flow  sheet  and  was  considered  to  approximate  the  final future DMS plant flow sheet.

Pilot  scale  flotation  tests  were  carried  out  on  the  as-received  blasted  outcrop  and  mine representative samples, as well as the DMS middling products obtained by processing the blasted  outcrop  and  mine  representative  samples.  Based  on  DMS  and  flotation  pilot testing at a head grade of 1.61% Li2O, the following was concluded:

- · 25.5% of the total lithium was recovered in the DMS concentrate, while 65.7% of the lithium reported to the flotation circuit;
- · The flotation Li recovery was 80%, for an overall lithium recovery of 78%;
- · The DMS concentrate grade was 6.2% Li2O, while the flotation concentrate grade was 5.9% Li2O. The combined concentrate grade was 6.0% Li2O, and
- · The  DMS  concentrate  represented  31.5%  of  the  total  concentrate  and  contained 32.7%  of  the  total  recovered  lithium,  while  the  flotation  concentrate  represented 68.5% of the total concentrate and contained 67.3% of the total recovered lithium.

Sedimentation  and  filtration  tests  were  carried  out  at  SGS  Lakefield.  Based  on  the filtration  tests,  it  was  concluded  that  a  pressure  filter  would  be  required.  The  flotation tailings will be combined with the DMS tailings and dry stacked.

## 1.5.2 Pyrometallurgical Testing

Prior to the hydrometallurgical test work at SGS Lakefield, the Whabouchi spodumene concentrate was roasted at Feeco's pilot plant facilities in Green Bay, Wisconsin, U.S.A. Fine  (flotation)  and  coarse  (DMS)  concentrates  from  the  original  concentration  flow sheet  were  shipped  from  SGS  Lakefield  to  Feeco's  laboratory.  Two  (2)  blends  of concentrates  were  prepared  using  the  as-received  coarse  material  and  the  dried  fine material. A first blend was prepared, containing 75% fines and 25% coarse. The second blend contained 50% fines and 50% coarse.

Roasting  converts  the  spodumene's  crystalline  structure  from  alpha  to beta. The conversion temperature is about 1,025 ºC. The beta phase is reactive with sulfuric acid and produces lithium sulphate, which is amenable to leaching. A paddle mixer was used to blend the beta spodumene with 93% sulfuric acid.

## 1.5.3 Hydrometallurgical Testing

The hydrometallurgical testing was done in three (3) phases at SGS Lakefield. Additional test work was completed by Ameridia.

- a) Hydrometallurgical Testing - Phase 1

The Phase 1 consisted of concentrate leach and all purification steps (primary and secondary impurity removal and ion exchange). The test program was carried out in

<!-- image -->

November  2011  by  SGS  Lakefield.  The  two  (2)  blends  tested during the pyrometallurgy test work were provided to feed the pilot plant (75/25 and 50/50).

The objectives of the concentrate leach and the Primary Impurity Removal (' PIR ') were to dissolve lithium sulphate and remove the major impurities (Fe, Al, Si, Mn and  Mg).  Solids  were  mixed  with  site  water  in  a  50:50  ratio  and  agitated  for 30 minutes.

The objectives of the Secondary Impurity Removal (' SIR ') were to precipitate Ca, Mg  and  Mn  impurities  from  the  PIR  filtrate.  Sodium  carbonate  (Na2CO3)  was added in the third tank to convert all the remaining divalent impurities to insoluble carbonates.

The objective of the Ion Exchange (' IX ') circuit is to further reduce the calcium and  magnesium  tenors  from  the  SIR  discharge  to  10  mg/L  each.  The  IX  circuit consisted  of  three  (3)  columns  packed  with  a  cationic  resin  which  is  selective towards divalent and trivalent metal ions. The process consisted in a lead/lag/regeneration operation.

## b) Hydrometallurgical Testing - Phase 2 and Phase 3

The Hydrometallurgical (Phase 2) test program was carried out in December 2011 by SGS Lakefield. Phase 2 consisted of Membrane Electrolysis (' ME ') test work and  subsequent  crystallization  to  produce  lithium  hydroxide  monohydrate.  The objective  of  the  electrolysis  process  is  to  produce  a  lithium  hydroxide  (LiOH) solution from a high purity lithium sulphate (Li2SO4) solution. The objective of the crystallization process is to produce high quality solid lithium hydroxide monohydrate (LiOH-H2O) from the lithium hydroxide (LiOH) solution generated through membrane electrolysis.

The Hydrometallurgical (Phase 3) test program was carried out in March 2012 by SGS  Lakefield.  Phase  3  consisted  of  the  production  of  lithium  carbonate.  The objective of the test work was to prove that lithium hydroxide conversion to lithium carbonate can be an effective method of producing high purity lithium carbonate. The lithium carbonate (Li2CO3) production process consists of two (2) stages, the first  is  referred  to  as  Lithium  hydroxide  (LiOH)  Carbonization  (' LC ')  and  the second is called lithium bicarbonate decomposition (' DC '). During carbonization (LC), carbon dioxide gas is reacted with lithium hydroxide at room temperature to form  lithium  carbonate.  Once  all  lithium  hydroxide  is  carbonized,  an  excess  of carbon dioxide converts lithium carbonate to lithium bicarbonate. During decomposition  (DC),  the  solution  is  heated  to  near  boiling.  Lithium  bicarbonate formed in the first stage is decomposed to insoluble lithium carbonate and carbon dioxide.

## 1.5.4 Electrodialysis Test Work

Electrodialysis using Bipolar Membranes (' EDBM ') was tested as an alternative method of producing lithium hydroxide. Ameridia was asked to conduct EDBM testing in June 2012.

The objective of the test work was to confirm the suitability of the EDBM technology for Nemaska's  solution,  measure  current  efficiency  as  well  as  resulting  base  and  acid concentrations.

A total of eight (8) trials were performed. A base concentration of 2 N (47.8 g LiOH/L) and an acid concentration of 1.5 N (73.5 g H2SO4/L) were achieved at an average current efficiency of 58%.  Higher  concentrations  were  achieved  but  affected  the  current efficiency, which dropped to below 30%.

Based  on  the  results,  EDBM  appears  to  be  a  good  technology  for  a  large  scale  LiOH production facility.

## 1.6 Mine Method and Planning

The Study is based on a conventional open-pit operation at 1,095,000 tpy or 3,000 tpd using drilling, blasting, loading and hauling mining methods. The geotechnical parameters used for the pit design were provided by Journeaux Assoc. and are a bench face angle of 75° and inter-ramp angle of 56° and bench heights of 10 m, resulting in 4-m berms. The in-pit haulage roads are 22 m wide in order to accommodate two-way traffic for the 46-tonne trucks. A single-lane 16 m-wide ramp is used for the lower levels of the pit. All in-pit ramps have been restricted to a maximum gradient of 10%. The pit design dimensions  are  a  length  of  1,250  m,  a  width  of  320  m  and  a  depth  of  190  m.  BBA performed  calculations,  using  the  block  model  and  the  mining  polygon  method,  to determine the dilution and mining recovery for the engineered pit design. The resulting dilution was 4.5% at 0.34% Li2O, and the mineralized material loss was 4.5%.

Mining operations will be conducted 24 hours day, seven (7) days week and 365 days per year. Drilling of mineralized material and waste will be performed by a fleet of two (2) diesel drilling  rigs.  The  mineralized  material and waste zones will be drilled with 6½' diameter holes, 5 m spacing, and 5 m burden. Blasting will be executed under contract with an explosive company that will supply blasting materials and technology, and ensure the  delivery  and  storage  of  explosive  products.  Blasting  will  be  accomplished  using 100% emulsion type explosives with an average density (in the hole) of 1.25 g/cm . 3

Mineralized  material,  overburden  and  waste  production  will  be  accomplished  using  a fleet of hydraulic shovels with a 6 m  bucket capacity and 46-tonne capacity haul trucks. 3 The truck fleet size was calculated using a mechanical availability of 88% in the earlier years, transitioning to 83% in the later years and an equipment utilization factor of 95%.

<!-- image -->

A maximum of two (2) shovels (in year 6) and a maximum of seven (7) trucks (in year 8) will be necessary to support the mine productivity level of 1.095 Mtpy of run of mine mineralization (' ROM '). An additional wheel loader with a 4 m  bucket will assist in the 3 loading and be also for standby in case of main equipment break down. In addition to this production equipment a number of primary equipment (dozers, graders, etc.) and support equipment (fuel and service trucks, pick-ups, etc.) will be required. All major equipment will be leased.

The fine and coarse mine waste will be mixed with the concentrator tailings to produce a single waste stream, for co-disposal on the waste dumps.

## 1.7 Spodumene, Lithium Hydroxide-Monohydrate and Lithium Carbonate Recovery

## 1.7.1 Concentrator

The  spodumene  concentrator  is  located  near  the  open  pit  mine.  The  concentrator  is designed to produce a nominal 213,000 tonnes of spodumene concentrate per year. The ROM mineralized material will be transported to the primary jaw crusher and conveyed to the secondary and tertiary cone crushers. The crushed mineralized material is upgraded in  a  two-stage  dense  media  circuit  to  produce  a  coarse  spodumene  concentrate  and middlings product that is ground and treated by flotation. The DMS middlings product is ground in a rod mill and then combined with screened 0.5 mm material (fine) from the DMS circuit and further ground in a ball mill to P80 200 microns. This ground product forms  the  feed  for  the  flotation  circuit.  The  flotation  circuit  consists  of  desliming  and mica pre-flotation followed further desliming and spodumene flotation. Mica concentrate, and spodumene rougher flotation tails are combined and filtered in a pressure filter to a moisture  content  of  about  13%  and  subsequently  combined  with  DMS  tailings  and transported by truck to the mine waste stockpile. The spodumene flotation concentrate is filtered by a belt filter to about 5-6% moisture and combined with the DMS concentrate for  transport  by  trucks  to  Chibougamau.  Here  it  is  transferred  to  a  train  with  18-24 railcars (90 tonnes each) for transport to CN load out at Valleyfield, some 700 km south of the site near Montreal,  Quebec,  for  further processing; then transport to the hydrometallurgical plant by eight (8) railcars every day.

## 1.7.2 Hydrometallurgical Plant

The plant availability is estimated at 93%. The hydromet plant is designed to produce a nominal 20,700 tonnes of lithium hydroxide monohydrate crystals per year and a nominal 10,000 tonnes of lithium carbonate powder per year. The overall lithium recovery of the hydromet circuit is 88.6%. The concentrate is discharged from the railcar into a receiving hopper.  A  reclaim  conveyor  transports  the  concentrate  to  the  hydrometallurgical  plant where  it  feeds  the  spodumene  conversion  kiln.  The  kiln  heats  the  spodumene  to approximately 1,050°C. The high temperature converts the spodumene concentrate from

<!-- image -->

the alpha crystalline structure to the beta crystalline structure. A flash cooler uses ambient air to cool the converted spodumene to approximately 200 °C.

The beta-spodumene is fed to the acid roaster. Sulphuric acid is sprayed onto the betaspodumene in the roaster and the resulting reaction produces solid lithium sulphate and aluminum silicates. The temperature in the roaster must be maintained above 175 °C.

Lithium  sulphate,  being  soluble  in  water  at  these  conditions,  will  dissolve.  The  slurry discharges  from  the  leach  tank  into  the  PIR  tank.  The  discharge  of  the  PIR  tanks  is pumped to the downstream belt filter. The slurry now contains approximately 19.3 g/L of dissolved lithium. The PIR residue cake, which consists mainly of aluminum silicate, is conveyed  outside  the  plant  building  where  it  is  stockpiled  in  anticipation  of  future marketable possibilities.

In the secondary impurity removal (SIR) tanks, the pH is further increased to precipitate even more dissolved metals as solid hydroxides and carbonates. The discharge slurry is pumped  to  a  centrifuge  to  remove  the  solid  impurities  from  the  lithium  solution.  The solid residue is directed to the tailings. The solution is stored in the IX feed tank before it is pumped to the next cleaning process.

The final lithium sulphate solution cleaning step is performed by three (3) ion exchange columns in a round-robin configuration. Solution is fed to two (2) columns in series (the lead column and the lag column) while the third is being cleaned/stripped/regenerated. Clean lithium sulphate solution discharging from the columns is stored in the LiOH feed tank. Waste solutions from the acid strip and wash steps are collected in the IX residue tank and pumped to the tailings tank for disposal.

Membrane  Electrodialysis  is  used  to  convert  lithium  sulphate  (Li2SO4)  to  lithium hydroxide  (LiOH).  In  total,  80  electrodialysis  cells  are  required  to  convert  the  lithium sulphate solution to lithium hydroxide. A portion of the LiOH solution is directed toward the lithium carbonate production circuit to produce 10,000 t/y of lithium carbonate. The remaining solution is pumped to the LiOH-H2O crystallization circuit.

The LiOH-H2O  crystallization circuit consists of a two-stage mechanical vapor recompression  falling  film  evaporator  followed  by  a  single-effect  steam-driven  forced circulation crystallizer. The crystals are separated from the mother liquor in a centrifuge where  they  reach  a  moisture  content  of  about  5%  (w/w).  The  dewatered  crystals  are discharged to a fluid  bed  dryer  before  the  final  packaging  step.  A  flash  drying  system using indirect heating with natural gas is planned to be installed. The dried crystals are stored in a bin located above the packaging system. A robot operated system is used to package the crystals into one (1) tonne bags.

The Li2CO3 production process is carried out in two (2) steps. The first step is called the lithium hydroxide carbonization (LC). The second step is called the lithium bicarbonate decomposition step (DC). In the LC step carbon dioxide is injected at the bottom of the tank to react with lithium hydroxide and then with the precipitated lithium carbonate.

In the DC step, the lithium bicarbonate solution is heated to 95ºC. The tanks are jacketed and heated with steam. The DC decanter underflow joins the LC decanter underflow in the belt filter feed tank.

A vacuum belt filter is used to dewater the lithium carbonate slurry to 70 % solids (w/w). The belt filter cake falls by gravity to the flash dryer.

A flash drying system using indirect heating with natural gas is planned to be installed to dry the lithium carbonate  final product. The  dried  product  is transferred to the pulverization  system.  The  jet  mill  uses  high  pressure  air  to  pulverize  the  lithium carbonate to a P80 of about five (5) microns. The pulverized product is transferred to a bin located  above  the  packaging  system.  A  robot  operated  system  is  used  to  package  the Li2CO3 into 25 kg bags.

## 1.8 Project Infrastructure

## 1.8.1 Whabouchi Site

The Route du Nord public road gives access to the existing base camp that will be used for  both  construction  and  operations.  The  road  will  have  to  be  rerouted  after  some  ten (10)  years  of  mine  operation.  The  camp  site  is  about  12  km  north  of  the  mine  and concentrator  site  and  the  Nemiscau  airport  is  another  7  km  further  north.  The  planned infrastructures are:

## 1.9 Market Studies

Two (2) market study reports were prepared for Nemaska, one (1) by Roskill Consulting Group  Limited  (September  2012)  and  one  by  SignumBOX  Inteligencia  de  Mercados (March 2012). The largest lithium  markets  are  batteries  (29%  of  overall  consumption) and  frits  and  glass  (28%).  The  two  (2)  main  lithium  compounds  used  by  the  different industries are lithium carbonate and lithium hydroxide. The projected increase in annual demand of these lithium products from 2011 to 2025 is forecasted from 66,736 - 253,739 tonnes LCE and 27,533 - 183,303 tonnes LCE, respectively. The lithium consumption forecast for this period is that lithium hydroxide for batteries will increase from 3% in 2011 to 69% in 2025. Lithium carbonate will also see an increase for that application.

Sensitivity  analysis  of  three  pricing  scenarios  has  been  done  over  the  same  projection periods. Lithium hydroxide is the most sensitive compound to market conditions, because of its use as cathode material in batteries for hybrid and electric cars. The analysis shows a Compound Annual Growth Rate of 12.6% (pessimistic scenario) to 16.8% (optimistic scenario)  for  lithium  hydroxide  and  8.7%  to  11.7%  for  lithium  carbonate.  The  current price of lithium carbonate is in the range of US$ 6,000 - US$ 6,500 per tonne and for lithium hydroxide, in the range of US$ 8,500 - US$ 8,900 per tonne.

## 1.10 Environmental Permits

For  the  Whabouchi  mine  project,  an  Environmental  and  Social  Impact  Assessment (' ESIA '), including an Environmental and Social Baseline Study (' ESBS ') is ongoing at the site and should be completed before the end of the year.

For the  Valleyfield  plant,  MDDEP  has  indicated  that  this  part  of  the  project  will  need only an Authorisation Certificate (' CA ') and not a complete Environmental and Social Impact  Assessment  (' ESIA ').  The  request  to  obtain  this  authorisation  certificate  is  in preparation.

## 1.11 Capital and Operating Costs

## 1.11.1 Capital Cost Estimate

The capital cost estimate consists of the direct capital costs for the Whabouchi mine and concentrator site and for the Valleyfield plant site and the indirect costs for the two (2)

sites. Each of the estimates will have a contingency added which is larger (15%) for the Valleyfield site compared with the Whabouchi site (10%) mainly because the hydromet plant estimate is considered to have still a Preliminary Economic Assessment (' PEA ') accuracy. The estimated Owner's costs are also included. Table 1.3 shows the summary of the capital costs. A Working Capital, equal to two (2) months operating costs, has been included as well.

## 1.11.2 Operating Costs Estimate

The Operating Costs has been estimated for the Whabouchi operations that include the mine and concentrator operations and the tailings and waste disposal. They are estimated based on the average over the life of the project. The mine operating costs include the costs for leasing the major equipment. The truck transport of the concentrate from the site to Chibougamau will be handled by a contractor and the transport to Valleyfield will be by  train.  The  Operating  Costs  at  the  Hydromet  Plant  have  also  been  estimated.  A summary of the costs is shown in Table 1.4.

Table 1.4 - Summary of the Operating Costs Estimate

| Operating Cost ($/t LiOH-H2O)   | Operating Cost ($/t Li2CO3)   |
|---------------------------------|-------------------------------|

## 1.13 Conclusions and Recommendations

The  parameters  used  in  this  Preliminary  Economic  Assessment  include  developing  a 1,095 Mtpy  open-pit mine using diesel hydraulic equipment, construction of a concentrator at the mine site (crushing, heavy media, grinding, flotation circuits) with a nominal capacity of 3,000 tpd of mineralized material at 90%  availability and construction of a lithium compounds complex production plant at Valleyfield.

BBA has examined the technical and economic aspects of the Whabouchi mine project within the level of precision of a feasibility study and Met-Chem the Hydrometallurgical plant  within  the  level  of  a  Preliminary  Economic  Assessment.  The  current  report  is  a Preliminary Economic Assessment (' PEA ') in conformance with the standards required by NI 43-101 and Form 43-101F1.

A  computed  cash  flow  analysis  was  developed  based  on  the  technical  aspects  and  on metal price projections made for lithium hydroxide and lithium carbonate derived from two  (2)  market  studies.  As  it  stands,  the  Whabouchi  deposit  contains  an  economic Mineral Resource.

Consequently, Met-Chem and BBA conclude that the Whabouchi project is technically feasible as well as economically viable. The authors of this Technical Report consider the Whabouchi Project to be sufficiently robust to warrant moving it to the feasibility study stage.

## 2.3 Effective Date and Declaration

This  Report  is  considered  effective  as  of  October  2,  2012  and  is  in  support  of  the Nemaska press release, dated October  2,  2012,  entitled  'Nemaska  Lithium  Announces Positive  Preliminary  Economic  Assessment  (PEA)  for  Whabouchi  Mine  and  Lithium Hydroxide/Carbonate Plant'.

The current Report provides an independent Technical Report for the PEA Study of the lithium  mineralization  of  the  Nemaska  Deposit,  in  conformance  with  the  standards required by NI 43-101 and Form 43-101F1. The estimate of mineral resources contained in this Report conforms to the CIM Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve definitions.

BBA and Met-Chem are not insider, associate,  or  an  affiliate  of  Nemaska  and  neither BBA and Met-Chem nor any affiliate has acted as advisor to Nemaska, its subsidiaries or its affiliates, in connection with this Project.

It  should  be  understood  that  the  mineral  resources  presented  in  this  PEA  Report  are estimates  of  the  size  and  grade  of  the  deposits  based  on  a  number  of  drillings  and samplings and on assumptions and parameters currently available. The  level of confidence in the estimates depends upon a number of uncertainties. These uncertainties include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  future  changes  in  metal  prices  and/or  production  costs, differences  in  size  and  grade  and  recovery  rates  from  those  expected,  and  changes  in Project parameters. In addition, there is no assurance that the Project implementation will be realized.

The comments in this PEA Report reflect BBA and Met-Chem's best judgment in light of the  information  available  at  the  time  of  preparation.  BBA  and  Met-Chem  reserve  the

BBA

Metallurgy and Recovery Methods

Two (2) market studies were prepared, one (1) by SignumBOX and the other by Roskill Consulting Group Ltd. (' Roskill '), independent consultants. Chapter 19 summarizes the key information from these studies about lithium markets. SignumBOX was mandated to perform a market study to evaluate potential target markets for the lithium concentrate. Roskill was mandated to evaluate the battery grade lithium hydroxide market. BBA and Met-Chem have reviewed the content of the market study reports and believe that they provide a reasonable overview of the past and current lithium minerals market as well as projections according to various recognized sources.

Drill  core  samples  collected  and  prepared  by  Nemaska were submitted by Nemaska to SGS Minerals Services (Lakefield, Ontario, Canada), which is an accredited laboratory. Although  BBA  and  Met-Chem  have  reviewed  the  test  work  results  generated  by  SGS Lakefield and believes that they are generally accurate, BBA and Met-Chem are relying on SGS Lakefield as an independent expert.

At the date of this Technical Report, Nemaska has paid for the 16 Cantore claims, a total amount of $510,000 in cash and issued 4,000,000 common shares for a total amount of $958,000. Nemaska is committed to pay Cantore Group an additional $500,000 and to issue 500,000 additional common shares if an independent feasibility study confirms the feasibility of production of the property is obtained.

No value was assigned specifically on the ten (10) claims acquired from Golden Goose since  they  were  part  of  the Lac  Levac and Lac  des  Montagnes purchase  agreement relating to the purchase of 594 claims.

## 4.3 Royalties Obligations

As described in Section 4.2, the Property is subject to two (2) separate agreements. The first  concerns  the  ten  (10)  claims  acquired  from  Golden  Goose,  where  a  2%  NSR  is retained by Golden Goose, of which 1% can be repurchased by Nemaska for $1 million within the first three years from the acquisition. The second relates to 20 claims, the 16 claims  that  were  acquired  from  Cantore  Group  plus  four  (4)  of  the  seven  (7)  claims acquired by map designation. Cantore retains a 3% NSR on these 20 claims, of which 1% can be repurchased by Nemaska for $1 million. The Whabouchi deposit is located on the Cantore claims.

## 4.4 Permits and Environmental Liabilities

The  main  permit  required  to  conduct  exploration  work  on  the  Property  is  the  forest intervention permit delivered by the provincial Ministère des Ressources Naturelles et de la Faune (' MRNF '). A certificate of authorisation from the Ministère du Développement durable  de  l'Environnement  et  des  Parcs (' MDDEP ')  is  also  necessary  to  conduct mechanical stripping covering more than 1,000 m  of overburden. As of the date of this 3 Report, the Company's management confirmed having valid work permits and authorisations.  To  the  knowledge  of  the  author,  there  are  no  environmental  liabilities pertaining to the Property.

## 5.0 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE AND PHYSIOGRAPHY

## 5.1 Accessibility

The Property is easily accessible via the Route du Nord road  that  crosses  the  Property near  its  center.  This  road  is  linking  the  town  of  Chibougamau,  located  approximately 300 km to the SSE, and leads to the community of Nemaska and the Route de la BaieJames road.

## 5.2 Physiography

The Property is characterized by a relatively flat topography with the exception of the local  ridge  where  the  more  competent pegmatites occur. The elevation above sea level ranges  from  275  m  at  the  lowest  point  on  the  Property  to  325  m  at  the  top  of  the pegmatite ridge, with an average elevation of 300 m. Lakes and rivers cover approximately  15%  of  the  Property  area.  The  fauna  in  the  area  is  typical  of  the  taiga environment  observed  in  the  region  with  a  mix  of  black  spruce  forest  and  peat  mosscovered swamps. A portion of the Property was devastated by forest fires several years ago. There is no permafrost at this latitude and the overburden cover ranges in depth from 0 m near the ridge to 25 m in the south part of the Property.

## 5.3 Climate

The climate in the region is sub-arctic. This climate zone is characterized by long, cold winters  and  short,  cool  summers.  Daily  average  temperature  ranges  from  -20°C  in January to +17°C in July. Break-up usually occurs in early June, and freeze-up in early November.

## 5.4 Local Resources and Infrastructures

The nearest  infrastructure  with  general  services  is  the Relais  Routier  Nemiscau Camp, located  12  km  west  of  the  Property,  where  the  Company  has  setup  its  field  office  and core  logging  facilities.  The  community  of  Nemaska  located  30  km  west  also  has accommodation  and  general  services.  The  area  is  serviced  by  the  Nemiscau  airport, serviced by regular Air Creebec flights and charter flights, and by cellular network from the  principal  Canadian  service  providers.  There  is  no  mining  infrastructure  on  the Property.

Hydro-Québec owns several infrastructures and facilities in the area including the Poste Albanel and Poste de la Nemiscau electrical stations located approximately 20 km east and 12 km west from the Property, respectively. Electrical transmission lines connecting both stations run alongside the Route du Nord road and cross the Property near its center.

## 6.0 HISTORY

## 6.1 Regional Government Surveys

Numerous  geological  surveys  and  geoscientific  studies  have  been  conducted  by  the Québec Government in the James Bay area. Geological surveys in the 1960s (Valiquette 1964, 1965 and 1975) cover the entire property area. In 1998, the MRNF released the results of a regional lake bottom sediment survey completed in 1997.

## 6.2 Mineral Exploration Work

The first exploration work reported in the area, dating back to 1962 by Canico, included a lithium-bearing pegmatite found by the geologists of the Québec Bureau of Mines. That same  year,  Canico  drilled  two  (2)  packsack  drill  holes  on  the  pegmatite,  followed  by three (3) diamond drill holes on the same pegmatite ridge in 1963. A total of 463.11 m were drilled. The best result obtained was 1.44% Li2O over 83.2 m (Elgring 1962).

No  exploration  is  reported  for  the  next  ten  (10)  years.  In  1973,  James  Bay  Nickel Ventures (Canex Placer) performed a large-scale geological reconnaissance that covered the  property  (Burns  1973).  From  1974  to  1982,  the  exploration  work  was  exclusively reported  by  the Société  de  Développement  de  la  Baie  James (' SDBJ '),  which  mainly executed large scale geochemical surveys, followed by geological reconnaissance of the anomalies (Pride 1974, Gleeson 1975 and 1976). Two (2) exploration programs, one in 1978 and the other in 1980 were aimed at lithium exploration, with the evaluation of the Whabouchi spodumene-bearing pegmatite (Goyer et al. 1978, Bertrand 1978, Otis 1980, Fortin 1981, and Charbonneau 1982). No channel sampling or drill holes are reported. No work was conducted from 1982 to 1987.

In  1987,  Westmin  Resources  completed  an  airborne  Dighem  III  survey.  A  part  of  this survey was located immediately east of the property (McConnell 1987). In 1987-1988, Muscocho  Exploration  also  completed  ground  Mag  and  VLF  surveys  that  covered  a major part of the property. The spodumene-bearing pegmatite gave a weak Mag and VLF response. The Muscocho Exploration efforts were oriented toward the search for massive sulphides.  A  program  of  14  holes,  11  of  them  located  on  the  southern  part  of  the Whabouchi Property,  was  completed.  Several  arsenic  anomalies  were  obtained,  with  a maximum  of  3,750  ppm,  as  in  Hole  ML-88-8  (Brunelle  1987,  Gilliatt  1987  and Zuiderveen 1988).

In 2002, while exploring for tantalum, Inco resampled the spodumene-bearing pegmatite, taking 11 channels and seven (7) grab samples. Inco obtained a best value of 0.026% Ta, and Li2O values ranging from 0.3% to 3.72% (Babineau 2002).

In 2008, Golden Goose Resources visited and sampled the Valiquette (Ni) and chromite showings south of the Whabouchi Property (Beaupre 2008).

Nemaska, as part of the Qualifying NI 43-101 Technical Report, initiated its exploration work on the Property during the fall of 2009. During the site visit, several outcrops of spodumene-bearing  pegmatite  were  observed  and  nine  samples  were  collected  and analyzed for Li2O. The highest and lowest results obtained during the site visit are the grab sample # 946511, with a value of 6.3% Li2O, and grab sample # 946508 at 1.18% Li2O  (Théberge  2009).  During  the  fall  of  2009,  a  mechanical  stripping  and  trenching program  was  conducted  to  expose  and  sample  the  main  spodumene-bearing  pegmatite along with a small drilling program designed to validate the historical results.

During  2010  and  2011,  exploration  work  completed  by  Nemaska  on  the  property included  three (3) drilling campaigns,  mechanical  stripping,  ground  and  airborne geophysics, a 50 tonne bulk sample and metallurgical testing. An initial mineral resource was estimated in May 2010 by SGS Geostat and was followed by an initial preliminary economic  assessment  of  the  project completed  in March  2011  by  Equapolar  in collaboration with BBA.

The initial mineral resource estimate of the Whabouchi property, effective May 28, 2010, totaled 9.78 Mt grading 1.63% Li2O in the measured and indicated resources categories, with an additional 15.40 Mt grading 1.57% Li2O in the inferred resources category.

## 7.0 GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND MINERALIZATION

## 7.1 Regional Geology

The Whabouchi Property is located in the northeast part of the Superior Province of the Canadian Shield craton. The Superior Province extends from Manitoba to Quebec, and is mainly made up of Archean-age rocks. The general metamorphism is at the greenschist facies,  except  in  the  vicinity  of  intrusive  bodies,  where  it  reaches  the  amphibolite-togranulite  facies.  In  Quebec,  the  eastern  extremity  of  the  Superior  Province  has  been classified  into  the  following  sub-provinces,  from  south  to  north:  Pontiac,  Abitibi, Opatica, Nemiscau, Opinaca, La Grande, Ashuanipi, Bienville and Minto (Hocq 1994). According to Card and Ciesielski (1986), the area covered by the Property is located in the Opinaca or Nemiscau sub- province. Figure 7.1 shows the position of the Property in the Superior Province.

## 7.2 Property Geology

The  Whabouchi  Property  is  located  in  the Lac  des  Montagnes volcano-sedimentary formation  and  sits  between  the  Champion  Lake  granotoïds  and  orthogneiss  and  the Opatica  NE,  which  is  made  of  orthogneiss  and  undifferentiated  granitoïds.  From  the northwest to the southeast, the Property is underlain by the Champion Lake granitoïds, a grey  oligoclase  gneiss  and  then  by  the Lac  des  Montagnes formation.  The Lac  des Montagnes belt  is  approximately  7  km  wide  in  the  area,  oriented  northeast,  and  is principally composed  of metasediments (quartz-rich paragneiss, biotite-sillimanitestaurotide  schist  and  garnet-bearing  schist)  and  amphibolites  (mafic  and  ultramafic metavolcanics). These rocks are strongly deformed and cut by late granitoïds (leucogranites and biotite-bearing white pegmatites) (Valiquette 1975). Figure 7.2 shows the location of the Property relative to the Lac des Montagnes ,  the Champion Lake and Opatica NE formations. Table 7.1 summarizes the different lithologies occurring in the area.

## 7.3 Mineralization

The  mineralization  of  economic  interest  observed  in  the  Whabouchi  pegmatites  is principally  lithium  in  spodumene,  which  when  pure,  contains  8%  Li2O,  with  minor nobium and tantalum. Spodumene generally assays 7.6% - 8.0% Li2O depending on the degree of replacement largely by Na2O. Albite and microcline feldspars and high purity quartz generally occurring in pegmatites, are of interest for glass, ceramics and other use when sufficiently close to markets. Rubidium is also present in microcline (feldspar) and muscovite (mica) but this element is normally extracted from lepidolite, lithium-rubidium mica.  In  the  present  Study,  only  spodumene  is  being  considered  since  metallurgical testing has been conducted only on this element.

Two (2) distinct phases are observed in the Whabouchi pegmatites: a spodumene-bearing phase  comprising  most  of  the  pegmatite  material  and  a  lesser,  white  to  pink  barren quartz-feldspar pegmatite. The lithium mineralization occurs mainly in medium to large spodumene crystals (up to 30 cm in size) but petalite also occurs, averaging less than 2% in the  deposit.  Muscovite  also  contains  minor  lithium.  The  lithium  mineralisation sampled from recent drill holes averages 1.62% Li2O and ranges up to 4.24% Li2O.

## 8.0 DEPOSIT TYPES

This section is an extract of the 2011 Technical Report.

## 8.1 Origin and Features of Rare Metal Pegmatites

The  interpretation  of  the  pegmatite  model  is,  in  a  major  way  that  of  the  author, Gary H. K.  Pearse,  based  on  geological  mapping,  evaluation  work,  and  development work on a number of major pegmatite deposits over many years.

The Whabouchi deposit is a lithium-bearing rare metal pegmatite. Emplacement of rare metal pegmatites is the last phase of the crystallization of a parent granite pluton. Highpressure  residual  fluids,  with  abundant  water,  silica,  alumina,  alkalis,  and  rich  in  rare elements  and  other  volatiles  from  the  crystallization  of  a  pluton  at  modest  depth, concentrate in the cupola or upper domed contact of the granite as it crystallizes. Under increasing pressure, this fluid dilates fractures in overlying rocks in a manner analogous to  that  of  hydraulics  in  mechanical  equipment,  thereby  providing  feeder  channels  for emplacement  of  pegmatites. Progressive crystallization of the main  rock-forming minerals  out  of  the  fluid  enriches  the  final  fluids  in  rare  metals  and  the  process culminates in the formation of rare metal pegmatites still under fluid pressure. A variety of types occur depending on the abundance and type of rare metals associated with the pluton  and  the  physico-chemical  conditions  affecting  the  sequence  of  emplacement events.

Pegmatite petrologists classify the variety of types and subtypes by combinations of the following criteria:

- · Mineralogical-geochemical signatures;
- · Internal structure/zonation;
- · Pressure-temperature conditions of crystallization.

The criteria are related through degree of fractionation, which arise from the chemical, temperature and pressure evolution of the pegmatite fluids over time and distance from the parent granite. The complex rare element pegmatites generally evolve as follows: at depth  under  high-pressure  and  temperature  conditions,  simple  granite  pegmatites  of quartz, feldspar and mica crystallize in fractures above and within the solidified granite pluton.  Above  this  level,  columbo-tantalite  minerals  appear  starting  with  high  niobium compositions  and  progress to higher tantalum/niobium  ratios where  the complex pegmatites appear with lithium, cesium, and rubidium bearing minerals. Variations may appear, in which petalite is the dominant lithium mineral, often along pollucite, lepidolite, etc. Alternatively, spodumene dominates in a classification known as Albite-Spodumene pegmatite. Tantalum may occur in a variety of minerals and cassiterite may be present. A

final,  mariolitic  or  greisen  phase  at  low  pressure-temperature,  may  be  present  with lepidolite, quartz, tantalum-rich minerals, tin, topaz, etc.

Three (3) characteristics of the geological setting for rare metal pegmatites are common:

- · Emplacement in concordant stacked sills;
- · Presence of a compressed, near-vertical, syntectonic mobile zone that is the locus of pegmatite intrusion;
- · Host rocks most commonly are dominantly mafic volcanics often with intercalated metasediments and gabbroic rocks.

## 8.2 Stacked Sill Structure

Although a field of rare metal pegmatites is commonly termed a dyke swarm, the major economic ones are most commonly emplaced in concordant, shallow to medium dipping sills with one or more steeply dipping feeder dykes. The mechanism for emplacement of the  rare  metal  pegmatite  sills  is  as  follows:  stratification  in  volcanic-metasedimentarygabbroic  piles  provides  planes  of  weakness  along  contacts  that  facilitate  entry  of,  and hydraulic dilation  by,  late-stage  pressurized  rare  metal  bearing  fluid.  The  layering  also provides  a  barrier  or  cap  to  the  escape  of  the  volatile  fluids  from  which  the  final  rare metal  pegmatites  crystallize.  Zoning  in  the  pegmatite  results  from  a  continuation  of crystallization of the rock forming minerals from the cooler contacts inward in the dilated space-albite  at  the  contact,  dominantly  K-feldspar  with  quartz-mica  next,  spodumene quartz with some feldpars and mica, and finally, a core of quartz (in the albite-spodumene type).  This  simple  zoning  is  often  made  more  complex  by  two  (2)  or  more  pulses  of intrusion, albitisation and other replacement reactions.

## 8.3 Syntectonic Mobile Zone Feeder Dykes

The feeder dykes are near vertical and represent the conduit from depth connecting the pluton to the final rare metal pegmatite bodies. In most cases, shearing at the contacts of the dyke and mylonitisation and/or plastic deformation of the feeder pegmatite identifies this as a deeper, syntectonic mobile zone. In extreme cases, the feeder pegmatite may be stretched  and  result  in  the  formation  of  boudinage  structure  (as  occurs  at  the  Moblan Lake 'Southwest Dyke' in northern Quebec). The feeder dykes tend to be intermediate in composition in the fractionation chain.

## 8.4 Mafic Host Rocks

Virtually all pegmatite researchers make only passing reference or none at all to the host rocks of rare metal pegmatites. Their interest has been limited to contact geochemistry and mineralogy and to some extent, the structural setting. The fact that most often the host rocks are volcanic-metasedimentary-gabbroic piles indicates that these rocks are an

<!-- image -->

important part of the genesis of rare metal pegmatite fields. Gary H. K. Pearse submits indeed that the presence of these host rocks may be the most important factor after parent granite composition in the genesis of rare metal pegmatites. The layering and ductility, particularly of mafic volcanics and gabbros, causes the pile to flex and stretch without fracturing, thereby confining the high pressure volatiles to permit final crystallization of the  rare  metal  pegmatite.  This  mechanical  behaviour  is  also  conducive  to  selective emplacement along contact zones between units of the host rock, which accounts for the preponderance  of  sill-controlled  pegmatite  deposits.  Were  the  host  to  be  brittle  and isotropic,  the  rocks  would  tend  to  fracture,  the  confinement  required  to  permit  coarse crystallization would be absent or greatly reduced, the volatiles would be essentially lost and the final product may be a more uniform feldspar-mica-spodumene rock with more subtle  zoning or little  zonation  at  all  (examples  are:  the  Thompson  Brothers  deposit  at Wekusko Lake, Manitoba and the Quebec Lithium deposit near Amos, Quebec). In cases where the active feeder dyke propagates through brittle fractures quickly to the surface, the final phase would be an extrusive rhyolite.

## 8.5 The Whabouchi Pegmatite

The  Whabouchi  pegmatite  is  a  highly  fractionated,  spodumene-rich  pegmatite  swarm, individual bodies of which display typical zoning to varying degrees - a comparatively thin albite wall zone at the contacts followed by a K-feldspar rich zone with lesser albite, quartz, mica, and little or no spodumene, followed by a spodumene-quartz-rich core zone (with variable feldspars and mica) making up more than 90% of the cross-section. The Whabouchi  deposit  lacks  a  quartz  core  which  is  one  of  the  classic  zoned  pegmatite features. Insufficient stratigraphic work has been done on the host rocks to establish that the bodies are dominantly sills as in the classic case. The concordance of the bodies with the  greenstone  belt  and  the  persistence  of  even  thin  pegmatite  bodies  over  a  100  m  or more on strike and at depth support this structural control. The drilled sections at 700E and  800E  on  the  grid  do  appear  to  show  this,  in  that  the  hanging  wall  of  the  main pegmatite zone is basalt and the footwall gabbro.

The south contact observed at several locations by the author in the field showed strong shearing and stretched basalt pillows indicating that the main pegmatite was emplaced in the mobile feeder zone, rather than in offshoot sills from the feeder. This suggests that the feeder dyke was controlled by the steeply dipping volcano-sedimentary-gabbro pile and that above the present level, an unknown layer or structure, now eroded away, sealed the system and allowed containment of the volatile pegmatite fluids for crystallization in the steeply dipping dilation.

## 9.0 EXPLORATION

This section is an extract of the 2011 Technical Report.

The Company began working on the Property in October of 2009 with a first exploration program that lasted 25 days. During fall 2009 exploration program, mechanical stripping successfully exposed the spodumene-bearing pegmatites in 16 trenches spaced between 50  and  100  m  apart  and  covering  1,000  m  in  strike  length.  From  these  trenches, 35 channels were cut and a total of 295 samples were collected for analysis. In addition to the  trenching  work,  seven  (7)  diamond  drill  holes  were  completed  including  one  hole abandoned for technical  reasons.  All  successful  drill  holes  have  intersected  pegmatites zones.

A second exploration program was conducted from January to April, 2010. During that program,  59  drill  holes  totalling  11,600  m  were  completed.  In  addition  to  drilling, 14 line-km of ground magnetic surveying covering the main mineralized occurrence and 670 line-km of helicopter-borne magnetic surveying covering the Property were completed. Later in May 2010, the Company completed 2,780 m of mechanical stripping of the south contact of the main mineralized zone with (16 trenches and seven (7) contact zones) and collected 649 channel samples. The stripping also allowed the mapping of the surface  geology.  A  1.2  km  access  road  from  the Route  du  Nord main  road  was constructed in 2010.

In late 2010, 23 drill holes were completed, with an additional 26 holes in early 2011 for a total of 9,500 m. In May 2011, a 50-tonne bulk sample was collected at surface.

## 10.0 DRILLING

This section is an extract of the 2011 Technical Report.

A total of 115 drill holes were completed by Nemaska to define the mineral deposit. In addition to the drilling, extensive mechanical  stripping on surface permitted the completion of more than 140 channels. Table 10.1 and Table 10.2 summarize the drilling and  channel  sampling  completed  by  Nemaska  to  define  the  mineralized  pegmatite intrusion.

Table 10.1 - Drilling Completed by Nemaska at Whabouchi

| Year   |   Count | Metres Drilled   |
|--------|---------|------------------|
| 2009   |       7 | 915              |
| 2010   |      82 | 15,670           |
| 2011   |      26 | 5,500            |
| Total  |     115 | 22,085           |

| 2010   |        108 |             649 |
| Total  |        143 |             944 |

All  the  drilling  done  by  Nemaska  used  NQ  and  HQ  coring  size.  HQ  size  was  used  to collect  material  for  metallurgical  testing.  The  samples  collected  for  analysis  represent approximately 37% of the drill core material. The drill holes are generally spaced 25 m to 50 m apart with azimuth ranging between N312° and N340° with an average of N330°. The dips range from 43° to 75° and average 49°. The deepest hole reaches 500 m below surface.  The  mineralized  drill  intersection  ranges  from  near  true  thickness  to  70%  true thickness.  The  geometry  of  spodumene-bearing  pegmatites  is  defined  as  a  series  of stacked  dyke-shaped  intrusions  which  include  a  thicker  principal  intrusion.  Some pegmatite contains local rafts or xenoliths of the host rock which can be a few metres thick  and  hundreds  of  metres  in  length.  Based  on  the  information  gathered  from  the drilling,  the  pegmatite  intrusion  is  more  than  1,300  metres  in  length  and  can  be  up  to 90 metres thick. The intrusions are generally oriented N030°, dip to the south at an angle ranging between 80 and 85 degrees and are reaching depths of up the 500 metres below surface. Please refer to section 14 for the interpretation of the drill results based on the results of mineral resources estimate. Figure 10.1, Figure 10.2 and Figure 10.3 show the drill holes in plan view, on longitudinal sections and on representative cross sections.

The author completed verification programs of the Project's analytical data and considers that there is no known drilling, sampling or recovery factors that could materially impact the  accuracy  and  reliability  of  the  results.  The  data  from  the  few  historical  drill  holes reported  on  the  project  could  not  be  validated  and  were  not  considered  as  part  of  the current mineral resource estimate.

## 11.0 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSIS AND SECURITY

This section is an extract of the 2011 Technical Report.

This section is based on information supplied by Nemaska and observations made during the independent verification programs conducted at the Project site by SGS Geostat from March 10 to 12, 2010 and on May 4 and 5, 2011.

## 11.1 Sample Procedure and Sample Security

The Whabouchi Project is located less than 12 km east of the Nemiscau Camp where the Project  office  and  core  logging  facilities  are  located.  The  evaluation  of  the  geological setting and mineralization on the Property is based on observations and sampling from surface (through geological mapping, grab and channel samples) and diamond drilling. The channel and drill core logging and sampling was conducted at the Property or at the nearby  Project  facilities.  All  samples  collected  by  Nemaska  during  the  course  of  the 2009,  2010  and  2011  exploration  programs  were  sent  to  the Table  Jamésienne  de Concertation Minière (' TJCM ') preparation laboratory located in Chibougamau, Quebec. The 2009 and 2010 sample pulps were shipped to SGS Canada Inc. - Mineral Services  (' SGS  Minerals ')  laboratory  in  Don  Mills,  Ontario,  for  analysis.  The  2011 sample pulps were sent to ALS Canada Inc. - Chemex Laboratory (' ALS Chemex ') in North Vancouver, B.C., for analysis. The remaining drill core is stored at the Property site in covered metal core racks.

All channel samples and drill core handling were done on site with logging and sampling processes  conducted  by  employees  and  contractors  of  Nemaska.  The  observations  on lithology,  structure,  mineralization,  sample  number,  and  location  were  noted  by  the geologists and technicians on hardcopy and then recorded in a Microsoft Access digital database. Copies of the database are stored on external hard drive for security.

Channel samples were collected from two (2) diamond saw cuts (typically 4 cm in width and 4 cm in depth). Each sample is generally one (1) m long and broken directly from the outcrop, identified and numbered then placed in a new plastic bag. Drill core of NQ and HQ  size  was  placed  in  wooden  core  boxes  and  delivered  twice  daily  by  the  drill contractor to the Project core logging facilities at the Nemiscau Camp. The drill core was first aligned  and  measured  by  a  technician  for  core  recovery.  The  core  recovery measurements were followed by the RQD measurements. After a summary review of the core, it was logged and sampling intervals were defined by a geologist. Before sampling, the core was photographed using a digital camera and the core boxes were identified with Box  Number,  Hole  ID,  and  by  using  'From'  and  'To'  aluminum  tags.  Due  to  the hardness of the pegmatite units, the recovery of the channel material and the drill core was generally very good, averaging more than 95%.

Sampling  intervals  were  determined  by  the  geologist,  marked  and  tagged  based  on observations of the lithology and mineralization. The typical sampling length is one (1) m but can vary according to lithological contacts between the mineralized pegmatite and the host rock. In general, one (1) host rock sample was collected from each side that contacts the pegmatite. The NQ drill core samples were split into two (2) halves with one (1) half placed in a new plastic bag along with the sample tag; the other half was replaced in the core box with the second sample tag for reference. The third sample tag was archived on site. HQ size drill core was collected for a portion of the 2011 program for metallurgical purposes. The first half of the HQ drill core was selected for metallurgical testing. The second half was split in two (2) quarters, one (1) quarter placed in a new plastic bag along with  the  sample  tag  and  the  remaining  quarter  was  replaced  in  the  core  box  with  the second sample tag for reference. The samples were then catalogued and placed in rice bags or pails, for shipping. The sample shipment forms were prepared on site with one (1) copy inserted with the shipment, one (1) copy sent by email to TJCM, and one (1) copy kept for reference. The samples were transported on a regular basis by Nemaska's employees or contractors by pick-up truck directly to the TJCM  facilities in Chibougamau.  At  the  TJCM  laboratory,  the  sample  shipment  was  verified  and  a confirmation  of  shipment  reception  and  content  was  emailed  to  Nemaska's  project manager.

SGS Geostat validated the exploration processes and core sampling procedures used by Nemaska as part of an independent verification program. The author concluded that the drill core handling, logging and sampling protocols are at conventional industry standard and  conform  to  generally  accept  best  practices.  The  author  considers  that  the  samples quality is good and that the samples are generally representative. Finally, the author is confident  that  the  system  is  appropriate  for  the  collection  of  data  suitable  for  the estimation of a NI 43-101 compliant mineral resource estimate.

## 11.2 Sample Preparation and Analysis

Channel  and  drill  core  samples  collected  during  the  2009,  2010  and  2011  exploration programs were transported directly by Nemaska representatives to the TJCM laboratory facilities in Chibougamau, Quebec for sample preparation. The submitted samples were pulverized at the TJCM laboratory to respect the specifications of the analytical protocol and then shipped to SGS Minerals or ALS Chemex for analysis. The author visited the TJCM facilities on March 10, 2010.

All samples received at TJCM were inventoried and weighted prior to being processed. Drying was done to samples having excess humidity. Sample material was crushed to 80-85% passing 2 mm using jaw crushers. Ground material was split using a split riffle to obtain  a 275-300  g  sub-sample.  Sub-samples  were  then  pulverized  using  a  twocomponent ring mill (ring and puck mill) or a single component ring mill (flying disk mill) to 85-90% passing 200 mesh (75 µm). The balance of the crushed sample (reject)

was placed into the original plastic bag. The pulverized samples were finally sent to SGS Minerals or ALS Chemex using Canada Post secured delivery services.

The  majority  of  the  2009  and  2010  analyses  were  conducted  at  the  SGS  Minerals laboratory  located  in  Don  Mills,  Ontario,  which  is  an  ISO/IEC  17025  laboratory accredited  by  the  Standards  Council  of  Canada.  There  are  two  (2)  analytical  methods used for the pulverized samples from the Whabouchi Project. The first analytical method used by SGS Minerals is the 55-element analysis using sodium peroxide fusion followed by both Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometry (' ICP- OES ') and Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (' ICP-MS ') finish (SGS code ICM90A).  This  method  uses  10  g  of  the  pulp  material  and  returns  different  detection limits for each element and includes 10 ppm lower limit detection for Li. The ICM90A analytical method was conducted at the beginning of the 2009-2010 exploration program to  verify  the  content  of  other  elements  in  the  mineralization.  The  second  method processed  20  g  of  pulp  material  and  used  the  mineralization  grade  sodium  peroxide fusion with ICP-OES finish methodology with a lower detection limit of 0.01% Li (SGS code  ICP90Q).  The  ICP90Q  analytical  method  was  used  at  the  beginning  of  the exploration  program  on  samples  analysed  by  ICM90A  returning  values  greater  than 0.3% Li.  The  ICP90Q  method  for  Li  was  later  used  on  a  more  systematic  basis. Analytical results were sent electronically to Nemaska and results were compiled in an MS Excel spreadsheet by the project manager.

The 2010 pulp reanalysis and the 2011 analyses were conducted at ALS Chemex using the mineralization grade lithium four-acid digestion with Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic  Emission  Spectrometry  (' ICP-AES ') (ALS  code  Li-OG63).  The  Li-OG63 analytical method used 4 g of pulp material and returned a lower detection limit of 0.01% Li.

## 11.3 Quality Assurance and Quality Control Procedure

Above the laboratory quality assurance quality control (' QA/QC ') routinely implemented by SGS Minerals and ALS Chemex using pulp duplicate analysis, Nemaska developed an internal QA/QC protocol consisting in the insertion of analytical standards, blanks  and  core  duplicates  on  a  systematic  basis  with  the  samples  shipped  to  the analytical laboratories. In 2010, the Company also sent pulps from selected mineralized intersection  to  ALS  Chemex  for  reanalysis.  No  pulp  reanalysis  was  performed  by  the Company in 2011. The author did not visit the SGS Minerals or ALS Chemex facilities or conduct an audit of the laboratories.

## 11.4 Analytical Standards

Two (2) different standards were used by Nemaska for the internal QA/QC program: one (1)  low  grade  lithium  (' Li-LG ')  and  one  (1)  high  grade  lithium  (' Li-HG ')  standards.

<!-- image -->

Both standards were custom made reference materials coming from historical drill core from the Whabouchi deposit itself. The preparation for the standards material has been conducted  by  TJCM  using  the  same  sample  preparation  protocol  used  for  the  regular Whabouchi samples. Each standard inserted weight between 90 and 120 g. In order to evaluate their expected values, Li-HG and Li-LG standards have been analysed six (6) times, each at the SGS Mineral Services laboratory in Don Mills, Ontario, and five (5) times each at the ALS Chemex laboratory in North Vancouver, British-Colombia. Both facilities are accredited ISO/IEC 17025 laboratories. The analytical protocol used at SGS Minerals is the mineralization grade sodium peroxide fusion with ICP-OES finish (SGS code ICP90Q). The analytical protocol used at ALS Chemex is the mineralization grade lithium four-acid digestion with Inductively Coupled  Plasma  -  Atomic  Emission Spectrometry ( 'ICP-AES' ) finish (ALS code Li-OG63).

For the Li-LG standard, the analytical results returned from SGS Minerals for the six (6) samples  averaged  0.46%  Li  versus  an  average  of  0.45%  Li  for  the  five  (5)  samples submitted to ALS Chemex. For the Li-HG standards, the average of the six (6) samples returned 0.72% Li versus an average of 0.71% Li for the five (5) samples processed at ALS Chemex. Each laboratory showed relatively consistent analytical results from one (1)  sample  to  another  for  each  standard  analysed.  The  averages  for  each  standard  also showed a good correlation between SGS Minerals and ALS Chemex. The amount of data is  not  statistically  significant  to  calculate  standard  deviation  (' Std.  Dev. ')  parameters which can be used to determine the success/failure of standards. Table 11.1 shows the results for each standard using both analytical protocols.

The insertion of the analytical standards Li-LG and Li-HG did not begin until drill hole WHA 10-15. After that, one (1) standard was inserted in the sample series at a rate of one (1) every 25 regular samples, alternating between the Li-LG and Li-HG standards. A total of  169  Li  HG  and  169  Li-LG  standards  were  analysed  during  the  2010  and  2011 exploration campaigns, representing 3.8% of the samples analysed. In order to determine the QC warning (±2x Std. Dev.) and QC failure (±3x Std. Dev.) intervals for the Li-LG and Li-HG standards, the Std. Dev. parameters returned from the 169 Li-HG and 169 LiLG analytical results are considered.

From  the  169  Li-HG  standards  analysed,  14  standards  fall  outside  the  QC  Warning interval and four (4) standards fall outside the QC Failure interval. After reviewing the four (4) failures, they are considered acceptable as the value falls within 12-15% of the expected value for Li-HG. From the 169 Li-LG standards analysed, six (6) fall outside the  QC Warning interval and one (1) is considered a failure as it falls outside the QC Failure interval. After reviewing the only failure, it is considered acceptable as it returned 13% of the expected value for Li-LG. Table 11.2 reports the statistics of the Li-LG and Li-HG standards. Figure 11.1 shows plots of the variation of both standards with time.

## 11.5 Analytical Blanks

Nemaska implemented the insertion of analytical blanks in the sample series as part of their  internal  QA/QC  protocol.  The  blank  samples,  which  are  made  of  coarse  silica lumps,  are  inserted  at  every  20  samples  in  the  sample  series,  at  the  beginning  of  the sample preparation procedure by TJCM before shipping to ALS Chemex. The analytical blanks  used  in  2010  were  made  of  pre-pulverized  silica  instead  of  coarse  lumps.  The 2010 procedure was not considered adequate since the analytical blanks were inserted by TJCM after the sample preparation procedure. The QA/QC procedure was updated by the Company for 2011 and is now considered adequate.

A  total  of  255  analytical  blanks  were  analysed  during  the  2009  and  2010  exploration programs and an additional 208 blanks were analysed for the 2011 program for a grand total of 463 results for analytical blanks available. From the 463 blanks analysed, 100% of them returned less than 0.05% Li, which is five (5) times the methods detection limit. Figure 11.2 shows a plot of the variation of the analytical blanks with time.

## 11.6 Core Duplicates

Sample  duplicates  were  inserted  at  every  20  samples  in  the  sample  series  as  part  of Nemaska's internal QA/QC protocol. The sample duplicates correspond to a quarter NQ or HQ core from the sample left behind for reference, or a representative channel sample from  the  secondary  channel  cut  parallel  to  the  main  channel.  Figure  11.3  shows correlation plots for the core duplicates.

For 2010, a total of 254 duplicates results analysed by SGS Minerals are available. From the 254 core duplicates analysed in 2010, 91.3% of assay pairs with a grade higher than 0.05% Li (five (5) times the method detection limit) reproduced within ±20% and 92.7% of assay pairs with a grade higher than 0.1% Li reproduced within ±20%. The sign test for the 2010 duplicates analysed by SGS Minerals does not show any bias (30% original &lt; duplicate, 33% original &gt; duplicate, and 37% original = duplicate).

For  2011,  a  total  of  58  duplicate  results  analysed  by  SGS  Minerals  and  145  duplicate results analysed by ALS Chemex are available. From the 58 core duplicates analysed by SGS Minerals, 96.6% of assay pairs with a grade higher than 0.05% Li (five (5) times the method detection limit) reproduced within ±10% and 96.4% of assay pairs with a grade higher  than  0.1%  Li  reproduced  within  ±10%.  The  sign  test  for  the  2011  duplicates analysed  by  SGS  Minerals  does  not  show  any  bias  (40%  original  &lt;  duplicate,  34% original  &gt;  duplicate,  and  26%  original  =  duplicate).  From  the  145  core  duplicates analysed at ALS Chemex, 90.0% of assay pairs with a grade higher than 0.05% Li (five

<!-- image -->

(5) times the method detection limit) reproduced within ±20% and 89.7% of assay pairs with a grade higher than 0.1% Li reproduced within ±20%. The sign test for the 2011 duplicates analysed by ALS Chemex does not show any significant bias (38% original &lt; duplicate, 54% original &gt; duplicate, and 8% original = duplicate).

## 11.7 Nemaska Pulp Re-Analysis

As part of Nemaska's 2010 QA/QC protocol, pulps from 192 mineralized core samples were  sent  for  re-analysis  to  ALS  Chemex.  No  pulp  re-analysis  was  performed  by  the Company  in  2011  at  the  time  of  writing  the  report  for  the  updated  mineral  resource estimate. The re-analysed samples represent continuous mineralized intervals of different lengths selected from eight (8) drill holes (WHA-10-08, 11, 15, 21, 22, 28, 38 and 44). Figure 11.4 shows a correlation plot of the re-analysed pulps for SGS Minerals vs. ALS Chemex.  Table  11.3  contains  a  comparison  of  the  weighted  average  grade  for  each mineralized  interval  by  hole.  The  pulp  re-analysis  returned  higher  Li  values  for  SGS Minerals for 145 samples (or 76% of the samples reanalysed) compared to 23 samples (or 12%)  returning  lower  Li  values  for  SGS  Minerals  and  24  samples  (or  13%)  shows identical  values  for  both  laboratories.  The  SGS  Minerals  Li  grades  show  a  relative difference averaging 5.3% higher than ALS Chemex. As observed, seven (7) mineralized

<!-- image -->

intervals out of a total of eight (8) show a higher weighted average grade for the SGS Minerals analysis. The relative difference of the weighted average grades for the different holes range from -1.4% to +8.9%. The results of the pulp re-analysis program conducted by  the  Company  show  a  potential  positive  small  analytical  bias  toward  SGS  Minerals analytical  data,  which  could  possibly  be  explained  by  the  differences  in  analytical methodologies from one laboratory to another. Although SGS Geostat considers that the potential analytical bias observed in the pulps re-analysis results is significant enough to be  investigated  in  more  detail,  the  grade  differences  observed  between  the  two  (2) laboratories  can  be  considered  acceptable  for  a  mineral  resource  estimate.  The  author recommends an  in-depth  comparison  of  the  different  analytical  methods  used  by  each laboratory be completed and that an additional pulp re-analysis of mineralized samples be carried out in order to verify the grade differences outlined herein.

## 11.8 Specific Gravity

As  part  of  the  2010  and  2011  independent  data  verification  programs,  SGS  Geostat conducted  specific  gravity  (' SG ')  measurements  on  the  74  mineralized  core  samples collected from drill holes WHA-09-07, WHA-10-25, WHA-10-79, and WHA-11-96. The measurements  were  performed  by  the  water  displacement  method  using  a  graduated cylinder (SG = weight in air in kg/volume of water displaced in litre) on representative half NQ core and quarter HQ core pieces weighting between 0.42 kg and 2.28 kg with an average  of  0.53  kg.  The  resulting  measurements  reported  an  average  SG  value  of 2.70 t/m , (Table 11.4). 3

| Maximum (t/m )  3       |                         2.88 |

In  2011,  Nemaska also conducted SG measurements of mineralized core samples. The measurements  were  conducted  at  TJCM  laboratory  in  Chibougamau,  by  the  water displacement method using weight in vs. weight in water. The SG measurements were done on samples from 24 different drill holes from 2009, 2010 and 2011. The resulting measurements  reported  an  average  SG  value  of  2.72  t/m   (Table  11.5).  Based  on  the 3

<!-- image -->

available SG measurement datasets, an SG value of 2.70 t/m  was selected as the average 3 SG for the mineralization for the Whabouchi deposit.

## 11.9 Conclusion

Nemaska  implemented  an  internal  QA/QC  protocol  by  regularly  inserting  reference materials (standards and blank) and core duplicates in the samples stream. The Company also conducted in the 2010 re-analysis of selected pulps in a second laboratory, as part of their QA/QC protocol.

SGS Geostat completed a review of the sample preparation and analysis including the QA/QC analytical protocol implemented by Nemaska for the Project. The author visited the  sample  preparation  facilities  at  TJCM  on  March  10,  2010  and  the  Whabouchi Property  from  March  10  to  12,  2010  and  again  on  May  4  and  5,  2011  to  review  the Company sample preparation procedures.

A review of the QA/QC analytical results for the standards, blanks and core duplicates did  not  highlight  any  analytical  issues.  The  re-analysis  of  the  pulps  completed  by  the Company in 2010 outlined a potential  small  analytical  bias  from  the  results  of  the  reanalysis of pulps from selected mineralized intervals. SGS  Geostat  recommends investigating this potential analytical bias which could potentially be caused in part by the different analytical methodologies used in the two (2) laboratories. SG measurements were completed in 2010 and 2011 on mineralized core samples to estimate an average bulk density value for the Whabouchi deposit.

The author is of the opinion that the sample preparation, analysis and QA/QC protocol used  by  Nemaska  for  the  Whabouchi  Project  follow  generally  accepted  industry standards and that the Project data is of a quality sufficient.

## 12.0 DATA VERIFICATION

As  part  of  the  2010  and  2011  data  verification  programs,  SGS  Geostat  completed independent analytical checks of drill core duplicate samples taken from Nemaska 2009, 2010 and 2011 diamond drilling programs. SGS Geostat also conducted verification of the  laboratories  analytical  certificates  and  validation  of  the  Project  digital  database supplied by Nemaska for errors or discrepancies.

During a site visit conducted from March 10 to 12, 2010, a total of 35 mineralized core duplicates  were  collected  from  holes  WHA-09-07  and  WHA-10-25  by  the  author  and submitted for Li analysis at the SGS Minerals laboratory in Don Mills, Ontario. The core duplicates were processed using the same analytical protocol used by Nemaska during the 2009 and 2010 drilling programs (code ICP90Q) except that the sample preparation has been done directly at the SGS Mineral Services and not at the TJCM laboratory. During the 2011 site visit, an additional 40 independent check samples were collected from holes WHA 10-079  and  WHA-11-096.  The  core  samples  from  these  holes  were  originally analysed  by  ALS  Chemex.  The  check  analyses  were  performed  at  SGS  Minerals laboratory in Don Mills.

The comparative results for the individual check samples are displayed in the correlation graph in Figure 12.1. Table 12.1 shows the comparative statistics for the 2010 and 2011 check  samples.  Table  12.2  reports  the  check  sampling  weighted  average  results  for continuous mineralized intervals sampled for each drill hole.

On  an  individual  sample  basis,  there  are  some  divergences  between  the  results  of  the check samples from 2010 versus 2011. In 2010, the original samples returned a higher grade than the check samples. In 2011, the original samples returned a lower grade than the  check  samples.  In  both  years,  the  average  relative  grade  differences  between  the original  and  the  check  samples  range  between  3%  and  19%,  which  can  be  considered acceptable for core duplicates, considering the coarse nature of the spodumene mineralization generally observed at Whabouchi. The weighted average grades between the  original  and  the  check  samples  outline  similar  results  except  for  hole  WHA-10-25. For WHA-10-25, the original samples returned a higher weighted average than the check samples with a relative grade difference of 37%, which can be considered excessive for core  duplicates,  although  most  of  the  samples  in  the  hole  have  relatively  low  grades compared to  the  other  holes.  The  other  three  (3)  holes  returned  an  acceptable  relative grade difference ranging between 1.1% and 6.0%. For the 2011 check sampling results, the pulps for the check samples were sent to ALS Chemex for reanalysis. The objective is to validate the significant variable observed between the original and the check samples. The reanalysis of the 2011 check samples completed at ALS Chemex for holes WHA-10079  and  WHA-11-096  returned  comparable  results  versus  the  original  check  samples

The digital drill hole database supplied by Nemaska has been validated for the following data field: collar location, azimuth, dip, hole length, survey data, lithology and analytical values. The validation returned only minor discrepancies located in survey data, lithology and analytical values, which were communicated to Nemaska and corrected in the final drill hole database.

As part of the data verification of the Project, the analytical data from the database has been  validated  with  the  values  from  the  laboratories  analytical  certificates.  No  errors were noted during the validation.

The final database includes the channel samples collected in 2009 and 2010 from surface trenches and the drilling data from the 2009, 2010 and 2011 drilling programs. The final drill hole with reported analytical results included in the database is WHA-10-112. The few historical drill hole and channel analytical data were not considered for the current mineral  resource  estimate.  Table  12.3  lists  the  data  contained  in  the  final  drill  hole database.  The  author  is  in  the  opinion  that  the  final  drill  hole  database  is  adequate  to support a mineral resource estimate.

## 13.0 MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING

Mineral processing and metallurgical testing were performed to evaluate the potential of spodumene  concentrate  production  and  lithium  hydroxide  (Li2O-H2O)  and  lithium carbonate  (Li2CO3)  production  separately.  The  spodumene  concentrate  production  test work is presented in Section 13.1. The hydrometallurgical production of Li2O-H2O and Li2CO3 test work is presented in Section 13.2.

## 13.1 Spodumene Concentrate

This section gives a review of bench scale and pilot scale metallurgical test work carried out in 2010 and 2011 at SGS Lakefield Research Limited (' SGS Lakefield ') to evaluate the  amenability  of  Nemaska  spodumene  pegmatite  for  the  production  of  a  6.0%  Li2O spodumene concentrate. Some of the bench scale test work results were reported in the July 2011 NI 43-101 Technical Report of the Updated Mineral Resources Estimate. This Report  provides  an  update  of  the  bench  scale  tests  carried  out  during  and  since  the Updated Mineral Resources Estimate Report and provides a summary of the pilot scale test work carried out for the current PEA Study. The following Figure 13.1 illustrates the bench scale and pilot testing that was done in order to propose the PEA final flow sheet.

## 13.1.3 2010 and 2011 Mineral Processing and Metallurgical Bench Scale Test work

- a) Test Work Samples

Four (4) NQ holes were drilled by Nemaska through the central portion of the main pegmatite  in  order  to  obtain  approximately  one  (1)  tonne  of  mineralized  core exclusively  for  metallurgical  test  work.  The  core  was  sent  by  truck  in  a  single palletized crate to the SGS Lakefield in July of 2010. The entire sample was stagecrushed to 6 mm (1/4'). The head grade of the sample was reported as 1.72% Li2O (Table 13.1).

The  material  collected  from  the  pegmatite  was  5.5%  higher  in  Li2O  than  the average  grade  determined  by  Geostat  and  used  in  their  resource  estimation.  This was considered to be within acceptable limits and appropriate for the metallurgical work  for  the  PEA  study.  Table  13.2  below  gives  the  mineralogical  assay  and indicates that spodumene makes up 21.1% of the sample.

## b) Mineralogical Test Work

Figure 13.2 below  summarizes  the mineralogical test work  done  with the mineralized  material.  The  objective  of  mineralogical  test  work  is  to  predict  the amount of liberated mineral of interest at varying size distribution.

Figure 13.2 - Summary of Mineralogical Test Work

<!-- image -->

Six (6) drill core samples, named MW, ME, SE, PP, and WP, were submitted to SGS Lakefield as 10 mesh material for mineralogical analysis.

From  each  -10  mesh  composite  sample,  a  portion  was  submitted  for  XRD  and QEMSCANTM analysis. Another portion from each composite was stage-crushed to -212 µm and submitted for QEMSCANTM. A third portion from each composite sample (with the exception of WP, which was considered waste) was screened at 212 µm to temporarily remove the fine particles. The oversized material was stagecrushed to K80 425 µm. The -212 µm material and stage-crushed oversized material were  then  blended  to  create  a  master  composite  sample.  The  master  composite sample was then split into five (5) size fractions ranging from +425 µm to -38 µm and submitted for XRF and QEMSCANTM analysis.

The  XRD  and  QEMSCANTM  analyses  for  each  of  the  -10  mesh  composite samples were in close agreement. For the QEMSCANTM analysis, it was difficult to  distinguish  between  the  spodumene  and  petalite  minerals,  and  therefore,  the minerals were combined and reported as Li Minerals. The XRF results are provided in  Table 13.3 and the QEMSCANTM results are shown in Table 13.4. MW, SE, and WP samples contained no petalite. Sample WP was also low in lithium and was considered as waste.

Table  13.7  shows  the  modal  analysis  of  the  master  composite  sample  by  particle  size range. The Li minerals tend to be more concentrated in the coarser fractions. Table 13.8 shows the liberation of Li Minerals by size fraction in the master composite sample. As expected, the Li mineral liberation increases with decreasing particle size. The liberation does not increase significantly below -212 µm.

Figure 13.4 shows the mineral release curves of Li minerals, microcline, and muscovite, for the master composite sample. Mineral release curves are used to predict the amount of liberated mineral of interest at varying size distribution. This is an indicator of optimum grind targets in order to achieve the most liberation for the least amount of grind energy. The liberation of Li minerals increases by only 2-3% below 212 µm.

According to the SGS Lakefield database, the samples tested were considered to be in the soft to moderately soft range of hardness with respect to the Bond Rod mill Work Index (' RWI ')  and  in  the  soft  to  medium  range  with  respect  to  Bond  Ball  mill  Work  Index (' BWI '). The outcrop sample was characterized as being hard in terms of Bond Crushing Work  Index  (' CWI ').  The  samples  were  also  characterized  as  being  abrasive.  The variability in hardness among the samples tested was relatively low. For equipment sizing purposes, BBA chose the 75 th Percentile values for RWI, BWI, and AI.

All  of  the  variability  samples  were  also  assayed  by  the  XRD  Whole  Rock  Analysis method (WRA) and the results are presented in Table 13.11.

## d) Dense Media Test Work

In the July 2011 NI 43-101 Report for the Updated Mineral Resources Estimate, it was determined that Dense Media Separation using a heavy medium with a specific gravity  (' SG ')  of  2.7  would  not  be  a  suitable  method  for  pre-concentration  and would  only  be  suitable  as  a  means  of  upgrading  the  mineralized  material  after grinding  to  10  mesh.  Further  test  work  was  proposed  and  subsequently,  four  (4) series  of  heavy  liquid  tests  were  carried  out.  These  tests  are  summarized  in  this section. More  detailed  results  are  provided  in  the  SGS  Lakefield  report  of October 20, 2011 (project 12486-001).

## i) First Series of Heavy Liquid Testing - HL1

The  first  series  of  heavy  liquid  tests  were  performed  on  two  (2)  fractions: -12.7  mm  +  4  mm  and  4  mm  +  0.84  mm.  The  results  are  summarized  in Figure 13.6.

From these results it was concluded that:

- -For the coarser size fraction, it is possible to reject about 50% of the mass to  the  float  product  with  a  lithium  loss  of  about  12%.  The  sink  product would contain  87.9%  of  the  Li  with  a  grade  of  3.23%  Li2O.  At  a  mass rejection of about 20%, the Li loss would be less than 5% with a lithium grade of about 1%.
- -For the finer fraction, it is possible to reject 62.8% of the mass to the float product  with  a  Li  loss  of  about  10%.  The  sink  product  would  contain 87.9%  of  the  Li  with  a  grade  of  1.87%.  Through  interpolation,  it  is predicted  that  by  adjusting  the  density  to  about  2.65  g/cm ,  it  may  be 3

possible to reject 35% of the mass with a lithium loss of less than 5% at a concentrate grade of 1.13% Li2O.

- -Further detailed analysis of the results indicated a possibility to produce an acceptable  concentrate  grade  for  Hydromet  processing.  The  feed  size fraction should be between ¼" and 35 mesh (6.35 mm and 0.5 mm). First, the media density will be adjusted to 2.5 g/cm  to reject petalite to the float 3 product. In the next stage, the media density would be raised to 2.65 g/cm 3 to reject silicate gangue minerals. The sink product would then be further processed at 2.9 g/cm . The sink product is expected to contain 6.0% Li2O 3 with a global spodumene recovery of 40%. The float product will contain some non-liberated  spodumene  and  will  be  combined  with  the  -0.5  mm fraction and further processed by flotation. This formed the basis for the second series of heavy liquid testing.

## ii) Second Series of Heavy Liquid Testing - HL2

The test flow sheet for the second series of HLS tests is illustrated in Figure 13.7.  As  indicated  in  the  previous  section,  the  feed  material  was  primary crushed to 6.35 mm. The crushed product was then processed sequentially at heavy liquid densities of 2.5 g/cm  to remove petalite and to 2.65 g/cm  to 3 3 reject the gangue minerals. The sink product was further crushed to 3.35 mm and further processing at an SG of 3.0 g/cm . The test results indicated that: 3

- -Processing the -6.35 mm + 0.5 mm size fraction at an SG of 2.5 g/cm  can 3 reject about 30% of the mass with a lithium loss of about 3.3%;
- -About  0.46%  of  the  mass  reported  to  the  2.5  g/cm   float  product  and 3 contained mainly petalite;
- -About 30% of the material reported to the 2.65 g/cm  float product with a 3 lithium loss of 3.35%;
- -A final dense media circuit concentrate grade of 6.0% Li2O was produced with a lithium recovery of 37%;
- -All the high grade rejected material was to be combined with the -0.5 mm undersize  material  for  further  processing  by  flotation.  The  flotation  feed contained 59.1% of the total lithium and represented 58.5% of the original mass. The flotation feed grade was 1.66% Li2O, which was similar to the original feed grade.

## iii) Third Series of Heavy Liquid Testing - HL3

The test flow sheet for the third series of HL tests was fairly similar to the second. The major differences were the feed was crushed to 3/8' (9.5 mm) instead of ¼' (6.35 mm), implementation of a third crushing stage to 2 mm and repassing the final middlings through the heavy liquid at 2.65 g/cm  to 3 remove gangue middlings. The test results indicated that:

- -The lithium recovery to DMS concentrate can be increased from 37% to about 42.5%;
- -About  38%  of  the  mass  can  be  rejected  as  gangue  before  further processing;
- -The  flotation  feed  would  represent  48.6%  of  the  original  feed  mass containing 45.7% of the total lithium at a grade of 1.57% Li2O.
- iv) Fourth Series of Heavy Liquid Testing - HL4

In the fourth series of tests it was decided to reduce the number of grinding stages to two (2), as shown in Figure 13.8. The test results indicated that:

- -The lithium recovery to DMS concentrate can be increased to about 50%;
- -About 40% of the mass can be rejected as gangue;
- -The  flotation feed would  represent  45%  of  the  original  feed  mass containing 43.6% of the total lithium at a grade of 1.6% Li2O.

## e) Bench Scale Flotation Test Work

Bench  scale  flotation  tests  were  carried  out  on  the  head  sample  and  on  the combined heavy liquid middlings and undersize fraction (-0.5 mm) from the dense media test work.

All  flotation  tests  were  conducted  in  a  Denver  12  or  a  10-kg  flotation  cell.  All grinding was performed either in a 12-kg Titan laboratory mill or in a 10-kg mill. In all  tests,  steel  rods  were  used  as  grinding  media.  After  the  stage  grinding  at  a closing screen size of 300 microns, a 50-mm Mozley cyclone was used to remove the primary slimes. Scrubbing was performed in a Denver flotation cell at pH 11 and  the  presence  of  lignin  sulfonate  for  10  minutes.  Most  of  the  bench  scale flotation tests were  performed  batch-wise  with  no  recirculation of streams. However, two (2) locked cycle tests were conducted. The locked-cycle flow sheets tested were developed from the initial batch-wise bench scale flotation tests. Some key findings of the flotation test program are summarized below.

The results of desliming are illustrated in Figure 13.9.

Figure 13.9 - Correlation between Slime Mass Fraction and Lithium Loss

<!-- image -->

There  is  a  strong  linear  correlation  between  lithium  loss  and  mass  fraction  of slimes. On average, about 4.24% of the composite sample reported to the cyclone overflow, which corresponded to a lithium loss of 2.9%. The cut size (K80) of the overflow was less than 10 µm.

Since the mica grade in the sample was relatively high at 8.5%, mica flotation was carried  out  prior  to  spodumene  flotation.  The  main  variables  investigated  in  the

<!-- image -->

flotation test work were spodumene and mica collector types and reagent dosages. The most important reagents used were:

- · Armac T and Armac C collectors for mica and feldspar flotation;
- · Aero 3030C collector for muscovite flotation;
- · Kersone to promote coarse mica flotation;
- · LR19, LR19B, and FA-2 collectors for spodumene flotation;
- · Marasperse D618, which is a calcium lignin sulphonate reagent, for promoting the dispersion of fine particles and improving desliming;
- · Sulphuric acid to reduce pulp pH before amine conditioning (Armac C or T) in mica flotation;
- · Soda ash for pH control in spodumene flotation.

In  the  mica  flotation  tests,  Armac  C  was  found  to  be  a  stronger  mica  collector, resulting in a slightly higher K2O distribution in the mica concentrate. On average, the  mica  concentrate  contained  about  3  to  5%  of  the  lithium.  A  portion  of  the lithium is in the mica lattice and is not due to spodumene deportment to the mica concentrate. Consequently, there is a strong linear correlation between lithium loss to the concentrate and mica concentrate mass pull.

The effect of eliminating mica flotation was investigated and it was concluded that eliminating  mica  flotation  can  impose  negative  effects  on  spodumene  flotation, making it difficult to reach the desired grade.

The effects  of  different  collectors  were  evaluated  and  the  results  are  provided  in Figure  13.10.  Collector  D30LR  showed  relatively  poor  performance  in  terms  of maximum concentrate grade. Collector LR19 generated good concentrate grade, but the  recovery  was  slightly  lower  in  comparison  to  the  other  collectors.  It  was recommended that future confirmatory test work should focus on LR19, LR19B, and FA-2.

Figure 13.10 - Effect of Different Collectors on Spodumene Flotation

<!-- image -->

The  effect  of  primary  grind  size  was  investigated  and  the  results  are  shown  in Figure  13.11.  These  tests  were  performed  by  stage  grinding  10  kg  charges  in  a 10-kg rod mill to 100% passing 380 µm, 300 µm, and 210 µm. The grade-recovery relationships  were  similar  for  the  coarser  grinds  and  slightly  better  at  the  finer grind. The final concentrate grades were higher for the two (2) finer grade tests.

As mentioned above, two (2) locked-cycle flotation tests were carried out. The flow sheet for the first locked-cycle test is illustrated in Figure 13.11. The -3.35 mm feed charge was stage-ground to 300 µm, followed by a desliming stage. The combined mica  rougher  and  cleaner  tails  were  scrubbed,  followed  by  a  second  stage  of desliming  and  then  high-density  conditioning  at  an  ambient  temperature  (22 C). û After  rougher  flotation,  the  rougher  tails  were  conditioned  at  high  density  with additional collector. The rougher and rougher scavenger concentrates were combined and cleaned in four (4) consecutive cleaning stages. The final concentrate from  each  cycle  was  passed  through  a  wet  high-intensity  magnetic  separator. LR19B  was  used  as  the  collector  and  D618  was  used  as  the  dispersant  in  the scrubbing  stage.  The  scavenger  tails  and  magnetic  product  from  the  wet  highintensity  magnetic  separator  were  considered  as  final  tails.  The  conclusions  from the first locked-cycle test were as follows:

- · The final concentrate grade was 6.41% Li2O with a recovery of 84.2%. The scavenger tails graded 0.09% Li2O with a lithium deportment of 6.81%. The lithium loss to the magnetic stream was  0.58%.  Magnetic  separation increased the concentrate grade from 6.35 to 6.41% Li2O and reduced the iron from 1.9% to 1.47% Fe2O3;

<!-- image -->

- · The highest Li losses were to the scavenger tails;
- · The K80 of the rougher tail was 230 µm and the cyclone overflow was 100% less than 20 µm.

In  the  second  locked-cycle  test,  LR19B  was  replaced  with  LR19,  and  ferric sulphate was added to the rougher tail to activate coarse spodumene grains.

The major difference in performance was the continuous decrease of the spodumene concentrate grade. The concentrate grade in the first cycle was 6.29% Li2O and it gradually decreased to 5.17% Li2O in the final cycle. It was believed that  ferric  iron  had  a  negative  effect  on  spodumene  flotation  and  it  activated feldspar and quartz particles. This test indicated that the depression of fine gangue minerals is crucial for spodumene flotation.

## 13.1.4 Pilot Scale Dense Media Separation and Flotation Test Work

- a) DMS Pilot Testing
- i) Test Work Samples

Dense Media Separation  (' DMS ')  pilot  testing  was  carried  out  on  two  (2) separate  samples  from  the  Whabouchi  deposit.  The  first  being  a  25  tonnes blasted  outcrop  sample  and  the  second  was  a  5  tonnes  mine  representative sample consisting of a blend of outcrop and drill core materials.

Testing  was  carried  out  in  several  stages  consisting  of  crushing,  scrubbing, screening,  DMS,  magnetic  separation,  and  dewatering.  The  larger  blasted outcrop  sample  was  processed  first  to  assess  the  effectiveness  of  various processing strategies. The processing route for the smaller mine representative sample was based on the results of the larger blasted sample and  was  considered  to  be  the  most  likely  flow  sheet  to  be  used  in  actual production.

## ii) Blasted Sample Testing

The blasted sample was processed in a total of eight (8) DMS stages to assess the  effectiveness  of  various  upgrading  stages,  both  by  DMS  and  magnetic separation. In addition, the impact of separation at three (3) different feed top sizes was also assessed.

- iii) Mine Representative Sample Testing

Based  on  test  data  during  processing  of  the  blasted  sample,  the  mine representative  sample was processed using a simplified flow sheet and was considered  to  approximate  the  final  future  DMS  plant  flow  sheet.  The  test flow sheet scheme is illustrated in Figure 13.12.

Since four (4) stages of DMS may add capital cost to the processing plant, the mass balance was recalculated assuming only two (2) DMS stages. Summary mass balances for the two (2) scenarios are presented in Table 13.13.

## 4-Stages

| Combined Products     |   Wt  (t) |   Wt  (%) |   Grade  (% Li2O) |   Li Distribution  (%) |
|-----------------------|-----------|-----------|-------------------|------------------------|
| Combined Tailings     |      1.77 |      40   |              0.42 |                   10.4 |
| Combined Middlings    |      2.15 |      48.7 |              1.48 |                   44.9 |

| Feed                  |      4.42 |     100   |              1.61 |                  100   |

## 2-Stages

| Combined Products     |   Wt  (t) |   Wt  (%) |   Grade  (% Li2O) |   Li Distribution  (%) |
|-----------------------|-----------|-----------|-------------------|------------------------|
| Combined Tailings     |      1.5  |      34   |              0.41 |                    8.6 |
| Combined Middlings    |      2.62 |      59.4 |              1.78 |                   65.7 |
| Combined Concentrates |      0.29 |       6.6 |              6.22 |                   25.7 |

With  the  elimination  of  the  final  two  (2)  stages  in  the  flow  sheet,  the production of final DMS concentrate would decrease from 11% (by weight) at a grade of 6.4% Li2O to 7% by weight at a grade of 6.2% Li2O. The lithium losses to the tailings would decrease by 2% and the grade of the middlings (i.e., flotation pilot plant feed) would increase from 1.5% to 1.7% Li2O. The lithium recovery to DMS concentrate would decrease from 45% to about 26% and the lithium deportment to the flotation circuit would increase from about 45% to 66%.

## iv) Flotation Pilot Testing

Pilot scale flotation tests were carried out on the as-received blasted outcrop and  mine  representative  samples,  as  well  as  the  DMS  middling  products obtained by processing the blasted outcrop and mine representative samples. As with the DMS pilot tests, the larger blasted outcrop sample was processed

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

first in order to assess the effectiveness of various processing strategies. The processing route for the DMS middlings product obtained by processing the mine  representative  sample  was  based  in  part  on  the  results  of  the  larger blasted sample, the concentrate specification required by the potential purchaser of the concentrate, and the need to minimize capital cost. The trial results for this processing route were used to develop the design criteria for the processing plant for the PEA Study.

The  main  reason  for  producing  a  coarse  DMS  product  was  to  obtain  a combined  DMS  and  flotation particle size distribution that would  be acceptable  to  the  potential  concentrate  buyer.  Based  on  the  particle  size distributions  obtained  from  the  pilot  DMS  testing  and  preliminary  flotation tests,  it  was  determined  that  a  two-stage  DMS  operation  would  provide  a combined concentrate that would be sufficiently coarse to meet the specifications.  Therefore,  it  was  decided  that  the  mine  representative  DMS middlings  product  obtained  from  a  two-stage  circuit  was  tested  in  the flotation pilot plant.

Preliminary pilot plant flotation trials confirmed that mica pre-flotation was well  as  wet  high  intensity  magnetic  separation  of  the  flotation  concentrate would be required to meet concentrate grade specifications.

Although  it  was  determined  that  LR19  and  Armac  C  are  the  collectors  of choice for mica pre flotation and spodumene flotation, it is recommended that a cost-benefit analysis of substitute reagents be carried out prior to detailed engineering.

## b) Spodumene Recovery Summary

Based  on  DMS  and  flotation  pilot  testing  at  a  head  grade  of  1.61%  Li2O,  the following was concluded:

- · 25.5%  of  the  total  lithium  was  recovered  in  the  DMS  concentrate,  while 65.7% of the lithium reported to the flotation circuit;
- · The flotation Li recovery was 80%, for an overall lithium recovery of 78%;
- · The DMS concentrate grade was 6.2% Li2O, while the flotation concentrate grade was 5.9% Li2O. The combined concentrate grade was 6.0% Li2O;
- · The  DMS  concentrate  represented  31.5%  of  the  total  concentrate  and contained 32.7% of the total recovered lithium, while the flotation concentrate represented 68.5% of the total concentrate and contained 67.3% of the total recovered lithium.

## c) Sedimentation and Filtration Testing

Sedimentation and filtration tests were carried out at SGS Lakefield in order to size the  slimes  tailings  thickener  and  to  select  and  size  the  appropriate  equipment  for filtering flotation tails and flotation concentrate. Based on the filtration tests, it was concluded that a pressure filter would be required to filter the flotation tailings. The flotation  tailings  will  be  combined  with  the  DMS  tailings  and  dry  stacked.  The combined moisture content would be about 10%. The flotation concentrate would be filtered by belt filter and combined with the DMS concentrate. The combined moisture content would be 5-6%. Further confirmatory tests were carried out by an equipment vendor. These results were used for the belt filter sizing and demonstrated that the use of steam was not required to produce a combined DMS and flotation concentrate at about 3%  moisture  to prevent freezing during transportation in the winter months.

## d) Process Flow sheet

The proposed Process Flow sheet for this PEA Study is presented in Figure 13.13. The  crushing  circuit  consists  of  one  (1)  jaw  crusher  along  with  primary  and secondary  cone  crushers.  The  crushed  product  is  sent  to  the  DMS  circuit  which consists of two-stage of DMS. The feed size to the circuit is 9.5 mm. All -0.5 mm material is screened and later recombined with the middlings float product from the second DMS stage and sent to the grinding circuit. The grinding circuit consists of a ball mill and rod mill in series. The rod mill P80 is 200 µm. The rod mill product is sent to the flotation circuit, which comprises a conditioning and desliming stage, mica pre-flotation stage, and spodumene flotation stage.

## 13.2 Hydrometallurgical Process

This  section  of  the  Report  summarizes  the  pyrometallurgical  and  hydrometallurgical testing  conducted  on  the  Nemaska  Lithium  Whabouchi  spodumene  concentrate.  This summary is based on reports provided by Feeco, SGS Lakefield and Ameridia.

The test  work's  objectives  were  to  develop  a  process  flow  sheet  for  the  production  of market-grade lithium hydroxide and lithium carbonate.

## 13.2.1 Introduction

SGS Lakefield was mandated by Nemaska Lithium to conduct a laboratory program for the development of the hydrometallurgical flow sheet. The flow sheet was piloted in three (3) phases:

- · Phase  1:  Concentrate  leach  and  all  purification  steps  (primary  and  secondary impurity removal and ion exchange);
- · Phase 2: Lithium hydroxide membrane electrolysis and crystallization;
- · Phase 3: Lithium carbonate precipitation.

Prior to the hydrometallurgical test work at SGS Lakefield, the Whabouchi spodumene concentrate was roasted at Feeco's pilot plant facilities in Green Bay, Wisconsin, U.S.A.

In addition to SGS Lakefield's electrolysis test work performed in Phase 2, electrodialysis bench tests have been completed at Ameridia's laboratory located in New Jersey, U.S.A.

## 13.2.2 Pyrometallurgical Test Work

The spodumene roasting and acid roasting test work was conducted by Feeco in the fall of 2011.

## a) Sample Preparation

Fine  and  coarse  concentrates  from  the  original  concentration  flow  sheet  were shipped  from  SGS  Lakefield  to  Feeco's  laboratory.  The  coarse  material  was generated  in  the  dense  media  separation  process  while  the  fine  material  was produced through flotation.

Two (2) blends of concentrates were prepared using the as-received coarse material and  the  dried  fine  material.  About  1.7  tonnes  of  a  first  blend  was  prepared, containing 75% fines and 25% coarse. A second blend (1.5 tonnes) was prepared, containing 50% fines and 50% coarse.

## b) Spodumene Conversion (Roasting)

Roasting  converts  the  spodumene's  crystalline  structure  from  alpha  to  beta.  The conversion occurs at a temperature of about 1,025 ºC. The beta phase is reactive with sulfuric acid and produces lithium sulphate, which is amenable to leaching.

The test work was carried out over a three (3) day period using a 30' diameter by 20' feet  long  parallel  flow  gas-fired  rotary  kiln.  The  feed  rate  was  maintained  at 50 kg/h and a thermocouple was inserted in the discharge end hood to monitor the product's temperature.

## c) Acid Roasting

A paddle mixer was used to blend the beta spodumene with 93% sulfuric acid. The acidified material was returned to the kiln after the kiln had cooled to about 200 ºC. The kiln feed rate was between 135 and 180 kg/h. The retention time for the acid roasting was about 32 minutes.

## d) Pyrometallurgical Test Work Additional Information

The following observations were made by Nemaska Lithium's representative who witnessed Feeco's test program. This information was not published by Feeco.

- · Only 82% extraction was achieved in the acid roasting step compared to the expected 95%.
- · Sulfuric acid was added in a 30% stoichiometric excess but this value was not supported by a chemical analysis.
- · The  kiln  temperature  of  200  ºC  was  thought  to  be  sufficient  for  the  acid roasting step as it was expected that the exothermic reaction would raise the material's temperature to 250 ºC.
- · Coarse  alpha  concentrate  was  easily  converted  to  beta  spodumene  but required a longer residence time in the kiln.
- · Acid roasting was not affected by the material size.
- · The presence of iron in the concentrate affected the conversion temperature. A higher temperature could be reached without causing the formation of glass beads when the iron was removed from the concentrate.

## 13.2.3 Hydrometallurgical Test Work - Phase 1

The Phase 1 test program was carried out in November 2011 by SGS Lakefield. Phase 1 consisted of concentrate leaching, primary impurity removal, secondary impurity removal and ion exchange.

<!-- image -->

## a) Sample Preparation

Approximately 2,600 kg of acid roasted beta spodumene (solid lithium sulphate) were processed during the first phase of the pilot plant.

The two (2) blends tested during the pyrometallurgy test work were used to feed the pilot  plant  (75/25  and  50/50).  Table  13.14  shows  the  chemical  analysis  of  the samples.

Table: 13.14 - Phase 1 Pilot Plant Feed Analysis

| Sample   |   Li  (%) |   Si  (%) |   Al  (%) |   Fe  (%) |   Na  (%) |   S  (%) |   Cr  (g/t) |   Zn  (g/t) |   Mn  (g/t) |   Mg  (g/t) |   Ca  (g/t) |   K  (g/t) |
|----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|----------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|------------|

| 50/50    |      2.29 |      24.4 |      10.4 |      0.96 |      0.36 |     6.06 |         163 |         103 |        1755 |         905 |        2311 |       3376 |

## b) Concentrate Leach and Primary Impurity Removal

The objectives of the concentrate leach and the Primary Impurity Removal (' PIR ') were  to  dissolve  the  lithium  sulphate  from  the  acid  roasted  beta  spodumene  and remove  the  major  impurities.  Approximately  1,200  kg  of  75/25  and  1,400  kg  of 50/50 were processed in 85 hours.

In the concentrate leach step, solids were mixed with site water in a 50:50 ratio and agitated for 30 minutes. Lithium and contaminants (Fe, Al, Si, Mn and Mg) were leached  and  the  final  pH  of  the  slurry  was  around  1.7.  The  lithium  sulphate contained in the acid roasted beta spodumene was 100% leached.

In  the  PIR,  the  pH  of  the  slurry  was  elevated  to  approximately  5.6  by  adding hydrated lime. The major impurities (Fe, Al and Si) were precipitated as insoluble metal  hydroxides.  Air  was  sparged  into  the  PIR  tanks  to  maintain  the  oxidative potential of the slurry. The retention time in the PIR was 60 minutes.

The slurry coming from PIR was filtered on pan filters and the filtrate proceeded to Secondary  Impurity  Removal  (' SIR ').  Lithium  extraction  reached  79%  for  the 75/25 blend and 86% for the 50/50 blend.

Vacuum filtration  testing  was  carried  out  on  direct  PIR  discharge  and  thickened underflow. At 0.7 bar vacuum the direct discharge sample filter cake moisture was 26.7%.

## c) Secondary Impurity Removal

The objectives of the secondary impurity removal were to precipitate Ca, Mg and Mn impurities from the PIR filtrate.

<!-- image -->

The pH of the solution was increased to 10 by adding sodium hydroxide (NaOH) in the first two (2) tanks. Sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) was added in the third tank to convert  all  the  remaining  divalent  impurities  to  insoluble  carbonates.  The  total residence time for SIR was 240 minutes including the surge capacity.

Impurity levels at the discharge averaged 1 mg/L Mn, 14 mg/L Mg and 241 mg/L Ca in the pilot plant runs. Concentrations as low as 2 mg/L Mg and 200 mg/L Ca were  attained  by  optimizing  key  parameters  such  as  retention  time.  The  overall lithium recovery was 99.1%.

## d) Ion Exchange

The objective of the Ion Exchange (' IX ') circuit is to further reduce the calcium and magnesium tenors from the SIR discharge to 10 mg/L each.

The IX circuit consisted of three (3) columns packed with a cationic resin, which is selective towards divalent and trivalent metal ions.

The  process  consisted  in  a  lead/lag/regeneration  operation.  At  any  time,  two  (2) columns  would  be  removing  Ca  and  Mg  while  the  third  one  would  be  resin regeneration mode.

One cycle consists of the following steps: loading, feed wash, acid strip, acid wash, regeneration and regeneration wash.

The  magnesium  tenors  varied  between  0.07  and  0.2  mg/L  and  a  99.0%  removal efficiency was achieved. The calcium tenors varied between 2.4 and 5.7 mg/L and a 97.6%  removal  efficiency  was  achieved.  Lithium  losses  in  the  IX  circuit  were minimal at 2.7%.

## 13.2.4 Hydrometallurgical Test Work - Phase 2

The  second  phase  of  the  test  program  was  carried  out  in  December  2011  by  SGS Lakefield. Phase 2 consisted of membrane electrolysis test work.

## a) LiOH Membrane Electrolysis

The objective of the electrolysis process is to produce a lithium hydroxide solution from a high purity lithium sulphate solution. The pilot plant was carried out in a three-compartment membrane electrolysis cell.

The  central  compartment  was  separated  from  the  cathodic  compartment  by  a cationic membrane and from the anodic compartment by an anionic membrane.

<!-- image -->

Under the influence of an electric field (a 400-440 amps current was applied to the cell), lithium  ions  from  the  central  compartment  are  transported  through  the cationic membrane.  In  parallel,  the  sulphate  ions  are  moved  to  the  anodic compartment. The anodic reaction generates protons and sulfuric acid is produced.

The feed solution composition is presented in Table 13.15.

The pilot plant was run for two (2) five (5) days campaigns and samples were taken every  four (4) to six (6) hours. Lithium  hydroxide  at  a  14.6  g/L  lithium concentration and a 20-30 g/L sulfuric acid solution were produced.

Overall  the  pilot  plant  was  operated  for  228  hours  and  930.5  kWh  of  electrical energy  was  consumed.  The  current  efficiency  was  43.5%  for  the  first  pilot  plant campaign and 34.9% for the second.

## b) LiOH-H2O Crystallization

The objective of the crystallization process is to produce high quality solid lithium hydroxide  monohydrate  from  the  lithium  hydroxide  solution  generated  through membrane electrolysis. Atmospheric and vacuum evaporation were tested in three (3) steps.

The water evaporation rate was between 6.0 and 6.8 mL/min  during the atmospheric evaporation tests and the product ranged between 18.2 and 19.9% Li.

<!-- image -->

The  crystals  were  filtered,  washed  with  distilled  water  and  dried  in  an  inert  gas environment.

Vacuum  evaporation  was  tested  at  two  (2)  different  conditions:  at  78-82  kPa (vacuum)  and  62-70  ºC  and  also  at  62-70  kPa  (vacuum)  and  79-81  ºC.  The evaporation rate was approximately 7.7 mL/min and the final purity of the product was similar to the one that underwent atmospheric evaporation (17.9% Li).

## 13.2.5 Hydrometallurgical Test Work - Phase 3

Phase 3 of test program was carried out in March 2012 by SGS Lakefield and consisted of the production of lithium carbonate.

## a) Lithium Carbonate Production

The  objective  of  the  test  work  is  to  prove  that  lithium  hydroxide  conversion  to lithium  carbonate  can  be  an  effective  method  of  producing  high  purity  lithium carbonate.

Lithium  hydroxide  solution  produced  from  the  membrane  electrolysis  pilot  plant campaign was used as a feed for the lithium carbonate production. The feed had an average lithium grade of 14.7 g/L with calcium and magnesium concentrations of 3.5 mg/L and &lt; 0.07 mg/L respectively.

The lithium carbonate production process consists of two stages, the first is referred to  as  Lithium  hydroxide  Carbonization  (' LC ')  and  the  second  is  called  lithium bicarbonate decomposition (' DC ').

During carbonization, carbon dioxide gas is reacted with lithium hydroxide at room temperature to form lithium carbonate. Once all lithium hydroxide is carbonized, an excess of carbon dioxide converts lithium carbonate to lithium bicarbonate.

During decomposition, the solution is heated to near boiling. Lithium bicarbonate formed in the first stage is decomposed to insoluble lithium carbonate and carbon dioxide.

The lithium carbonate production pilot plant was run for three (3) days, 24 hours per day. At the end of the three (3) day pilot plant, 12.5 kg of lithium carbonate were produced (79% from the LC step and 21% from the DC step).

## 13.2.6 Electrodialysis Test Work

Electrodialysis using Bipolar Membranes (' EDBM ') was tested as an alternative method of producing lithium hydroxide. Ameridia was asked to conduct EDBM testing in June 2012.

<!-- image -->

The objective of the test work was to confirm the suitability of the EDBM technology for Nemaska's  solution,  measure  current  efficiency  as  well  as  resulting  base  and  acid concentrations.

An EDBM stack consists of three (3) compartments: one (1) for the salt stream (Li2SO4), one (1) for the base recovery (LiOH) and one (1) for the acid recovery (H2SO4). When an electric field is applied, the cations migrate from the salt, through the cation membrane and into the base loop. Anions migrate through the anionic membrane and into the acid loop. The bipolar membrane splits water molecules. The H+ and OH- ions move to their respective compartment and allow the formation of the acidic and basic solutions.

A total of eight (8) trials were performed. A base concentration of 2 N (47.8 g LiOH/L) and an acid concentration of 1.5 N (73.5 g H2SO4/L) were achieved at an average current efficiency of 58%.  Higher  concentrations  were  achieved  but  affected  the  current efficiency, which dropped to below 30%.

Based  on  the  results,  EDBM  appears  to  be  a  good  technology  for  a  large  scale  LiOH production facility.

## 14.0 MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATES

This section is an extract of the 2011 Technical Report.

An  initial  mineral  resource  estimate  has  been  previously  reported  on  the  Whabouchi Property by Nemaska in early summer 2010. Please refer to Section 6.0 History for the previous mineral resource estimate on the Project.

This  section  reports the results of an  updated  mineral  resource  estimate  for  the Whabouchi Project. SGS Geostat completed the mineral resource update using the digital database supplied by Nemaska which includes channel data from trenches and drill hole data completed by Nemaska since 2009. The historical data of the Project was not used in the present mineral resource estimate as the drill core is no longer available, which makes the analytical data impossible to validate.

The database  used  to  produce  the  mineral  resource  estimate  is  derived  from  a  total  of 460 channels  and  diamond  drill  holes  and  contains  the  collar,  survey,  lithology,  and analytical results information. A significant amount of channels does not have analytical data but include only lithological information which was considered during the modeling of the mineralized envelopes. The database contains drill hole data up to hole WHA-11117  but  the  analytical  data  from  the  last  drill  holes  of  the  2011  exploration  program (WHA-11-115  to  117)  was  not  included  in  the  database  because  results  were  not available at the time of the mineral resource estimate. Refer to Table 12.3 for a summary of the records in the database used for the updated mineral resources estimate.

The mineral resource estimate is derived from a computerized resource block model. The construction of the block model starts with the modeling of 3-D wireframe envelopes of the mineralization using channel and drill hole Li2O analytical and lithological data for the updated mineral resource estimate, once the modeling is complete, the analytical data contained  within  the  wireframe  envelopes  is  normalized  to  generate  fixed  length analytical  composites.  The  composite  data  is  used  to  interpolate  the  grade  of  blocks regularly spaced on a defined grid that fills the 3-D wireframe envelopes. An optimized pit  shell  model  using  the  pit  optimization  software  Whittle  was  produced  using  the completed block model. The interpolated blocks located below the bedrock/overburden interface and within the optimized pit shell comprise the mineral resources. The blocks are then classified based on confidence level using proximity to composites, composite grade  variance  and  mineralized  solids  geometry.  The  3-D  wireframe  modeling,  block model, Whittle optimized pit shell and mineral resource estimate were completed by SGS Geostat based on information provided by Nemaska.

## 14.1 Exploratory Data Analysis

Exploratory  data  analysis  for  lithium  was  completed  on  original  analytical  data  and composite data contained within the modeled mineralized envelopes.

## 14.1.1 Analytical Data

There  are  a  total  of  8,882  assay  intervals  in  the  database  used  for  the  current  mineral resource  estimate.  Most  of  the  drill  hole  intervals  defining  the  mineralized  envelopes have been sampled continuously. The few gaps with no analytical data located within the mineralized intervals were considered having zero grade for the purpose of the mineral resource  estimate.  These  gaps  generally  correspond  to  local  xenolites  of  adjacent lithologies floating inside the pegmatite intrusions. Table 14.2 shows the range of Li2O values from the analytical data.

The  channel samples  collected at Whabouchi  are  mostly  located at the highest topographic  area  of  the  Property  where  the  outcrop  exposure  is  best.  The  channel's azimuth  ranges  from  N020°  to  N210°  with  an  average  of  N149°  which  is  generally perpendicular to the orientation of the pegmatite intrusions. The channels average 9.7 m in length and the sampling interval is typically one metre.

The core holes drilled on the Project are generally oriented N330°, perpendicular to the general orientation of the pegmatite intrusions, and have a weak to moderate deviation toward  the  east.  Their  spacing  is  typically  50  m  with  tighter  25  m  spacing  between sections  200  mE  and  1,050  mE.  The  drill  holes  dips  range  from  43°  to  75°  with  an average of 50° and the drill hole intercepts range from approximately 70% of true width to near true width of the mineralization.

## 14.1.2 Composite Data

Block  model  grade  interpolation  is  conducted  on  composited  analytical  data.  A  2-m composite length has been selected based on the N-S thickness of the 5 m by 3 m by 5 m block size defined for the resource block model. The minimum length of composite kept

<!-- image -->

for the interpolation process is 1 m. Compositing is conducted at the start of the bedrockoverburden contact in the case of drill holes. No capping was applied on the analytical composite data. Table 14.2 shows the statistics of the analytical composites used for the interpolation of the resource block model and Figure 14.1 shows the related histogram for Li2O.

Figure 14.2 and Figure 14.3 display the spatial distribution of the composites in plan and longitudinal  view  respectively  (hole  collars  are  shown  as  blue  circles  and  sample composites are shown as black diamonds).

## 14.1.3 Specific Gravity

Section  11.4  summarizes  the  SG  determination  in  details.  The  results  of  the  SG measurements conducted by SGS Geostat and Nemaska in 2010 and 2011 on selected mineralized core samples returned an average SG value of 2.70/m  for the mineralized 3 pegmatite. This value was used for the calculation of the tonnages from the volumetric estimates of the resource block model.

## 14.2 Geological Interpretation

SGS Geostat conducted the interpretation and modeling of the 3-D wireframe envelopes of  the  mineralization  based  on  the  channel  and  drill  hole  data  in  collaboration  with Nemaska personnel. The modeling was first completed on sections to define mineralized prisms using the lithologies and analytical data for lithium. A minimum grade of 0.3% Li2O over a minimum drill hole interval length of 3 m was generally used as guideline to define the width of mineralized prisms, corresponding to the N-S width of the individual blocks.  The  final  3-D  wireframe  model  was  constructed  by  meshing  the  defined mineralized prisms based on the geological interpretation. Local smaller 3-D wireframe envelopes  of  significant  size  xenolith  material  located  inside  the  large  envelopes  were also modeled.

A  bedrock-overburden  interface  3-D  surface  has  been  generated  by  triangulating  the lower intercept of the overburden-coded lithology from the drill hole dataset. Figure 14.4 and Figure 14.5 show the final 3-D wireframe envelopes in plan and longitudinal view respectively.  The  different  colors  of  the  envelopes  do  not  represent  any  specific parameters and are there to help the visual differentiation of the different envelopes.

## 14.3 Resource Block Modeling

A block size of 5 m (E-W) by 3 m (N-S) by 5 m (vertical) was selected for the resource block model of the Project based on drill hole spacing, width and general geometry of mineralization.  The  5  m  vertical  dimension  corresponds  to  an  approximation  for  the bench height of a potential  small  open  pit  mining  operation.  The  5  m  E-W  dimension corresponds to about a quarter to a fifth of the minimum spacing between the drill holes and accounts for the variable geometry of the mineralization in that direction. The 3 m N-S dimension accounts for the average minimum width of the mineralization modeled at Whabouchi.  The  resource  block  model  contains  177,997  blocks  located  below  the overburden/bedrock surface for a total of 13,206,808 m . Blocks located at the interface 3 with the bedrock/overburden surface have been calculated with block fraction. Table 14.3 summarizes the parameters of the block model limits.

Table 14.3 - Resource Block Model Parameters

| Direction       | Block   Size (m)   | Number  of Blocks   | Coordinates   (Local Grid)   | Coordinates   (Local Grid)   |

| Direction       | Block   Size (m)   | Number  of Blocks   | Min (m)                      | Max (m)                      |

## 14.4 Grade Interpolation Methodology

The grade interpolation for the Whabouchi resource block model was completed using the Inverse Distance to the power square (' ID 2 ') methodology. The interpolation process was conducted using three (3) successive passes with relaxed search conditions from one (1) pass to the next until all blocks are interpolated. In the first pass, the search ellipsoid distance was 75 m (long axis) by 75 m (intermediate axis) by 25 m (short axis) with an orientation of 0° azimuth, 75° dip and 0° spin which represents the general geometry of the pegmatites in the deposit. Search conditions were defined with a minimum of seven (7)  composites  and  a  maximum  of  30  composites,  with  a  minimum  of  three  (3)  holes required to estimate the block. The first pass resulted in the interpolation of 71% of the block model. For the second pass, the search distance was twice the search distance of the first pass and composites selection criteria were kept the same as for the first pass. A total of 95% of the blocks was interpolated during the second pass. Finally, the search distance of  the  third  pass  was  increased  to  500  m  (long  axis)  by  500  m  (intermediate  axis)  by 100 m (short  axis)  and  again  the  same  composites  selection  criteria  were  applied.  The purpose of the last interpolation pass was to interpolate the remaining unestimated blocks mostly located at the edges of the block model. Figure 14.6 illustrates the three (3) search ellipsoids used for the different interpolation passes. Figure 14.7 and Figure 14.8 show the results of the block model interpolation in plan and longitudinal view respectively.

## 14.5 Mineral Resource Classification

The mineral resources at Whabouchi are classified into Measured, Indicated and Inferred categories.  The  mineral  resource  classification  follows  the  CIM  requirements  and guidelines and is based on the density of analytical information, the grade variability and

<!-- image -->

spatial  continuity  of  mineralization.  The  mineral  resources  were  classified  in  two  (2) successive stages: automated classification followed by manual editing of final classification results.

The first classification stage is conducted by applying an automated classification process which  selects  around  each  block  a  minimum  number  of  composite  from  a  minimum number of holes located within a search ellipsoid of a given size and orientation. For the Measured resource category, the search ellipsoid is 35 m (strike) by 35 m (dip) by 5 m with  a  minimum  of  seven  (7)  composites  in  at  least  four  different  drill  holes.  For  the Indicated  category,  the  search  ellipsoid  is  twice  the  size  of  the  Measured  category ellipsoid  using  the  same  composites  selection  criteria.  The  second  classification  stage involves  the  delineation  of  coherent  zones  for  the  Measured  and  Indicated  categories based on the results of the automated classification. The objective is to homogenize or 'smooth'  the  results  of  the  automated  process  by  removing  the  'Swiss  cheese'  or 'spotted  dog'  patterns  typical  of  the  automated  process  results.  The  second  stage  is conducted  by  defining  3-D  solids  on  a  bench  by  bench  basis  for  the  Measured  and Indicated categories. Figure 14.9 and Figure 14.10 show the block model classification in plan and longitudinal views respectively (categories: Measured - red, Indicated - blue, and Inferred - grey).

## 14.6 Mineral Resource Estimation

The mineral resources of Whabouchi are reported using an open-pit mining perspective. Due to the significant depth extent of the resource block model, it is considered that not all the interpolated  blocks  could  meet  the  requirement  of  reasonable  prospect  of economic extraction. In order to define the mineral resources of the Project, SGS Geostat completed an optimization of an open pit using the Whittle software. The final mineral resources include all the resource blocks located within the optimized pit shell and below the overburden/bedrock interface.

Table  14.4  summarizes  the  parameters  used  in  the  pit  optimization  process.  The  pit optimization process returned an in-pit Li2O grade cut-off of 0.36%. The base case cutoff for the updated mineral resource estimate has been set to 0.4% Li2O.

The final  in-pit  mineral  resource  estimate  at  the  base  case  cut-off  of  0.4%  Li2O  totals 11,294,000  tonnes,  with  an  average  grade  of  1.58%  Li2O  in  the  Measured  category, 13,785,000 tonnes, with an average grade of 1.50% Li2O and in the Indicated category, with an additional 4,401,000 tonnes, with an average grade of 1.51% Li2O the Inferred category. The updated mineral resource estimation for Whabouchi deposit is tabulated in Table 14.5 for the base case cut-off of 0.4% Li2O. Two (2) others cut-offs at 1.0% and 1.5% Li2O are also shown for reference. Figure 14.11 is a longitudinal section showing the optimized pit outline with the final in-pit resource block model.

## 14.7 Block Model Validation

A validation of the mineral resource Li2O grade was conducted as part of the verification process. The validation includes: 1) a visual comparison of the color-coded block values versus the composites data in the vicinity of the interpolated blocks, and 2) a comparison of the grade average and standard deviation parameters for the original assay data located within the mineralized envelop, the composite data and the block model data. Table 14.6 summarizes the comparative statistics of the assay, composite and block model datasets.

## 14.8 Comments about the Mineral Resource Estimate

There are no known factors or issues related to permitting, legal, mineral title, taxation, socio-economic  or  political  settings  that  could  materially  affect  the  mineral  resource estimate.

The price of Li2O concentrate of US$310 per tonne selected for the pit optimization is based on the nine (9) months average selling price for Li2O concentrate disclosed by the Li2O concentrate producer Talison Lithium Ltd in their MD&amp;A dated May 2011. SGS Geostat  considers  the  selected  price  to  be  reasonable  for  the  purpose  of  the  current mineral resource estimate.

## 15.0 MINERAL RESERVE ESTIMATE

Since this Report is a PEA Report, the resources have to be classified as in-pit measured and indicated resources and it is described in Section 16.0.

## 16.0 MINING METHODS

## 16.1 Block Model Validation

The  mining  engineering  work  required  for  the  study,  such  as  the  pit  optimization, engineered  pit  design,  mine  planning,  and  in-depth  economic  analysis  is  based  on  the resource  block  model  prepared  by  Geostat.  The  model  has  the  name  Whabouchi 2011\_BM\_ID2\_final\_8juin2011.csv.  For  the  purpose  of  this  study,  the  model  was transferred  from  a  Comma  Separated  Value  File  (CSV)  into  the  MineSight™  mining software. Geostat also provided BBA with digitized topographical and bedrock mapping data.

The  block  model  was  provided  in  a  local  coordinate  system  based  upon  the  section location and orientation used in geological interpretation.

The block dimensions and the block model details are as follows:

- · X-coordinate (abscissa-axis) = 5 metres;
- · Y-coordinate (ordinate-axis) = 3 metres;
- · Z-coordinate (vertical axis) = 5 metres.

The following data was provided by Geostat in the model:

- · ix, iy, iz (increments in model);
- · Fixed Density (Rock = 3.06 t/m , ROM = 2.70 t/m ); 3 3
- · Classification (3 = Measured, 2 = Indicated, 1 = Inferred);
- · Li2O % (Lithium Oxide %);
- · Percent\_Env (only for the bedrock-overburden interface, fraction of block considered mineralization).

Additional  variables  were  introduced  into  the  BBA  MineSight  model,  in  order  to ascertain additional block  model  economic  statistics.  The  additional  variables  are summarized in Section 16.3.2 below.

## 16.2 Pit Optimization

In order to develop an optimal engineered pit design for Nemaska's Whabouchi Project, an  optimized  pit  shell  was  prepared  using  the  Lerchs-Grossman  3D  algorithm  in MineSight™  (' LG 3D ').  The  LG  3D  pit  optimizer  algorithm  is  a  true  pit  optimizer, based upon dynamic programming of the graph theory. The pit optimizer calculates the net value of all blocks in the model (i.e. profit minus loss) and searches for the ultimate pit shell that delineates the volume of extraction, which maximizes the revenue. In order

<!-- image -->

to maximize  the  revenue,  it  takes  into  consideration  the  following:  mining  costs, processing costs, processing recoveries, weight recovery values, and the overall pit slope.

As outlined in this section, the pit optimization has used only those blocks classified as either a Measured or Indicated resource in order to generate revenue.

## 16.2.1 Pit Optimization Parameters

Additional variables were coded into the block model in order to ascertain block model economics.

The main economic equations that govern the outcome of the LG 3D algorithm are as stated:

- · Volume of block (' Vol. ') (m ) = 5 m × 3 m × 5 m 3
- · Head Grade in Li (' HGLI ') = 〖 %Li 〗 \_2 O × 0.465 (atomic mass)
- · Li Recovery (' LIREC ') = (HGLI/100) × (79/100)
- · Spodumene Produced (' SPODP ') = (LIREC × 100) /2.81 (Tonnes)
- · Spodumene Sold (' SPODS ') = (SPODP) × (1-0.02) (Tonnes)
- · Block Value (' BVAL ') = {Vol. × Density × (TOPO %) /100)} × (400 SPODS-122 SPODP) * ($)

*Where value of concentrate FOB mine = $400/t Spodumene Concentrate, less Freight cost mine to refinery = $122/t con.

Additional pit optimization parameters include:

- · Mining cost (mineralized material/waste) = $2.50/t mined
- · Total operating cost per tonne of mineralized material = $24.00/ t milled (Processing, G&amp;A)
- · Pit Slope = 48°

## 16.2.2 Cut-off Grade Calculation

A milling cut-off grade (' CoG ') is used to classify the material inside the pit limits as mineralization  or  waste.  Due  to  the  fact  that  the  material  falls  within  the  pit,  the breakeven  cut-off  grade  is  the  grade  required  to  cover  the  costs  for  processing  and general and administration costs (' G&amp;A ').

After multiple simulations on in-pit resources estimation, the mill cut-off grade for the Nemaska Lithium 'Whabouchi' Pit was established at 0.4% Li2O.

## 16.2.3 Pit Optimization Results

The technical parameters described in Section 16.2.1were used in the LG 3-D algorithm to  generate  the  optimum  pit  shell  for  Nemaska  Lithium's  Whabouchi  pit.  Figure  16.1 shows a 2D view of the pit optimization.

Figure 16.1 - 2D LG Pit Shell

## 16.3 Engineered Pit Design

The detailed pit design for Nemaska Lithium's Whabouchi Project was carried out using the optimal LG 3D pit shell as a guide. The designed pit design includes mining features required for an operational open-pit mine, such as minimum mining widths, safety berms, bench face angles, inter-ramp angles, and benching arrangement. Bench heights of ten (10) m have been used, and double benching is used throughout the final designed pit.

The geotechnical parameters used for the detailed pit design were prepared by external consultants, Journeaux Assoc., and are presented in the following section.

## 16.3.1 Pit Slope Parameters

As  previously  mentioned  in  Section  16.3  Engineered  Pit  Design,  the  geotechnical parameters  for  the  pit  design  were  provided  by  Journeaux  Assoc.  in  a  report  entitled 'Report on Pit Slope Design', dated February 16, 2012.

The majority of the recommended pit slope design parameters are listed in Table 16.1. The original recommendations suggest bench heights of 10 m, with a bench face angle of 75° and inter-ramp angle of 56°, resulting in 4-m berms.

Table: 16.1 - Recommended Slope Angles for Whabouchi Project

| Wall          |   Bench   Height (m) |   Berm   Width (m) |   BFA (°) 1 |   Vertical Bench   Separation (m) |   IRA (°) 1 |
|---------------|----------------------|--------------------|-------------|-----------------------------------|-------------|
| North Wall    |                   10 |                  4 |          75 |                                10 |          56 |
| South Wall    |                   10 |                  4 |          75 |                                10 |          56 |
| East End Wall |                   10 |                  4 |          75 |                                10 |          56 |
| West End Wall |                   10 |                  4 |          75 |                                10 |          56 |

1 ' BFA ' = Bench Face Angle and 'I RA '= Inter-Ramp Angle.

According to Journeaux Assoc., the slopes are considered stable due to very competent bedrock and to the fact that the joint systems are deeply steeping. The conclusions and recommendations can be found in the report from Journeaux Assoc. entitled Report on Pit Slope Design, Whabouchi Project, Nemaska Lithium Report No. L111474, March 23, 2012.

## 16.3.2 Additional Design Aspects

The in-pit haulage roads for the PEA Study of Nemaska Lithium are 22 m wide in order to accommodate two-way traffic for the 46-tonne trucks. A single-lane, 16 m-wide ramp is  used  for  the  lower  levels  of  the  mine.  All  in-pit  ramps  have  been  restricted  to  a maximum gradient of 10%. The ramp exit has been designed to allow easy access to the waste  rock  piles  situated  to  the  North  (UTM)  of  the  pit.  Both  the  2D  and  3D representations can be seen in Figure 16.2 and Figure 16.3, respectively.

The engineered pit design dimensions are:

- · Length: 1,250 m;
- · Width: 320 m;
- · Depth: 190 m.

Three  (3)  cross-section  views  (Eastings)  are  also  Xdemonstrated  from  Figure  16.4  to Figure 16.6.

## 16.4 Dilution and Mineralized Material Loss

Using  the  provided  block  model  and  the  mining  polygon  method,  BBA  performed calculations in order to determine the dilution and mining recovery for the engineered pit design. The resulting dilution was 4.5% at 0.34% Li2O, and the mineralized material loss was 4.5%.

The  mining  polygon  method  for  dilution  estimation  simulates  the  possible  mining configuration by digitizing a series of mining polygons around the mineralized material blocks  that  would  be  delivered  to  the  mill  as  mill  feed.  The  blocks  that  are  being delivered to the mill are those that are classified as either Measured or Indicated resource class material, with a grade of 0.4% Li2O or greater. Therefore, these are the blocks that the  mining  polygon method triggers. The method follows a set of guidelines to ensure that the work on the dilution estimate is consistent and systematic throughout all of the chosen benches for the estimation.

The guidelines for digitizing the polygons in order to estimate the expected dilution are as follows:

- · Mining  dilution  simulation  should  only  include  Measured  and  Indicated  resource classes;
- · Mining  polygons  must  only  be  taken  for  mineralized  material  blocks  having  a certain pre-determined cut-off grade;

<!-- image -->

- · When mining widths were greater than 4 metres (i.e., ≥ 4 m in width), the polygon perimeters  were  digitized  with  an  offset  of  0.3  m  inside  the  mineralized  material /waste contact of the block;
- · When  mining  widths  were  less  than  4  metres  (i.e., ≤ 4  m  in  width),  the  polygon perimeters were digitized with an offset of 0.5 m outside the mineralized material /waste contact of the block;
- · Minimum blocks to be mined in a single cut should be two blocks in length;
- · Mining cuts were taken only within the pit design.

Figure 16.7 shows an example of the polygon method used in order to estimate dilution in the model. Additional waste is added and a portion of mineralized material is removed, which contributes to the final diluted mineralized material amount. The dilution content is  calculated  as  the  ratio  of  the  waste  tonnes  along  the  perimeter  of  the  mining  block divided by the tonnes of mineralized material located inside the mining block.

The polygon estimates were performed on four (4) different benches equally spaced in the pit design: z = 297.5 m, z = 257.5 m, z = 212.5 m, z = 167.5 m. The plan views for these  respective  benches  are  shown  in  Figure  16.8  through  Figure  16.11.  An  isometric view of the selected benches, shown with the engineered pit design, can be seen in Figure 16.12.

After completion of the polygons, they were extruded by one (1) block height (5 m) in order to generate the solids for estimating the mining dilution, dilution grade and mining loss.

With all the mineralized material, waste and grade data extracted from the computation of the solids, a weighted average was taken from the benches. The compilation of results can be seen in Table 16.2.

## 16.5 In-Pit Resources

The  Resources  for  the  engineered  pit  design  amount  to  19.639  Mt  of  Measured  and Indicated  Resources  at  an  average  grade  of  1.49%  Li2O  using  a  cut-off  grade  of 0.4% Li2O  after  4.5%  dilution  @  0.34%  Li2O  and  an  mineralized  material  loss  of 4.5%.The expected mine life is approximately 19 years, based on a production rate of 1.095 Mt of ROM per year. The stripping amounts to 59.4 Mt, resulting in an overall stripping  ratio  of  3.02  tonnes  waste  per  tonne  mineralized  material.  The  resources contained in the engineered pit design are given in Table 16.3 by resource categories.

## 16.6 Mine Planning

The yearly mining schedule has been developed based on a mill feed of 1,095,000 tpy, or 3,000 tpd. The life of the mine of this Project is approximately 19 years, based on the 19,639 M tonnes of Measured and Indicated Resources from the engineered pit design for Nemaska's Whabouchi Project.

A starter  pit  was  created  in  order  to  ensure  the  extraction  of  higher  grade  run-of-mine (' ROM '), along with the minimization of the stripping ratio in the first three (3) years of the life of mine. The starter pit that was used in the phasing of the mine plan can be seen in the figure below. To achieve these goals during the pre-production period, 1.14 Mt of waste  material  must  be  stripped  from  the  engineered  pit  design,  and  0.43  Mt  of overburden must be stripped.

A weighted average ramp-up of 77% is applied to the run of mine and stripping amounts in Year 1. Two (2) months' worth of production at a mill capacity of 30% is also used in preproduction (' PP '), which totals 54,000 tonnes of ROM.

The mining sequence presented in Table 16.4 below shows the details of the 19 years of the mine life, which was used for the financial analysis. The mine plan drawings can be found in the following Figure 16.14 through Figure 16.23.

## 16.7 Waste Rock and Tailings Management

The Waste Rock Pile is located to the north of the Nemaska engineered pit. The Waste Rock Pile is divided into two (2) phases: Phase (A) is the first phase to be filled, and is located on the west side of the total footprint; Phase (B) is the second phase to be filled, and is located on the east side of the footprint. The reason for the division of the Waste Rock Pile into two (2) phases is due to the fact that the Route du Nord is running through the  center  of  the  combined  (overall  footprint).  The  relocation  is  delayed  until  the completion of Phase (A). Phase (A) expires around Year 12, once a capacity of 13.2 Mm 3 (bank volume) has been reached. Afterwards, Phase (B) is used until the end of the Life of Mine (' LOM '). The capacity of Phase (B) is 14.5 Mm  (bank volume). This yields a 3 total Waste Rock Pile capacity of 27.7 Mm  (bank). 3

The Project has selected to use a co-disposal methodology for the tailings produced at the concentrator  and  the  waste  rock  from  the  mine.  Co-disposal  is  the  mixing  of  fine  and coarse mine waste to produce a single waste stream. Mixing the fine and coarse waste reduces  the  empty  void  space  primarily  associated  with  coarse  waste  streams,  while simultaneously increasing the strength of the fines. Tailings produced at the concentrator have moisture content around 10%.

The deposition strategy to blend the coarse and fine waste feeds is based on mixing at the edge of the waste rock pile by placing both tailings and waste rock near the crest of the active dump, then pushing both over the face with a dozer. The design parameters used for the waste/tailings stockpile do not require that a fixed ratio be maintained. Waste and tailings trucks can arrive randomly. Compaction will be achieved by traffic of equipment on the pile and self-weight.

Thus, the tailings are being transported from the concentrator to the rock pile and mixed at the crest with a dozer. The dimensions of the CAT 772 (or equivalent), recommended for  the  hauling  fleet,  were  used  for  the  design  criteria  of  the  loading  area  at  the concentrator. Loading of the tailings is being done by a suspended conveyor with a single discharge point and with a design capacity to load the CAT 772 (or equivalent) in ten (10) minutes.

Based  on  the  engineered  pit  design,  the  amount  of  in-pit  waste  rock  is  approximately 18.6 Mm 3 (in-pit),  leaving  sufficient  space  for  up  to  9.1  Mm   for  the  coarse  tailings 3 material from the mill.

The  design  criteria  used  for  both  phases  of  the  Waste  Rock  Pile  are  governed  by geotechnical specifications. The geotechnical specifications are as follows:

- · Bench Face Angle (' BFA '): 30°;
- · Inter-Ramp Angle (' IRA '): 26.6°;

## 16.8 Mine Operations

Mining operations will be conducted 24 hours day, seven (7) days week and 365 days per year. The operations at Nemaska will use conventional mining methods, which include a drilling and blasting sequence, followed by hauling and loading.

## 16.8.1 Drilling

Production  drilling  will  be  accomplished  using  a  fleet  of  diesel  drilling  rigs.  The mineralized material and waste zones will be drilled with 6 ½ inch diameter holes, 5 m spacing, and 5 m burden.

A re-drill  factor  of  5%  has  been  included  to  account  for  productivity  lost  to  collapsed holes or lost drill steels. The number of drills operating at any given time is dependent on the annual production rate and varies over the course of the mine life. The operating drill requirements are to have one drill operating throughout the life of mine. However, the fleet has allocated two (2) drills (one on stand-by), in order to account for any unforeseen downtime.

Holes  will  be  drilled  to  a  total  depth  of  11.5  m  including  1.5  m  of  sub-drilling.  A stemming  height  of  4  m  will  be  used  to  maximize  the  effectiveness  of  the  explosive column.

With all of these factors, the tonnage capacity per shift is respectively 11,267 tonnes of mineralized material and 12,770 tonnes of waste.

## 16.8.2 Blasting

Blasting will be provided under a contract with an explosive company that will supply blasting  materials  and  technology,  and  ensure  the  delivery  and  storage  of  explosive products. Blasting will be accomplished using 100% emulsion type explosive production with an average density (in the hole) of 1.25 g/cm . 3

Based  on  the  drilling  patterns  listed  above,  the  powder  factor  is  estimated  to  be 0.297 kg/tonne in mineralized material and 0.262 kg/tonne in waste. The explosives will be trucked and stored on-site by the explosives supplier in storage facilities built for this purpose. The explosives contractor will also be responsible for providing a down-the-hole service.

Table 16.6 below shows the blasting parameters used that contribute to the production calculations.

The cost for the blasting contractors is included in the summary of mine operating costs. Costs  for a blasting contractor  supervisor,  Mobile  Manufacturing  Unit  (' MMU ') operator  otherwise  known  as  the  bulk  emulsion  truck  operator,  and  mechanic  are  all summarized in the section on operating costs.

Emulsion-type explosives are preferred for their higher resilience to water. Environmentally, they are also sounder and produce 2% less residual ammonia than other explosive materials. In the size range chosen for the charge diameter of these emulsive products, these explosives will allow for better overall performance and handling.

In  order  to  obtain  good  fragmentation,  electronic  detonators  will  be  used.  This  type  of detonator  is  a  less  costly  alternative.  The  total  cost  per  tonne  (including  explosives manufacturing,  transport,  down-the-hole  service,  and  related  labour  fees)  has  been estimated at $0.341 per tonne of mineralized material and $0.319 per tonne of waste.

## 16.8.3 Loading and Hauling

Production  will  be  accomplished  using  a  fleet  of  46-tonne  capacity  haul  trucks  and hydraulic shovels with a 6 m  bucket capacity. This fleet combination should allow for 3 4-pass loading of trucks hauling mineralized material and waste, and 5-pass loading for trucks carrying overburden.

Haul truck loading time is estimated at 2.7 minutes for mineralized material and waste and 3.3 minutes for overburden.

## 16.9 Fleet Requirements

The requirements for the primary mining equipment include a fleet of drills; haul trucks, shovels,  and  one  (1)  supporting  wheel  loader,  which  are  based  on  the  haul  distances, equipment availability, utilization, and overall productivity data. Availability profiles for major  equipment  have  been  estimated  using  vendor  benchmarks,  similar  projects  in BBA's database, as well as internal operational experience.

The truck  fleet  consists  of  units  having  a  payload  capacity  of  46  tonnes  (CAT  772  or equivalent).  A  maximum  of  seven  (7)  trucks  will  be  necessary  to  support  the  mine productivity  level  of  1.095  Mtpy  of  ROM  in  Year  8,  along  with  the  waste  removal schedule. In addition, tailings re-handling requires an operating fleet of one (1) truck to satisfy the variable amounts of tailings re-handling throughout the life of mine. This one (1) truck is summarized separately from the total operating cash costs, since it is not a cost  directly  associated  with  the  mine  planned  tonnage.  (The  description  for  tailings  is summarized further in the section on Waste Rock and Tailings Management). Operating truck requirements were determined using the appropriate operating time parameters, fill factors, haulage distances and cycle times, and tonnes to be moved by material type.

The truck fleet size was calculated using a mechanical availability of 88% in the earlier years, transitioning to 83% in the later years. The equipment utilization factor is 95%.The gross operating hours (' GOH ') used for the operating truck calculation, are based on a 2 x 12-hour shift work schedule and upon the variable mechanical availability. The GOH varies from 10 hours to 10.6 hours over the life of mine. The truck fleet size on a yearly basis was then smoothed out to better represent actual operation.

The proposed hydraulic shovel fleet  consists  of  6  m   front-end  configured  units  (CAT 3 390D  or  equivalent)  for  loading  the  blasted  ROM,  waste  rock,  and  overburden.  The tailings re-handling does not require a loader or excavator, since the truck will be filled directly from the conveyor connected to the concentrator.

Annual  shovel  productivity  was  determined  using  the  appropriate operating time parameters, fill factors, material properties, and bucket capacities. The number of shovels will reach a maximum of two (2) units in Year 6. In addition, one (1) 4-m  wheel loader 3 (CAT988H or equivalent)  will  assist  in  the  loading  of  ROM  in  cases  where  the  main loading  equipment  is  temporarily  unavailable  or  when  temporary  additional  loading production is required. The wheel loader will also assist in other general duties such as stockpile management. The fast response time and high mobility of the wheel loader will enable particular bench face blending requirements.

As  mentioned  in  Section  16.3.1  on  the  drilling  parameters,  one  (1)  operating  drill  is required to satisfy production. In addition, a second drill has been added for stand-by use. The drill is a DTH Cubex QXR 920 (or equivalent), which will be drilling 6½" diameter holes.

For a complete list of all primary, secondary and auxiliary equipment, see Table 16.7.

## 16.10 Mine Manpower Requirements

The  manpower  requirements  for  the  mine  are  divided  into  two  (2)  categories:  hourly operations  and  staff  personnel.  Hourly  operations  personnel  can  be  further  subdivided into the major  equipment  and  support  equipment  operators  and  the  maintenance personnel. Most of the operators for the major mine equipment are based on a four (4) crew rotation schedule.

The number of hourly personnel (mine operations and mobile equipment maintenance) reaches a peak of 73 in Year 10. The average ratio of hourly maintenance personnel to hourly operators is 0.48.

The staff mine personnel list includes such employees as mine superintendent, engineers, planners, foremen, and geologists. The  number  of  salaried employees  reaches  a maximum of 27 in Year 5 and subsequently  decreases  to  17  in  Year  15  for  the  short remainder of the mine life.

A full list of the personnel over the life of the mine can be seen in the chart shown below.

## 17.0 RECOVERY METHODS

Section 13 of this Report described the metallurgical test work and how the results were used to derive the preliminary Process Flow sheet (' PF ') and mass balance. The process design  has  been  split  in  two  (2)  locations.  The  Concentrator  Plant  will  be  located  at Whabouchi  and  the  Hydrometallurgical  Plant  will  be  located  at  Valleyfield  near  the CEZinc  facilities.  The  Concentrator  design  is  presented  in  Section  17.1  whereas  the Hydrometallurgical Plant design is presented in Section 17.2.

General  processing  plant  descriptions  of  various  areas  are  provided.  This  information serves  as  input  information  for  the  development  of  the  capital  and  operating  cost estimates presented in Section 21.

## 17.1 Concentrator Plant

The  PF  and  mass  balance  constitute  the  basis  for  determining  the  recovery  method  of spodumene from the Whabouchi mineralized material to obtain a spodumene concentrate which be treated  at  Valleyfield  to  produce  lithium  hydroxide  and  lithium  carbonate  of suitable grade to produce battery grade lithium compounds. In this section of the Report, a  process  design  basis  is  established  and  is  used  to  further  develop  the  PF,  mass  and water  balance  and  to  develop  the  process  design  criteria,  including  the  selection  and sizing of major process equipment.

## 17.1.1 Process Design Criteria

The  process  design  is  based  on  the  processing  plant  capacity  of  1.1  MTPY.  The  test results, given in Section 13, were used to develop the PF and preliminary mass and water balances which form the base criteria for the process design. In addition, the required size and quantities of major processing equipment were calculated based on the aforementioned criteria, briefly summarized in Table 17.1.

The PF, including mass and water balances, is shown in Figure 17.1 and Figure 17.3. The mass and water balances are given as design values and take into consideration the plant utilization. These balances were derived from the block diagram presented in Section 13. Both Table 17.1 and Figure 17.1 were established using the pilot plant test results that was described in Section 13 and for which the head grade was 1.61% Li2O. Those were used in this study for the equipment and layout design.

In Figure 17.2, the mass balance has been adjusted to the life of mine average head grade of 1.49% Li2O. This mass balance was calculated by assuming a constant Li recovery at each of the major process steps. This assumption was based on previous test work results from experience. The annual concentrate production is 213,600 tpy. Those mass balance results were used as inputs for the financial analysis in Section 22.

## 17.1.2 General Process Description and Plant Design

General process and plant design criteria for the concentrator are based on the following:

- · The location of the jaw crusher concentrator, crushed ore stockpile, major conveyors and thickener are shown on the site plan developed in this study. The site plan is presented  in  Section  18  and  shown  in  Figure  17.4,  Figure  17.5,  and  also  in Appendix A.
- · Crushing  is  performed  with  a  150  kW  jaw  crusher  followed  by  secondary  and tertiary cone crushers.
- · The crushed ore is upgraded in a two-stage dense media circuit to produce a coarse spodumene  concentrate  and  a  middlings  product  that  is  ground  and  treated  by flotation.
- · The  DMS  middlings  product  is  ground  in  a  rod  mill  and  then  combined  with screened 0.5 mm material from the DMS circuit and further ground in a ball mill to P80 200 microns. This ground product forms the feed for the flotation circuit.
- · The flotation circuit consists of desliming and mica pre-flotation followed by further desliming and spodumene flotation. All slimes, mica concentrate, and spodumene rougher  flotation  tails  are  combined  and  filtered  in  a  pressure  filter  to  a  moisture content of about 13%  and  subsequently combined  with DMS  tailings and transported by truck to the mine  waste  stockpile. The  spodumene  flotation concentrate is filtered by belt filter to about 5-6% moisture and combined with the DMS concentrate before being sent to the concentrate storage.

## 17.1.3 Primary Crushing

The  run-of-mine,  which  has  an  F80  of  600  mm,  is  fed  from  the  mineralized  material stockpile  to  the  static  grizzly  and  hopper  by  a  front-end  loader.  The  grizzly  rejects material larger than 800 mm. The hopper discharges in a vibrating grizzly feeder.

The reciprocating grizzly feeder separates the feed into two (2) streams; a fine material stream,  which  is  sent  directly  to  the  crushed  ore  belt  conveyor,  and  a  coarse  stream, which is fed to the primary crusher. The primary crusher is a jaw-type crusher, measuring 813 mm x 1,220 mm with an installed power of 150 kW, and receives material with an F80 of 700 mm. It has an availability of 60% with a product P80 of 160 mm. This product is discharged onto the crushed ore belt conveyor.

The crushed ore belt conveyor feeds material to the scalping screen feed hopper with a 7.6  m   capacity.  The  crushed  mineralized material is discharged to the scalping screen 3 feed conveyor and then fed to the 8 x 20 double deck scalping screen (5.8 m  surface 2 area). The screen is a double-deck machine. The top deck has a 45 mm aperture, while the  bottom  deck  has  a  10  mm  aperture.  The  fines  are  sent  directly  to  the  fine  ore  belt conveyor.

The oversize and mid-size material separated in the screen are conveyed to the secondary cone crusher and tertiary cone crusher respectively. The secondary crusher and tertiary crushers  are  both  cone-type  crushers  with  installed  power  of  220  kW  and  295  kW respectively.

The discharge of the secondary and tertiary cone crushers is transferred to the screen belt conveyor which reports back to the scalping screen feed hopper mentioned above.

Dust is controlled in the crushing area using a dedicated dry dust collector and collecting duct work, which discharges collected material onto the fine ore transfer belt conveyor.

An  air  compressor  is  installed  in  the  crushing  plant.  It  supplies  the  service  and instrumentation air for the crushing area and the fine ore bin.

All equipment of the crushing area, with the exception of the belt conveyors, is mounted on trailers and is mobile.

## 17.1.4 Two-Stage DMS Circuit

The  fine  mineralized  material  from  the  crushing  circuit  is  collected  and  stored  in  a (510 m ) fine ore bin. Material from the fine ore bin is conveyed by bucket elevator and 3 conveyor belt to the DMS feed preparation screen with a 0.5 mm aperture. The undersize material  from  the  preparation  screen  is  pumped  to  the  DMS  fine  product  dewatering cyclone, which feeds the grinding circuit prior to flotation.

<!-- image -->

The oversize material from the DMS preparation screen flows by gravity to the first stage oversized  product  collector  tank,  where  it  is  combined  with  the  dense  media  from  the circulating  media  primary  distributor.  The  combined  slurry  feeds  the  first  stage  DMS cyclones  by  gravity.  The  first  DMS  stage  serves  to  remove  petalite  in  the  cyclone overflow. The dense media SG in the first stage is 2.65.

The underflow from the cyclones flows by gravity to the DMS separation screen, where the  coarse  concentrate  product  is  separated  from  the  dense  media  and  washed.  The washed  coarse  product  is  then  sent  to  the  second  DMS  stage  by  bucket  elevator.  The dense  media  from  the  front  end  of  the  separation  screen  is  collected  in  the  first  stage circulating media tank. The diluted media from the discharge end of the separation screen is  collected  and  sent  to  the  diluted  media  tank  for  dense  media  recovery  by  magnetic separation and returned to the DMS circuit.

The  cyclone  overflow  product  is  separated  and  washed  in  the  same  manner  as  the underflow. The coarse washed overflow product is sent to the DMS tailings hopper.

The washed underflow product from the first stage is collected in the second DMS stage cyclone feed hopper, where it is combined with dense media from the second stage media distributor. The dense media SG in the second DMS stage is controlled at 3.0. The second stage overflow and underflow products are separated and washed in the same manner as in  the  first  stage.  The  coarse  washed  underflow  product  is  sent  to  the  concentrate conveyor  belt,  where  it  is  combined  with  the  flotation  concentrate  and  stockpiled  for subsequent transportation to the refinery. The coarse washed overflow product contains a sufficient  amount  of  lithium,  and  therefore,  is  sent  to  the  grinding  circuit  for  further lithium recovery by flotation.

A  portion  of  the  dense  media  from  the  second  stage  circulating  media  distributor  is diverted to a Multotec tube densifier to ensure that the circulating media does not become too  diluted  over  time.  The  densified  media  is  returned  to  the  second  stage  circulating media tank, where a portion is sent to the first stage circulating media tank. The media densities in the first and second stage media circulating tanks are adjusted by the addition of water. The media used is ferrosilicon.

## 17.1.5 Grinding and Classification Circuit

The coarse washed overflow product from the second DMS stage is fed to a one-hour capacity rod mill feed bin. The rod mill feed is fed to a 450 HP (335 kW) rod mill with an F80 and P80 of 6,500 µm and 375 µm, respectively. The rod mill product discharges into the rod mill pump box which feeds a classification cyclone. The underflow of the DMS fine product dewatering cyclone also reports by gravity to the classification cyclone. The classification  cyclone  underflow  is  fed  by  gravity  to  a  500  HP  ball  mill  with  a  P80  of 345 µm and a P80 of 200 µm. The ball mill product discharges into the rod mill pump

<!-- image -->

box, which in turn feeds the classification cyclone. The classification cyclone overflow reports to the first desliming cyclone pump box.

## 17.1.6 Desliming and Flotation Circuits

The grinding circuit classification cyclone overflow is pumped to the first stage desliming cyclones,  which  have  a  cut  size  of  about  45  µm.  The  cyclone  overflow  is  sent  to  the slimes tailings thickener. The cyclone underflow flows by gravity to the mica flotation conditioning tank where the mica collector, namely Armac C, and fuel oil are added. The conditioning tank feeds a bank of five (5) mica rougher flotation cells. The mica rougher tails flow by gravity to a bank of seven (7) mica scavenger flotation cells. Both the mica rougher  concentrate  and  mica  scavenger  concentrate  are  pumped  to  the  mica  cleaner flotation conditioning tank where additional collector is added. The mica cleaner flotation conditioning  tank  feeds  a  bank  of  seven  (7)  mica  cleaner  cells.  The  mica  cleaner concentrate  is  pumped  to  the  spodumene  rougher  tailings  pump  box.  Both  the  mica scavenger  and  cleaner  tails  are  dewatered  through  of  a  cluster  of  five  (5)  250  mm cyclones and sent to the spodumene flotation circuit.

The dewatered scavenger and cleaner tails from the mica flotation circuit are scrubbed in an  attrition  scrubber  and  then  de-slimed  in  the  second  stage  desliming  cyclones.  The overflow  from  second  stage  desliming  is  sent  to  the  slimes  tailings  thickener.  The thickened underflow is pumped to flotation tails holding tank for subsequent filtration. The  underflow  from  the  second  stage  desliming  cyclones  flows  by  gravity  to  a  high density (65% solids) conditioning tank where spodumene collector (LR19) is added. The conditioned slurry is pumped to a bank of five (5) spodumene rougher flotation cells. The rougher tails are pumped to a dewatering cyclone and then to the flotation tails holding tank for subsequent filtration in a pressure filter. The filtered tails are conveyed to the tailings hopper along with DMS tails. The combined tails are then transported by truck to the waste stockpile.

The  rougher  spodumene  concentrate  is  pumped  to  a  bank  of  four  (4)  cleaner  flotation cells, where additional collector is added. The pH is controlled by the addition of sodium carbonate. The first cleaner tails are dewatered and returned to the attrition scrubber. The first cleaner concentrate is pumped to a second cleaning stage. The second cleaning stage tails  are  also  dewatered  and  returned  to  the  attrition  scrubber,  while  the  second  stage cleaner  concentrate  is  pumped  to  a  wet  LIMS  magnetic  separator  to  remove  iron.  The final concentrate is then filtered by belt filter and stockpiled along with DMS concentrate for subsequent transportation to the refinery.

## 17.1.7 General Concentrator Plant Services

## a) Compressed Air

Two (2) 1,500 scfm air compressors (one operating and the other on standby) will provide compressed air for the tailings filter press, instrument air, and other plant services. A desiccant dryer of equivalent capacity is also included. An air blower will provide air for the mica and spodumene flotation circuit.

## b) Freshwater and Process Water

Fresh  water  will  be  sourced  from  a  well.  Fresh  water  will  be  used  to  provide makeup water for the process water tank and to meet clean water requirements for the concentrator. Clean water will be stored in a separate clean water tank, which will  also  include  filtered  process  water.  The  clean  water  will  be  used  for  gland seals, reagent preparation (flocculants and dispersants) and firewater.

## c) Fire Protection

Approximately 760,000 litres (757.1 m ) of clean water from the clean water tank is 3 reserved  for  firefighting.  The  clean  water  tank  is  equipped  with  a  fire  water circulation pump to ensure fire water is readily available.

## 17.2 Hydrometallurgical Processing Plant

Based on the metallurgical testing results described in Section 13, the hydrometallurgical plant process design criteria, process flow sheets, equipment list as well as plant layouts were  prepared  for  a  plant  feed  rate  of  213,558  t/y  of  spodumene  concentrate.  The following section summarizes the process developed for the Project.

The  spodumene  concentrate  will  be  transported  by  train  approximately  700  km  to  the hydrometallurgical  plant  located  in  Valleyfield,  Quebec.  The  hydrometallurgical  plant processing activities include decrepitation, acid roasting, leaching, purification, electrodialysis, crystallization, precipitation, drying  and  packaging  of  the  different products.

## 17.2.1 Plant Design Criteria

The hydrometallurgical process plant is scheduled to operate 365 days per year, seven (7) day per week and 24 hours per day. The plant availability is estimated at 93%.

The hydrometallurgical process plant is designed for a feed capacity of about 26.2 t/h of spodumene concentrate, resulting in a lithium carbonate powder average production rate of  10,000  tonnes  per  year  and  a  lithium  hydroxide  monohydrate  crystals  average production  rate of 20,734  tonnes  per year. The  overall lithium recovery  of the hydrometallurgical circuit is 88.6%.

<!-- image -->

The  hydrometallurgical  plant  feed  consists  of  a  blend  of  dense  media  separation concentrate and flotation concentrate. The concentrates characteristics are included in the design criteria summary presented in Table 17.2.

POND

## b) Process Description

- i) Concentrate Reception and Conversion

The  spodumene  concentrate  is  transported  from  the  mine  and  concentrator site  to  the  hydrometallurgical  process  plant  in  90-tonne  railcars  (100  short tons). Deliveries are expected approximately every three (3) days (eight (8) railcars per delivery).

The concentrate is discharged from one (1) railcar at a time into a receiving hopper. A reclaim conveyor transports the concentrate from the hopper to a bucket elevator.

The  concentrate  discharges  into  one  (1)  of  two  (2)  bucket  elevators  that convey  the  concentrate  vertically  into  the  kiln  feed  silo.  A  diverter  chute allows the concentrate from either bucket elevator to fall onto the emergency

<!-- image -->

stockpile.  A  wheel  loader  is  used  to  reclaim  the  concentrate  from  the emergency  stockpile.  A  second  reclaim  hopper  and  conveyor  are  used  to convey  the  material  from  the  emergency  stockpile  back  to  the  bucket elevators. Only one (1) bucket elevator will be in operation at any given time. The second bucket elevator is used as a stand-by unit.

The  kiln  feed  silo  live  capacity  represents  eight  (8)  hours  of  continuous hydrometallurgical plant feed.

Two (2) belt feeders feed the concentrate from the silo to the kiln feed belt conveyor.  This  belt  conveyor  is  equipped  with  a  belt  scale  to  monitor  and control concentrate feed to the hydrometallurgical plant.

The concentrate falls into a screw conveyor that will distribute the concentrate in an even layer into the spodumene conversion kiln.

The  natural  gas  fired  rotary  kiln  heats  the  spodumene  to  approximately 1,050°C. The high temperature converts the spodumene concentrate from the alpha  crystalline  structure  to  the  beta  crystalline  structure.  Unlike  alphaspodumene, beta-spodumene is amenable to acid roasting and water leaching.

A flash cooler uses ambient air to cool the beta-spodumene to approximately 200°C.

The acid roaster is a continuous paddle-type mixer. The mixer is constructed of Inconel®,  a type of superalloy resistant to high temperatures and corrosion.

Sulphuric  acid  is  sprayed  onto  the  beta-spodumene  in  the  roaster  with  a stoichiometric excess of 30%. The resulting reaction produces solid lithium sulphate and aluminum silicates.

## ii) Concentrate Leach and Primary Impurity Removal

The solid lithium sulphate and the gangue material fall into the concentrate leach tank via a chute. Wash water from a downstream belt filter, which may contain lithium sulphate, as well as a weak lithium sulphate solution from the downstream  electrodialysis  process  are  also  fed  to  the  tank  in  order  to produce a 50 % (w/w) feed slurry. Lithium sulphate, being soluble in water under these conditions, will dissolve, along with any other sulphates produced during the roasting step (iron sulphate, aluminum sulphate, sodium sulphate etc.). The slurry discharges from the tank by overflow into the first Primary Impurity Removal (' PIR ') tank.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

There are three (3) PIR tanks arranged in series and overflowing one (1) into the other.

An hydrated lime slurry is fed to the PIR tanks to precipitate out impurities such as iron and aluminum in the form of insoluble hydroxides.

The discharge of the PIR tanks is pumped to the downstream belt filter. The PIR belt filter dewaters and washes the PIR residues in order to recover as much  lithium  sulphate-rich  filtrate  as  possible.  Five  (5)  washing  steps  are performed.

The belt filter cake, which consists mainly of aluminum silicate, is conveyed outside  the  plant  building  where  it  is  stockpiled  in  anticipation  of  future marketable possibilities.

## iii) Secondary Impurity Removal

In the Secondary  Impurity  Removal  (' SIR ') tanks, the pH  is  further increased to precipitate even more dissolved metals as solid hydroxides and carbonates. The PIR belt filter filtrate is pumped to the first SIR tank along with lithium hydroxide solutions recovered from the downstream  ion exchange  and  electrodialysis processes. Lithium hydroxide reacts with dissolved  manganese  and  zinc  ions  which  will  precipitate  as  insoluble hydroxides.

A  sodium  carbonate  solution  is  fed  to  the  third  SIR  tank.  The  sodium carbonate will react with dissolved calcium and magnesium ions, precipitating as carbonates which are also insoluble.

The discharge slurry is pumped to a centrifuge to remove the solid impurities from  the  lithium  solution.  The  solid  residue  is  directed  to  the  tailings.  The filtrate is pumped to the SIR product tank. The solution is pumped to a selfcleaning fabric filter where the solids smaller than five (5) microns, and any solids that have precipitated after the centrifuge, are removed.

The filtrate is stored in the ion exchange feed tank before it is pumped to the next cleaning process.

## iv) Ion Exchange

The final lithium sulphate solution cleaning step is performed by three (3) ion exchange columns in a round-robin configuration. Solution is fed to two (2) columns  in  series  (the  lead  column  and  the  lag  column)  while  the  third  is being cleaned/stripped/regenerated. When the lead column is saturated with

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

contaminants, it is brought offline to undergo the cleaning/stripping/ regeneration processes. Meanwhile, the lag column becomes the lead column while the third column which was on stand-by becomes the lag column.

Diluted HCl will be used as the column stripping agent while diluted LiOH recovered from the downstream LiOH-H2O crystallization process is used as the regeneration agent.

Clean lithium sulphate solution discharging from the columns is stored in the LiOH feed tank. Waste solutions from the column stripping step are collected in  the  IX  residue  tank  and  pumped  to  the  tailings  tank  for  disposal.  Waste solutions from the column regeneration step are collected in the regeneration solution tank and metered back to the first SIR tank.

## v) LiOH Membrane Electrodialysis

Membrane  electrodialysis  is  used  to  convert  lithium  sulphate  to  lithium hydroxide.

The  electrodialysis  cell  consists  of  an  anode,  a  cathode  and  a  series  of cationic,  anionic  and  bipolar  membranes  in  between.  The  lithium-sulphate rich  solution  is  fed  to  the  compartments  between  the  anionic  and  cationic membranes. An electric current is applied across the cell causing positive ions to  cross  the  cationic  membrane  and  negative  ions  the  anionic  membrane. Meanwhile, a weak sulphuric acid solution is fed to the compartment between the anionic  membrane  and  the  bipolar  membrane  and  a  weak  lithium hydroxide solution is fed to the space between the cationic membrane and the bipolar membrane.

In  total,  it  is  estimated  that  80  cells  are  required  to  convert  the  lithium sulphate solution to lithium hydroxide. The electrodialysis cells and ancillary equipment will draw approximately of 25.1 MW/h of electrical power.

A  portion  of  the  LiOH  solution  is  directed  toward  the  lithium  carbonate production circuit)  to  produce  the  required  10,000  t/y  of  lithium  carbonate. The remaining solution is pumped to the LiOH-H2O crystallization circuit.

The  by-products  of  the  electrodialysis  process  are  a  weak  solution  of sulphuric acid and a spent solution of lithium sulphate. The sulphuric acid is neutralized as solid gypsum and the lithium sulphate solution is recycled to the concentrate leach tank.

## vi) LiOH-H2O Crystallization

The crystallization circuit produces lithium hydroxide monohydrate crystals from the lithium hydroxide solution generated through electrodialysis.

The crystallization circuit consists of a two-stage mechanical vapor recompression  falling  film  evaporator  followed  by  a  single-effect  steamdriven forced circulation crystallizer.

The LiOH solution feed is pre-heated and enters the evaporation circuit where a concentrated LiOH solution is produced. Evaporated water is recovered as distilled water and recycled to the plant.

The  concentrated  LiOH  solution  feeds  the  crystallizer.  This  unit  removes water from the incoming feed, which causes the precipitation of LiOH-H2O crystals.  The  remaining  liquor  is  purged  from  the  system.  This  purged solution replaces the NaOH solution that would normally be purchased to be used  in  the  IX  circuit  for  resin  regeneration  and  in  the  SIR  circuit  for  pH control. The excess purge is directed toward the lithium carbonate production circuit. The evaporated water is recovered as distilled water and recycled to the plant.

The LiOH-H2O crystal grade is expected to be around 16.4 % Li (w/w). The crystals are separated from the mother liquor in a centrifuge.

## vii) LiOH-H2O Drying and Packaging

The LiOH-H2O crystals coming out the centrifuge are dried before the final packaging step. A flash drying system using indirect heating with natural gas will be used.

A robot operated system is used to package the crystals into one (1) tonne bags. Around 61 bags per day will be produced.

## viii) Li2CO3 Precipitation

The  feed  to  the  lithium  carbonate  production  circuit  comes  from  two  (2) sources:  lithium  hydroxide  from  the  electrodialysis  circuit  and  sodium-rich lithium hydroxide solution from the crystallization circuit purge.

The Li2CO3 production process is carried out in two (2) steps. The first step is called the Lithium hydroxide Carbonization (' LC ') or it may be referred to as  the  lithium  carbonate  precipitation  step.  The  second  step  is  called  the lithium bicarbonate decomposition step (' DC ').

<!-- image -->

The LC step is carried out in a single tank. Carbon dioxide is injected at the bottom  of  the  tank  to  react  with  lithium  hydroxide,  producing  lithium carbonate.

The  slurry  is  pumped  to  a  decanter.  The  decanter  overflow  containing  a lithium  bicarbonate  by-product  is  fed  to  the  second  step.  The  decanter underflow contains the precipitated lithium carbonate and is pumped to a belt filter feed tank.

In  the  DC  step,  the  lithium  bicarbonate  solution  is  heated  to  95ºC  using reactors installed in series. The tanks are jacketed and heated with steam.

The slurry from the DC step is pumped to a decanter. The decanter overflow is directed towards the water treatment system. The decanter underflow joins the LC decanter underflow in the belt filter feed tank.

A vacuum belt filter is used to dewater the lithium carbonate slurry. The belt filter cake falls by gravity to the flash dryer. The belt filter filtrate is returned to the decomposition step to convert any unreacted lithium bicarbonate into lithium carbonate.

## ix) Li2CO3 Drying, Pulverization and Packaging

A flash drying system using indirect heating with natural gas dries the lithium carbonate final product.

The dried product is transferred to a jet mill. The jet mill uses high pressure air to pulverize the lithium carbonate to a P80 of about five (5) microns.

A  robot  operated  system  is  used  to  package  the  Li2CO3  into  25  kg  bags. Around 1,178 bags per day will be produced.

## x) Gypsum Precipitation and Disposal

The  weak  sulfuric  acid  solution  coming  from  the  electrodialysis  circuit  is neutralized  with  hydrated  lime  to  produce  gypsum.  The  gypsum  slurry  is pumped to a thickener.

The thickener overflow is directed towards the water treatment system while the  underflow is pumped to the gypsum tailings pond. A dedicated pond is planned  to  be  used  for  the  gypsum  tailings  because  of  future  gypsum marketable  possibilities.  Water  recovered  from  the  pond  is  recycled  to  the plant's water treatment system.

<!-- image -->

- xi) Tailings Disposal

Tailings from the SIR circuit and most of the plant sumps are collected in the SIR tailings tank. Lime is added to neutralize the tailings.

The  tank's  content  is  pumped  to  a  thickener.  The  thickener  overflow  is directed towards the water treatment system while the underflow is pumped to  the  SIR  tailings  pond.  Water  recovered  from  the  pond  is  recycled  to  the plant's water treatment system.

## xii) Reagents

- -Hydrated Lime

Quicklime is purchased in bulk and stored on site in a 200 tonnes capacity silo.  A  slaker  is  used  to  prepare  hydrated  lime.  Lime  is  used  to  control  the SIR tailings pH, precipitate gypsum and precipitate iron in the PIR tanks.

- -Soda Ash

Soda ash is purchased in one (1) tonne bags and delivered to the mixing tank using a screw feeder followed by an eductor. Approximately 1.3 bags of soda ash are required daily. Soda ash is used to precipitate calcium and magnesium in the SIR circuit.

- -Hydrochloric Acid

Hydrochloric  acid  is  delivered  in  tanker  trucks  and  unloaded  into  a  single storage tank. The acid is purchased undiluted at a concentration of 32 % (w/w). Hydrochloric acid is used in the IX circuit for stripping the resin.

- -Sulfuric Acid

Sulfuric  acid  is  also  delivered  in  tanker  trucks  and  unloaded  into  a  single heated tank located outside the building. Sulfuric acid is purchased at a 93 % concentration and is used at this strength. The only requirement for sulfuric acid is for the acid roasting step.

- xiii) Services
- -Cooling Water

A  1,050  m /h  capacity  tower  is  required  to  provide  cooling  water  to  the 3 electrodialysis circuit and crystallization circuits.

<!-- image -->

## -Steam

A 1,400 HP boiler provides steam at 30 psig and 134 ºC. A total of about 21,500  kg/h  of  steam  is  required  for  the  crystallization  circuit  and  the decomposition reactors.

## -Compressed Air

Two (2) high pressure air compressors (one in operation and one stand-by) provide instrument and plant air for all users throughout the plant. Only the jet mill requires a dedicated air compressor. The main instrument air users are the various dust collection systems and the instruments. Plant air is required in the PIR tanks and for the utility stations.

## -Natural Gas

Natural  gas  is  used  to  fire  the  kiln  burner  and  both  dryer  burners.  No  gas storage is planned on site. Natural gas will be supplied by Gaz Metro from a connection  to  their  existing  network.  Overall  gas  consumption  is  about 3,200 m /h. 3

## xiv) Water Management

## -Process Water

Process  water  comes  from  the  PIR  belt  filter  washes  two  (2)  to  five  (5). Process water can be used for reagents preparation (lime and soda ash), for washing  the  SIR  centrifuge  cake  and  backwashing  the  SIR  self-cleaning filter. The excess process water is pumped to the water treatment system.

## -Distilled Water

Distilled water consists of the condensate from the crystallization circuit. The distilled water is at a higher temperature than all the other sources of water (higher than 50 ºC).

Distilled water users are the PIR belt wash water make-up, the boiler makeup and the lithium carbonate belt filter cake and belt wash water. A make-up from the purified water tank is required to meet the distilled water demand.

## -Purified Water

Many  sources  of  water  and  process  solutions  are  collected  in  the  water treatment feed tank. The gypsum, SIR tailings and decomposition thickeners overflows  are  collected  in  this  tank  along  with  the  IX  residue,  the  spent Li2SO4 from electrodialysis and the Li2CO3 cake wash water.

<!-- image -->

This water is first treated using a potable water treatment system. The potable water is then fed to a purified water treatment system that consists of reverse osmosis. To meet the purified water requirements, potable water from the city of  Valleyfield  is  used  as  make-up  water  and  is  fed  to  the  purified  water treatment system.

Purified  water  is  used  in  the  acid  roaster  scrubber,  the  IX  circuit,  the electrodialysis circuit and the belt filters vacuum pumps.

The  concentrate  from  the  reverse  osmosis  system  is  directed  to  the  city  of Valleyfield's sewage system.

## 18.0 PROJECT INFRASTRUCTURE

The  mine  and  the  concentrator  infrastructures  will  be  located  at  Whabouchi  and  are described in Sections 18.1 to 18.9. The hydrometallurgical infrastructures will be located at Valleyfield and are described in Section 18.10.

## 18.1 Whabouchi General Site Plan

Two  different  scale  plans  have  been  issued  for  the  Project:  Drawing  No.°3073002°0010000-41-D20-0001, to a scale of 1 / 7,500, presents the overall area where the mining Project is to be undertaken and Drawing No.°3073002°-0010000 41-D20-0002, to a scale of  1/1,250,  showing  the  processing  plant  and  related  infrastructures  more  precisely, including the office and mining garage area plus the related services for water supply and sewage  disposal  and  the  surrounding  hauling  and  service  roads.  Both  drawings  are presented in Appendix A.

They  contain  the  topographic  information  from  LIDAR  laser  mapping  technology provided for the Project by Nemaska Lithium.

The site is accessible by the Route du Nord , which also leads to the existing base camp that the Owner intends to use for both construction and operation purposes.

The camp site is about 12 km from the site toward the west and the Nemiscau airport is another 7 km farther away.

All  mining  activities  will  be  concentrated  in  a  75  hectares  area;  area  delimited  by  the Route du Nord to the north, the UTM 5,724,500 mN, NAD83 Zone 18 to the south, the Des Montagnes Lake to the west and the Spodumene Lake to the east.

## 18.1.1 The Route du Nord Public Road

The Route du Nord is  actually located just outside a 500 metres safe distance from the open pit.

This road is scheduled to be relocated north of the Phase II waste rock pile, as shown on drawing No°3073002°-001000-41-D20-0001. This relocation will require approximately 2.1 kilometres of new road to be built.

## 18.1.2 Mine Service and Hauling Roads

The  site  hauling  roads  were  designed  for  Cat  772  with  an  82,100  kg  target  operating weight. The quantities required for building those roads were established based on draft profiles for each of the three (3) sections of mining road. Those profiles were determined

<!-- image -->

based  on  the  roads  not  exceeding  a  maximum  slope  of  8  %.  To  suit  the  Cat  772 dimensions, those mining roads have been designed to be 17 metres wide.

The quantities of fill required to construct the service roads were established the same way using a standard AASHO-H20 highway live load. All service roads were designed to be ten (10) metres wide.

## 18.1.3 Service Buildings

The service buildings are to include a gate house, an administration office, and a mine management and engineering office, all located along the site access road.

The gate house will be used to monitor pedestrian and all vehicle access to the site. A control gate will be operated by a security guard.

The  administration  and  the  mine  management  offices  are  proposed  to  be  connected together for easier personnel circulation and access to all three (3) conference rooms.

The first sector will mostly be reserved for administration purposes and will house such services as the computer servers and technicians, the environmental department, the first aid  clinic  and  finally,  the  general  manager's  and  the  human  resources  offices.  The administration office will include an 18-person conference room.

The  second  office  building  will  be  the  main  gateway  for  the  mine  personnel,  with changing  and  lunch  room  facilities.  The  mine  superintendent  and  foreman  offices  will also be located within this complex, as well as two (2) adjacent conference rooms that could be used for staff training and coordination meetings. The mine garage area is easily accessible from this complex within a 25 metres distance. Finally, the same office unit will house the technical department, including the engineering and surveyor personnel, as well as the geology experts.

## 18.1.4 Maintenance Garage and Warehouse

As discussed previously, the garage building is to be located at an easy walking distance from the service buildings and personnel parking lot.

The garage will  be  used  for  servicing  the  mine  equipment  in  addition  to  other  mobile equipment.  The  garage  will  be  equipped  with  overhead  cranes,  tools,  air  compressors, lubricants, and will house the following facilities:

- · Two (2) maintenance bays for the mine trucks and other large mobile equipment;
- · One (1) large equipment wash bay;
- · One (1) light-vehicle maintenance bay.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

As for the 270 m  adjacent warehouse, it will have shelving that is arranged to maximize 2 storage  space.  The  warehouse  will  have  access  to  the  equipment  maintenance  area through an internal door.

Apart from the maintenance staff changing-room and kitchen, the garage complex will also house three (3) offices for the garage management personnel, i.e., the superintendent, the foreman and the maintenance clerk.

## 18.1.5 Fresh Water Supply

It  is  foreseen  that  fresh  and  fire  water  will  be  supplied  to  the  site  from  wells  since  the process and domestic water demand is relatively low, basically under 6 m  per hour. 3

It is otherwise expected that the process itself will need to be fed about 20 m /h for start3 up purposes. This is the basic flow rate that is being retained for the fresh water supply source.

## 18.1.6 Sewage Treatment

At the site, sewage treatment facilities will be built for all three (3) centers of operation: the administration buildings, the maintenance garage and the concentrator.

Without  shower  facilities  on  site,  as  it  had  been  directed  by  Nemaska  Lithium  at  the beginning of the study, the unit water demand of 75 litres per person per day has been used to establish the amount of sewage to be treated daily.

Once the manpower requirement was established, it was found that the largest producer of waste water would be the administration/mine offices, but with a limited quantity of 3.75 m  per day. 3

A maximum quantity of 9.25 m  per day is expected to be generated by the entire site. 3

As  the  geotechnical  investigation  report  L-11-1452  from  Journeaux  Assoc.  dated December 2011 demonstrated, some locations  on  the  site  may  be  suitable  for  seepage field  operations.  The  preliminary  design  of  all  sewage  disposal  installations  has  been based on that simple technology. It is expected that the construction of three (3) septic tanks  and  seepage  fields  would  be  less  expensive  than  a  9.25  m   per  day  modular 3 treatment plant.

Other PLCs will be supplied with some of the main equipment (crushers, filters, etc.).

The central SCADA system will be able to control and supervise the remote equipment, but during communication outages, the equipment will be controlled locally.

## 18.2.3 Cabling Strategy between PLC Panels and Instruments

The  cabling  strategy  used  between  the  PLC  panels  and  instruments  assumes  that  the instruments are wired to Remote I/O or PLC. The average distance from instruments to Remote I/O used in the estimate is 30 metres.

## 18.2.4 SCADA

The  SCADA  is  based  on  client/server  technology  and  will  be  comprised  of  two  (2) SCADA  servers  for  redundancy,  four  (4)  main  SCADA  operators  and  six  (6)  local operation clients throughout the plant.

<!-- image -->

## 18.2.5 SCADA and PLC Power Sources

In case of plant power loss, a diesel generator will provide emergency power to different electric  loads  throughout  the  plant.  PCS,  switches,  main  servers,  phone  system,  and security  systems  will  be  fed  by  a  UPS.  These  UPS  systems  will  be  powered  from  the emergency power.

UPS used for the Control System will be monitored using SNMP Ethernet protocol.

## 18.2.6 Redundancy

For the automation network, the ring shall offer a second route in case of a communication outage on one (1) segment.

## 18.2.7 Process Analog Instruments

Process  analog  instruments  will,  whenever  possible,  support  HART  protocol  and  they will be wired to analog inputs/outputs of the process controller by means of traditional 4-20 mA loops.

## 18.3 Communication System (Local and External)

## 18.3.1 Telecommunication Guidelines

The  telecommunication  system  will  be  based  on  Ethernet  links  throughout  the  plant buildings and administrative buildings.

A single-mode fibre optic backbone will be deployed to accommodate both automation and corporate services on the same cable. For remote sites, a Wimax link will transport automation and corporate services. For short cable runs, a CAT6 cable will be used. The CAT6 cable will be armored when installed in an instrumentation cable tray.

## 18.3.2 Telecommunication Systems

A mobile radio system will be provided for the construction and operation phase covering the mine site, the construction site and the unloading area. This system is provided by a telecom tower and a telecommunications shelter hosting all the communication equipment.  An  IP  phone  system  will  be  provided  at  the  beginning  of  the  construction phase.

The telecommunication systems will include:

## 18.3.3 Telecommunication Services

The site will be connected to an Internet Service Provider (' ISP ') via a microwave link to the Relais routier Nemiscau (12 km west of the main facility), expected to be available by June 2014. The microwave link will be supplied and maintained by the ISP. For the PEA Study, the bandwidth costs have been evaluated with 5 Mbps for the first year and then ten (10) Mbps for the next two (2) years on a 3-year contract basis.

A backup system will  use  a  cellular  modem.  The  current  cellular  coverage  allows  the usage of the 4G technology.

The IP PBX phone system will be connected to an Internet Telephone Service Provider (' ITSP ').

## 18.3.4 Telecommunications Distribution

During the construction phase, all communication services, such as Internet and phone, will  be  distributed  via  Wi-Fi,  Wimax  and  Microwave point-to-point radios to reach all buildings.  All  mine  trucks  and  pick-ups  will  be  equipped  with  a  Wimax/WiFi  antenna that shall also act as a WiFi local access point.

A fibre optic link will be extended from the process plant to the administrative offices, to the mine garage and to the main tower using the 25 kV distribution lines or underground trenches.

## 18.3.5 Corporate Network

A corporate Ethernet backbone at 1 Gbps in a star type topology will be deployed for the process and security video broadcast distribution, the IP phone system and the corporate network applications.

All the major network equipment will be located in dedicated server rooms located in the administrative office, the telecom shelter and in the control room (or main substation). For  the  feasibility study,  the administrative  server  room  itself  will  reside  in  the administration offices.

Corporate services are:

- · Wired/wireless phones and phone system;

## 18.6 Water Supply and Fire Protection

Fresh  and  fire  water  will  be  supplied  to  the  buildings  from  a  new  well.  A  pumping station,  with  two  (2)  electric  pumps,  will  draw  water  from  the  well  to  a  760,000  litres capacity reservoir used for fire protection services located at the concentrator. The fire water pumping station will include one (1) electrical pump complete with jockey pump and one (1) emergency diesel powered pump.

<!-- image -->

Design  provides  for  a  plant-wide  fire  protection  system,  including  all  electrical  rooms and other high risk areas. Final design will confirm fire protection in further detail, in order  to  conform  to  local  regulations  along  with  the  Insurer's  requirements.  The  fire water  will  be  distributed  through  an  independent  underground  and  heat  traced  piping system. Fire hydrants will be located on-site along access roads, allowing for easy access in the event of an emergency.

At  the  fire  water  entrance  of  each  building,  a  post  indicating  valve  and  Siamese connection will be provided. Fire cabinets, complete with 1½' fire hose, will be located at every level and throughout the building at 30 m intervals. Fire cabinets, complete with 2½' fire hose connections, will be located in all stairwells at every level, including roof level. For extra hazard in heated or unheated areas, wet or dry sprinkler systems will be provided.  Special  pre-action,  double  interlock  detection  systems  will  be  provided  for electrical rooms.

The fire alarm system will consist of a panel located in the guardhouse, with detectors and  manual  stations  installed  to  cover  all  of  the  different  areas.  Alarm  signals  will  be automatically transmitted to the security station. There will be emergency meeting places to be designated in the event of a fire alarm, along with evacuation routes and procedures. Fire extinguishers will be included in fire cabinets and will be required in certain areas such as offices, laboratory, warehouse, lunch rooms, and fuel stations. Hot work permits will be required for maintenance on rubber lined equipment.

## 18.7 Power Supply and Distribution

## 18.7.1 Power Line, Main Substation and Electrical Distribution

The  total  power  demand  of  the  Project  was  determined  to  be  approximately  7.5  MW, based  on  the  estimated  connected  load,  running  load  and  running  power.  Table  18.1 shows the power demand breakdown by sector.

Table 18.1 - Estimated Total Project Power Demand

| Area                  |   Power Demand (MW) |
|-----------------------|---------------------|
| Crushing              |                0.85 |
| Processing            |                3.42 |
| Infrastructure        |                2.41 |
| Network Loss (2%)     |                0.13 |
| Power Demand Subtotal |                6.82 |
| Security Factor (10%) |                0.68 |
| Total Power Demand    |                7.5  |

Note: The power demand was calculated using an average efficiency factor, load factor and diversity factor.

<!-- image -->

The Whabouchi Project will get its power from the Hydro-Québec Albanel substation. From  that  point,  a  new  25  kV  overhead  power  line  will  be  built  over  approximately 20 km and will terminate at a new outdoor substation. At this substation, the incoming voltage  will  be  stepped  down  to  a  distribution  voltage  of  4.16  kV  through  one 10/13 MVA transformer. The transformer will feed a 5-kV switchgear.

The 5-kV switchgear is located indoors in the pre-fabricated electrical room and provides power to:

- · The Administration/Garage area through an overhead 5-kV line;
- · The primary, secondary and tertiary crushing package;
- · A MV MCC;
- · A capacitor bank to improve the power factor to 95%;
- · Three (3) 2-MVA unit substations that generate the 600 V.

There  is  no  electrical  distribution  to  and  within  the  mine,  as  all  mining  equipment, including pumps, will be powered from diesel motors.

The rod and ball mills have the biggest motors on this Project, at 500 HP each, and are driven by a 5-kV variable frequency drive equipped with an active front end to minimize the  generation  of  harmonics  onto  the  electrical  system,  for  which  the  electrical  supply utility has very strict limits.

## 18.7.2 Emergency Generators

Emergency power will be provided at 600 V by a 1 MW diesel powered generator. The following process equipment will operate on emergency power:

- · Auxiliary services of bigger motors of the plant;
- · Tank agitators;
- · Thickener rake;
- · Sump pumps;
- · Partial heating/lighting;
- · Communication and control equipment.

## 18.8 Effluent Water Treatment

At the time of this Report, the only effluent considered for water treatment in the Project is the effluent water produced during truck wash at the mine garage. The wash effluent is collected and treated along with the effluent for sanitary treatment.

<!-- image -->

## 18.9 Camp Accommodations

A construction camp and a permanent camp are required for the Project. These two (2) camps will be built at the location of the Compagnie de Construction et Développement Cri Ltée (' CCDC ') site. The CCDC Ltée will be mandated for the two (2) camps and all required services.

Initially,  the  permanent  camp  will  be  used  as  a  construction  camp.  An  additional construction  camp  (to  accommodate  the  expected  peak  workforce)  will  be  built  as  an extension  to  the  permanent  camp.  In  total,  125  rooms  in  the  permanent  camp  and 90 rooms in the additional construction camp will be built for a total of 215 rooms.

The common areas of the permanent camp, such as the kitchen and the recreational areas will be used by the residents of the construction camp. Thus, the kitchen capacity in the permanent  camp  is  able  to  accommodate  the  additional  load  of  the  peak  construction workforce. Outdoor pathways will be in place to connect the permanent camp with the construction camp. The permanent camp will be in place in April 2014 and will be the first to be used. The additional construction camp will be built for September 2014 and will be used until the end of the construction and commissioning period.

## 18.9.1 Site Location

The CCDC site designated for the construction camp and the permanent camp is located at the Relais routier Nemiscau (km 291 of Route du Nord ), approximately 12 km west of the Whabouchi Project site. Employees will be transported daily by bus.

## 18.10 Valleyfield Plant Infrastructure

This  section  summarizes  infrastructure  such  as  power  line,  site  roads,  concentrate  rail load  out,  site  buildings,  tailings  storage  facilities  and  site  services  that  are  required  to complement the processing of spodumene  concentrate at the Hydrometallurgical Processing Plant.

<!-- image -->

All topographic information for the location of infrastructure was gathered from readily available data from the City of Valleyfield, including a geotechnical drilling investigation of  surrounding  land.  It  is  understood  that  a  LIDAR  based  topographic  map  will  be available for the Feasibility Study phase of the project.

Detailed geotechnical investigations will need to be performed in order to optimize civil design criteria related to the foundations of the hydrometallurgical process plant.

An overall general site layout and access plan is shown on Figure 18.1.

<!-- image -->

Figure: 18.1 - Overall General Site Layout and Access Plan

<!-- image -->

## 18.10.1 Power Line

The  Hydrometallurgical  Processing  Plant  will  be  fed  through  a  120  kV  overhead electrical power  line supplied and installed by Hydro-Québec  from  the  existing distribution point at the Langlois substation.

## 18.10.2 Site Roads

The Hydrometallurgical Processing Plant is accessible year-round without any interruption by the city's road network. The access road is located directly to the east of the property, off Des Érables Boulevard. A second access road is located in the southwestern corner of the site, off Gérard-Cadieux Boulevard. A single guard house will be used to monitor both access points.

Site and service roads will be eight (8) m wide and will provide access to:

- · Process facility from both city roads;
- · Aluminum silicate pile;
- · Shipping warehouse;
- · Warehouse.

## 18.10.3 Concentrate Transportation and Load-Out Facility

Concentrate  will  be  shipped  by  railcar  from  Chibougamau  to  the  hydrometallurgical processing plant. An existing CN railway runs along the western side of the site. Railcars will be diverted from the railway at the north-western corner of the site onto a new 600 m railway. This new railway will run in parallel to the SW limit of the site. The new railway will be doubled over a 250 m distance to facilitate railcar handling.

It is expected that deliveries of eight (8) 100-short ton railcars will be made every day. Railcars will be emptied from the bottom one (1) at a time over the concentrate receiving hopper.  The  hopper  is  equipped  with  a  feeder  that  directs  the  concentrate  onto  an unloading conveyor.

## 18.10.4 Tailings Storage Facilities

A  preliminary  assessment  of  tailings  disposal  requirements  to  store  and  manage  the tailings and process water was prepared for the hydrometallurgical processing plant.

Tailings storage design has been performed for the three (3) distinct plant tailings. The concentrate leach and PIR tailings will be stockpiled dry. The gypsum slurry produced by neutralizing the waste from the electrodialysis process will be stored in a dedicated pond. The remaining tailings will be stored in a second pond.

<!-- image -->

## a) Aluminum Silicate Pile

Concentrate  leach  and  PIR  tailings  (aluminum  silicates)  are  discarded  from  the Hydrometallurgical  Processing  Plant  as  a  cake  from  a  belt  filter.  They  will  be stockpiled on a pad outside. Pile sizing has been based on an annual production of 219,000  t/y  (dry)  of  tailings  with  a  27  %  moisture  content.  Design  criteria  were based on an assumed final density of 1.76 t/m  and a single year of storage. Since 3 aluminum silicate  is  a  marketable  product,  it  has  been  assumed  that  most  of  the aluminum silicate produced by the plant will be sold. Therefore, the total designed stockpile  capacity  is  170,000  m .  Provisions  for  a  200  by  120  m  pad  have  been 3 made in the north western corner of the site.

## b) Gypsum Storage Pond

Gypsum is produced as a by-product of the electrodialysis process. Gypsum slurry is  discarded from the Hydrometallurgical Processing Plant at a rate of 80,600 t/y (dry) with 50% moisture content.

Because gypsum is a marketable product, gypsum storage pond sizing was based on a  one  (1)  year  storage  capacity.  Design  criteria  were  based  on  an  assumed  final depositional density of 1.39 t/m  and a total tailings placement requirement of about 3 86,700  m .  The  water  volume  pumped  into  the  tailings  ponds  is  expected  to  be 3 240 m  per day. The tailings will retain about 50% of the pumped water while 50% 3 i.e. 120 m  per day will be available for reclaim. 3

Provisions for a 100 by 100 m pond have been made in the south eastern corner of the site.

## c) SIR Tailings Pond

The  SIR  Tailings  Pond  will  receive  the  balance  of  the  tailings  generated  by  the Hydrometallurgical Processing Plant at a rate of 2,200 t/y (dry) with 50% moisture content. The pond is sized to receive 20 years of tailings.

Design criteria were based on an assumed final depositional density of 1.47 t/m 3 and a total tailings placement requirement of about 44,000 m . The water volume 3 pumped into the tailings pond is expected to be 6.5 m  per day. The tailings will 3 retain  about  50%  of  the  pumped  water  while  50%  i.e.  3.3  m   per  day  will  be 3 available for reclaim.

Provisions for a 75 m by 75 m pond have been made in the south eastern corner of the site, north of the gypsum storage pond.

## 19.0 MARKET STUDIES AND CONTRACTS

This Section summarizes the key information from these studies about lithium markets two  (2)  market  studies.  These  studies  were  prepared,  one  (1)  by  SignumBOX  and  the other  by  Roskill  Consulting  Group  Ltd.  ('Roskill'),  independent  and  experienced consultants. SignumBOX was mandated to perform a market study to evaluate potential target markets for the lithium concentrate. Roskill was mandated to evaluate the battery grade lithium hydroxide market.

## 19.1 Lithium Hydroxide and Lithium Carbonate

In this Section, two (2) market study reports prepared for Nemaska are summarized. One called 'Battery grade lithium hydroxide Market Study', as of September 2012, by Roskill Consulting  Group  Limited  and  the  other  prepared  by  SignumBOX  Inteligencia  de Mercados, entitled 'Lithium Minerals Market', as of March 2012.

## 19.1.1 Introduction

Lithium  is  the  lightest  and  more  reactive  of  the  alkali  metals  and  reacts  with  water, oxygen, carbonate dioxide and nitrogen at room temperature. It is a soft white-grey metal and giving its high reactivity in nature, it is always present as a compound. Its natural characteristics  make  it  a  suitable  product  for  many  applications  in  several  industries. Some of the properties that allow lithium to be used in many different applications are: the highest specific heat capacity amongst solids, a high electro chemical potential, a low atomic mass and a low density.

Lithium occurs in pegmatites, brines, clay and ocean water, but only the one found in pegmatites and brines is commercially viable at current lithium prices.

## 19.1.2 Demand

The  following  sub-sections  will  cover  the  different  aspects  of  the  demand  for  lithium hydroxide and lithium carbonate and their outlook.

## a) Lithium Applications

Lithium is used in a vast range of applications that can be classified in two (2) main markets:

Technical application markets: These markets demand lithium minerals, with very specific requirements allowing for direct use of the ore, such as low iron content. The main markets for technical grade lithium minerals are glass and ceramic. As the spodumene mineral found in the Whabouchi deposit is of chemical grade focus

<!-- image -->

in this section  will  be  on  the  different  applications  related  to  the  chemical application markets.

Chemical  application  markets:    These  markets  require  different  common  lithium chemicals,  among  them  lithium  carbonate,  lithium  hydroxide,  lithium  bromide, lithium  chlorite,  butyl  lithium  and  lithium  metal.  These  lithium  compounds  are obtained through the processing of spodumene mineral or from brines.

Since the business case of Nemaska, and of this Report, is the production of lithium hydroxide and lithium carbonate, this section will summarize the main applications relating to these two (2) lithium compounds in particular.

## b) Lithium Consumption 2011

As shown on Figure 19.1 below 'Total lithium consumption by application', the battery  market  represents  the  largest  use  of  lithium  with  29%  of  the  overall consumption  in  2011.  After batteries, the combined  frits and  glass market represents the second largest application with a 28%  market  share, while lubricating greases is the third largest application with 14%  of the total consumption.

## c) Lithium Carbonate and Lithium Hydroxide

The two (2) main lithium compounds used by the different industries are lithium carbonate,  representing  48%,  and  lithium  hydroxide,  representing  20%  of  the overall  demand.  Currently  lithium  hydroxide  is  mainly  used  in  the  lubricating greases as shown in Figure 19.2.

## d) Lithium Consumption Forecast: 2011- 2025

As  can  be  seen  from  Table  19.1  below  both  lithium  carbonate  and  lithium hydroxide  demand  are  forecasted  to  increase  significantly  compared  to  other lithium compounds  used  in  other  industrial applications. Lithium  hydroxide demand in particular is  predicted  to  grow  from  the  actual  27,533  tonnes  level  in 2011 to over 183,303 tonnes by 2025, the demand almost doubling every five (5) years from today.

This  forecasted  increase  in  demand  for  lithium  hydroxide  is  mainly  due  to  the increased use of lithium hydroxide in rechargeable batteries, especially batteries for the automotive application. Despite the fact that lithium carbonate has been widely used in batteries for portable devices, lithium hydroxide apparently suits better in cathodes such as lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4), which are being developed for electric  cars.  There  are  different  methods  of  producing  LiFePO4  some  of  them require  exclusively  lithium  hydroxide  or  lithium  carbonate  while  other  methods works equal with either. In the case of the method that works better with lithium hydroxide, LiFePO4 solution is prepared for lithium hydroxide monohydrate LiOHH2O.  It  is  estimated  that  by  2025,  50%  of  the  lithium  requirements  for  hybrid electric cars would be in the form of lithium hydroxide. It is also expected that the use of lithium hydroxide in batteries for portable devices will increase from 5% in 2011 to about 20% in 2025.

Table 19.2 'Lithium consumption by application - forecast 2011 - 2025' clearly shows  that  the  major  increase  in  demand  is  expected  to  come  from  the  battery industry, mainly for the portable devices secondary (rechargeable batteries) and the Hybrid (' HEV ') and electric vehicles (' EV ').

This  situation  implies  that  batteries  will  represent  the  largest  use  of  lithium hydroxide in 2025; increasing from 3% in 2012 to 69% in 2025 and those batteries will continue to be the main application for lithium carbonate.

Figure  19.3  to  Figure  19.6  below,  show  the  evolution  of  the  demand  for  lithium hydroxide  and  lithium  carbonate  from  the  2011  level  to  the  forecasted  2025 expected demand.

- e) Lithium Consumption Forecast: Sensitivity Analysis

A sensitivity analysis has been done in order to assess different demand and price scenarios, using the following criterias:

- · The possibility of a deeper economic slowdown in 2012. This situation would imply a slowdown of the demand of lithium, mainly in the industries related with ceramics and glasses, automotive application, and batteries;
- · The penetration rate of hybrid and electric cars in the market; which depends mainly on how the cost of the battery will evolve, which represents currently the biggest cost of an electric car.

Three  (3)  scenarios,  reflecting  economic  growth  and  electric  vehicle  penetration rate have been considered. Table 19.3 show these three scenarios.

Table 19.3 - Possible Scenarios For Future Lithium Demand

| Scenario    | Economic Growth   | EV Penetration Rate   |
|-------------|-------------------|-----------------------|
| Optimistic  | Base              | High                  |
| Realistic   | Base              | Base                  |
| Pessimistic | Low               | Low                   |

Source: SignumBOX estimates

In  terms  of  the  growth  of  total  lithium  demand,  the  more  pessimistic  scenario results  in  a  Compound  Annual  Growth  Rate  of  8.8%  (CAGR)  and  the  more optimist scenario in a CAGR of 11.8% for the next 21 years as is shown in Figure 19.7.

Lithium  hydroxide  is  much  more  sensitive  to  market  conditions  than  the  other lithium compounds, because of its use as a cathode material in batteries for hybrid and electric cars. As can be seen in Table 19.4, lithium hydroxide growth would range  between  12.6%  and  16.8%  per  year.  It  is  important  to  highlight  that  these estimations do  not consider future economic  recessions  as  well  as product substitution.  They  only  consider  different  scenarios  for  the  economic  growth  in 2012 and different scenarios for HEV and EV's penetration rate. It is not yet known with certainty which will be the most used lithium chemical compound in cathode material for batteries for hybrid and electric cars. It has been assumed that the vast majority of the manganese-spinel and lithium iron phosphates battery types would require  lithium  hydroxide  as  raw  material  while  the  vast  majority  of  lithium polymer and other types of cathode materials would require lithium carbonate as raw material.

## 19.1.3 Supply

- a) Lithium Reserves and Resources: Description

There are two (2) main sources of supply for lithium. The main one is currently continental brines and the second one is hard rock, mainly pegmatite but also from petalite and lepidolite.

Figure  19.8  shows  the  actual  distribution  of  supply  between  these  two  (2)  main sources in 2011.

In the SignumBOX report, the lithium minerals for direct use, representing 13% of the current supply are not taken into consideration, as it is mainly ore of technical grade.

## b) Lithium Reserves and Resources: Estimation

There are different estimations of the amount of reserves and resources around the world. The US Geological Survey (' USGS ') updates every year its estimation of lithium  reserves  and  resources  and  according  to  the  latest  publication,  lithium reserves are 12.7 million tonnes (Li) while resources are estimated at 25.5 million tonnes (Li).

The Table 19.5 shows the estimations of reserves and resources established by both USGS and Mr. Keith Evans, a geologist by profession who has been involved in the lithium business since 1970. Mr. Evans has written many articles regarding lithium reserves and resources and participated in several international lithium conferences.

## c) Lithium Chemicals Supply

Currently the chemicals production capacity around the world is estimated at about 145,000  t  Lithium  Carbonate  Equivalent  (' LCE ').  Approximately  41.5%  of  the supply obtained from pegmatites which is used in the form of lithium concentrate in direct  applications  (13%  of  total  lithium  supply)  and  in  the  form  of  lithium chemicals (28% of total lithium supply), as shown in the above Figure 19.8.

## d) Worldwide Supply of Lithium

Total lithium production capacity is currently estimated around 198,500 t expressed as LCE. According to the Companies' information, it is forecasted that a production capacity from current lithium producers is to increase by 129,000 t in the next four (4)  years  reaching  about  330,000  t  in  2020.  According  to  SignumBOX,  it  is estimated  that  production  capacity  from  Newcomers  in  2014-2015,  will  bring  an additional  50,000  t  of  lithium  carbonate  equivalent  in  the  overall  production capacity.  Therefore,  SignumBOX  estimate  that  by  2020  the  production  capacity would reach about 500,000 t of which 330,000 t will come from current producers and 170,000 t from new projects.

- e) Production Capacity from Newcomers

Figure 19.9 shows the potential production capacity from Newcomers.

## 19.1.4 Prices

Current lithium carbonate prices are in  the  range  of  US$  6,000-  US$  6,500  per  tonne, whilecurrent  lithium  hydroxide  prices  are  in  the  range  of  US$  8,500-  US$  8,900  per tonne. Recently, the main producers of lithium compounds have announced increases of 10% to 15% of their main products. The main reason behind these increases is the higher cost of raw materials required to produce lithium carbonate, in particular soda ash. With the  estimates  of  further  production  capacity  and  demand,  it  is  expected  that  in  2025 outside of China, lithium carbonate prices would reach US$ 8,000 and lithium hydroxide prices would reach US$ 13,100.

## 19.1.5 Conclusions

The main conclusions of the two (2) reports received by Nemaska are:

- · There are a limited number of producers of lithium hydroxide presently around the World, all of them using a traditional process of transforming lithium carbonate into lithium hydroxide;
- · Demand for lithium hydroxide of battery grade is expected to grow at the rhythm of about 30% per annum over the next 15 years;
- · Lithium hydroxide expected growth demand is mainly related to secondary batteries use over the next years;

- · Overall lithium hydroxide demand is expected to grow at a rate between 12.6 % to 16.8 % depending on the rate of penetration of the electric and hybrid vehicles.

## 19.2 Contract

Nemaska  has  signed  on  October  3,  2012,  an  off-take  and  collaboration  agreement (' Agreement ') with Phostech Lithium Inc. (' Phostech '), a Clariant AG group company. Per the Agreement, Phostech agreed to evaluate and purchase from Nemaska the output of  the  lithium  hydroxide  monohydrate  to  be  produced  by  Nemaska's  Phase  I  plant. Nemaska and Phostech also agreed to collaborate in order to determinate the economic and technical feasibility of tailoring the lithium hydroxide fabrication process according to Phostech's specifications. Pending financing and budgetary considerations, Nemaska Lithium intends to build a Phase I, 500 tonnes a year lithium hydroxide plant using its patent pending chemical transformation process. Phostech recently opened its facility in Candiac,  Quebec  that  produces  the  Life  Power®  P2  C-LiFePO4,  a  safe,  high-power cathode  material  for  rechargeable  lithium-ion  batteries  used  in  hybrid  and  electric vehicles, solar and wind energy storage and power tools.

## 20.0 ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES, PERMITTING, AND SOCIAL OR COMMUNITY IMPACT

All the information presented in this section concerns the mine site, except Section 20.7.

An Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (' ESIA '), including an Environmental and Social Baseline Study (' ESBS '), for the Company's Whabouchi Project is ongoing at the mine site.

The ESBS will present information on the physical, biological and social environment for the mine study area, which has been defined to cover an area of approximately 300 km . 2

## 20.1 Environmental Studies

Baseline environmental studies at the Whabouchi site began in August 2010 with field surveys for water quality, sediment quality, benthic invertebrates, and fish. During 2011 and through 2012, additional data were collected, focusing on fish, surface water quality, bathymetry,  hydrology,  ground  water  quality,  soil  quality,  air  quality,  noise,  large mammals, small mammals, bats, birds, amphibians, and reptiles. Figure 20.1 shows a list of completed, ongoing, and planned work for the environmental baseline.

## 20.1.1 Study Area

Two (2) study areas have been defined for the environmental studies (Figure 20.1). The local study area includes all of the areas likely to be directly physically impacted by the mine  development  (pit,  buildings,  and  roads).  The  regional  study  area  is  a  larger  area extending out 10 km from the pit. This larger study area encompasses areas likely to have increased sound levels or dust deposition resulting from activities at the site as well as areas that may be visually impacted.

The following sections present a portrait of the natural environment at the site. It is as yet incomplete, since a number of field studies and analyses are still to be completed. Also, subjects which have been covered in other sections are not presented here (i.e. geology, physiography, etc.).

## 20.1.2 Physical Environment

## a) Surface Water and Groundwater Environment

Both the local and regional study areas are within the Rupert River drainage. The Rupert  River  has  a  watershed  of  43,400  km   and  runs  into  the  southern  part  of 2 James Bay. All of the small watersheds near the site drain into the Nemiscau River (2,000 km  watershed upstream from the site) itself, a tributary to the Rupert River 2 that it joins 70 km downstream from the site. The Nemiscau River is on the western perimeter  of  the  site  and  the  on-site  drainage  trends  west-southwest  towards  the Nemiscau River. The largest stream on-site is the one that drains Spodumene Lake with  a  watershed  of  over  100  km .  The  other  on-site  watersheds  are  well  under 2 5 km . 2

The largest lake in the vicinity of the site is Lac des Montagnes , with a surface area of 1,375 ha. It is located on the western perimeter of the Whabouchi Property and is actually a widening of the Nemiscau River. Spodumene Lake, to the east of the site, is only 61 ha.

Calculations of stream flow rates derived from standard CEHQ models have been made and supplemented with field checks.

A preliminary analysis of the surface water quality data to date indicates that the waters on and near the site are typical for this type of environment. The pH values range from 5.0 to 8.0, depending on water body and depth. Some of the waters are somewhat acidic, common for Shield water bodies. The lowest pH values are for a small lake that is in the process of turning into a bog, again a common value for this situation.  Most  of  the  chemical  analyses  show  values  under  the  detection  limits, common for poorly mineralized oligotrophic waters. The only exception appears to be  the  small  lake  turning  into  a  bog  that  has  normal  higher  levels  of  carbon. Alkalinity and calcium levels are low in most stations, indicating some sensitivity to  acidification.  Most  metals  are  present  at  levels  below  the  detection  limits  but some measurable levels of aluminum, iron, chromium, lead, and zinc occur.

A  preliminary  analysis  of  sediment  quality  data  taken  to  date  in  the  lakes  and watercourse  suggests  that  they  are  generally  of  good  quality  with  some  elevated copper values.

Groundwater has been analysed at several well locations and preliminary evaluation suggests that it is generally of good quality. Other analyses are planned.

## 20.1.3 Biological Environment

## a) Aquatic Biology

As is typical in northern environments, the aquatic systems are low in nutrients and the growth rate of aquatic organisms is slow because of the low temperature.

Benthic  invertebrate  studies  were  undertaken  in  2010.  Benthic  invertebrates  are important indicators of the quality of aquatic habitats. Results show a great deal of variability between sites.

Thirteen (13) fish species have been found in the lakes and streams near the site during fieldwork from 2010 to 2011. The species caught most frequently is the lake whitefish. Other common species include white sucker, walleye, and brook trout.

Several of the fish species present are caught and eaten by local residents, notably brook trout, walleye, lake white fish, and pike. In November 2011, over 100 sample fish were taken and preserved for chemical analyses. Preliminary evaluation of the results  of  chemical  analyses  of  muscle  tissue  from  40  of  these  fish  suggests  that levels of metals are generally low. Mercury levels were above detection limits in all samples. The mercury levels were consistently higher in the lake whitefish samples from Lake Spodumene.

To  date,  no  aquatic  species  of  special  status  has  been  found  on  the  site.  Lake sturgeon is a species considered as likely to be designated threatened or vulnerable in Quebec ( Espèce de la faune susceptible d'être désignée menacée ou vulnerable ) and is present in some nearby lakes (i.e., Nemaska Lake) and in the Rupert River system. However, there are no indications of its presence on the Nemiscau River drainage this far  up.  Local  people  have  stated  that  they  have  not  found  it  in  this area.

## b) Terrestrial Biology

The  site  is  in  the  boreal  forest  vegetation  zone  that  covers  much  of  northern Quebec;  more  specifically,  it  is  located  in  the  Western  spruce-moss  bioclimatic zone. Black spruce forests, more or less open, dominate but around 80 percent of the local study area has been burned in the very recent past and is in various stages of regeneration. Forest fires are a key element in the evolution of the vegetation in this  area.  Wetlands,  primarily  bogs  but  also  some  marshes,  cover  a  significant percentage of the study area. There is a large wetland south of the proposed pit.

The site is well beyond the northern limit of commercial forests according to the MDDEP. However, some plant species of traditional use are likely to be present on the site. No plant species of special status has been found on the site.

The animal species found in the vicinity are typical of the boreal forest and include moose,  black  bear,  otter,  marten,  and  wolf.  There  have  been  field  surveys  for mammals, birds, reptiles, and amphibians.

One  (1)  species  of  particular  interest  is  the  woodland  caribou,  a  subspecies  of caribou. Two (2) ecotypes of this subspecies may be present at the site. The forest ecotype  is  present  in  small  numbers  throughout  the  year  in  this  part  of  Quebec, although the area around the site has not been identified as of particular importance by  the  Quebec  Government.  The  other  ecotype  is  the  tundra  ecotype.  In  the summer, it is present in large herds in the more northern parts of Quebec. In the winter, these herds move down into the more wooded areas in smaller bands. Most of  the  tundra  ecotype  caribou  remain  north  of  52  degrees  latitude,  but  radio telemetry  data  shows  that  some  individuals  of  the  Rivière  aux  Feuilles  herd  do come down to the vicinity of the site. Woodland caribou of the forest ecotype are considered  vulnerable  in  Quebec;  however,  caribou  were  not  sighted  during  the February 2012 aerial surveys, nor during any of the other field work.

There is a prior record of one (1) sighting of a hoary bat near Spodumene Lake. This species is considered as likely to be designated threatened or vulnerable by the Quebec Government. Analyses of ultra sound recordings taken in June-July 2012 are still ongoing. This is a species that needs trees for roosting and the recent forest fires may have made the local area less attractive for this species.

One  (1)  bird  species,  the  common  nighthawk,  listed  as  'threatened'  under  the Federal Species at Risk Act, is present at the site and probably breeds on the site. It is a widespread and typically fairly common species but which has seen a marked reduction  in  population  throughout  most  of  its  range,  hence  it  being  put  on  the Federal  list.  Mitigation  measures  regarding  this  species  will  be  included  in  the impact analysis.

The site is not in any protected zone for terrestrial plants or animals, as designated by the Quebec Government.

## 20.1.4 Water, Rock and Tailings Characterization

The principal lithological units that comprise the deposit and are likely to end up in the waste  rock  and  tailings  pile  include  gabbro,  basalt,  and  pegmatite.  The  geochemical classification  of  the  lithological  units  was  done  using  static  tests  and  kinetic  tests  are actually  ongoing.  Samples  of  drill  core  and  mineral  processing  rejects  were  tested following the characterization program proposed by the MRNF/MDDEP (Directive 019 sur  l'Industrie  minière,  2009).  The  overburden  will  also  be  tested  soon  but  will  go through a chemical analysis only.

<!-- image -->

The geochemical classification program had three (3) objectives:

- · Classify the waste rock and the tailings according to the MRNF/MDDEP standards;
- · Identify the surface disposal requirements;
- · Identify chemicals that could potentially affect future surface water quality.

Preliminary results done on 83 samples of rock taken in the drill holes show that some of them  contain  a  small  amount  of  sulfides  with  no  neutralisation  potential.  The  average values of all samples show that the amount of sulfides should not be enough to start any acidic drainage over the time of weathering exposure. However, kinetic tests are ongoing to ensure that the future waste rock will never oxidise in a way that would produce acidic water.  Static  tests  done  on  the  tailings  showed  that  they  are  non-acid  generating.  The tailings  will  be  co-disposed  with  the  waste  rock  by  layered  co-mingling.  Because  the tailings will be filtered and then transported by truck and compacted in the waste pile, their hydraulic conductivity will be low. This will have an impact on the infiltration of water  within  the  pile  and  the  movement  of  oxygen  also.  This  impact  is  positive  and should  limit  the  oxidation  of  sulfides,  if  any,  and  the  transport  of  chemicals  in  the environment.

Samples of waste rock and tailings have also been tested for their leachability. Three (3) protocols  were  done  (TCLP,  SPLP  and  Shake  Flask  Extraction).  Results  showed  that most of the samples leached during these static tests. Kinetic tests are ongoing. These are more representative in terms of probably leaching behavior and leachate concentrations generated from waste rock and tailings that will be exposed to weathering conditions.

## 20.1.5 Run-Off and Mine Water Management

The water management plan is developed to collect, monitor and treat, if  required,  all contact water from the mine site.

Water will be collected only from the three (3) zones of operation, namely milling and mine infrastructures, waste rock and tailings pile, and open pit. All other run-off water will follow the natural watersheds around these three (3) operation zones and will not be allowed to enter the drainage structures by protecting them with berms.

In  general,  peripheral  berms  will  prevent  run-off  water  to  enter  the  various  drainage structures  and  mix,  dilute,  or  segregate  with  mine  effluents  (compliance  with  Quebec Directive 019 for the Mining Industry, article 2.1.5).

Surface water from the milling and mine infrastructures area will be collected in ditches into  local  sedimentation  ponds.  The  treated  water  will  then  be  recycled  for  use  in processing.  Peripheral  berms  around  the  sedimentation  ponds  and  ditches  will  prevent run-off water from entering these structures and, as a result, will increase the recycled

<!-- image -->

water volume. Water from this source shall not be released in nature. Only suspended solids are expected in the mine water.

The run-off water from the waste rock and tailings pile and open pit will be collected in ditches  and  then  will  flow  to  sedimentation  ponds  where  water  will  be  treated  for suspended solids. Then the overflow will be discharged in nearby streams and/or lakes.

Since  preliminary  results  do  not  indicate  acid  generation,  construction  of  impermeable drainage  structures  (except  for  the  dikes  of  the  sedimentation  ponds)  is  not  necessary. The  native  soil  is  generally  fine  silts  and  sands  of  relatively  low  permeability,  of thickness  ranging  from  0.5  to  four  (4)  metres  and  sitting  on  rock.  Infiltration  of  water from  the  ditches  and  sedimentation  ponds  towards  near-by  water  bodies  will  be  slow (order of four (4) metres/year) and any fines in the drainage water will be captured by the native soil.

Progressive vegetation of the waste rock and tailings pile will reduce the release of fine materials. Further sedimentation control will be provided along the length of the drainage ditches  by  introducing  various  types  of  small  catchment  basins  (by  enlarging  and/or deepening the ditches) and silt traps (rip-rap mounts, hay balls, etc.).

The waste rock and tailings pile and open pit sedimentation ponds are designed with low impermeable dikes and will be sufficient to contain the 100-year return of precipitation and snow melt flood. Under 'normal' flow conditions, the water will be given sufficient time to sediment in the pond before exiting through a culvert positioned in the dike above a predetermined elevation such as to provide sufficient water residence time required for sedimentation  of  fines.  In  the  case  of  an  'extreme'  precipitation  event,  the  water  will surpass the elevation of the culvert to a maximum of one (1) metre below the crest of the dike. This water will subsequently exit the pond through the culvert, which is designed with a gate to control the output flow rate.

The water collected from the waste rock and tailings pile and open pit will eventually reach the Lac des Montagnes in two (2) distinct locations: on the south side of the waste rock  and  tailings  pile  (south-west  limit  of  the  proposed  mine  site)  through  an  existing stream and south of the open pit (south-east limit of the proposed mine site), respectively. Channels, armoured with geotextile and rip-rap, are designed to carry the water from the sedimentation ponds to either the creek or the lake. These channels become wider at their exit such that the flow rate and corresponding water velocity are further minimized.

Armouring the 'exit' channels will prevent erosion as well as contamination with fines of the previously 'polished' water.

In the long term, the permeability of the bottom materials of the ditches and ponds will decrease as fines settle as sediment from the drainage water.

<!-- image -->

A minimum freeboard of one (1) metre has been allowed in the design of all drainage structures.

Outflow water from the sedimentation ponds (waste rock and tailings pile and open pit) will be regularly sampled and tested for compliance with Quebec Directive 019 for the Mining Industry (article 2.1.1.2).

'Normal'  operation  conditions  water  balance  estimates  were  based  on  the  mean Canadian Normals for the Nemiscau airport. It is assumed that there are no flows in the period of December to March as almost all precipitation is snow and the air temperature is below zero. However, during spring, the snow melt is incorporated in the precipitation run-off  as  the  difference  between  snow  melt  quantities  between  two  (2)  consecutive months (snow on the ground at month end) until there is no more snow on the ground.

For  'extreme'  operation  conditions,  the  100-year  return  24-hour  rain,  plus  a  30-day 1:100-year snow melt is employed in the estimation of water run-off volumes.

## 20.2 Social Studies

Information pertaining to local demographics, economic development, land use, cultural heritage,  health  and  social  services,  and  infrastructure  has  been  collected  in  order  to provide a snapshot of the community's needs and priorities and to determine how current conditions may be affected by the proposed Whabouchi Project. Results are based largely on data obtained from the local First Nations government (Cree Nation of Nemaska Band Council),  local  social  service  providers,  educational  institutions,  law  enforcement,  and Census  Canada,  as  well  as  on  data  obtained  from  engagement  with  land  users  and community  stakeholders. Socio-economic data from various Cree agencies (Cree Regional Authority entities) and provincial authorities will continue to be collected and analyzed in order to complete the baseline assessment.

## 20.2.1 Socio-Economic Baseline of Nemaska Cree Community

According  to  the  2006  Canada  census  data,  the  Cree  community  of  Nemaska  has  a population of 642  people. However,  estimates  from  the  Nemaska  Band  Council administration personnel report rapid population growth and the actual population now stands closer to 800 people. The mean population age in 2006 was 25 years old. Elders represent the smallest age group at 4% of the population.

Local  economic  opportunities  in  Nemaska  have  increased  over  the  past  several  years. Contributing factors include Hydro-Québec contracts being awarded to local contractors for  construction  projects  and  environmental  monitoring,  as  well  as  new  community infrastructure  projects  undertaken  by  local  government  and  associated  economic  spinoffs.  Taking  into  consideration  the  large  youth  population  in  Nemaska,  the  Economic Development branch of the local government is currently rolling out various training and skills development programs (heavy machinery operation, for example) which will play a key role in building local capacity to meet future needs.

A  recent  development  in  the  community  is  the  emergence  of  employment  at  the entrepreneurial level. Individuals are offering such services as equipment rentals (dump trucks,  snowmobiles),  video  rentals,  painting,  towing  and  equipment  maintenance  and repairs. As well, the new Nemaska clinic, band council headquarters and justice facilities are  in  the  process  of  being  erected.  However,  in  spite  of  efforts  to  stimulate  the  local economy, people in the community still report a lack of jobs.

Social service facilities  in  the  community  include  the  wellness  centre,  Nemaska  clinic, social  services  centre,  school,  daycare,  multi-service  centre  and  youth  centre.  The wellness centre, social services centre and Nemaska clinic provide those social service programs with the farthest reach within the community. Programming focuses on mental and physical health promotion at large, and on generating awareness around such specific issues  as  diabetes,  substance  abuse,  bullying,  conjugal  violence,  sexual  health,  suicide, anxiety,  and  depression.  Resource  workers  who occupy management positions at these facilities  report  being  without  adequate  resources  to  accomplish  the  work  required  of them (lack of trained workers, time and funding).

There is very little incidence of violent crime in Nemaska, however assaults and domestic violence do exist. The majority of the crimes dealt with by the police force are alcohol related, with the incidence of crime being higher in the summer. Drunk driving was cited as one (1) of the main criminal activities within the community. Out-of-town employees staying at temporary worker camps are thought to exacerbate alcohol-related incidents.

## 20.2.2 Land Use

The Project is located on part of the territory of the Cree Nation of Nemaska, one (1) of the nine (9) James Bay Cree communities, more specifically on the Cree hunting ground known as Trapline R20.

The  land  use  study  covers  a  range  of  topics  that  allow  a  thorough  description  and understanding of Cree  uses of the territory and its resources over a period of approximately two (2) generations. It also includes projected land use by Cree families traditionally associated with the area.

The general description of Cree land use practices is partly based on a literature review and  data  collection  from  the  community  of  Nemaska.  Land  use  studies  have  been conducted  in  the  community  of  Nemaska  in  the  recent  past,  namely  in  the  context  of Hydro-Québec's  environmental  impact  assessment  for  the  EM1-A  Rupert  diversion, which affected the same Cree families. For this reason and to avoid duplication of effort and  undue  pressure  on  Cree  land  users,  authorization  was  obtained  from  relevant authorities to use results from these past studies.

An important part of the consultations regarding land use consists in conducting in-depth semi-structured interviews with Cree users of hunting grounds located in the vicinity of the Project. A special emphasis is put on consultations with the family of Trapline R20, which will bear the majority of disturbances and infrastructures related to construction and operations of the mine.

Focus  groups  are  also  carried  out  to  obtain  further  community  input  on  the  Project, perceptions of impacts and benefits, and to document concerns and expectations.

Efforts  are  made  to  create  and  maintain  a  collaborative  and  cordial  relation  with  the community, in particular with families affected by the Project, in order to address issues as they emerge throughout the course of consultations and Project development.

## 20.2.3 Heritage Resources

An initial archaeological survey has been completed in 2011 and further field work done during the summer of 2012. However, at this time, no significant issues have emerged that would be considered jeopardizing to the Project.

## 20.2.4 Involvement of Chibougamau Community

Since  2009,  the  company  has  engaged  with  the  mayor  and  executive  council  of Chibougamau  to  inform  them  of  the  mining  project  and  its  potential  impacts  on  the community.  Nemaska  Lithium  and  the  municipal  leadership  have  since  developed  an engagement and communication program that is appropriate for anticipated impacts that

<!-- image -->

the Project will have on the community. Although the impacts anticipated at this time are mainly positive, ongoing engagement should identify any new potential impacts that have yet to be assessed. Broad community consultation is planned to take place in 2013.

## 20.3 Permitting

## 20.3.1 Environmental Assessment and Review Processes

Because of  its  northern  location,  the  Whabouchi  Project  falls  under  the  environmental protection regimes of the James Bay and Northern Quebec Agreement ( 'JBNQA' ) and could possibly fall under the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act. The purpose of the Environmental Assessment is to allow the relevant Quebec and federal regulators to properly assess the impact of the Project and to seek input from local stakeholders on the proposed development. In this context, the Whabouchi Project notice was submitted in July 2011 to the James Bay Convention Administrator, Mrs. Diane Jean, sous-ministre from  the Ministère  du  Développement  durable,  de  l'Environnement  et  des  Parcs ( 'MDDEP' ). Following  the  Directives  to  be  issued  by  the  Evaluation  Committee ( 'COMEV' )  via  the  MDDEP  and  possibly  the  Canadian  Environmental  Assessment Agency ( 'CEAA' ), an ESIA will be completed. Subject to a schedule to be established by  the  Review  Committee  of  the  JBNQA  (' COMEX' ),  and  possibly  the  CEAA,  it  is currently  expected  that  public  hearings  will  be  held,  and,  upon  the  satisfaction  of  all regulatory requirements, the Project will be eligible for the receipt of Quebec Certificates of  Authorization.  Once  the  provincial  (and  federal  if  necessary)  administrators  have issued authorizations for Project development, final mine permits will be sought from the MDDEP, the Ministère  des  Ressources  naturelles  et  de  la  Faune ( 'MRNF' ),  and  all relevant federal authorities.

## 20.3.2 Permitting

Apart  from  the  ESIA,  which  will  lead  to  the  delivery  of  the  global  certificate  of authorization,  many  other  authorizations  are  required  from  municipal,  provincial,  and possibly federal governments.

At the municipal level, the Project is on the territory of the Municipality of James Bay and  a  certificate  of  conformity  to  their  regulations  will  have  to  be  issued  each  time  a certificate  of  authorization  is  requested  under  sections  22  and  32  of  the  Environment Quality  Act  (c.  Q-2).  Construction  permits  will  also  be  required  before  starting  any construction work.

At the provincial level, many certificates of authorization will have to be delivered from the MDDEP in accordance with the Environment Quality Act (c. Q-2).

During  the  construction  and  the  operation,  many  permits  and  leases  will  be  required. Nemaska will present the requests when required.

<!-- image -->

From  the  federal  point  of  view,  if  the  Project  does  not  fall  under  the  Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, no specific permit will be required for the construction of the mine.

## 20.3.3 Status of Permit Applications

The  permit  application  process  for  the  Whabouchi  Project  was  initiated  at  the  end  of July 2011  when  Nemaska  sent  the  proponent's  preliminary  information  and  Project notice. Nemaska has received the guidelines from the COMEV in February 2012.

## 20.4 Anticipated Impacts

## 20.4.1 Environmental

The impact predictions contained in this section are preliminary, subject to modifications in the mine layout and process and the results of ongoing fieldwork and modelling.

The Whabouchi Project has a major positive feature in terms of impact on the natural environment: it is located on an existing road and has nearby support facilities, including an  airport.  Besides  the  costs  and  impacts  directly  associated  with  these  constructions, there are also long-term impacts from the road, often much longer than the operational life of the mine. The most profound impact of a new road is that it allows ground access to areas which were formerly remote, leading to increased use. The road itself may also lead to habitat fragmentation. This may  have long-term effects on the natural environment,  primarily  on  larger  mammals.  The  habitat  fragmentation  impacts  of  the Whabouchi Project are lessened because of its location on the Route du Nord .

Many of the impacts associated with the Whabouchi Project are limited to the period of operation of the mine and impacts cease with the mine closure. The development of a good mine closure plan will considerably reduce any residual impacts.

The most evident impact of a mine development on a natural site is that a certain amount of land is removed from natural habitat and is converted into active industrial use for the duration of the mining activities, in this case roughly 25 years. This includes the open pit, the associated facilities, any on-site roads, and the waste rock and tailings pile. For the Whabouchi Project, the estimated area involved amounts to 4 km  (2 km x 2 km). 2

The nature of the deposit essentially eliminates the possibility of an underground mine, an option that could reduce the amount of habitat converted. The body of the mineralized material dictates the location and size of the pit itself. Other spatial aspects of the facility have  been  developed  taking  environmental  concerns  into  consideration.  In  particular, nearly all lakes, streams, and wetlands have been avoided. There is only one crossing of a stream by an on-site required road and it will be done following all applicable measures to reduce impacts to aquatic life. The areas to be cleared consist of terrestrial vegetation;

<!-- image -->

primarily spruce woods regenerating following recent fires. Some ephemeral watercourses may be eliminated by the waste tailings, something practically impossible to avoid in an area with a drainage network as dense as here. Choosing an optimum time and method will minimize the impact from the clearing and reduce the impact on animals unable to move (i.e., nesting birds). The closure plan will include measures to help bring back the affected areas as useful habitats. The open pit will gradually be filled with water.

The  surface  water  flow  near  the  mine  site  may  be  affected  in  two  (2)  ways:  by  the diversion  of  surface  water  flow  in  specific  watersheds  and  by  mine  dewatering.  The surface flow diversions are associated with the mine water management system, which ensures that water coming off of the waste rock and tailings pile, and other facilities are released  at  two  (2)  outfalls.  This  will  impact  particularly  two  (2)  small  watersheds, watersheds so small as to be considered to have only intermittent watercourses associated with them. The ESIA will document the anticipated changes and the potential impacts. Groundwater entering the open pit will have to be pumped to a sedimentation pond. This will tend to depress the water table and could affect water levels in adjacent wetlands, streams  and  lakes. Further hydrogeological  studies  are  underway  to  estimate  the magnitude of this drawdown effect.

The quality of the surface water in the area of the mining activities could be affected. Studies to quantify and model these potential effects are underway.

Air quality at the mine site could be affected as the result of dust in the air resulting from traffic  and  mining activities. The air quality impacts will be modelled. The increase of noise  levels  as  a  result  of  the  Project  will  be  modelled  and  the  anticipated  effects described.

The use of the road to Chibougamau to haul concentrate will result in some increase of noise and dust along the road.

The Project will also be assessed in terms of cumulative impacts. There are few other projects in this area at this time so that the cumulative effects are likely to be limited. However, it will be important to consider these effects carefully because of the remote nature of the area.

## 20.4.2 Social

The construction, operation, and closure of the mine will alter the physical landscape and will  consequently  affect  land  use  within  the  immediate  areas.  The  mining  Project  will also increase direct, indirect and induced employment and thereby impact the community and  regional  populations.  These  changes  will  affect  the  communities  of  Nemaska, Chibougamau,  and,  perhaps  to  a  much  lesser  extent  Chapais  and  other  communities further afield, both positively and negatively. Public consultations are underway and aim

<!-- image -->

to provide a more meaningful assessment of the scope and weight of anticipated impacts. Impacts identified to date or anticipated are summarized below.

## a) Land Use Impacts

The mine site is within the territory of Trapline R20 and the Project will lead to a temporary loss of some hunting and trapping area within R20 because of the mine's footprint.  The  mine  and  its  activities  will  impact  resource  harvesting  temporarily through habitat loss and perhaps disturbance.

There are some campsites, which may include cabins or tent frames, on or near the mine site that will also be impacted.

At the time when this Report was prepared, sites of shared or family heritage (sites imbued with memory and history) have been identified on or near the mine site. Undoubtedly the integrity of these sites and the overall landscape will be impacted. However the degree to which specific sites of importance will be impacted requires further  study  (new  meeting  with  the  users  to  clarify  certain  information  and determine mitigation measures).

It is perceived by residents that use of the beaches, the bible camp, and possibly the waterways in between, which are nearby and/or within view of the mine, will be negatively affected by the mine's visual and audible impacts. The extent of these impacts  is  being  further  assessed  and  is  the  focus  of  ongoing  consultation.  The beaches  and  bible  camp  are  sites  valuable  to  the  maintenance  of  community cohesion.  Impacts  on  these  two  (2)  sites  may  hinder  their  use  for  the  potential pursuit of outfitting, tourism and other income generating activities.

The  Project's  overburden,  waste  rock  and  tailings  pile,  as  well  as  its  noise,  will decrease the aesthetic and wilderness value of the landscape to Cree and other land users and create direct visual impacts that may degrade the value and appreciation of certain sites (i.e., the bible camp).

Disturbance from noise will be temporary (i.e., the operating life of the facility), however the visual disturbance from the waste rock and tailings pile will be longerterm. The visual impacts may be mitigated by careful design and re-vegetation.

## b) Social Impacts

The Project will provide training, employment, economic development opportunities,  and  revenue.  These  positive  impacts  will  occur  at  the  local  level (Nemaska),  the  regional  level  (Chibougamau),  and  the  provincial  and  national levels.  These  impacts  will  likely  be  felt  most  strongly  in  Nemaska  through  the training and employment of local residents and the local procurement of goods and

<!-- image -->

services.  Chibougamau  may  also  see  marked  positive  impacts  as  the  road  haul terminal.

Along  with  these  positive  impacts,  one  must  be  aware  of  potentially  negative impacts.  For  example,  the  study  team  will  be  further  assessing  the  potential  for these  largely  positive  impacts  to  increase  tension  and  conflict  among  Nemaska community members, especially with regards to those who are perceived beneficiaries versus those who are not (i.e., impacting community cohesion).

It is also possible that the increased presence of non-Cree people near Nemaska and the  increased  frequency  of  workers  leaving  and  returning  to  the  community  may exacerbate existing social problems or create new social issues. For example, the more frequent movement of people in and out of the community may increase the availability of drugs and alcohol, which may thereby exacerbate the social issues associated with their use and abuse.

In terms of community well-being, Nemaska community members have indicated increased social and individual anxiety stemming from fear of Project impacts, an increased  sense  of  exploitation  and  decline  in  cultural  self-esteem,  increased feelings  of  loss  related  to  the  modification  of  the  traditional  landscape,  and increased feelings of confusion related to the clashing of Cree and non-Cree values.

The  population  growth  resulting  from  the  increased  direct,  indirect,  and  induced employment attributed to the mine and its transportation system may put pressure on the Nemaska  and Chibougamau  community  services and infrastructure, depending  on  whether  they  are  at  or  near  capacity  and  whether  this  population growth far exceeds the communities' planning projections.

## 20.5 Closure Plan

## 20.5.1 Introduction

In  accordance  with  the  law  on  mines  (L.R.Q.,  chapter  M-13.1,  section  III,  article  232, august 2012) a detailed closure plan must be submitted to the Ministère des Ressources Naturelles et de la Faune  (' MRNF ') prior to getting the Global  Certificate of Authorization. The Guide and method of preparation for the plan as well as the general requirements  for  the  restoration  of  Quebec  mining  sites  (Guidelines  for  Preparing  a Mining Site Rehabilitation Plan and General Mining Site Rehabilitation Requirements, 1997,  hereafter  referred  to  as Guide ),  prepared  by  MRNF  in  collaboration  with  the Ministère  du  Développement  durable,  de  l'Environnement  et  des  Parcs (' MDDEP '), must be followed when preparing the closure plan for a mining site.

The  closure  plan  must  include,  among  other  things,  a  description  of  the  site  and  the mining activities which must be accomplished, a description of the restoration tasks that

<!-- image -->

are planned during operation, and if circumstances permit, a description of the restoration and  redevelopment  planned  at  the  end  of  the  mining  operations,  an  evaluation  of  the restoration related costs, as well as a description of the financial guarantee provided for restoration of the accumulation areas.

The  financial  guarantee  must  cover  70%  of  the  costs  related  to  restoration  of  the accumulation areas. According to the Guide, accumulation areas include sedimentation ponds,  waste  rock  piles, tailings area, and  storage  areas  of mineralized  material concentrate. The goal of restoration is to rehabilitate the site in a satisfactory condition, by:

- · Eliminating unacceptable health hazards and ensuring the safety of persons;
- · Limiting  the  production  and  the  spread  of  substances  that  are  likely  to  affect  the receiving  environment  and,  in  the  long  term,  aiming  to  eliminate  all  forms  of maintenance and monitoring;
- · Restoring the site to a visually acceptable state for the community;
- · Restoring  the  infrastructures  site  (excluding  accumulation  areas)  in  a  state  that  is compatible for future use.

## 20.5.2 Revegetation

Several measures will be taken with regards to the closing works for the mine. In this regard,  the  site  of  the  mine  infrastructures,  the  waste  rock  and  tailings  pile,  the sedimentation  ponds,  and  any  roads  which  are  not  useful  for  post  closure  monitoring operations, will be restored and covered with vegetation.

- A  0.3  metre  layer  of  overburden  will  be  spread  on  the  relatively  flat  surfaces  before revegetating them.

The overburden will be used initially to restore the waste rock and tailings pile and other industrial areas. Revegetation of the waste rock and tailings pile will be done progressively during operation of the mine.

## 20.5.3 Soil Decontamination

The Regulation on Land Protection and Rehabilitation (L.R.Q., c. Q-2, a. 31, 31.69, 109.1 et  124.1  in  effect  since  March  2003),  aims  to  provide  increased  protection  and  land rehabilitation in case of contamination, making several provisions applicable to the new section IV.2.1 of the Act on Environmental Quality (sections 31.42 to 31.69), enacted by Article  2  of  Chapter  11  of  the  statutes  of  2002.  Moreover,  the  very  definition  of  land includes the surface water and groundwater. The regulation states the limits for a variety of contaminants and specifies the types of commercial and industrial activities covered including the mining industry.

<!-- image -->

The mining company must then proceed with the characterization of the industrial site according to the regulation on Land Protection and Rehabilitation within six (6) months after  the  end  of  the  operation.  In  cases  where  contamination  exceeds  the  criteria established by the regulations, a rehabilitation plan that specifies the protective measures to be put in place, must be submitted for approval to the MDDEP. Note that the waste rock and tailings pile is not subject to this regulation.

The characterization study will identify areas that were likely to have been contaminated by industrial activities and in particular, by the handling of petroleum products.

## 20.5.4 Dismantling of Buildings and Infrastructures

The walls of the buildings will be dismantled and the foundations will be covered with overburden and will then be revegetated. Wherever possible, the surface infrastructures will be built with the objective of maximizing the reuse of materials during decommissioning.

A program of waste management will be implemented in order to minimize the disposal of residual and demolition materials.

Underground storage tanks and pipes will be removed.

The work areas and parking lots will be covered with overburden and revegetated.

Based on past experience for similar projects, a substantial part of the decommissioning costs of infrastructure will be covered by the sale of equipment and materials themselves (structural steel, copper, aluminum, etc.).

It  is  estimated  that  the  mine  will  have  an  approximate  volume  of  7,000  m   of  non3 recoverable material that will have to be disposed. Because these materials are inert and that  they  represent  a  considerable  volume,  a  solids  disposal  site  will  be  created  at  the waste  rock  and  tailings  pile.  The  disposed  materials  will  be  covered  with  materials already present on site such as sand and waste rock.

## 20.5.5 Waste rock and Tailings Pile

The waste rock and tailings pile will be designed to meet the minimum requirements in terms of stability and also, to meet the requirements as defined in the Guide.

The waste rock and tailings pile will be designed so as to enable progressive revegetation during the life of the Project. Revegetation will be completed at the end of operations. The waste rock and tailings pile will be built with flatter slopes than the minimum stable slopes determined from stability analyses performed for the most critical sections. Thus, no stabilization work will be required at closure.

According to static  tests,  most  of  the  waste  rock  and  tailings  samples  that  were  tested leached during these tests; kinetic tests, which are more representative, are ongoing (see Section 20.1.4 for more details). Nonetheless, as a precaution, perimeter ditches will be constructed to collect the seepage and drainage catchment areas within its site boundaries.  The  water  will  then  be  routed  to  a  sedimentation  basin  to  be  polished (removal of fines by sedimentation) and then directed to the Lac des Montagnes .

It is estimated that 36% of the waste rock and tailings area will be revegetated as only the relatively flat surfaces (benches and top surface of the pile) can be revegetated. Given all the activities planned during operations, over 40% of the area occupied by these activities will be restored at the end of the operation period.

## 20.5.6 Open Pit

Following the closure of the mine, the open pit will be filled gradually by groundwater and  precipitation.  The  access  to  the  pit  will  be  permanently  closed  by  constructing  an embankment  made  of  waste  rock  removed  from  the  waste  pile.  A  ditch  around  the embankment will intercept surface water from entering the pit.

For the time being, filling the pit is being considered by stopping the pumping system. A hydrogeological study indicates that the water level will stabilise at elevation 288.5 metres and it will overflow to the wetlands on the south-west side of the open pit.

## 20.5.7 Mining Effluent

At the conclusion of the operation phase, the processing unit and water control structures will remain in operation until the MRNF/MDDEP criteria are met. Then the ditches will be filled with their own excavation material used as protective berms during construction of the mine and revegetated. The dikes of the sedimentation ponds will be breached to allow free circulation of natural surface run-off water. The crests of the dikes and any relatively flatter slopes will be revegetated.

## 20.5.8 Other Installations

Sanitation, petroleum products, waste, and hazardous waste facilities will be dismantled in accordance with the regulations and the laws currently in place. The same applies for the residues associated with such facilities.

## 20.5.9 Emergency Plan and Monitoring Program

The closure plan will include the required information regarding the emergency plan and the five-year minimum monitoring program required (integrity of the works, environmental and agronomic monitoring/follow-ups).

## 20.5.10 Timing and Economic Considerations

Timing and economic considerations for the proposed mine site restoration will also be covered in detail in the closure plan.

Table 20.3 summarizes the costs estimated for restoration of the Whabouchi mine site including the post closure monitoring.  The  estimated  cost for the restoration of accumulation  areas  (Table  20.4)  totaled  $1,441  million.  These  costs  represent  only  a fraction of the estimated costs that Nemaska Lithium will require to invest for closure of the mine site.

According  to  the  Mining  Act  currently  in  force,  the  amount  of  financial  guarantee required  presently  is  equivalent  to  70%  of  the  anticipated  restoration  cost  for  the accumulation areas, which is $1,346 million. The guarantee is expected to increase to a 100% of the anticipated restoration cost for the accumulation areas, or $1,923 million, after the Mining Act is revised and effective. The annual guarantee estimated payments are  presented  in  Table  20.5  for  the  anticipated  restoration  costs  for  the  accumulation areas.

Since  the  restoration  costs  of  the  waste  rock  and  tailings  pile  will  be  high,  Nemaska Lithium  will  conduct  research  and  development  to  reduce  the  costs  of  restoration  of accumulation areas, such as:

- · Placement of the overburden;
- · Methods and species for the re-establishment of vegetation.

## 20.6 Conclusion

Consultations with stakeholders and a preliminary assessment indicate that the impacts identified  to  date  do  not  present  any  critical  risks  to  the  Project  at  this  time.  It  is anticipated  that  mitigation,  remediation,  compensation,  surveillance  and  monitoring measures  and  programs,  as  well  as  other  collaborative  initiatives,  should  address  the Project's impacts in a manner that is commensurate with the standards set by authorities, the industry, and other projects, and which meet stakeholder expectations. Although the assessment of the Project's social, environmental, and economic impacts is still ongoing, Nemaska Lithium and the Cree Nation of Nemaska are currently negotiating a Resource Development Partnership Agreement (' RDPA '), which sets out an arrangement for the sharing  of  Project  benefits  and  for  addressing  Project  impacts  through  a  range  of measures and programs.

## 20.7 Hydrometallurgical Plant

For the Valleyfield installation, the discussions with MDDEP indicate that this part of the Project did not require an ESIA.

However,  a  certificate  of  conformity  to  Valleyfield's  City  regulations  will  have  to  be issued each time a certificate of authorization is requested under sections 22 and 32 of the

<!-- image -->

Environment  Quality  Act  (c.  Q-2).  Construction  permits  will  also  be  required  before starting any construction work.

At  the  provincial  level,  certificate  of  authorization  will  have  to  be  delivered  from  the MDDEP in accordance with the Environment Quality Act (c. Q-2).

During  the  construction  and  the  operation,  many  permits  and  leases  will  be  required. Nemaska will present the requests when required.

From  the  federal  point  of  view,  if  the  Project  does  not  fall  under  the  Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, no specific permit will be required for the construction of the plant.

It is recommended  that before the land acquisition a soil characterization and geotechnical survey be completed.

## 21.0 CAPITAL AND OPERATING COSTS

The  Project  scope  covered  in  this  Study  is  based  on  the  construction  of  a  greenfield facility  having  a  nominal  daily  processing  capacity  of  3,000  tonnes.  The  capital  and operating cost estimates related to the mine, concentrator, and Whabouchi  site infrastructure have been developed by BBA. Capital and operaring cost estimates related to  the  hydrometallurgical  plant  and  associates  infrastructures  have  been  developed  by Met-Chem. Engineering quantities related to the water and environmental management were  provided  by  Journeaux  Assoc.,  as  well  as  the  site  closure  plan,  including  the associated  costs.  Owner's  Costs  were  provided  by  Nemaska.  BBA  and  Met-Chem consolidated  cost  information  from  all  sources.  Table  21.1  presents  a  summary  of  the total  estimated  initial  and  sustaining  capital  costs  for  the  Project.  The  capital  and  the operating costs are in Canadian Dollars (' CAD ').

The capital cost estimate consists of the direct capital costs for the Whabouchi mine and concentrator site and for the Valleyfield plant site and the indirect costs for the two (2) sites. A contingency of 10% is added to Whabouchi site costs. A contingency of 15% is added to the Valleyfield site costs to allow for a PEA accuracy. The estimated Owner's costs are also included. A Working Capital, equal to two (2) months Operating Costs, has been included as well. Table 21.1 shows the summary of the capital costs.

- · The  portion  of  rehabilitation  and  closure  costs  required  to  be  disbursed  prior  to production start-up, estimated by Journeaux Assoc. in the order of $1,009 M;
- · Sustaining capital (capital expenses incurred in Year 1 of production to the end of mine life) estimated at $25.74M.

## 21.1.1 Basis of Estimate and Assumptions

The  Capital  Cost  Estimate,  pertaining  to  the  processing  areas  and  Whabouchi  site infrastructure  within  the  BBA  scope,  was  performed  by  a  professional  estimator  on BBA's  estimation  team.  Capital  costs  for  the  mine  were  estimated  by  BBA's  mining group. Material take-offs, fulfilled by Journeaux Assoc., were rated by BBA.

## 21.1.2 Dates, Currency, and Exchange Rates

This  Capital  Cost  Estimate  is  expressed  and  presented  in  constant  Q1  2012,  Canadian Dollars.

## 21.1.3 Mining Quantities and Costs

Mining  equipment  quantities  and  costs  have  been  developed  by  BBA's  mining  group based on the mine plan developed in this Study. Equipment costs were estimated from BBA's recently  updated  database  of  Vendor  pricing.  In  order  to  reduce  initial  mining equipment costs, it is assumed that Nemaska Lithium will lease to own certain equipment that is required for pre-production and for Year 1 of operation.

Pre-stripping  costs  incurred  in  the  pre-production  period  have  been  capitalized.  This capital cost estimate is based on pre-stripping tonnage, as defined in the mine plan, and includes costs associated with the mining and hauling of overburden and waste rock.

## 21.1.4 Scope and Quantity Development

This capital cost estimate is based on the construction of a greenfield facility having a capacity to process 3,000 tpd mill feed.

The design of the crusher area and the concentrator zone has been developed by BBA and has  largely  been  based  on  BBA's  experience  on  other  projects.  General  Arrangement drawings  developed  in  this  Study  have  been  used  to  estimate  quantities  and  generate MTOs for all commodities. Equipment costs have been estimated using Vendor prices based on budget proposals for major process equipment and some mechanical equipment packages.  Labour  rates  have  been  estimated  as  described  subsequently  in  this  section. Related infrastructure has been estimated by BBA based on the site plan developed. A summary of  the  methodology  associated  with  each  engineering  discipline  is  presented below:

- · Site Works  -  Earthwork  quantities  were  measured  from  drawings  and  local topographical data;
- · Concrete - Preliminary design sketches were used to derive the foundations;
- · Structural Elements - Building sketches were developed to produce take-off;
- · Architectural - Siding and roofing quantities were taken from General Arrangement drawings;
- · Mechanical  Process  Equipment  -  A  detailed  mechanical  equipment  list  was developed with capacities and sizing;
- · Mechanical  Bulks  -  A  plate  work  list  was  developed  with  sizing,  weights  and surface areas, including lining requirements;
- · Fire Protection and HVAC - MTOs were taken from layout and elevation drawings. An HVAC equipment list was also developed;
- · Piping  -  Diameter  sizing  carried  out  from  preliminary  design,  while  lengths determined from layouts. Lining requirements were also categorized;
- · Electrical Equipment - An equipment list was developed with capacities and sizing;
- · Electrical  Bulks  -  MTOs  derived  from  cable  schedules  and  runs,  including  tray routing layouts;
- · Automation - Detailed instrumentation list was developed from marked-up PFs;
- · Telecommunication  -  Preliminary  telecommunication  design  and  equipment  list was developed from plant site drawings and local data.

Moreover, the mine garage, administration offices, and high performance fabric building (Sprung)  were  estimated  using  BBA's  recently  updated  internal  database,  as  well  as budget prices from suppliers.

## 21.1.5 Pricing Sources

The  pricing  in  this  Estimate  was  based  on  a  combination  of  budgetary  quotes  and/or historical data obtained from similar projects.

- · Concrete  -  Unit  rates,  including  formworks  and  rebars,  were  built  from  similar ongoing projects overseen by BBA;
- · Steelwork - Labour productivity calculated from BBA database and material priced from actual steel market value;
- · Architectural  -  Pricing  based  on  recent  data  from  similar  projects  erected  in equivalent region;
- · Plant Equipment - For all major mechanical equipment packages (23 in total), data sheets  were  prepared  and  budget  pricing  was  obtained  from  Vendors.  Whenever recent pricing was available for packages of lesser value, this information was used;
- · Mechanical Bulks - Pricing was based on recent project experience;
- · Piping - Material pricing for carbon steel and rubber lined piping was constructed from supplier propositions;
- · Electrical and Instrumentation Bulks: Pricing bulks are based on current published pricing;
- · Instrumentation equipment: Pricing was based on recent project experience;
- · Electrical Equipment: For all major electrical equipment packages, data sheets were prepared and Budget Pricing was obtained from Vendors, or was taken from recent projects.

## 21.1.6 Labour Rates and Labour Productivity Factors

For the purpose of defining the 'Work Week', all estimated costs for labour are based on ten (10) hours per day, through seven (7) days per week, for a total of 70 hours per week. Rotation is based on a work cycle of three (3) weeks on site and one (1) week off, unpaid. Work is forecasted to be realized on day-shift only.

The  present  estimate  is  structured  and  based  on  the  philosophy  that  contracts  will  be awarded to reputable contractors on a lump-sum basis.

The  hourly  crew  rates,  used  in  the  present  estimate,  have  been  derived  from  Quebec construction collective agreements dated January 1, 2012. Crew rates include a mix of skilled, semi-skilled and unskilled labour for each trade, as well as the fringe benefits on top of the gross wages. The supervision by the foremen and surveyors is built-in into the direct  costs.  The  indirect  costs  consist  of  items  such  as  small  tools,  consumables, supervision  by  the  general  foremen,  management  team,  contractors  on  site  temporary

<!-- image -->

construction  facilities,  mobilization  /  demobilization,  contractor's  overhead  and  profit. They also include the costs related to the transportation  of  the  employees  to  and  from their  residence  to  construction  site,  as  well  as  room  and  board  (if  required)  during traveling.  The  construction  equipment  rates  are  based  on  the  tariff  proposed  by  the Direction générale des acquisitions du Centre de services partagés du Québec , detailed inside  edition  dated  April  1,  2011;  and  by  Ontario  Provincial  Standard  Specifications (' OPSS ') schedule of rental rates for construction equipment. The cost of fuel (diesel), associated  to the construction  equipment  in  the  present  estimate,  is  estimated  at 1.10 $/litre given that we are taking under consideration a potential return on taxes.

Construction Project Performance is an important concern for Project owners, constructors, and cost management professionals. Project costs and schedule performance depend largely on the quality of Project planning, work area readiness, preparation, and the resulting productivity of the work process made possible in Project execution. Labour productivity is often the greatest risk factor and source of cost and schedule uncertainty to owners and contractors alike.

Many terms are used to describe productivity in the construction industry: performance factor, production rate, unit person-hour rate and others. Traditionally, productivity has been  defined  as  the  ratio  of  input  /  output,  i.e.,  the  ratio  of  the  input  of  an  associated resource (usually expressed in person-hour) to real output (in creating economic value). To restate this definition for use in the construction industry: labour productivity is the physical progress achieved per person-hour, i.e., person-hours per linear metre of conduit laid  or  person-hours  per  cubic  metre  of  concrete  poured.  The  two  (2)  most  important measures of labour productivity are:

<!-- image -->

- · The effectiveness with which labour is used in the construction process;
- · The  relative  efficiency  of  labour,  doing  what  it  is  required,  at  a  given  time  and place.

A study, carried out by Optima Engineers and Constructors, for the Alberta Economic Development, revealed 208 irregularities affecting the labour productivity on a construction  site.  BBA  summarized  the  results  of  this  study  into  the  following  major factors:

- · Site location
- · Weather conditions
- · Extended overtime
- · Access to work area
- · Height - Scaffolding
- · Availability of skilled workers
- · Labour turnover
- · Inspection + QA / QC
- · Sophisticated specifications
- · Scattered items of work
- · Overcrowded / Tight work areas
- · Complexity
- · Efficiency
- · Supervision
- · Revamps / Connections / Tie-ins
- · Fast-track requirements
- · Materials + Equipment + Handling
- · Safety / Security

Table 21.6 presents the labour productivity factors applied in the capital cost estimate for Nemaska Lithium Project.

## 21.1.7 Indirect Costs

Indirect  Costs  for  areas  under  BBA's  responsibility  for  capital  cost  estimation  were estimated  by  BBA  based  on  experience  on  other  projects  as  described  below.  It  is important to note that these factors were estimated based on the assumption that Nemaska

<!-- image -->

Lithium  will  execute  the  Project  using  an  internal  Procurement  and  Construction Management (' PCM ') team rather than contracting a major PCM firm.

- · Costs related to the construction of temporary facilities required during the Project construction period comprise  of  costs  incurred for building and  maintaining temporary facilities and accesses, which will no longer be required once construction is completed. An itemized list with budget allowance was developed by BBA.
- · The operations of temporary construction facilities are capitalized. An itemized list with budget allowance was developed by BBA.
- · Engineering and Procurement. A detailed staffing plan was the basis of the services estimate.
- · Construction Management (' CM '). The construction management will be performed by Nemaska Lithium and those costs are included in the Owners' Costs. An allowance for engineering field support services from BBA has been included.
- · An  allowance  of  3,000  man-hours  for  pre-operational  acceptance  of  mechanical equipment was included.
- · Costs  for  plant  mobile  equipment  used  during  construction  was  based  on  an itemized list with budget amounts.
- · Costs for spare parts and initial fill were estimated at 2.5% of equipment value.
- · The  camp  facilities,  operation  &amp;  the  catering  will  be  provided  by  CCDC  at  the location  of  the Relais  Routier  Nemiscau Camp  on  the Route  du  Nord ,  which  is located about 12 km to the west of the mine site. The requirement for the capacity of the camp has been estimated at 215 based on the Project schedule. Budget pricing was provided by CCDC and has been used in this Study.
- · Freight:  Domestic-sourced  materials  are  FOB  job  site,  and  therefore,  costs  are included  with  the  material  pricing.  Freight  for  design/supply  packages  has  been estimated at 6.75% of the equipment costs.
- · The cost for Vendor representatives for equipment installation and pre-operational support is based primarily on estimated durations and historical daily pricing.

## 21.1.8 Owner's Costs

Owner's  costs  include  items  such  as  owner's  team  salaries  and  expenses,  insurance, authorization  certificates  and  permits,  geotechnical  and  surveying  costs,  laboratory  test work, etc. An itemized list with budget allowance was developed by Nemaska Lithium.

An allowance was also included for the power line to be built by Hydro-Québec.

## 21.1.9 Contingency

Contingency provides an allowance in the capital cost estimate for undeveloped details within the scope of work covered by the estimate. Contingency is not intended to take into account items such as labour disruptions, weather related impediments, changes in the scope of the Project from what is defined in the Study, nor does contingency take into account price escalation or currency fluctuations. A contingency of 10% of the sum of direct and indirect costs has been attributed to the capital cost estimate developed in this Study for areas estimated by BBA.

## 21.1.10 Exclusions

The following items are not included in this capital cost estimate:

- · Inflation and escalation, the estimate is in constant Q1 2012 Canadian Dollars;
- · Currency fluctuations;
- · Costs associated with protection against currency fluctuations;
- · All taxes, duties and levies;
- · Project financing costs;
- · Provision for outdoor winter concrete or formwork in winter season;
- · Disposal of hazardous materials.

## 21.1.11

Assumptions

- · Hydro-Québec will provide the permanent power line in time for use as construction power;
- · It was assumed that all backfill materials will be available from gravel pits, esker or other sources located within a radius of five (5) km;
- · Mine waste rock is suitable for use in road construction (as established following preliminary assessment);
- · Mass  earthworks  and  haulage  road  construction  is  performed  by  crews  from Nemaska;
- · Soil  conditions  will  not  require  special  foundation  designs  such  as  grouting  and piling (as established following preliminary assessment);
- · All excavated material will be disposed of within the site battery limits;
- · The external envelope of the mineral processing plant is based on a pre-engineering building design;

## 21.2 Hydrometallurgical Plant Capital Costs

## 21.2.1 Capital Cost Estimate and Battery Limits

This part of the Project scope is based on the construction of a greenfield facility having a nominal  yearly processing rate of 213,558  tonnes to produce  lithium hydroxide monohydrate  and  lithium  carbonate.  The  estimate  is  based  on  Met-Chem's  standard methods applicable for a preliminary economic assessment study to achieve the accuracy level of ± 25%.

All  duties  and  taxes  are  excluded  from  the  capital  cost,  but  are  considered  in  the economic  analysis. Escalation and  interests incurred during construction are also excluded from the Capital Cost.

The effective date for the cost estimate is Q3 2012. The estimate is expressed in CAD dollars.

The pre-production initial capital cost for the base case scope of work is CAD$ 277.2 M, of which CAD$ 203.4 M is direct cost, CAD$ 37.6 M is indirect cost and CAD$ 36.2 M is contingency.

No provision  is  required  for  sustaining  capital.  Capital  costs  are  summarized  in  Table 21.7.

Updated indices were used for quotation received before Q3 of 2012. No provisions for escalation or currency fluctuation are included. The exchange rates used when quotations  were  received  in  foreign  currencies  are  1.00  CAD  /  1.00  USD  and 1.24 CAD / 1.00 EUR.

## b) Construction Labour

The labour rate was developed for a typical crew from a detailed table of current rates developed by the Corporation des Entrepreneurs Généraux du Québec .  The all-inclusive hourly rate is CAD$ 100, and includes the basic hourly rates for the tradesman,  social  benefits  and  employer's  burden,  industrial  site  premium,  direct supervision, small tools and consumables, and contractor's overhead and profit.

Indirect  supervision  is  excluded  from  the  hourly  rate  but  is  included  in  the construction contractor's site management provision.

In  addition  to  the  labour  cost,  a  construction  allowance  based  on  delivered equipment  cost  was  established  from  similar  projects  to  cover  for  construction material,  sub-contract  and  mobile  cranes  to  be  paid  by  the  owner.  Few  heavy  or

<!-- image -->

complex  crane  lifts  as  well  as  limited  specialized  worker  trades  are  expected. Therefore, a factor of 3.5% is applied.

The working calendar was defined as one (1) shift per day, eight (8) hours per day and five (5) days per week for a total of 40 hours per week. Realistic construction schedule,  good  site  conditions  as  well  as  limited  number  of  contractors  on  site, limited  work  outside  in  winter  and  also  limited  work  in  overtime  is  expected. Therefore, a factor of 1.07 is applied for productivity loss.

The  estimate is based on construction contracts attributed on the base of competitive  bidding  process  amongst  qualified  contractors.  Availability  of  local qualified  contractors  and  skilled  workers  is  expected.  It  is  also  expected  that  an average  level  of  site  management,  contract  administration,  quality  control  and adequate safety requirements will be required from  the contractors by the construction management.

## c) Freight, Duties and Taxes

Based on recent surveys and studies and when not included in the cost, the freight was accounted for by adding a factor of 10% to the value of the goods. All other duties  and  taxes  are  excluded  from  the  capital  cost,  but  are  considered  for  the economic analysis.

## d) Contractor's Costs

Provisions  have  been  included  to  cover  for  contractor's  major  equipment  and supplies,  including  owned  and  rented  construction  equipment,  vehicles  and  other facilities such as trailers, tool cribs, power panels, containers, maintenance of area, janitorial  and  clean-up,  and  also  the  mobilisation  and  demobilisation.  Special installation  tools,  cranes,  scaffolding,  cribbing  and  dunnage  are  also  included  as well as work place weather protection. Workers transportation within the construction site is also included.

Provision  have  also  been  made  for  construction  contractor's  site  management including    supervision  and  support  staff  such  as  administration  and  procurement, coordination and scheduling, and quality and safety.

## e) Process

The  process  facilities  at  the  Hydrometallurgical  Plant  include  the  main  process building  consisting  of  the  process  area,  the  mechanical  shop,  the  office,  change room and lunch room and the laboratory areas as well as railcar unloading facility.

## i) Main Building

The cost for the building is estimated based on the type and dimensions of the building and unit cost from recent similar projects, adjusted for the location of the Project.

## ii) Process Equipment

The  process  equipment  list  was  derived  from  the  flow  sheets.  For  major equipment,  budget  prices  were  obtained  from  qualified  suppliers  based  on data  tables  or  preliminary  technical  description.  The  remaining  equipment was  estimated  from  databases  from  recent  similar  projects  or  in  house estimation.

Installation was estimated for each area by factorisation on delivered process equipment.

## iii) Piping and Pipelines

Process  piping  cost  was  established  for  each  area  by  factorisation  on delivered process equipment. Small bore pipelines and pipe racks for tailings and gypsum by-product was estimated based on quantities from layout and unit rates from databases.

## iv) Electrical

Electrical  equipment  list  and  quantities  were  derived  from  the  single  line diagram.  Budget  prices  were  established  based  on  databases  from  recent projects.  No  provision  was  made  for  redundancy  on  the  power  supply installations. Quantities and costs for material as well as man-hours were also established based on recent similar projects. Installation was estimated using hourly rate as described above.

## v) Instrumentation

Instrumentation,  automation  and  communication  material  and  equipment quantities were derived from the flow sheets. Budget prices were established based  on  databases  from  recent  projects.  Installation  was  estimated  using hourly rate as described above.

## vi) Buildings Services and Supplies

For  each  process  area,  buildings  services  and  supplies  were  estimated  by applying  a  factor  to  delivered  equipment  cost,  based  on  recent  similar

<!-- image -->

projects. Consideration was given that some services will be provided by the City of Valleyfield.

## f) Tailings and By-products Management Facilities

The  management  and  storage  facilities  were  designed  for  one  (1)  year  only  of storage  in  the  gypsum  by-product  pond,  one  (1)  year  only  of  storage  in  the aluminium silicate by-product stockpile and 20 years of storage in the SIR tailings pond. It is expected that markets will be found within one (1) year to then dispose of gypsum and aluminium silicate by-products. Costs were based on material takeoffs from the layouts and unit cost from databases.

## g) General Services, Infrastructure and Ancillary Buildings

General  services  such  as  natural  gas  and  general  fire  protection  were  estimated based  on  recent  similar  projects.  Services  such  as  sanitary  waste  disposal  and potable water were not included as they will be supplied by the City of Valleyfield. However, a provision is made for interconnection to public networks based on a budget price provided by the City of Valleyfield.

Site  preparation,  peripheral  fencing  and  site  roads  cost  estimate  were  established based on allowance, quantities derived from general layouts and budget unit price based on recent similar projects.

## h) Ancillary Buildings and Facilities

Preliminary requirements were established from the layouts and also process data for  the  storage  warehouse,  the  shipping  warehouse,  the  railcar  unloading  system cover structure and the guard house.

Unit rates and allowances based on recent similar projects were applied to estimate the costs of the storage warehouse and the guardhouse, while budget prices were obtained  from  a  qualified  supplier  for  prefabricated  structures  for  the  shipping warehouse and the railcar unloading system cover structure.

Facilities  such  as  offices,  change  rooms,  laboratory,  as  well  as  mechanical  and electrical rooms, are located within the main process building and included in its cost.

Finally,  because  the  Project  is  centrally  located,  there  are  no  provisions  for permanent or construction camps.

<!-- image -->

## i) Site Access

Quantities were calculated from the layout for the construction of 850 m railway connection to the existing CN line and some turnouts. Unit rates obtained from a qualified contractor were applied to estimate the cost.

## j) Power Supply, Main Substation and Communication

Preliminary requirements were established for a main power line. Estimation of the cost  was  based  on  quantities  and  prices  for  material  as  well  as  installation  manhours, based on recent similar projects.

Preliminary  requirements  were  established  for  the  main  substation  based  on  the power  demand.  Equipment  budget  prices  and  costs  for  material  and  installation were established based on databases from recent similar projects.

Preliminary  requirements  were  established  for  the  site  distribution  power  lines. Estimation of the cost was based on quantities and prices for material as well as installation man-hours, based on recent similar projects.

Preliminary requirements were established for emergency power supply. A budget price was estimated based on recent similar projects.

## k) Service Vehicles and Equipment

An allowance was made for the service vehicles based on preliminary requirements and recent similar projects.

## 21.2.3 Basis of estimate for Indirect Costs

Preliminary estimation for indirect  costs  is  included  in  Table  21.7.  This  provision  was established by factorisation on the total direct cost and typically covers for the following major items detailed here under: Project Development, Project Implementation, Financial Costs and Closure Costs.

## a) Project Development

Project Development  mainly  includes:  Permitting  Process,  Land  Acquisition, Administration,  NSR  buyout,  Engineering  Studies  as  Feasibility  studies  and Independent Review, Metallurgical Testing, Geotechnical and Occupational Hazard studies, Social Impact Studies and Community Relations, Preproduction Operation Group and Legal Fees. No provision is made for development, implementation and operation of a demonstration plant.

<!-- image -->

## b) Project Implementation

Project Implementation mainly includes: EPCM, Spares, First Fills, Commissioning and Owner's Costs.

' EPCM '  includes Detailed Engineering, Procurement, Construction Management and Commissioning Assistance and Site Assistance.

Spares and First Fills are excluded from the initial capital cost but are considered as working capital.  Commissioning include commissioning spare parts, dry and wet commissioning as well as vendors representative on site.

Construction owner's costs include mainly construction indirect costs and Owner's Project team.

## c) Financial Costs

Financial Costs includes mainly insurances, escalation and interests incurred during construction. Escalation and interests are excluded from the Capital Cost. Working capital, taxes and duties are also excluded from the Capital Cost estimate but are considered in the financial analysis.

## d) Closure and Rehabilitation Costs

Preliminary indication is that no provision is required for closure and rehabilitation of the site.

## 21.2.4 Contingency

Based on the level of development stage of the Project as well as assessment of major risks,  a  factor  was  applied  to  estimate  the  provision  for  contingency.  No  contingency provision  was  made  to  cover  technological  risks  associated  with  the  process.  It  is expected that sufficiently developed engineering, adequate project management and tight cost control will be implemented in order to meet the budget for the Project.

## 21.2.5 Sustaining Capital Expenditures

There are no sustaining capital expenditures for the Hydrometallurgical Plant.

## 21.3 Operating Costs

The operating costs have been estimated for the Whabouchi operations that include the mine and concentrator operations and the tailings and waste disposal. They are estimated based on the average over the life of the Project. The mine operating costs include the costs for leasing the major equipment. The truck transport of the concentrate from the site to Chibougamau will be handled by a contractor and the transport to Valleyfield will be

## 21.3.1 Mining Operating Costs

Table 21.9 presents a summary of total estimated average operating costs for producing concentrate  in  Nemaska.  Those  costs  are  presented  in  Canadian  Dollars  (CAD$)  per tonne of concentrate produced. Operating costs were estimated based on the average over the life of the mine. Operating costs include the estimated cost of leased equipment over the life of the lease.

Table 21.9 - Total Estimated Average Operating Costs for Production of Concentrate

| Project Operating Costs           |   $/t Milled |   $/t Concentrate |
|-----------------------------------|--------------|-------------------|
| Mining Operating Costs            |        15.87 |             81.37 |
| Haulage of Tailings and Middlings |         0.91 |              4.68 |

## a) Mine Equipment Maintenance Costs

The equipment operating costs are derived from supplier quotations (2011-2012), historical  numbers  and  values  from  BBA's  internal  database.  The  equipment operating costs are split between fuel costs and unit operating costs, which usually include maintenance, parts, repairs, etc.

The maximum $/hr unit operating costs for the major equipment (excluding fuel and labour) are as follows:

- · $52.88/hr for the CAT390 hydraulic shovel;
- · $40.13/hr for the CAT772 haul truck;
- · $49.83/hr for the CAT988H loader;
- · $105.87/hr for the DTH drill.

The  yearly  mine  maintenance  operating  costs  are  summarized  for  all  primary, secondary and auxiliary equipment in Table 21.10. The equipment operating costs (excluding fuel) total $55.85 M over the LOM.

## b) Mine Fuel Consumption Costs

Mine  fuel  consumption  was  based  on  supplier  quotations  from  2011,  as  well  as historical trends from  an  internal  database.  The  fuel  consumption  costs  are calculated using a local fuel cost on site of $1.1046/L.

The yearly fuel  operating  consumption  is  summarized  for  all  primary,  secondary and auxiliary equipment in Table 21.11. As well, the total operating fuel costs for each  year  are  summarized  in  one  line  at  the  bottom  of  the  table.  The  unit  fuel consumptions are provided in the first column of the table in litres per hour. The total consumption calculations are dependent on the Gross Operating Hours (GOH) for the specific type of equipment, on the total shifts required in all materials, and on the utility factor.

The total equipment fuel costs over the LOM total $67.62 M.

## c) Blasting Costs

Blasting and loading services will be carried out under a blasting contract. Costs under this proposed contract have been validated with local suppliers. The emulsion and accessories costs are outlined below Table 21.12.

Table 21.12 - Blasting Costs by Category

| Category                   |   Blasting Costs |
|----------------------------|------------------|
| Fuel Price ($/L)           |           1.1046 |
| Emulsion ($/100 kg)        |         103      |
| Unitronic Double Prime ($) |          25.25   |
| Pentex D16 Booster ($)     |           8.9    |
| Surface Connector ($)      |           0.908  |

The powder factors for mineralized material and for waste are 0.30 and 0.26 kg/t, respectively. The total unit cost for blasting mineralized material and waste are 0.34 and 0.32 $/tonne (of blasted material), respectively. The powder factor is calculated by taking the total bulk emulsion mass per hole (i.e., kg/hole) and dividing by the expected rock mass per hole. The total unit cost is calculated by taking the sum of the total required emulsion cost, accessories cost and fuel cost over the life of the mine, and then dividing by the total mine plan tonnage.

Other mine operating costs related to blasting are limited to the costs associated for the  blasting  contractors.  The  following  salaries  are  allocated  to  the  blasting contractors on a monthly basis, over the life of the mine:

- · Site supervisor: $14,943/month;
- · MMU Operator: $10,775/month;
- · Mechanic (blast): $12,425/month.

## d) Mine Personnel

The mine personnel salaries were obtained from the 2011 Infomine Canadian Mine Salaries,  Wages  and  Benefits  Survey.  For  both  hourly  and  salaried  personnel, middle ranges were chosen from a summary of surface mined in Eastern Canada.

The total operating costs allocated to hourly personnel are approximately $93.53 M, whereas the total operating costs for salaried personnel reach a total of $44.49 M. This accounts for a total of $141.02 M in personnel operating costs over the life of the mine. A complete list of personnel salaries can be seen in the Table 21.13.

## 21.3.2 Haulage of Coarse Tailings

The estimated cost for the haulage of the coarse tailings is summarized in Table 21.16.

Table 21.16 - Estimated Operating Costs of Coarse Tailings Material

| Operating Costs             |   $/t milled |
|-----------------------------|--------------|
| Handling of Coarse Tailings |         0.91 |

The coarse tailings operating costs are separated from the mining costs, since they are not directly  related  to  the  LOM  plan,  and  do  not  require  the  same  haulage  schedule.  The tailings operating costs are calculated based on a few assumptions:

- · Under  one  (1)  Mt  of  coarse  tailings  material  is  re-handled  each  year  from  the conveyor;
- · The coarse tailings follows the same haul route as the waste rock material;
- · The time for loading coarse tailings material from conveyor is ten (10) minutes;
- · One (1)  truck  is  required  to  re-handle  all  of  the  coarse  tailings  material  from  the conveyor.

The  operating  costs  for  the  one  (1)  truck  required  for  the  handling  of  coarse  tailings material  incorporate  the  total  fuel  cost,  the  equipment  operating  cost,  and  the  cost associated to the operators who are assigned to that truck.

## 21.3.3 Processing Operating Costs

The estimated annual operating costs for the process plant are summarized in Table 21.17 for  unit  costs.  The  breakdown  of  the  major  components  such  as  manpower,  electrical loading,  consumables,  reagents,  and  maintenance  supplies  are  shown  by  sector.  The corresponding unit cost per tonne of mineralized material milled is also provided.

The plant operating costs were derived from Project specific process engineering, from supplier information, BBA's internal database, and benchmarked from similar operations.

## b) Employee Transport

The  cost  for  the  transportation  of  employees  is  for  chartering  a  50-passenger airplane between Montreal or Quebec and the Nemiscau airport, with stopovers in Chibougamau  and  Saguenay.  A  budget  price  was  obtained  at  $25,000/week.  It amounts to a total of 1.3 M$/y.

## 21.3.7 Concentrate Transport

The  cost  for  concentrate  transport  includes  truck  transport  from  the  mine  site  to  the Chibougamau  rail  track,  loading  of  concentrate  into  railcars,  rail  transport  to  the Hydrometallurgical  plant  in  Valleyfield.  The  cost  for  storage  at  Chibougamau  is  not included in the operating costs since Nemaska plans to build a pad for storage and this is therefore included in the capital cost estimate. The cost for the concentrate transport was obtained from different transport and handling service companies.

## 21.3.8 Hydrometallurgical Plant Operating Costs

Operating  costs  were  estimated  for  the  Hydrometallurgical  Plant  and  cover  the  costs related  to  the  transformation  of  spodumene  concentrate  into  lithium  hydroxide  and lithium carbonate.

The  operating  costs  are  based  on  a  concentrate  annual  feed  rate  of  213,558  tonnes,  a lithium hydroxide monohydrate production of 20,734 t/y and lithium carbonate production of 10,000 t/y.

The  sources  of  information  used  to  develop  the  operating  costs  include  in-house databases and outside sources particularly for reagents and consumables.

## a) Operating Costs Summary

The plant life average operating cost estimate is summarized in Table 21.29.

Table 21.29 - Average Operating Cost Estimate ($/year)

| Area                       | Average Operating Cost  ($/year)   |

| Total Operating Costs      | 48,938,864                         |

## b) Manpower Requirement

Table 21.30 presents the estimated personnel requirements for the hydrometallurgical plant operation by area. Administration employees responsible for  both  the  concentrator  and  the  hydrometallurgical  operations  are  based  in Valleyfield and are accounted for in the hydrometallurgical plant operating costs.

| Area           |   Number |
|----------------|----------|
| Administration |       14 |
| Operations     |       43 |
| Maintenance    |       14 |
| Metallurgy     |       10 |
| Total Manpower |       81 |

Table 21.30 - Total Personnel Requirement

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Manpower consists of 31 staff employees and 50 hourly employees. Total annual costs for the above manpower including base salary, expected overtime and fringe benefits have been estimated at $ 6.5 M.

## c) Electrical Power

The hydrometallurgical plant total operating electrical power is 27 MW resulting in annual  costs  of  $  10.6  M.  Approximately  80%  of  the  demand  is  from  the electrodialysis process. Electricity cost ($/kWh) was provided by Hydro-Quebec.

## d) Consumables and Wear Parts

Consumables include belt filter cloths, kiln liner replacement, ion exchange resin replacement, final product bags, electrodialysis membranes, etc. Also included in this  cost  category  are  potable  water  make-up  costs  (purchased  from  the  City  of Valleyfield)  and  liquid  tailings  disposal  costs.  Potable  water  ($/m )  and  tailings 3 disposal ($/kg of impurity) costs were provided by the City of Valleyfield.

Annual consumables and wear parts costs total $ 10.3 M. Similarly to the electrical costs,  about  80%  of  the  consumables  and  wear  parts  costs  are  related  to  the electrodialysis process (membrane replacement).

## e) Reagents and Chemicals

Lime, soda ash, sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid and carbon dioxide are required by the  hydrometallurgical  process.  Reagents  and  chemicals  costs  total  $  14.9  M annually. Lime and sulfuric acid costs represent almost 80% of the total.

## f) Natural Gas

Natural gas is used to fire the kiln, both product dryers and the boiler. Annual costs reach $ 5.2 M. Natural gas cost ($/m ) was provided by Gaz Metro. 3

## 21.3.9 Site Material Handling

Mobile equipment is used for continuous plant work, concentrate unloading and reclaim and final product handling. Personnel pick-up trucks costs are also included in this cost category.  Annually,  an  estimated  $  1.4  M  is  spent  for  site  material  handling  and personnel transportation on site.

## 21.3.10 Operating Costs per Product

In  order  to  determine  operating  costs  for  each  of  the  hydrometallurgical  plant  final products,  lithium  hydroxide  solution  production  costs  were  first  established.  Once  this base value was known, additional processing costs for converting this lithium hydroxide

solution into solid lithium hydroxide monohydrate and lithium carbonate were calculated. The operating cost summary per product is presented in Table 21.31.

Table 21.31 - Average Operating Cost Estimate (CAD$/year)

| Operating Cost  Area      | Cost ($/y)   |   Cost  ($/tonne  milled) | % of  Total Costs   | Cost  ($/t LiOH)   |   Cost Adder   ($/t LiOH- H2O) |   Cost Adder  ($/t Li CO3) 2 |

Based  on  the  above  values,  yearly  production  costs  were  calculated.  The  LiOH production cost (based on 20,828 t/y) is 43,276,098 $/y and the cost adders for LiOHH2O  (20,734  t/y)  and  Li2CO3  (10,000  t/y)  are  3,005,861  $/y  and  2,656,905  $/y respectively.

To determine each final product's total production cost, the LiOH cost was distributed according  to  the  solution  split  between  the  hydroxide  monohydrate  and  the  carbonate circuit (73.6% to LiOH-H2O and 26.4% to Li2CO3).

The LiOH distributed cost and the adders are combined and the operating cost is obtained by dividing this combined cost by the annual production tonnage. Results are shown in Table 21.32.

| Operating Cost  ($/t LiOH-H2O)   | Operating Cost  ($/t Li2 CO3)   |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| 1,681                            | 1,408                           |

## 22.0 ECONOMIC ANALYSIS

## 22.1 General

A preliminary economic analysis of the Project has been carried out using a cash flow model. The model is constructed using annual cash flows in constant money terms (third quarter  2012).  No  provision  is  made  for  the  effects  of  inflation.  As  required  in  the financial assessment of investment projects, the evaluation is carried out on a so-called '100% equity' basis, i.e. the debt and equity sources of capital funds are ignored. Results are presented before and after taxation.

The model reflects the base case macro-economic and technical assumptions given in this Report.

## 22.2 Assumptions

## 22.2.1 Macro-Economic Assumptions

The main macro-economic assumptions used in the base case are given in Table 22.1.

The  price  forecasts  for  Lithium  Hydroxide  Monohydrate  (LiOH-H2O)  and  Lithium Carbonate (Li2CO3) are based on projections from Roskill and SignumBOX studies.

The sensitivity analysis examines a range of prices 30% above and below these base case prices.

Table 22.1 - Macro-Economic Assumptions

| Item                                                                              | Unit       | Base Case Value   |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|-------------------|
| Lithium hydroxide monohydrate (LiOH-H2O)  Price Forecast (F.O.B. hydro-met plant) | USD/tonne  | 8,000             |
| Lithium carbonate (Li2CO3)  Price Forecast (F.O.B. hydro-met plant)               | USD/tonne  | 6,500             |
| Exchange Rate                                                                     | CAD/USD    | 1.00              |
| Discount Rate                                                                     | % per year | 8                 |
| Discount Rate Variants                                                            | % per year | 6 and 10          |

The  current  Canadian  tax  system  applicable  to  Mining  Resources  Income  is  used  to assess the Project's annual tax liabilities. This consists of federal and provincial corporate taxes  as  well  as  provincial  mining  taxes  (mining  taxes  in  Québec  were  revised  in  the 2010 budget). The federal and provincial corporate tax rates currently applicable over the Project's operating life are 15.0 % and 11.9 % of taxable income, respectively. The rate applicable  for  the  purpose  of  assessing  mining  taxes  is  16 %  of  taxable  income.  It  is uncertain at this time whether the 13 % processing allowance rate (in the Quebec Mining

<!-- image -->

Tax legislation) associated with processing to a more advanced stage within the province would be applicable in this instance. For this reason, the more conservative processing allowance rate of 7 % is used until confirmation can be obtained from the ' Ministère des Ressources naturelles et de la Faune '.

Apart from the base case discount rate of 8 %, two (2) variants of 6 and 10 % are used to determine  the  net  present  value  of  the  Project.  These  discount  rates  represent  possible weighted-average costs of capital to the investor.

## 22.2.2 Mineral Royalties

The present  financial  analysis  incorporates  a  net  profit  royalty  agreement.  The  royalty payment is based on 3 % of the 'unit value' of the concentrate produced at the mill. The unit  value  of  the  concentrate  is  calculated  from  the  pre-established  sales  price  of  $300 and operating cost of $200 per tonne, representing unit revenue and operating expenses, respectively, less all capital expenses incurred over the life of the Project, expressed per tonne  of  estimated  concentrate  production.  Based  on  the  capital  expense  estimates associated  with  this  Project,  the  unit  value  of  the  concentrate  amounts  to  $55.51  per tonne, leading to a royalty payment of $1.665 per tonne of concentrate produced.

## 22.2.3 Technical Assumptions

The main technical assumptions used in the base case are given in Table 22.2.

| Hydro-metallurgical Processing Costs           | ($/tonne concentrate) | 229.16  |

Table 22.2 - Technical Assumptions

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

A reduced production of 894 Kt milled in the first production year provides for a ramp-up to the full capacity of 1 095 Kt milled per year. The amount of concentrate produced is a function of the mill head grade and milling process recovery and thus, varies from 178 Kt to 225 Kt per year.

## 22.3 Financial Model and Results

A summary of the base case results is given in Table 22.3. The cash flow statement for the base case is given in Table 22.4.

The summary and cash flow statement indicate that the total pre-production capital costs are evaluated at $438.8 M and the sustaining capital requirement is evaluated at $8.8 M, for  a  total  of  $447.7  M  over  the  life  of  the  Project.  The  mine  rehabilitation  trust  fund payments are estimated at $1.9 M.

For  taxation  purposes,  the  indirect  costs  and  contingency  components  of  the  preproduction  capital  cost  estimate  were  redistributed  by  area  as  shown  in  the  cash  flow statement of Table 22.4. The cash flow statement shows a capital cost breakdown by area and  provides  a  preliminary  capital  spending  schedule  over  the  2-year  pre-production period  of  the  Project.  Working  capital  requirements  are  estimated  at  2  months  of  total annual operating costs.  As  operating  costs  vary  annually  over  the  mine  life,  additional amounts of working capital are injected or withdrawn as required.

The total revenue is estimated at $4,083.1 M or $207.91/tonne milled. The total operating costs are estimated at $1,875.2 M or $95.48/tonne milled.

The financial results indicate a before-tax Net Present Value (' NPV ') of $567.2 M at a discount rate of 8%. The before-tax Internal Rate of Return (' IRR ')  is  23.3%  and  the payback period is 3.9 years.

The  after-tax  Net  Present  Value  is  $330.5  M  at  a  discount  rate  of  8%.  The  after-tax Internal Rate of Return is 18.9% and the payback period is 4.0 years.

## 22.4 Sensitivity Analysis

A  sensitivity  analysis  has  been  carried  out,  with  the  base  case  described  above  as  a starting point, to assess the impact of changes in total pre-production capital expenditure (' CAPEX '), operating costs (' OPEX ') and product prices on the Project's NPV @ 8 % and IRR. Each variable is examined one-at-a-time. An interval of ± 30% with increments of 10% was used for all three variables.

The  before-tax  results  of  the  sensitivity  analysis,  as  shown  in  Figure  22.1  and  Figure 22.2, indicate that, within the limits of accuracy of the cost estimates in this study, the Project's  before-tax  viability  does  not  seem  significantly  vulnerable  to  the  underestimation of capital and operating costs, taken one at-a-time. As seen in Figure 22.1, the net  present  value  is  more  sensitive  to  variations  in  operating  expenses  than  preproduction CAPEX, as shown by the steeper slope of the OPEX curve. As expected, the net present value is most sensitive to variations in price (both product prices are varied together).  The  net  present  value  becomes  marginal  at  the  lowest  price  variation  in  the interval, i.e., at -30 % (this corresponds to a price combination of $5,600 and $4,550 per tonne  for lithium  hydroxide  monohydrate  and  lithium  carbonate,  respectively).  A reduction of about 31% in both prices is found to result in a break-even net present value @  8%.  Figure  22.1,  showing  variations  in  internal  rate  of  return,  provides  the  same conclusions.  As  seen,  the  IRR  becomes  marginal  (just  above  the  8%  IRR  break-even dashed line) at the lowest price variation of the interval. Compared to Figure 22.1, which shows linear variations in net present value for the three (3) variables studied, variations associated  with  internal  rate  of  return  are  not  linear.  Because  of  the  different  timing associated  with  pre-production  CAPEX  versus  OPEX,  the  IRR  is  more  sensitive  to negative variations in pre-production CAPEX than OPEX, but remains less sensitive for positive variations, as evidenced by the shape of the CAPEX curve.

The after-tax results of the sensitivity analysis are shown in Figure 22.3 and Figure 22.4. Figure 22.3 indicates that the Project's after-tax viability is mostly vulnerable to a price forecast reduction while being less affected by under-estimation of capital and operating costs. A reduction of about 28% in both price forecasts (down to $5,760 and $4,680 per tonne for lithium hydroxide monohydrate and lithium carbonate, respectively) results in a break-even net present value @ 8%.

Figure 22.4, showing variations in internal rate of return, provides the same conclusions. Here, the price curve intersects the 8% IRR break-even dashed line at the same relative variation of about -28%.

The PEA is preliminary in nature. There is no certainty that the conclusions reached in the  PEA  will  be  realized.  Mineral  resources  that  are  not  mineral  reserves  do  not  have demonstrated conomic viability.

## 23.0 ADJACENT PROPERTIES

Significant adjacent properties in the immediate surroundings of the Whabouchi property include  ten  (10)  properties  owned  by  Monarques  Resources  Inc.  (' Monarques '),  the advanced stage Nisk property which hosts the Nisk-1 Ni-Cu-Co-PGE deposit, and nine (9) early stage properties to the east and to the west of the Property, which show potential for  hosting  magmatic  and  volcanogenic  sulfides  mineralization  as  well  as  spodumenebearing pegmatites. Tucana Lithium owns an exploration property located in between the Whabouchi Property and the Nisk property. Figure 23.1 shows the location of adjacent properties surrounding the Whabouchi property.

Monarques' Lac  Levac property  hosts  the Nisk-1  deposit,  an  elongated  body  of serpentinized  ultramafic  rocks  that  intrude  paragneiss  and  amphibolite  sequences.  The ultramafic  rock  intrusion  is  interpreted  as  a  sill  composed  of  at  least  two  (2)  distinct ultramafic lithological units: a grey serpentinized peridotite with magnetite veinlets, and a black serpentinized peridotite with chrysotile veinlets hosting the Ni-Cu-Co-PGE sulphide mineralization. The Nisk-1 deposit hosts NI 43-101 compliant mineral resources totalling 1.25 Mt grading 1.1% Ni, 0.6% Cu and 1.3 g/t Pt+Pd in the measured category,

0.78 Mt grading 1.0% Ni, 0.5% Cu and 1.2 g/t Pt+Pd with an additional 1.0 Mt grading 0.8% Ni, 0.3% Cu and 1.5 g/t Pt+Pd (Théberge - June 2011).

Other exploration properties also developing spodumene-bearing pegmatites are located in the region surrounding the Whabouchi Property. The Rose-Pivert property owned by Critical Element Corp. and located 47 km northwest of Whabouchi hosts an NI 43-101 compliant mineral resources of  11.4  Mt  grading  1.34%  Li2O  in  the  Indicated  category with an additional 2.2 Mt grading 1.27% Li2O in the Inferred category at 0.75% Li2O cutoff grade (InnovExplo - Dec 2010). Galaxy Resources Inc. lithium property located 105 km northwest of Whabouchi hosts an NI 43-101 compliant with in-pit mineral resources of  11.7  Mt  grading  1.30%  Li2O  in  the  Indicated  category  with  an  additional  10.5  Mt grading  1.20%  Li2O  in  the  Inferred  category  at  0.75%  Li2O  cut-off  grade  (SRK  November 2010). At 125 km southeast of Whabouchi, the Moblan property jointly owned by Perilya Ltd and Soquem hosts an NI 43-101 compliant with inpit mineral resources totalling 4.5 Mt grading 1.66% Li2O in the Measured category and 4.9 Mt grading 1.43% Li2O  in  the  Indicated  category,  with  an  additional  1.1  Mt  grading  1.42%  Li2O  in  the Inferred category at 0.6% Li2O cut-off grade (Perilya NR - May 2011).

The information is not necessarily indicative of the mineralization on the Property that is the  subject  of  the  technical  report.  The  Qualified  Person  has  been  unable  to  verify  the information related to the NI 43-101 mineral resources reported in this section.

## 24.2 Whabouchi Construction

## 24.2.1 Construction Infrastructure

A construction camp and a permanent camp are required for the Project. These two (2) camps will be built at the location of the Compagnie  de Construction et de Développement Crie Ltée (' CCDC ') site. The CCDC will be mandated for the two (2) camps and all required services.

Initially,  the  permanent  camp  will  be  used  as  a  construction  camp.  A  supplemental construction  camp  (to  accommodate  the  expected  peak  workforce)  will  be  built  as  an extension  to  the  permanent  camp.  In  total,  125  rooms  in  the  permanent  camp  and  90 rooms in the supplemental construction camp will be built for a total of 215 rooms.

The  permanent  camp  will  be  in  place  in  April  2014  for  the  start  of  construction.  The supplemental construction camp will be built for September 2014 and will be used until the end of the construction and commissioning period.

Permanent power will be delivered by Hydro-Québec in time for the start of construction. Until the time when the main substation will be commissioned, construction power will be supplied through a temporary installation.

## 24.2.2 Mining

In  2013, initial  orders  for  mining  equipment are expected to be placed. Deliveries will start  in  the  third  quarter  of  2014  and  assembly  will  have  taken  place  in  time  for  preproduction to start in the first quarter of 2015. Logistics for on-site assembly plans will be made  to  ensure  that  all  equipment  will  be  operational  in  time  to  perform  the  mine production tonnages corresponding to the mine planning requirements.

## 24.2.3 Site Infrastructure

Detailed engineering related to site infrastructures is scheduled to start with the award of the EPCM services. Related procurement activities are to follow three (3) months later. Construction of site facilities and infrastructure, such as change house, offices, maintenance facilities etc., is expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2014.

## 24.2.4 Concentrator Processing Plant

## a) Processing Plant Implementation Plan

The processing plant implementation plan takes into account that detailed engineering is required to start within 12 months prior to the construction start-up. The  implementation  plan  covers  the  period  from  the  rod  mill  and  ball  mill specification preparation up to the end of the processing plant commissioning. The

<!-- image -->

schedule  is  derived  from  major  equipment  delivery  information  obtained  from suppliers during this Study.

## b) Engineering

In  order  to  achieve  a  proposed  plant  commissioning  and  start-up  in  the  fourth quarter of 2015,  proper sequencing  of  detailed engineering is fundamental. Enclosing the building before winter conditions prevent efficient mechanical and electrical  installation  is  key  to  the  success  of  this  plan.  To  achieve  this,  a  preengineered building shell-type construction has been selected. Key to this type of installation is freezing the equipment layout and building sizing early. In order to achieve  this,  all  major  mechanical  equipment  with  potential  impact  on  these elements will be designed and procured at the onset of the Project.

The detailed engineering for the processing plant is estimated at 18 months and will include the mobile crushing equipment and the process plant.

## c) Long Lead Items

As part of this Study, budgetary prices and delivery periods have been requested from  suppliers  for  major  equipment.  The  equipment  fabrication  times  for  the pressure  filters,  ball  and  rod  mills  have  a  delivery  period  from  12  to  14  months, followed by the leach tank agitators with a fabrication time of up to 12 months. The implementation schedule allows for 14 months for the crusher and grinding mills to be delivered on site.

## d) Procurement Plan

In order to complete engineering, certified drawings are required. For this reason, efforts  will  be  made  to  purchase  all  other  equipment  early.  This  has  a  secondary advantage of securing early fabrication slots, hence reducing the impact of potential fabrication delays. The procurement of equipment will include the preparation of comprehensive engineering and tender documents.

## e) Construction

The first priority is site preparation and temporary installations such as construction management camp and temporary construction power distribution. Early during the site preparation, the concrete contractor will install a batch plant to be ready for the first concrete pour. Construction activities will start with concrete foundations for the  grinding  mills  and  concentrator  building.  The  building  shell,  complete  with siding panels, will be erected. Other equipment foundations, elevated concrete slabs and finally the slab on grade in the main process building will precede the erection of the balance of the steel. The structural steel work of the main process building will follow, starting from the grinding area moving northeast along the plant site.

The building roofing and siding will follow to complete building closure that will allow workers to work in an enclosed area. The internal equipment steel supports and  platforms  will  then  precede  the  grinding  mills  installation  and  mechanical, piping and  electrical work  will  continue  to completion  in  June  2015.  The commissioning  will  follow.  All  other  work  areas  not  on  the  critical  path  will  be optimized, based on resources leveling and availability.

## f) Commissioning and Start-Up

The commissioning activities will be performed by a team comprised of construction managers, contractors, engineers, and operation personnel in order to maximize efficiency. A six (6) month commissioning period has been scheduled. The dry commissioning will start while the construction is still on-going. A detailed commissioning  schedule  will  identify  process  systems  that  can  be  commissioned prior  to  construction  completion and turned over to Operations to reduce the last minute  turnover  procedures.  Commissioning  will  start  with  individual  equipment evaluation followed by a dry run for a short period. Systems will then be flushed and  run  with  water,  where  possible,  to  check  functionality  of  controls  and equipment.  Any  discovered  deficiencies  or  leaks  will  then  be  repaired.  Once  all process  deficiencies  are  corrected,  systems  will  be  turned  over  to  the  production personnel to start normal operation.

## 24.2.5 Water Management

Detailed engineering for water management will be initiated in the fall of 2013. Actual earthworks, dykes and trenches, required for the start-up of operations, will be carried out between both the summer and fall of 2014 and 2015.

## 24.3 Valleyfield Construction

This part of the Project will follow the same schedule basis. Delivery periods have been requested  from  suppliers  for  the  major  equipment.  The  long  lead  equipment  area  as follows:

- · Electrodialysis cells delivery 26 to 65 weeks After Reception of Order (' ARO ');
- · Kiln and cooler delivery 52 weeks ARO;
- · Crystallizer delivery 48 weeks ARO.

The construction and commissioning are aligned with the completion of the Wabouchi Plant since the concentrate from this Plant is required for start-up.

## 25.0 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS

## 25.1 Conclusion

The Whabouchi Lithium Deposit and Hydromet Plant Project consists in the development of  an  open mine 300 Km North of Chibougamau and a lithium compounds production complex to be built in Valleyfield.

The  parameters  used  in  this  Preliminary  Economic  Assessment  include  developing  a 1,095 Mtpy  open-pit mine using diesel hydraulic equipment, construction of a concentrator at the mine site (crushing, heavy media, grinding, flotation circuits) with a nominal capacity of 3,000 tpd of mineralized material at 90%  availability and construction of a lithium compounds complex production  plant at Valleyfield.

BBA has examined the technical and economic aspects of the Whabouchi mine project within the level of precision of a feasibility study and Met-Chem the Hydrometallurgical plant  within  the  level  of  a  Preliminary  Economic  Assessment.  The  current  report  is  a Preliminary Economic Assessment ('PEA') in conformance with the standards required by NI 43-101 and Form 43 101F1.

A computed cash flow analysis was developed by Met-Chem from the technical aspects and on metal prices projections made for lithium hydroxide and carbonate from two (2) market studies.

As it stands, the Whabouchi deposit contains an economic Mineral Resource.

Consequently,  Met-Chem  and  BBA  conclude  that  Whabouchi  Lithium  Deposit  and Hydromet  Plant  Project  is  technically  feasible  as  well  as  economically  viable.  The authors of this Technical Report consider the Whabouchi Project to be sufficiently robust to warrant moving it to the feasibility.

## 25.2 Risks Evaluation

Several aspects of the Whabouchi Lithium Deposit and Hydrometallurgical Plant Project are fairly well defined, however some aspects and assumptions need to be better defined and confirmed during the feasibility stage. Met-Chem  and BBA  made  several recommendations to be followed up to for the next phase in Section 26.

The  most  significant  risks  in  the  Project  identified  are  in  technology,  markets  and environmental as explained in the following paragraphs.

The size and grade of the Whabouchi deposit are well defined. The process to produce spodumene concentrate is also well known and should not be problematic. However the processes  of  making  lithium  hydroxide  monohydrate  from  spodumene  concentrate  by

<!-- image -->

electro  dialyse  and  lithium  carbonate  from  lithium  hydroxide  in  solution,  have  been developed by Nemaska with the assistance of SGS Minerals. These processes, for which Nemaska has filed 2 patent applications, have not been used on a commercial basis and therefore there are risks that the production and capital costs related to this portion of the processes differ from the ones used in the economic analysis which could have a direct impact on the economics of the Project.

Lithium  is  considered  as  an  industrial  mineral  and  the  sales  prices  for  the  different lithium compounds are not public. Sales agreements are negotiated on an individual and private  basis  with  each  different  end-user.  Therefore  it  is  possible  that  the  sales  prices used in the financial analysis be different than the actual market when Nemaska is in fact in  a  position  to  sell  lithium  compounds.  In  addition,  there  are  a  limited  number  of producers  of  lithium  compounds  and  it  is  possible  that  these  existing  producers  try  to prevent new comers in the chain of supply by increasing their production capacity and lowering sales prices. In such case the economics of the Project could be affected.

One important uncertainty of the Project is the delay to obtain the required authorization (Certificat d'autorisation) to start construction of the mine and concentrator at Whabouchi,  as  well  as  the  underlying  conditions  to  the  Authorization  certificate  from MDDEP. Consequently it is possible that the capital and operating costs forecasted in the financial model be different and increased in such a way as to affect the economic of the Project.

The  delays to obtain construction permits, therfeore beginning of production of concentrate at Whabouchi, may allow other project to begin production before Nemaska and therefore reduce the portion of the market that Nemaska is targeting, which would impact sales level and economic of the Project.

Nemaska  intends  to  produce  mainly  lithium  hydroxide  monohydrate  to  address  the increasing  demand  for  that  compound  due  to  use  in  the  making  of  cathodes  for rechargeable batteries. If cathode manufacturers use less hydroxide than expected or if the demand for rechargeable batteries, mainly in the electric and hybrid vehicles, is less than forecasted, it could have an effect on the sales price of that compound and the need for new production.

## 26.0 RECOMMENDATIONS

This Preliminary Economic Assessement showed that Whabouchi Lithium Deposit and Hydromet Plant Project is technically feasible as well as economically viable.

The following recommendations should be considered to support the feasibility:

## 26.1 For Whabouchi Site

- · Perform a detailed investigation of the discharge water quality for both discharge points (reject pile and pit dewatering/run-off);
- · Continue kinetics testwork on waste rock and tailings samples;
- · Continue environmental investigation to comply with regulations;
- · Continue local communities discussions to better present the Project;
- · Continue discussions with Hydro-Quebec to firm-up power supply and costs to site;
- · Prepare to award long lead items contracts at the beginning of detailed engineering;
- · Continue discussions with CN Rail to firm-up a potential agreement for concentrate transportation;
- · Start  recruitment  of  Owner's  Construction  Management  personnel  early.  Include sufficient float in schedule to minimize delays risks.

## 26.2 For Hydrometallurgical Plant

- · Prior to land acquisition, soil characterization survey should be completed;
- · Prior to land acquisition, geotechnical survey should be completed;
- · Complete metallurgical test works to better define size of process equipment;
- · Further define aluminium silicates and gypsum by-product characteristics in order make these products attractive to potential clients;
- · Continue environmental investigation to comply with regulations;
- · Continue local communities discussions to better present the Project;
- · Continue discussions with Hydro-Quebec to firm-up power supply and costs to site;
- · Prepare to award long lead items contracts at the beginning of detailed engineering;
- · Complete a trade of study of electrodialysis versus electrosynthesis.
