## 1 SUMMARY

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The Cantung Mine is a primary producer of tungsten concentrate from underground mine  operations.    It  was  opened  in  1962  and  operated  fairly  continuously  until  it  was shutdown in 1986 for 15 years due to low tungsten prices, reopening in 2001. A short term closure from late 2003 to mid-2005 also took place. Recent strong tungsten prices allowed NATCL to re-open the mine in September 2005.  Currently, the major features and facilities associated with Cantung are as follows:

- · The Cantung deposits, consisting of the Open Pit resource near surface, and the E Zone reserve, underground.
- · The  physical  plant  site  including  an  underground  mine,  a  small  open  pit, process  plant,  diesel  power  plant,  workshops,  warehouses,  administration buildings, a town site and single status accommodation, plus an airstrip.
- · Waste rock dumps and a tailings storage facility.

The  cash  flow  estimate  in  this  report  is  based  on  July  1,  2009  Mineral  Reserves, summarized in Table 1-1.

The  purpose  of  this  report  is  to  update  the  annual  reserves  and  resources  for  the Cantung Mine.

| TOTAL Probable Reserves     | 1,020,699 |             1.08 | 1,105,602 |

Notes:

- 1. Mineral Reserves conform to CIM and NI43-101 requirements.
- 2. All Mineral Reserves are classified as Probable.
- 3. Mineral Reserves are estimated at a cutoff grade of 0.80% WO3.
- 4. A minimum mining width of 15 feet was used.

The Cantung Mine produces ore at a rate of 1,100 stpd.  Mineral Reserves support a mine life of 2.5 years, ending in Q4 2011.  Primary mining methods included, cut and fill, longhole stoping and pillar-remnant ore recovery using different techniques.  Currently, longhole methods are planned for mining the majority of the remaining reserves, both for pillar recovery and for primary mining in areas with favourable geometry.

Processing is carried out by gravity and flotation circuits.  Final products include a premium  gravity  concentrate  (G1),  containing  65%  WO3  and  a  flotation  concentrate containing 47% WO3.

## CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

The Cantung Mine is positioned to take advantage of recent high prices for tungsten. The  Mine  has  the  advantages  of  considerable  operating  history,  relatively  low  capital requirements,  and  established  contacts  with  suppliers  and  customers.    The  Mine  has operated successfully in the past, however, it should be noted that it is a relatively high cost producer, and has experienced previous shutdowns during periods of low tungsten prices and soft markets. In NATCL's opinion, the key risk to mine profitability lies in tungsten price sustainability and mined grades over the remaining mine life.

Given the forecast continued demand for tungsten metal, and price forecasts, NATCL is of the opinion that the base case G1 price scenario of US$205/MTU is reasonable for the entire life of mine.  At prices below current levels, the Mine generates positive cash flow, so there is some margin to allow for negative changes in the mine plan and cost estimates.

When production is taken into  account,  Mineral  Reserves  have  increased  since  the previous reserve estimate of October 1, 2008.  Increases are due to exploration of new zones, inclusion of lower-grade areas rendered economic by higher prices, and planned pillar recovery in previously mined areas through the use of longhole mining methods.

There  are  Mineral  Resources  in  the  Open  Pit/PUG  Zone  that  could  potentially  be mined.  Past open pit and PUG designs proposed production in the order of more than one year of mill feed.

As long as development and stope preparation continues in a timely manner, longhole mining  should  provide  steady  production  at  a  lower  cost  than  cut  and  fill  mining. Longhole pillar mining carries a risk of lower grades from higher dilution; however, life of  mine  plan  production  estimates  carry  a  reasonable  and  appropriate  allowance  for expected dilution.

## ECONOMIC ANALYSIS

The Pre-Tax Cash Flow Projection shown in Table 1-2 has been generated from the life of mine operational data , and capital and operating cost data.  The Cash Flow starts July 2009 (the Mineral Reserve estimation date), and is organized by NATC's fiscal year, which  runs  from  October  to  September.    A  summary  of  the  key  criteria  is  provided below.

## ECONOMIC CRITERIA

## PHYSICALS

- · Mine life:
- · Operations 365 days per year
- · Mill  throughput  of  1,100  tons  per  day  from  underground,  or  approximately 400,000 tons per year.
- · Metallurgy as per recent mill performance:
- o Tungsten recovery 79.0%
- o Gravity concentrate (G1)
-  Grade 65%
-  Distribution 75%
-  Recovery relative to mill feed 59.3%
- o Flotation concentrate
-  Grade 47%
-  Distribution 25%
-  Recovery relative to mill feed 19.7%

2.5 years

• Total mill feed: 1,020,999 tons at a grade of 1.08% WO3

## NORTH AMERICAN TUNGSTEN CORPORATION LTD.

## REVENUE

- · Tungsten selling price over entire life of mine
- o US$205/MTU for G1 product
- o US$245/MTU  for APT converted from flotation concentrate less conversion charges and process losses
- · Revenue recognized at the time of production
- •
- Exchange rate US$1: $C1.16
- · Teck Resources Ltd. royalty  of 1%
- · Insurance, Freight &amp; Marketing charges of $280/ton
- · Moisture content &lt; 1% (Flotation product)

## COSTS

• Sustaining capital: $6.9 million

• Exploration: $1.4 million

• The average operating cost over the mine life, including head office cost, is estimated to be $152.22 per ton milled

## CASH FLOW MODEL

Considering the  Project  on  a  stand-alone  basis,  the  undiscounted  pre-tax  cash  flow totals  CDN$9.7  million  over  the  mine  life.    As  an  operating  mine  without  significant capital requirements, cash flow is anticipated to be positive over the course of the mine life.

The site Unit Cost of Production is CDN$187 per MTU of WO3.  Net Present Value (NPV)  at  a  6%  discount  rate,  pre-income  tax  is  $9.3  million.    A  low  discount  rate  is appropriate due to the short mine life, and lower risk associated with an operating mine. This  is  a  2009  constant  dollar  model  and,  as  mine  life  is  relatively  short  (2.5  years), introduction of inflation/deflation criteria to the model will make little difference to NPV figures.

## PROJECT SENSITIVITY

Figure 1-1 shows the project sensitivity to the following factors:

- · Tungsten price
- · Operating costs
- · C$:US$ exchange rate
- · Head grade
- · Mill recovery

FIGURE 1-1    SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS

The Cantung Mine is located in the Nahanni area of western Northwest Territories, Canada, approximately 300 km by road northeast of Watson Lake, Yukon, close to the Yukon border.  The mine is a primary producer of tungsten concentrate from open pit and underground mines.  It was opened in 1962.

Cantung  is  located  in  the  rugged  mountain  wilderness  of  the  Selwyn  Mountains, where severe winter conditions prevail from October to May, with temperatures as low as -40°C and substantial  snowfall.    Local  terrain  is  characterized  by  steep  mountains  and narrow  valley  bottoms.    There  are  a  number  of  avalanche  slide  paths  in  the  area,  and avalanche monitoring and control is an ongoing requirement in the winter.

## INFRASTRUCTURE

Existing underground and surface infrastructure at the property includes the following:

- · Underground workings of a total strike length of 5,000 ft, with a main haulage drift at the 3,950 ft level and a number of ramps at different levels.
- · An open pit located south of the main underground orebody, at the 4900 level.
- · An  underground  maintenance shop comprising large service bays and warehouse facilities, equipped with overhead cranes.
- · Primary, secondary, and tertiary crushing plants equipped with rod and ball mills, plus gravity and flotation equipment
- · A mill building with offices and a maintenance shop.
- · An analytical lab fitted with a Leco sulphur analyzer, colorimetric spectrophotometer, and AA analyzers.
- · Concentrate storage facilities.
- · Tailings ponds and a polishing pond.
- · A backfill plant.
- · A warehouse for reagents and other supplies.
- · A pumping station.
- · Two diesel fuel tanks, each of a capacity of 360,000 litres.

The water supply is provided from the Flat River and is restricted to 45,000 m  per 3 week in accordance with the Water Licence.

The power supply is provided by a powerhouse equipped with diesel generators with a total capacity of 5.3 MW.

The original operators of the Cantung mine built and maintained a town at the mine site, known as Tungsten, complete with all necessary facilities.  Currently, only a portion of  the  existing  town  site  is  in  use.    Employees  are  accommodated  in  an  80-person

apartment complex, in town house units and in staff rooms above the main office.  The site can accommodate up to 140 people at a time.

## GEOLOGY

Southeastern Yukon and southwestern Northwest Territories are underlain by a thick sequence of late Precambrian and lower Paleozoic sedimentary strata, which are intruded by several Cretaceous granitic plutons.  Basement rocks comprise upwards of 3,000 m of fine-grained Proterozoic clastic sediments, predominantly slate and phyllite, referred to as the Grit Unit.  In the mine workings, the lowest stratigraphic unit exposed is argillite of the  Proterozoic  Grit  Unit,  referred  to  as  the  Older  or  Lower  Argillite.    The  overlying Swiss Cheese Limestone, or Chert Unit as it is referred to at the mine, is in the order of 40 m to 50 m thick.  The Ore Limestone is approximately 30 m thick in the Open Pit, thickening  to  approximately  100  m  in  the  underground  E  Zone.    The  stratigraphically overlying  argillite  and  interbanded  quartzite,  which  averages  approximately  150  m  in thickness, is referred to at the mine as the Younger or Upper Argillite.  At the top of the local stratigraphic sequence is a light buff dolomite with interbedded quartzite, which has a  maximum  thickness  of  approximately  600  m,  however,  this  is  not  seen  in  the  mine workings.

The Open Pit and E Zone orebodies lie on the west limb of the Flat River Syncline. This  limb  is  steeply  dipping  and  overturned  in  the  west,  but  becomes  flat  to  the  east, where in the area around the two mined deposits it forms a recumbent anticlinal fold that trends east to west.  The Open Pit lies on the flat lying upper limb of this fold and the E Zone on the lower limb.

Two of the deposits at Cantung have been mined.  These are the original Open Pit orebody,  which  was  mined  from  1962  to  1973,  and  the  E  Zone,  which  was  mined between  1973  and  1986,  again  between  January  2002  and  December  2003,  and  is currently in production.  Both deposits are in calc-silicate skarn zones that replace the Ore Limestone.

## NORTH AMERICAN TUNGSTEN CORPORATION LTD.

Mineralization  at  the  Cantung  mine  comprises  skarn  replacements  within  the  Ore Limestone.  At the Open Pit, mineralization is also present as lower grade replacements in the underlying Chert Unit.  The Open Pit skarn ore is comprised of scheelite and minor chalcopyrite disseminated in a gangue of pyrrhotite, diopside, garnet, and actinolite.  The E Zone ore differs in several respects from Open Pit ore.  It typically contains massive to semi-massive  pyrrhotite  and,  in  addition  to  pyroxene  and  garnet,  contains  abundant hydrated calc-silicates actinolite and biotite.

## EXPLORATION

The mine property has been covered almost completely by ground and airborne magnetic  and  electromagnetic  surveys,  and  by  geochemical  stream  sediment  and  soil sampling. No obvious targets were discovered by these surveys, with the exception of the geochemical  anomalies  in  the  upper  reaches  of  Rifle  Range  Creek.  The  other  targets listed  below  are  of  a  geological  nature  and  are  mainly  suggested  by  earlier  geological mapping or diamond drilling. Up to 2007 Exploration work has been limited to a few holes in the Open Pit/PUG Zone since the mine ceased production in 1986. A diamond drill  program was reinitiated in mid 2007 including some surface drilling (one hole on Sheet Mountain), drilling in the PUG but primarily in the west extension, E-zone and the area below 3700 elevation.

Since start up in 2006, 155 Definition Drill Holes were undertaken for a total of 19,787 feet  if  diamond  drilling  averaging  127  feet  in  depth.  Since  2006,  a  further  250 Exploration  Diamond  Drills  were  competed  encompassing  65,171  feet  of  diamond drilling and averaging 260 ft in depth.

Drilling  focused  on  the  area  below  3700  (the  area  below  the  lowest  mine workings). In addition drilling above 3700 (but from 3700 level) confirmed the presence of mineralization above the level and to the west of current workings.

The mineralization conforms to that of the currently mined areas. Specifically the majority of the mineralization is limited to the ore limestone with minor intersections in the 'swiss cheese' limestone. The other area investigated was the central flats.

## NORTH AMERICAN TUNGSTEN CORPORATION LTD.

The diamond drilling was undertaken by Boart Longyear utilizing a LM75 diamond drill. All core was BQTK size.

The diamond drillhole database for the Cantung mine property, which is complete except for the drilling done on the Baker showing, comprises 1,847 (an additional 107 diamond  drill  holes  since  October  2008)  drill  holes.  The  drillholes  are  concentrated around the known deposits, mainly those that have been mined - the open pit and E Zone. Outside of these areas of exploration, diamond drilling is sparse or non-existent.

The following exploration targets have been identified. Those targets in and close to the E Zone underground workings that could be accessed and put into production most quickly are given the highest priority, as they are the most likely to extend the current mine life.

West of the Western extension

Target 2:

In  addition  there  is  a  high  degree  of  probability  that  tonnage  can  be  found  by 'data mining'. In 2008, 26% of tonnage to the mill came from areas outside of reserves. Recent  modeling  has  at  least  temporarily  removed  many  sub-grade  or  areas  of  poor confidence level (due to ground conditions and/or mined out openings) from reserves. It is  anticipated  that  at  least  some  of  these  areas  will  be  put  back  in  resource/reserve categories over the next year.

NATCL notes that some mining zone nomenclature may cause confusion for those unfamiliar with the Cantung deposits.  The E-Zone refers both to the entire underground orebody, and also to the few remaining stopes that do not fit into a subzone category such as Main, South Flats, or West Extension.

## MINING OPERATIONS

In the past, the mine used a variety of mining methods including room and pillar, cut and  fill,  longhole  stoping  with  and  without  delayed  backfill,  and  pillar-remnant  ore recovery using different techniques.

Currently, longhole methods are used for the majority of the remaining reserves, both for  pillar  recovery  and  for  primary  mining  in  areas  with  favourable  geometry.    Access drifts  are  driven  under  the  old  workings,  providing  drill  locations  for  upholes  into remnant pillars above.  The drill patterns form a draw cone from the access up to the base of the ore - this waste is mucked first after blasting, and discarded.  In some cases, the pillars are surrounded by unconsolidated waste fill from previous cut and fill mining, and higher  levels  of  dilution  are  expected  as  a  result.    In  other  cases,  the  pillars  are surrounded by void space, and extraction is expected to be lower, as some ore will be

## NORTH AMERICAN TUNGSTEN CORPORATION LTD.

blasted outwards into the old workings and will not be recovered.  Cut and fill methods are  planned  for  areas  with  narrower  ore  widths.    Mining  widths  for  cut  and  fill  are expected to be approximately 15 ft.  Waste rock will be used as backfill for the working areas.  There are areas in the old workings where pillars have failed and the hangingwall has  deteriorated.    The  area  of  pillar  failure  is  expected  to  expand  as  pillar  mining progresses, however, no threats to active areas are anticipated.

The Cantung Mine workings extend vertically from 3600 up to the 4350 level and cover a strike length of approximately 5,000 ft.  In order of size, the key underground mining reserve areas are:

- · Main Zone (Pillar Recovery)
- · West Extension (below 3700)
- · West Extension (below 3570)
- · West Extension
- · South Flats Pillar Zone
- · PUG
- · E-Zone
- · Central Flats

## MINERAL PROCESSING

The mill processing facilities at Cantung comprise primary crushing and coarse ore storage installations, secondary and tertiary crushing, fine ore storage, a general gravity and flotation building with offices and a maintenance shop, backfill preparation building (inactive), reagents, supplies storage building, and an assay lab.  Although the mill was designed to process 1,000 tons per day, it has achieved continuous processing rates of up to  1,200  tons  per  day.    The  Life  of  Mine  Plan  (LOMP)  details  an  average  processing tonnage of 1,100 tons per day at a recovery rate of 79% of WO3.  Final products include a premium gravity concentrate (G1) and a flotation concentrate.

## ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS

The Cantung Mine is in compliance with applicable regulations. The following is a summary from the 2007 report, with updated information :

## PERMITS

On December 5, 2003 NATC received notification from the  Mackenzie  Valley Land and Water Board (MVLWB) of the renewal of the type 'A' Water License (the license) for a period of five years, expiring on November 29, 2008. The Water Licence outlines  the  permitted  water  use  and  includes  a  surveillance  program  and  criteria  for discharge.  There  are  also  a  number  of  conditions  related  to  the  operation.  The  water license was extended by 60 days to January 28, 2009 as outlined below.

In July 2007, NATCL applied to the MVLWB for a 5 year renewal to the license. The renewal process is a public process involving public consultation, comment review and public hearings. The original public hearings scheduled for July 23-25, 2008 were postponed  by  the  MVLWB  at  the  request  of  the  hosting  communities  due  to  personal tragedies in both small communities. Due to this delay NATCL was requested to apply to the  MVLWB for  a  60  day  license  extension,  which  was  approved  by  the  Minister  of Indian and Northern Affairs (INAC) on September 8, 2008.

The public hearings for the five year license renewal took place on October 28-30, 2008, with the new proposed license forwarded on December 9, 2008 by the MVLWB to the Minister of INAC for his approval. The new 5 year term Water License was issued on January 30, 2009.

The  security  deposit  required  under  the  prior  license  was  $7,900,000  which  is posted  in  support  of  the  license.  The  renewed  license  requires  that  NATCL  post  an additional security deposit of $5,200,000 over time (see Mine Closure, below).  NATC negotiated the terms of the form of security deposit with INAC, which has jurisdiction over such an arrangement and to whose benefit the deposits are to be posted, and entered into the Reclamation Security Agreement (RSA) . NATCL has posted a total of $3,900,000  in  cash  and  $6,600,000  in  the  required  form  of  secured  promissory  note

## NORTH AMERICAN TUNGSTEN CORPORATION LTD.

pursuant to the RSA. The total security posted in favour of INAC is $10,500,000 which fulfills the security requirements of the Water License up to July 1, 2009. The amounts owing  are  secured  against  NATCL's  assets  by  way  of  a  General  Security  Agreement (GSA).

The RSA provides for the cash components payable to INAC to increase under certain  events.    Any  funds  in  excess  of  ultimate  reclamation  costs  will  be  returned  to NATCL.

## CAPITAL COSTS

The total capital  costs  for  the  remainder  of  the  mine  life  are  estimated  to  be  $6.53 million.  Closure costs, and salvage value were not included in capital costs.

## MARKETS/CONTRACTS

NATCL sells the G1 product at prices based on free market values for ammonium paratungstate (APT).  Flotation concentrate is toll converted to APT or sold directly into the market.  Concentrates may be blended in various configurations to maximize revenue. Customers  for  the  Cantung  products  include  North  American,  European,  and  Chinese APT and W powder producers.

NATCL's competitors are the tungsten producers within  China,  the  Beralt  mine  in Portugal,  and,  on  a  smaller  scale,  producers  within  Russia,  Africa,  South  America, Thailand, and Vietnam.  Although China is unable to export concentrate, NATCL must compete against Chinese mines to supply to APT producers within China.

## PRICING

June 2009 London Metal Bulletin (LMB) European free market price quotation for APT is approximately US$200 per MTU.  Before 2005, prices were fairly consistent in the  range  of  US$40  to  US$90  per  MTU,  with  a  median  of  approximately  US$60  per MTU.

## 4 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE AND PHYSIOGRAPHY

## ACCESSIBILITY

The  Cantung  Mine  is  located  approximately  300  km  by  road  northeast  of  Watson Lake, Yukon.  Although the mine is situated in the Northwest Territories, Watson Lake is the  staging  area  for  trucking  the  tungsten  concentrates  and  for  supplying  the  mine  site (Figure 4-1).

Access to the mine from Watson Lake is via Highway 4 (Campbell Highway) and then Highway 10 (Nahanni Range Road).  Additionally, the mine operates a 1,219 m long VFR-rated gravel airstrip.  The airstrip is maintained for year-round operations.

## CLIMATE

Cantung  is  located  in  the  Selwyn  Mountains,  and  climatic  conditions  vary  with elevation.    The  mean  annual  temperature  for  major  valley  systems  is  approximately  4.5°C,  with  a  summer  mean  of  9.5°C  and  a  winter  mean  of  -19.5°C.    Mean  annual precipitation is highly variable, ranging from 600 mm at lower elevation on the perimeter of the Selwyn Mountains region up to 750 mm at high elevation.  Locally at Cantung, severe winter conditions prevail from October to May with temperatures as low as -40°C and substantial snowfall.  Total annual precipitation locally is 650 mm, half as rain and half as snow, with an average 1,270 mm snow accumulation in the valley.

## PHYSIOGRAPHY

Cantung  is  located  in  the  Selwyn  Mountains  Ecoregion  of  the  Taiga  Cordillera Ecozone.  This ecoregion is located in the Selwyn and southern Mackenzie mountains that  span  the  Yukon-Northwest  Territories  border.    For  the  most  part,  this  is  a  rugged mountain wilderness, a northern extension of the Rocky Mountains.  The mine site lies in the Flat River Valley, within the Selwyn Mountain Range.  Local terrain is characterized

## NORTH AMERICAN TUNGSTEN CORPORATION LTD.

by steep mountains and narrow valley bottoms.  Elevations vary from 1,130 mASL at the bottom of the Flat River valley to elevations of 2,750 mASL on nearby mountain peaks.

There are a number of avalanche slide paths in the area, and avalanche monitoring and control is an ongoing requirement in the winter.  The Flat River is a tributary of the South Nahanni River, which ultimately drains into the Liard and Mackenzie Rivers.

The ecoregion is characterized by alpine tundra at upper elevations and by subalpine open  woodland  vegetation  at  lower  elevations.    Alpine  vegetation  consists  of  crustose lichens, mountain avens, dwarf willow, and ericaceous shrubs; sedge and cottongrass are associated  with  wetter  sites.    Barren  talus  slopes  are  common.    Subalpine  vegetation consists of discontinuous open stands of stunted white spruce, and occasional alpine fir and lodgepole pine, in a matrix of willow, dwarf birch, and northern Labrador tea with a ground cover of moss and lichen.

Local alpine glaciers exist in the highest ranges of this ecoregion.  Bare rock outcrops and rubble are common at higher elevation.  Permafrost is extensive but discontinuous in the western part and continuous, with low ice content, in the eastern part of the ecoregion.

Characteristic wildlife includes caribou, grizzly and black bear, Dall's sheep, moose, beaver, fox, wolf, hare, raven, rock and willow ptarmigan, and bald and golden eagle.

## LOCAL RESOURCES

Climate  and  resources  provide  opportunities  for  hunting  and  trapping  of  wildlife, ecotourism, and mineral exploration.  There are no major permanent settlements in the ecoregion.

## NORTH AMERICAN TUNGSTEN CORPORATION LTD.

## INFRASTRUCTURE

Existing underground and surface infrastructure at the property, shown in Figure 5-1, include the following:

- · Underground workings of a total strike length of 5,000 ft, with a main haulage drift at the 3,950 ft level and a number of ramps at different levels.
- · An open pit located south of the main underground orebody, at the 4900 level.
- · An  underground  maintenance shop comprising large service bays and warehouse facilities, equipped with overhead cranes.
- · Primary, secondary, and tertiary crushing plants equipped with rod and ball mills, plus gravity and flotation circuits.
- · A mill building with offices and a maintenance shop.
- · An analytical lab fitted with a Leco sulphur analyzer, colorimetric spectrophotometer, and AA analyzers.
- · Concentrate storage facilities.
- · Tailings ponds and a polishing pond.
- · A backfill plant.
- · A warehouse for reagents and other supplies.
- · A pumping station.
- · Two diesel fuel tanks, each of a capacity of 360,000 litres.

The water supply is provided from the Flat River and is restricted to 45,000 m  per 3 week in accordance with the Water Licence.

The power supply is provided by a powerhouse equipped with diesel generators of a total capacity of 5.3 MW.

The original operators of the Cantung mine built and maintained a town at the mine site, known as Tungsten, complete with all necessary facilities.  Currently, only a portion of  the  existing  town  site  is  in  use.    Employees  are  accommodated  in  an  80-person apartment complex, in town house units, and in staff rooms above the main office.  The site can accommodate up to 140 people at a time.

## 5 HISTORY

Prospectors discovered the Cantung Mine tungsten deposit in 1954, while looking for copper.  In 1959, the Canada Tungsten Mining Corporation Ltd. was formed to acquire and develop the property.  The Cantung Mine commenced production in 1962 from an open  pit  at  the  rate  of  300  tons  per  day  (stpd),  with  suspensions  in  1963  due  to  low tungsten prices and in 1966 due to the destruction of the mill by fire.  The construction of a new 350 stpd mill was completed in 1967 and, in 1969, the capacity was increased to 450 stpd.

In 1971, deep drilling discovered the 'E Zone'.  This zone was accessed through an adit collared at the valley bottom, close to the town site.  The mill began to process the underground ore in 1974.  In 1975, the mill was further expanded to 500 stpd.  A major mill  expansion  in  1979  increased  the  mill  capacity  to  1,000  stpd.    In  1986,  the  mine ceased operations due to low tungsten prices.

In 1985, Amax Inc consolidated ownership of the Cantung Mine and transferred all tungsten assets, including the Mactung Project at Macmillan Pass, to Canada Tungsten Mining  Corporation,  retaining  majority  control.    Aur  Resources  Inc.  (Aur)  purchased Amax Inc's controlling interest in 1995 and Canada Tungsten and Aur merged in 1996.

In  1997,  NATCL  purchased  the  Cantung  mine,  together  with  the  related  tungsten assets of the former Canada Tungsten Inc., from Aur.

After an improvement in tungsten prices commencing in 2000, NATCL reopened the Cantung mine in December 2001.  Underground production and milling resumed at this time.    In  December  2003,  NATCL  was  placed  under  the  protection  of  the  Companies Creditors  Arrangement  Act  (CCAA),  and  the  mine  was  closed.    In  November  2004, NATCL successfully completed a plan of arrangement to deal with creditors, allowing planning for reopening to commence.  Preparatory work for the reopening began in July 2005, and production resumed in late September 2005.

## 6 GEOLOGICAL SETTING

## REGIONAL GEOLOGY

Southeastern Yukon and southwestern Northwest Territories are underlain by a thick sequence of late Precambrian and lower Paleozoic sedimentary strata, which are intruded by several Cretaceous granitic plutons (Figure 6-1).

Basement  rocks  comprise  upwards  of  3,000  m  of  fine-grained  Proterozoic  clastic sediments, predominantly slate and phyllite, referred to as the Grit Unit.  At the onset of the  Cambrian,  a  thin  layer  of  calcareous  siltstone,  the  Swiss  Cheese  Limestone  Unit, which contains distinctive limestone nodules, was deposited over the region.  After this, the region was divided into two contrasting environments of sedimentation, the boundary of which was more-or-less the present Flat River valley.  A thick, uniform, sequence of shale  beds  developed  in  the  Selwyn  Basin  southwest  of  Flat  River,  while  extensive shallow  water  quartzites  and  carbonate  predominated  to  the  northeast,  in  the  northern Cordilleran miogeosyncline.  The strandline between basin and shelf shifted repeatedly over time from northeast to southwest and back.

The stratigraphic unit of principal interest,  the  Ore  Limestone,  directly  overlies  the Swiss Cheese Limestone.  It is a clean blue grey limestone and the lowest pure limestone in the geological succession.  Its distribution is restricted to an area of three kilometres by 12 km in the immediate mine area (Figure 6-1).  A shale unit that caps the Ore Limestone in the Flat River valley area thickens to the southeast of the mine.  The shales are overlain by light buff dolomite, which is of regional extent.  Fossil evidence dates all these units as Lower Cambrian.  A wavy Banded Limestone, or Rabbitkettle Formation, of Middle to Upper  Cambrian  age  overlies  the  Lower  Cambrian  sequence  and  forms  a  distinctive regional marker.

Granitic stocks of Cretaceous age intrude all strata and regional structures.  They are of similar  composition:  medium-grained  biotite  quartz  monzonite,  locally  with  prominent

## NORTH AMERICAN TUNGSTEN CORPORATION LTD.

plagioclase  and  potash  feldspar  phenocrysts.    The  stocks  occur  mainly  in  a  northwesttrending zone approximately 10 km wide that coincides with the Flat River valley.

The dominant regional structure in the area is a major northwest-trending synclinal fold, the Flat River Syncline, which is roughly five kilometres wide and has an axis close to the river.

Figure: 6-1    REGIONAL GEOLOGY

## Local and Property Geology

In  the  mine  workings,  the  lowest  stratigraphic  unit  exposed  is  argillite  of  the Proterozoic Grit Unit, referred to as the Older or Lower Argillite (Figure 6-2).  It has an undefined  thickness.    The  overlying  Swiss  Cheese  Limestone,  or  Chert  Unit  as  it  is referred  to  at  the  mine,  is  in  the  order  of  40  m  to  50  m  thick.    The  Ore  Limestone  is approximately  30  m  thick  in  the  Open  Pit,  thickening  to  approximately  100  m  in  the underground E Zone.  The stratigraphically overlying argillite and interbanded quartzite, which  averages  approximately  150  m  in  thickness,  is  referred  to  at  the  mine  as  the Younger or Upper Argillite.  At the top of the local stratigraphic sequence is a light buff dolomite with interbedded quartzite, which has a maximum thickness of approximately 600 m, however, this is not seen in the mine workings.

The  two  principal  intrusive  stocks  exposed  in  the  mine  area  are  the  Mine  Stock, which outcrops near the Tungsten townsite, and the Circular Stock, which is approximately 500 m north of the E Zone.  A third intrusion occurs at depth below the Open Pit and E Zone orebodies, however, its age and relationship to the other two stocks is not clear.  Dykes and other small apophyses of this blind stock cut the overlying strata.

The Open Pit and E Zone orebodies lie on the west limb of the Flat River Syncline. This  limb  is  steeply  dipping  and  overturned  in  the  west,  but  becomes  flat  to  the  east, where in the area around the two mined deposits it forms a recumbent anticlinal fold that trends east to west (Figure 6-3).  The Open Pit lies on the flat lying upper limb of this fold and the E Zone on the lower limb, close to where the sedimentary succession is cut off by the Mine Stock.  The pit is associated with a late acidic dyke.  The mine anticline appears to be of local extent, as it has not been identified outside the immediate area of the  two  mined  deposits.    Steeply  dipping,  northeasterly-trending  late  stage  faults  with limited displacement cut all the rocks in the mine area.

Two of the deposits at Cantung have been mined.  These are the original Open Pit orebody,  which  was  mined  from  1962  to  1973,  and  the  E  Zone,  which  was  mined between  1973  and  1986,  again  between  January  2002  and  December  2003,  and  is

## NORTH AMERICAN TUNGSTEN CORPORATION LTD.

currently in production.  Both deposits are in calc-silicate skarn zones that replace the Ore Limestone.  The only tungsten mineral in the ore zones is scheelite, calcium tungstate (CaWO4), which is recovered in either a gravity or flotation concentrate by the processing plant.    At  one  time,  the  copper  mineral  chalcopyrite  was  recovered  from  the  ore  by flotation.  NAT is currently re-installing a copper circuit. Testwork indicates a potentially saleable and profitable product.

The Open Pit orebody, located in the valley of Sardine Creek, was roughly circular and approximately 150 m in diameter (Figure 6-2).  The current open pit resources are mainly in the Chert that forms the bottom of the existing pit.  In addition, a low grade geological resource, also within the Chert Unit, extends from the pit wall for a distance of 250 m to the north.  The E Zone orebody measures 1,200 m in length, and has an average thickness of 12 m and slope length of 150 m.  The south side of the ore body is close to flat lying.  Further north, the Ore Limestone thickens and becomes vertical, so that at the axis of the recumbent mine anticline the ore occurs in vertical or sub-vertical lenses.  The ore  pinches  out  above  this  fold  axis  mainly  because  of  increasing  distance  from  the intrusive. In a down  dip  direction  the Ore  Limestone,  the  skarn,  and  the  ore mineralization pinch out against quartz monzonite of the mine stock.  Throughout most of the deposit two, main ore lenses are present: a hanging wall lens adjacent to Chert Unit, and a footwall lens adjacent to Upper Argillite.  Intermediate lenses also occur, however, they tend to be less continuous than either the hanging wall or the footwall lenses (Figure 6-3).

## 7 DEPOSIT TYPES

The Cantung Mine consists of two deposits,  the  Open  Pit,  near  surface,  and  the  E Zone, underground.  The deposits are described in the following section, Mineralization.

## 8 MINERALIZATION

The  description  below  is  largely  taken  from  the  reports  of  Blusson  (1968)  and Hodgson (2003).

Mineralization  at  the  Cantung  mine  comprises  skarn  replacements  within  the  Ore Limestone.  At the Open Pit, mineralization is also present as lower grade replacements in the underlying Chert Unit.  The Open Pit skarn ore is comprised of scheelite and minor chalcopyrite disseminated in a gangue of pyrrhotite, diopside, garnet, and actinolite.  The E Zone ore differs in several respects from Open Pit ore.  It typically contains massive to semi-massive  pyrrhotite  and,  in  addition  to  pyroxene  and  garnet,  contains  abundant hydrated  calc-silicates  actinolite  and  biotite.    The  hydrated  silicates  are  particularly characteristic of the West  Extension.    The  scheelite  content  of  the skarn-hosted mineralization  in  the  two  orebodies  was  similar  (1.64%  WO3 at  the  Open  Pit  versus 1.54% WO3 average to 1986 at the E Zone).  Copper content in the open pit ore averaged 0.5%, and in the E Zone approximately 0.25% Cu.  Accessory minerals in the E Zone include apatite, epidote, and tourmaline.

## 9 EXPLORATION

The mine property has been covered almost completely by ground and airborne magnetic  and  electromagnetic  surveys,  and  by  geochemical  stream  sediment  and  soil sampling.  No obvious targets were discovered by these surveys, with the exception of the geochemical anomalies in the upper reaches of Rifle Range Creek. The other targets listed  below  are  of  a  geological  nature  and  are  mainly  suggested  by  earlier  geological mapping or diamond drilling. Up to 2007 Exploration work has been limited to a few holes in the Open Pit/PUG Zone since the mine ceased production in 1986. A diamond drill  program was reinitiated in mid 2007 including some surface drilling (one hole on Sheet Mountain), drilling in the PUG but primarily in the west extension, e-zone and the area below 3700 elevation.

During  the  first  ¾  of  fiscal  2009  over  35,000  ft  (10,600  meters)  of  both exploration and definition diamond drilling was undertaken- a total of 85,000 ft has been drilled since start up in 2006. This translated into 405 diamond drill holes with an average depth of 210 feet but ranging from a low of 18 feet to a high of 970 feet. Most of the remaining pillars were drilled to confirm both tonnage and grade. Approximately 3,500 ft of  definition  diamond  drilling  occurred  during  fiscal  2009  with  the  remainder  being exploration drilling. Drilling focused on the area below 3700 (the area below the lowest mine  workings).  This  resulted  in  148,000  tons  being  added  to  the  indicated  mineral resource during 2009. The drilling was initially on 100 ft spacing with subsequent infill drilling.  Drilling indicates a southern offset in the ore in the area of 3700 (caused by a granite  intrusion).  Diamond drilling has also confirmed ore grade mineralization to the 3430 level. In addition in the later part of the fiscal year drilling above 3700 (but from 3700 level) confirmed the presence of mineralization above the level and to the west of current  workings.  The  diamond  drilling  was  undertaken  by  Boart  Longyear  utilizing either an LM37 or LM75 diamond drill. All core was BQTK size.

The mineralization conforms to that of the currently mined areas. Specifically the majority of the mineralization is limited to the ore limestone with minor intersections in the 'swiss cheese' limestone.

## NORTH AMERICAN TUNGSTEN CORPORATION LTD.

The diamond drillhole database for the Cantung mine property, which is complete except  for  the  drilling  done  on  the  Baker  showing,  comprises  1,847  drill  holes.  The drillholes are concentrated around the known deposits, mainly those that have been mined -  the  open  pit  and  E  Zone.  Outside  of  these  areas  of  exploration,  diamond  drilling  is sparse or non-existent. The following exploration targets were identified. Those targets in and  close  to  the  E  Zone  underground  workings  that  could  be  accessed  and  put  into production  most  quickly  are  given  the  highest  priority,  as  they  are  the  most  likely  to extend the current mine life.

In addition there is a high degree of probability that more tonnage can be found by 'data mining'. In 2008 and 2009, 26% and 34% of tonnage respectively, to the mill came from areas outside of reserves.  Modeling has at least temporarily removed some subgrade  or  areas  of  poor  confidence  level  (due  to  ground  conditions  and/or  mined  out openings) from reserves. Recent work on upgrading some of the areas currently outside of reserves has contributed significantly to the reserve statement. While it is anticipated that the percentage of ore mined outside of reserves will decrease over the next few years, a percentage of ore each year will continue to come from areas not included in resources and/or reserves.

## 10 DRILLING

Mineral  resources  and  reserves  at  the  E  Zone  are  based  almost  entirely  upon diamond drill core assay data from holes drilled in the mine area by Canada Tungsten Mining Corporation between 1958 and 1986. The current open pit reserves and resources rely mainly on the surface diamond drilling and the underground reserves on underground  diamond  drilling. The  resource BELOW  3700  is  based  on  drilling undertaken in late  2007  and  2008.  Scott  Wilson  RPA  reviewed  copies  of  the  diamond drill hole logs prior to 2007 and noted that core recovery was normally at or near 100% and the core condition was reasonably good Drill core was placed in wooden boxes and logged. Mineralized sections of core were split parallel to the core axis using a hydraulic splitter. After splitting, one half of the core was submitted for assay, while the other half was stored in core racks at the mine. Sample lengths varied up to ten feet; however, five foot samples are most common

Mineral resources and reserves for the area below 3700 are based almost entirely upon  diamond  drill  core  assay  data  from  holes  drilled  in  the  mine  area  by  North American  Tungsten  Corporation  in  2007  and  2008.  Core  recovery  was  normally  at  or near 100% and the core condition was good. Drill core was placed in wooden boxes and logged.  Mineralized  sections  of  core  were  cut  sub  parallel  to  the  core  axis  using  a diamond  saw.  After  splitting,  one  half  of  the  core  was  submitted  for  assay,  while  the other half was stored in pallets at the mine. Sample lengths varied up to six feet although department  standards  called  for  a  maximum  of  5  ft  or  at  lithology  or  grade  changes. Rejects and pulps are saved.

## 11 SAMPLING METHOD AND APPROACH

Most drill core samples from the E Zone were assayed at Rossbacher Laboratories,  Burnaby,  B.C.,  utilizing  hot  hydrochloric  acid  digestion  followed  by colorimetric  finish.  The  method  of  sample  preparation  and  analysis  was  designed  by Amax  Inc.  for  application  at  its  Climax,  Colorado  mine.  Rossbacher  used  a  set  of standard  samples  developed  by  Amax.  Check  assays  were  carried  out  at  Chemex Laboratories Ltd., and Bondar-Clegg Ltd., both in North Vancouver, B.C. Between 1984 and 1986, samples were assayed at the Cantung mine laboratory using X-ray analysis.

During  2002/2003  operations  all  mine  and  mill  assays  were  performed  at  the Cantung  mine  laboratory using hot three-acid digestion (HCl, H3PO4,  HF)  and colorimetric  finish.  All  reagents  used  were  certified  reagent  grade  chemicals,  used  in conjunction with laboratory-produced distilled water. To each assay run of 12 samples, one  standard  and  one  blank  sample  were  attached.  The  standard  used  was  Canadian Certified Standards sample CT1, at 1.311% WO3, which originated at the Cantung mine many years ago. The blank samples test for constant error and error due to contamination from reagents and glassware that is used in the process. Each laboratory sample run also included one duplicate sample and one in-house mill feed standard to maintain statistical control records. The grade of latter was confirmed at 1.47% WO3 in over 100 separate assays.

Check assays were performed from time to time at the ALS Chemex laboratory, North  Vancouver,  BC,  which  is  ISO  9000  certified.  Assays  on  concentrates  were performed at the mine assay laboratory by gravimetric method, involving digestion in hot hydrochloric and nitric acid followed by gravimetric finish. Umpire and check assays on concentrates were  performed  at  Alfred H. Knight  laboratory, Spartanburg, South Carolina.  No  special  assay  security  provisions  were  taken  at  the  mine,  as  none  were deemed necessary.

All  exploration  diamond  drill  core  samples  were  assayed  on  site  utilizing  hot hydrochloric acid digestion followed by colorimetric finish. Assays greater than 1%WO3 were sent to Global Discovery Labs for verification and as part of a QAQC program. In

A  total  of  750  samples  grading  more  than  1%WO3  were  submitted  to  Global Discovery Labs for comparison. It was noted that Cantung assays were lower than that being  reported  by  Global  Discovery,  similar  to  that  observed  when  the  higher  grade standard (W2) was assayed - see graph above. As a result 85 samples were re-assayed by the  Cantung  Lab  (the  samples  with  the  greatest  discrepancies).  The  results  are  given below.

The  re-assayed  samples  are  much  closer  to  those  reported  by  Global.    Work  is continuing to validate the remaining differences. For the purposes of the Resource/Reserve calculation the first (and generally lower) value was used to ensure that grade estimates were conservative.

## 12 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND SECURITY

Most drill core samples from the E Zone were assayed at Rossbacher Laboratories, Burnaby, B.C., utilizing hot hydrochloric acid digestion followed by colorimetric finish. The  method  of  sample  preparation  and  analysis  was  designed  by  Amax  Inc.  for application  at  its  Cimax,  Colorado  mine.

No special assay security provisions were taken at the mine, as none were deemed necessary.

## 13 DATA VERIFICATION

Archival  drillhole  assay  data  were  corroborated  through  reconciliation  of  average diluted  recoverable  reserves  grade  against the  mine  average  production  mucking  grade for  the  period  from  February  2002  until  September  30,  2003.    The  average  production mucking grade for this period was reportedly 1.72% WO3 and the corresponding diluted recoverable ore reserve grade 1.73% WO3, which represents a grade variance (loss) of 1%.  Mill head grade for the period was 1.67% WO3, which compares well with mucked grade.    This  suggests  that  diluted  recoverable  ore  reserve  estimates  are  reasonably accurate  on  a  global  basis.    This  suggests,  by  extension,  that  assaying  has  been reasonably accurate.

## 14 ADJACENT PROPERTIES

The Northwest Territories mining recorders claim sheets 105H/16 and 105 I/01 show no third party claims tied on to the NATC Cantung property, and none in the immediate vicinity.

## 15 MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING

The mill processing facilities at Cantung comprise primary crushing and coarse ore storage installations, secondary and tertiary crushing, fine ore storage, general gravity and flotation  building  with  offices  and  a  maintenance  shop,  backfill  preparation  building (inactive),  reagents  and  supplies  storage  building  and  an  assay  lab.    Although  the  mill was designed to process 1,000 tons per day, it has achieved continuous processing rates of  up  to  1,300  tons  per  day.    The  Life  of  Mine  Plan  (LOMP)  details  an  average processing  tonnage  of  1,100  tons  per  day  at  a  recovery  rate  of  79.0%  of  WO3.    Final products  will  be  approximately  330  tons  per  month  of  gravity  concentrate  (G1), containing 60% to 70 % WO3 at 59.3% recovery and approximately 100 tons per month of flotation concentrate containing 47% WO3 at 19.7% recovery. These target numbers appear  to  be  obtainable  based  on  projected  ore  metallurgical  characteristics  and  past performance attained by the operation.  A process flow sheet is shown in Figure 15-1.

## PRIMARY CRUSHING

Ore is handled from the stockpile by a loader or directly dumped from haulage truck into a 30 ton receiving bin equipped with 42 in x 10 ft apron feeder, which, in turn, feeds a 42 in x 48 in jaw crusher.  The jaw crusher is set to produce a nominal five inch crushed product.    A  conveyor  transports  crushed  ore  into  a  1,000  ton  capacity  coarse  ore  bin. This bin acts as a surge bin for the secondary crushing circuit.

## SECONDARY &amp; TERTIARY CRUSHING

A vibratory feeder and a conveyor feed a 4¼ ft (secondary) standard cone crusher set at 1 inch.  The crushed ore is discharged via conveyor to a vibrating screen equipped with a 7/16 in. x four inch slotted screen.  The oversize feeds a 4¼ ft (tertiary) short-head cone crusher set at 3/8 in.  The tertiary crusher discharge combines with the secondary crusher discharge to feed the screen in a closed-circuit recycle.  Screened undersize (minus 7/16 in.)  product  is  conveyed  to  two  fine  ore  bins  ahead  of  the  grinding  mills  in  the concentrator.  Dust is controlled by the use of a wet scrubber with the discharge slurry returning to the mill as a recycle.

## NORTH AMERICAN TUNGSTEN CORPORATION LTD.

## GRINDING, CLASSIFICATION AND TALC FLOTATION

The grinding circuit consists of a primary 9 ft x 12 ft rod mill, powered by a 450 hp motor, a secondary 7 ft x 10 ft rod mill powered by a 200 hp motor, and a secondary auxiliary 6'10' x 6' ball mill powered by a 125 hp motor.  The primary rod mill is fed from the two fine ore bins via a conveyor and discharges ground ore slurry into a sump for  pumping  to  primary  cyclones.    The  cyclones  overflow  is  discharged  by  gravity  to 'talc' flotation and the underflow is pumped to vibrating Derrick Screens for sizing.

Talc  complicates  scheelite  flotation  and  therefore  it  is  floated  first  and  sent  to  mill tails.  If  the  talc  content  of  the  'talc'  cell  concentrate  is  relatively  low,  the  concentrate goes to the copper circuit for copper scavenging prior to being tailed. If the talc content is high, the stream is tailed directly.  The flotation tails go to two 40 ft diameter triple-tray thickeners in parallel, which also receive gravity circuit tails ahead of scheelite flotation. The screen undersize goes to a 40 ft diameter triple-tray thickener.  Normally, the screen oversize is gravity fed to a dewatering classifier, from which the sand feeds the secondary rod  mill.    Classifier  overflow  and  the  secondary  rod  mill  discharge  merge  with  the primary  rod  mill  discharge  in  the  pump  box.    When  increased  grinding  capacity  is required, the (auxiliary) secondary ball mill is operated in parallel with the secondary rod mill.  In this configuration, the Derrick Screen oversize is dewatered with a 15' cyclone where  the  cyclone  underflow  is  split  between  the  secondary  ball  mill  feed  and  the dewatering classifier feed.  The cyclone overflow joins the dewatering classifier overflow and discharges to the rod mill discharge pump-box.  The secondary ball mill discharge is pumped to the same location.

## SULPHIDE FLOTATION

Underflow  from  the thickener, after conditioning with appropriate promoters, collectors, depressants, and frothers, is floated for its copper content, and subsequently for  its  residual  sulphide  content.  The  copper  rougher  concentrate  is  sent  to  the  copper circuit while the sulphide scavenger concentrate is sent directly to mill final tails.  The sulphide scavenger flotation tailing is sent to the gravity circuit.

## NORTH AMERICAN TUNGSTEN CORPORATION LTD.

## GRAVITY SEPARATION

Sulphide  flotation  tails  are  distributed  to  triple-deck  shaking  tables  for  rougher concentration of scheelite.  Concentrate from these tables is cleaned on single-deck tables before being pumped to the dewatering classifier that feeds the dryer.  Rougher table tails are de-slimed with a cyclone.  The cyclone overflow (slimes and excess water) is sent to the scheelite flotation thickeners while the underflow sand is reground in a single pass through a 6 ft dia. x 8 ft ball mill.  The ball mill discharge is passed through cyclones which direct the slimes to the scheelite thickeners and the sands to a secondary sulphide flotation  step  whereby  freshly  liberated  sulphides  are  removed  prior  to  the  flow  being sent to triple-deck tables for scavenging of gravity recoverable scheelite.  The concentrate from these tables is cleaned on single-deck tables with final concentrates joining other concentrates  in  the  dewatering  classifier  ahead  of  drying.    The  tailings  from  the scavenging  table  circuit  are  pumped  to  the  scheelite  thickeners  to  prepare  feed  for scheelite flotation.

## NORTH AMERICAN TUNGSTEN CORPORATION LTD.

The gravity circuit can be adjusted to produce a range of G1 concentrate grades; production of higher grade G1 increases gravity circuit losses such that the volume of flotation concentrate production increases.  .

## SCHEELITE FLOTATION CONCENTRATE

In  general,  the  flotation  feed  consists  of  gravity  circuit  cyclone  overflow  products, talc flotation tails and secondary gravity tails.  The thickened underflow slurry from the thickeners is treated with a frother and passed through a tertiary sulphide bank to remove residual  sulphides  and  talc,  after  which  the  material  is  sent  to  conditioners  where  it  is treated  with  a  conventional  pH  regulator,  depressants,  collectors  and  a  frother.    The mechanical  rougher,  scavenger  flotation  banks  and  scavenger  column  produce  their respective concentrates, which are then cleaned in conventional cleaner flotation cells and re-cleaned in column cells to produce a marketable-grade final concentrate.  The flotation concentrate is thickened in a 20 ft thickener, filtered, and then dried in a rotary furnace to reduce moisture before being loaded into bags for shipment to markets.

## DRYING AND MAGNETIC SEPARATION

The cleaner table gravity concentrate contains, on average, 55% to 65% WO3.  It is dewatered  in  a  spiral  classifier  before  entering  the  roaster  (dryer).    The  roaster  is equipped with cooling screws, which help cool the dryer discharge as it is transported to magnetic  separators  by  use  of  a  bucket  elevator  system.    Magnetic  separation  is accomplished  in  two  stages.      The  first  stage  consists  of  two  roll  type  separators  that produce a high grade product with their rejects being further treated by a secondary stage. The secondary stage consists of a single rare earth magnet cross belt and three electro magnetic  units  fixed  over  a  moving  belt.    The  concentrates  from  both  stages  are combined to produce the final product, while the high sulfur rejects from each stage are returned to the mill circuit for re-processing.

## NORTH AMERICAN TUNGSTEN CORPORATION LTD.

## CONCENTRATE HANDLING AND STORAGE

Dried concentrate is packed in two ton plastic tote bags for shipment to the customers. Bagged concentrate is stored in covered areas before being shipped.  The tote bags are handled with a small forklift.

## COPPER CIRCUIT

The  present  copper  circuit  takes  copper  rougher  concentrate  and  'talc'  flotation concentrate and cleans it with mechanical cells in three stages; the first and second stage tailings report to mill final tails, while the third stage tail returns to second cleaner feed. The third cleaner concentrate is thickened and subsequently filtered on a belt filter prior to packaging in bags for shipment.

## TAILINGS DISPOSAL

Tailings are pumped to tailings ponds No. 4 for disposal and storage.  Solution from the  tailings  ponds  is  pumped  to  polishing  pond  No.  5,  from  which  it  passes  to  the environment  by  exfiltration.    Tailings  pond  No.  4  was  an  exfiltration  pond  until  2007 when it was upgraded to store tailings.  Pond 5 was constructed in 2006 and utilized in 2007 for exfiltration   No tailings were used for mine backfill.

In 2001, the embankment of Tailings pond No. 3 was raised by two metres, with an additional  two  metres  added  in  2003,  and  a  further  1.5  metres  lift  added  in  2005.  The current crest elevation of tails pond 5 is at 3,765 ft..

Tailings pond No. 5 was completed in the fall of 2006 to an elevation of 3740 ft., 20 feet below it's design elevation of 3760 ft. Tails pond 5 was originally designed to become the primary tails disposal pond as tails pond 3 reached capacity in late 2006. As noted below, tails pond 5 became the designated exfiltration pond in early 2007. Due to its change in function, tails pond 5 is being modified by the addition of 33 ft wide support wedge of material to  the  upstream  face.  This  is  expected  to  be  completed  in  the  2009 construction season.

## NORTH AMERICAN TUNGSTEN CORPORATION LTD.

In 2006 it became clear that polishing pond #4, which received the decant water from  tails  pond  3  was  rapidly  blinding  off  and  was  no  longer  exfiltrating  efficiently. Though a number of attempts were made to re-establish exfiltration (such as dredging and excavating), it became clear that it had reached the end of its life as an exfiltration pond. After studying the options, and noticing how well TP5 exfiltrated, the decision was made to  use  TP4  as  a  tails  pond,  and  pump  the  supernatant  water  to  TP5  for  disposal  by exfiltration. Upon  receiving  approval  from  the  MVLWB  in  February  2007,  tails deposition was started into tails pond 4.

In 2007, tails pond 4 was raised from its original elevation of 3690 ft to 3715 feet, providing tails storage capacity for production into late 2008. In 2008 tails pond 4 was raised to 3730 ft elevation to provide tails storage capacity until late 2009. In 2009 tails pond 4 is scheduled to be raised, to a planned 3742.5 ft elevation, which will provide tails storage capacity until mid/late 2010.

At  the  time  of  this  writing  (July,  2009),  the  mill's  Zimpro  hydraulic  backfill pumps are being refurbished for pumping of cycloned tailings underground in the second half  of  2009;  the  slimes  and  excess  water  will  continue  to  be  pumped  to  tails  pond  4. Beyond  return  of  hydraulic  backfill  to  the  mine,  initial  planning  is  underway  to investigate possible scenarios including further lifts on existing Tailings Ponds 3 &amp; 4, and building a new tails pond.

Capital costs include an allowance for completing the dam lift on Tailings Ponds 4 &amp; 5.

## LABORATORY

There is an assay laboratory on site, which has been used for sample preparation and assaying services for the mine and mill,.  The laboratory QA/QC testing with other labs is monitored  and  managed  by  the  Geology  Department,  reference  material  and  control samples are used in each assay run in the lab.

## NORTH AMERICAN TUNGSTEN CORPORATION LTD.

## PROCESS RECOVERY

Recovery is calculated using the assays of the mill tails and recovered concentrates in conjunction  with  the  concentrate  weights  and  mill  feed  tonnage.  As  a  check  on recoveries, the sampled mill feed assay is checked against the back calculated feed assay; if  a  significant  discrepancy  is  noted,  conveyor  weightometer  calibration  and  sampling systems are immediately checked.

## PLANNED MILL CHANGES

In July of 2009, the copper circuit will be upgraded through the installation of a 20 foot  high  by  20  inch  diameter  cleaner  column  to  replace  the  second  and  third  stage mechanical  cleaners;  this  is  expected  to  slightly  improve  both  concentrate  grade  and recovery through the reduction of the circulating load.  At the same time, provision is being made for subsequent installation of a copper regrind mill to allow liberation and recovery of copper in the middling fraction.

As mentioned in the 'Tailings Disposal' section above, the existing Zimpro hydraulic backfill pumps are being refurbished for use in the second half of 2009.

## 16 MINERAL RESOURCE AND MINERAL RESERVE ESTIMATES

## MINERAL RESOURCE AND MINERAL RESERVE SUMMARY

Mineral Resources for the Cantung Mine, as of July 1, 2009 are listed below in Table 16-1.    These  Mineral  Resources  encompass  both  audited  resources  in  the  underground mine,  as  well  as  those  recently  updated  for  the  Open  Pit  and  PUG  (Pit  deposit, Underground ore) Zones.

Mineral Resources are inclusive of Mineral Reserves; excess resources may at some time in the future become reserves, however, at present they cannot be included in the estimate of Mineral Reserves.  The Mineral Reserves include material for which there is a mining plan, and at least a conceptual design.  Mineral Reserves for the Cantung Mine, as of July 1, 2009, are summarized in Table 16-2 below.

Notes:

- 1. Mineral Reserves conform to CIM and NI43-101 requirements.
- 2. All Mineral Reserves are classified as Probable.
- 3. Mineral Reserves are estimated at a cutoff grade of 0.80% WO3.
- 4. A minimum mining width of 15 feet was used.

When production is taken into  account,  Mineral  Reserves  have  increased  since  the previous  estimate.    Increases  are  due  to  exploration  of  new  zones,  inclusion  of  lowergrade  areas rendered  economic  by  higher  prices,  and  planned  pillar  recovery  in previously mined areas through the use of longhole mining methods.

## ESTIMATION METHODOLOGY

## UNDERGROUND MINE

NATCL mine personnel updated the Mineral Resources estimate for the underground mine.  The update was carried out using commercially available software.

Minesight/Compass was used to create a 3D block model of the various ore bodies. Mine  openings  were  generated  in  AutoCad/Promine  and  entered  into  the  project.  The openings  were  not  included  in  the  calculations  per  se  but  were  used  to  limit  material remaining to be mined. Block size was 10 ft x 10 ft x 10 ft (X x Y x Z).

The model was oriented parallel to the grid EW and NS directions (i.e. not rotated). It is  apparent  that  work  undertaken  by  Scott  Wilson  RPA  in  July  2008, that  modelling constraints need to be tightened. This should have a positive effect on grade calculations in the more steeply dipping areas of the mine.

## NORTH AMERICAN TUNGSTEN CORPORATION LTD.

## OPEN PIT AND PUG ZONES

In 2006, Scott Wilson RPA generated a 3D Block model of the Open Pit and PUG using Gemcom. According to Scott Wilson RPA ' a subset of 189 holes were selected for use in grade interpolation in the Open Pit/PUG block model.  Included in this subset are the 15 most recent holes drilled in 2005.  In total, the 189 drillholes in the Open Pit/PUG subset  encompass  4,162  sampled  intervals,  and  of  these,  3,845  samples  were  used  for grade interpolation.'

In  2007  the  model  was  exported  to  Minesight.  The  missing  surface  data  was incorporated into the model. The mineralized lens were slightly modified to better match lithology.   The estimate was carried out using a block model constrained with wireframe solid models of the principal lithologic units, and was essentially an update of the block model created for the 2006 estimate.  Grade was estimated into the blocks using Inverse Distance Cubed weighting.  The block model was constructed using Minesight software. Block size was 10 ft x 10 ft x 10 ft (X x Y x Z), and the model was oriented parallel to the grid EW and NS directions (i.e. not rotated).

The Minesight model was compared to the 2006 model completed by Scott Wilson RPA.  While  lithological  boundaries  were  honoured  to  limit  the  'smearing'  of  grades, individual rock types were given the same code. The rationale being that the bulk of the remaining resource was confined to the 'Swiss Cheese Limestone'.

The gross results were comparable to that obtained by Scott Wilson RPA. A cutoff of 0.8% WO3 was applied to the resource compared to the 0.5% used by Scott Wilson RPA. This  resulted  in  472,000  tons  at  1.3%  WO3  meeting  the  criteria.  (Scott  Wilson  RPA arrived at 448,000 tons at 1.4% WO3 using a 0.8% cutoff)

## BLOCK MODEL METHODOLOGY

For the 2008 estimate of the underground Mineral Resources, Cantung mine staff did not cap high grade WO3. It is of the opinion of the author that caps should be applied to composites and not individual assays as the tendency of mine personnel is to selectively sample very high but small intersections of scheelite even though the adjacent samples

## NORTH AMERICAN TUNGSTEN CORPORATION LTD.

are  of  the  same  lithology.  Time  did  not  permit  a  detailed  analysis  of  the  high  grade composites  but  by  using  inverse  cubing  the  impact  of  these  relatively  few  samples  is minimal (most of the historical high grade samples are in areas already mined out).

The  search  parameters  used  in  the  reserve  estimate  are  significantly  smaller  than previously employed, to a maximum of 150 ft (down from 270 feet).  Several estimates were made using different search radius but the results were almost identical. This is in large part due to using a maximum of 10 composites in total and a maximum of 3 per drill hole for interpolation. These requirements are usually met before the search ellipsoid has looked more than 50 feet.

As  for  the  Open  Pit  and  PUG,  the  estimate  was  carried  out  using  a  block  model constrained  with  wireframe  solid  models  of  the  principal  lithologic  units.    Grade  was estimated into the blocks using Inverse Distance Cubed weighting.  The block model was constructed using Minesight software.  Block size was 10 ft x 10 ft x 10 ft (X x Y x Z), and the model was oriented parallel to the grid EW and NS directions (i.e. not rotated).

| Pass   | Search Radius (ft)   | Search Radius (ft)   | Search Radius (ft)   | No. of Composites   | No. of Composites   | No. of Composites   |

|        | Major                | Semi                 | Minor                | Min.                | Max.                | Max/hole            |
| 1      | 150                  | 75                   | 40                   | 1                   | 10                  | 3                   |

Cantung personal carried out validation of the block model by visual inspection, and by comparison of the global block to those reported using manual methods as well as to follow testholes.  The block grades appeared to honour the drillhole grades reasonably well.

A cut-off grade of 0.80% WO3 was applied to the block model to estimate Mineral Resources for the Open Pit/PUG and the entire E Zone Orebody.  It is apparent that more

work needs to be done on the open pit/PUG before it can be upgraded to a Reserve. Much of the remaining material is amenable to underground mining only.

## RESOURCE CLASSIFICATION

Underground  Mineral Resources were classified as follows:

Indicated Mineral Resources were those that were either:

- · Blocks  outlined  that  fell  within  a  50  ft  radius  of  a  diamond  drill  hole. Initial calculations were on a 12.5 ft measured, 25 ft indicated and a 50 ft inferred basis but it was apparent that these constraints were too harsh as indicated in previous work undertaken by Scott Wilson RPA. As a result all  data  calculated  to  one  of  these  three  parameters  was  redefined  as 'indicated'

Open pit Mineral Resources were classified as follows:

- · Blocks outlined that fell within a 100 foot radius of a diamond drill hole.

Inferred Resources were not reported as they are for the most part quite small (due to limiting the model to lithological codes obtained by modeling of the lenses).

## MINERAL RESERVES

The Mineral Reserve estimate for the Cantung Mine is provided above in Table 16-2. No Mineral Reserves were estimated for the Open Pit pending redesign of the pit and separation  of  the  underground  PUG  Zone  from  the  Open  Pit  resource  blocks.  A  small reserve was estimated in the PUG Zone immediately adjacent to current workings. The remainder of the PUG resource require further design and economic analysis before they can be added to reserves.

Mineral  Reserves  for  the  underground  were  estimated  by  applying  extraction  and dilution  estimates  to  the  insitu  Mineral  Resources.    Dilution  was  applied  in  a  manner specific  to  the  ore  body  characteristics,  configuration,  and  extraction  methods,  in accordance with the lengthy experience of mine operation.  Dilution was added at a grade of  0.1%  WO3.    Some  of  the  Mineral  Resources  were  deliberately  excluded  from  the Mineral  Reserves  owing  to  access  or  design  constraints.    These  Mineral  Resources remain in the inventory as material that may become mineable at some future time.

## WEST EXTENSION AND E-ZONE

The  West  Extension  comprises  primarily  polygonal  blocks  through  an  area  of  the mine that has not been worked before.  As such, this material does not encompass pillars for  the  most  part.    The  E  Zone  is  in  the  older  part  of  the  mine  and  comprises  stope remnants and pillars.

Tons  and  grade  were  determined  from  a  conceptual  stope  design  for  each  block, which took into account the thickness and orientation of the ore.  Wall rock dilution was added to the block based on historical averages.  Extraction percentages are expected to average  85%  in  the  West  Extension  and  85%-90%  in  the  E-Zone.    After  dilution  and extraction parameters were applied, the remaining material was summed and assigned to the Probable Mineral Reserves category.

## MAIN ZONE

The Main Zone consists of pillars that will be recovered by advancing drifts below them, drilling longhole uppers in a fan pattern to blast both the pillar and a drawpoint cone underneath. Material in the cone is anticipated to be mostly waste. Muck will be extracted  until  ore  grade  material  starts  to  appear  at  the  drawpoint.      From  that  point onward the muck will be trammed to the mill. This part of the mine has been backfilled with  unconsolidated  material,  so  ore  pillars  have  been  designed  to  be  left  around  the perimeter of the stope in order to hold back the waste. Occasionally the ore pillar fails and the resulting inrush of waste prevents the extraction of the entire pillar. However, it is common for the ore pillar to hold, resulting in very high recoveries and very low dilution.

The recovery and dilution for this zone have been estimated based on past experience. Recovery for this zone ranges from 75% to 95%, while the dilution has been estimated at 20% to 35%.

## SOUTH FLATS

This is also pillar material, although the backfill comprises sand from the tails and is anticipated to have more strength than the rock fill.  The current conceptual mining plan

## NORTH AMERICAN TUNGSTEN CORPORATION LTD.

is  to  rehabilitate  old  working  to  gain  access,  followed  by  a  retreat  sequence  of  small longhole stopes from within the orebody.  Dilution from the sand was estimated to be 25% of the total pillar volumes, and extraction was estimated to be 90%.

## CLASSIFICATION

All  Mineral  Resources  in  the  underground  mine  are  in  the  Indicated  category. Accordingly,  all  Mineral  Reserves  have  been  assigned  to  the  Probable  category.  The classification of the Mineral Reserves has been done according to the rules and guidelines set forth in NI43-101 in accordance with CIM guidelines.

## 17 OTHER RELEVANT DATA AND INFORMATION

## MINING OPERATIONS

The Cantung Mine comprises underground and open pit operations, producing ore at a  rate  of  1,100  stpd.    The  underground  mine  was  developed  as  a  multilevel  operation based on the E-Zone (main ore body), which was extensively mined in the past, and the narrower West Extension, which has been mined only recently.  Underground areas form the current Mineral Reserves.

The  open  pit  ore  body  contains  the  Open  Pit  and  PUG  Zones,  for  which  current Mineral Resources have been estimated.  Open Pit mining has taken place in the past, and as recently as the summer of 2006.  The PUG Zone, located in the wall of the pit, has been explored with drifting and diamond drilling.  Ore from both sources has historically been blended with feed from underground.

## MINING METHODS

In the past, the mine used a variety of mining methods including room and pillar, cut and  fill,  longhole  stoping  with  and  without  delayed  backfill,  and  pillar-remnant  ore recovery using different techniques.  The primary mining method was cut and fill, using breasting or benching techniques for ore extraction.  Waste rock was used as backfill and a working platform for subsequent mining lifts when breasting.

Currently, longhole methods are planned for the majority of the remaining reserves, both  for  pillar  recovery  and  for  primary  mining  in  areas  with  favourable  geometry. Access drifts are driven under the old workings, providing drill locations for upholes into remnant pillars above.  The drill patterns form a draw cone from the access up to the base of the ore - this waste is mucked first after blasting, and discarded.  In some cases, the pillars are surrounded by unconsolidated waste fill from previous cut and fill mining, and higher  levels  of  dilution  are  expected  as  a  result.    In  other  cases,  the  pillars  are surrounded by void space, and extraction is expected to be lower, as some ore will be

## NORTH AMERICAN TUNGSTEN CORPORATION LTD.

blasted  outwards  into  the  old  workings  and  will  not  be  recovered.    To  reduce  the possibility  of  dilution  from  waste  backfill  and  loss  into  the  open  stope  longhole  drill patterns are designed to leave a skin of rock around the pillar perimeter.  In most cases this skin fails during or after the broken ore is removed allowing a higher than expected recovery rate and lower than expected dilution.

Grade control is achieved through close monitoring of mining faces by geologists and engineering staff to assess the grades and mark up the ore contacts.  Grades are estimated at the faces through visual inspection using a UV light.  Face and muck pile samples are also collected and assayed for mill feed grade estimation.

## GROUND CONDITIONS AND ROCK MECHANICS CONSIDERATIONS

The Cantung Mine is in relatively good physical condition.  Ground conditions can be classified as generally good to very good, with the exception of localized weaker parts where  the  ground  has  deteriorated  due  to  mining  extraction,  due  to  the  occurrence  of weaker rocks and structures, or a combination of both.

Within the ore body envelope, there are occasional weaker zones, mostly attributed to structural  settings  and  these  areas  require  more  extensive  ground  control  work  than  in other areas in order to maintain safe access and working conditions.

The primary access and infrastructure openings are well supported, large in size, and driven in good to very good ground.  Primary ground support consists of different lengths of mechanical and friction type rock bolting, wire mesh screening, and strapping.  Local ground conditions dictate the type of application, spacing, and length of rock bolts used.

There are areas in the old workings where pillars have failed and the hanging wall has deteriorated.  Some parts of the remnant ore extraction zones have wide spans, in excess of  30  ft,  across  the  intermediate  backs.  Wide-span back areas are supported with rebar and  split  set  rock  bolts,  cable  bolts  and  wire  mesh  screen.  The  area  of  hanging  wall failure is expected to expand as pillar mining progresses; however, no threats to active

## NORTH AMERICAN TUNGSTEN CORPORATION LTD.

areas are anticipated. Geotechnical monitoring of key areas and regular review of ground support practices and procedures are carried out based on the results.

Pakalnis &amp; Associates, geomechanics specialists, conducted a ground control audit on February 15 to 19, 2006.  The audit included a review of ground conditions of stopes and mining  areas,  geometrics  of  critical  back  spans,  ground  support,  and  pillar  recovery. Pakalnis &amp; Associates made the following recommendations:

- · Minimization of the amount of undercut through the use of a 'rammer jammer' or some alternative way to provide tight fill
- · Re-evaluation of intersections for the use of rebar and screen, particularly in areas where the span has exceeded the critical span
- · The use of a higher-capacity mechanical bolt (8.6 ton) in addition to pull tests to determine the realized strength
- · The use of rebar and screen in development drifts in response to deterioration from secondary blast and stress damage
- · The implementation of a design criteria or methodical engineering approach to their mining activities in combinations with past practices and experiences.

Pakalnis &amp; Associates conducted a follow-up ground control audit on March 9 to 12, 2008. The audit included a review of the February 2006 ground support recommendations and implementation of same.  Ground conditions of stopes and mining areas, geometrics of  critical  back  spans,  ground  support,  and  pillar  recovery  were  again  reviewed  along with support standards in use.

Pakalnis &amp; Associates made the following recommendations:

- · Address  the  induced  stress  deterioration  in  the  West  Extension  through seismic support (rebar, straps, chainlink) along with developing a 3D model to minimize adverse geometries/mine sequences.
- · The use of Shotcrete where weak rock mass/adverse faulting are encountered.
- · Ground control standards as presently employed should continue.

## NORTH AMERICAN TUNGSTEN CORPORATION LTD.

## MINING AREAS

The Cantung Mine workings extend vertically from 3600 up to the 4350 level and cover a strike length of approximately 5,000 ft.  In order of size, the key underground mining reserve areas are:

- · Main Zone (Pillar Recovery)
- · West Extension (below 3700)
- · West Extension (below 3570)
- · West Extension
- · South Flats Pillar Zone
- · PUG
- · E-Zone (Primary Mining)
- · Central Flats

Mining areas outside of Mineral Reserves include:

- · Open Pit

## MAIN ZONE

The Main Zone remnants are predominantly pillars of different shapes and types left in  the  central  portion  of  the  mined  out  E-zone.  Between  2007  and  2009,  undercut development was completed and many of the Main Zone pillars were extracted.  Lessons learned  during  the  initial  pillar  excavations  allowed  planning  to  reduce  future  pillar extraction dilution and losses.

During 2009, an intensive data mining program was launched to evaluate whether any additional  tons  could  be  found  in  the  Main  Zone.  This  resulted  in  a  number  of discoveries. In total, 195,440 tons of 1.17%WO3 was added to the reserves. This has been an  amazing  success  and  is  planned  to  continue  until  all  remnant  pillars  have  been identified and evaluated.

## WEST EXTENSION

The West Extension is located at the western end of the 3950 haulage drift level and extends westward and below this level.  This area was explored by diamond drilling prior to  1986  and  was  first  developed  for  ore  production  in  2001.    The  ore  was  initially extracted  by  cut  and  fill  methods,  using  waste  rock  as  backfill  material  and  later  by longhole retreat methods leaving open stopes.

## NORTH AMERICAN TUNGSTEN CORPORATION LTD.

The  2005/2006  production  from  the  West  Extension  was  below  previous  resource estimates for a number of reasons:

- · Higher than expected dilution
- · Use of lower cut-off grades for grade control (i.e. more low-grade rounds sent to mill)
- · Narrow and patchy mineralization causing continuity problems

Over the summer of 2006, West Extension Mineral Reserves were re-estimated by Cantung Mine personnel.  Dilution reflecting recent experience was applied.  Low grade control cut-off grades are no longer necessary, as long hole tons from pillar recovery are now available to form the majority of mill feed.  Greater selection has been applied to West  Extension  mineralization,  eliminating  narrow  or  isolated  areas  from  reserves. Additional sill development and two long hole stopes were mined during 2007 and 2008. Stope sequence modeling to mine the remainder of the West Extension was completed in early 2009 to minimize stress related issues. To date during 2009, 3 longhole stopes have been extracted with excellent recovery and dilution. Reserves for this block have been reduced by 67,421 tons at 1.10% WO3. Mining of this zone is ongoing and will provide a substantial amount of the ore feed for the remainder of the year.

## South Flats

The South Flats Pillar Zone comprises the mined out areas on the south side of the EZone orebody on the 4100 and 4050 levels.  The area was mined and backfilled, leaving long rib pillars that are generally 15 ft to 30 ft in width. During 2007 and 2008, extraction of  the  remaining pillars was achieved by mining an undercut drift (ramped down from 3950  level)  and  drilling  longholes  up  into  each  of  the  pillars.    Each  undercut  drift accessed several pillars which were mined in a retreating sequence. By the end of 2008, all undercut  development  was  completed  and  all  the  South  Flats  pillars  had  been extracted.

During 2009, an intensive data mining program was launched to evaluate whether any additional  tons  could  be  found  in  the  South  Flats.  This  resulted  in  a  number  of discoveries. Subsequently, access was re-established into this area, rehabilitation of old workings has commenced and should be complete early in the 3 rd quarter. This will allow for a small amount of ore development, followed by the extraction of a number of small longhole stopes in a retreat sequence. Reserves in this area now stand at 45,287 tons at 1.33% WO3.

## WEST EXTENSION (BELOW 3700 LEVEL)

The West Extension zone below 3700 Level (lowest mine development) is located at the western end of the 3950 haulage drift level and extends from the 3700 ft elevation to the 3570 ft elevation.   This area was discovered and explored by diamond drilling during 2008. It was later infilled and expanded by additional diamond drilling in 2009, resulting in an expansion of the reserve of 123,002 tons at 1.09%WO3.  Development of an access decline ramp is ongoing to access the lowest level of this zone.  The upper levels are now undergoing ore development. Longhole mining of this zone will take place throughout the Life of Mine.

## WEST EXTENSION (BELOW 3570 LEVEL)

The West Extension zone below 3570 Level is located directly down dip from the West Extension below 3700 Level and extends from the 3570 ft elevation to the 3450 ft elevation.   Diamond drilling in 2009 resulted in an expanded resource and the inclusion into the reserve for this zone. There are now 148,187 tons at 1.11% WO3 in the reserves in this zone. This area can be accessed from the same decline ramp as the West Extension zone below 3700 area.

## CENTRAL FLATS

The Central Flats Zone is located down dip of the western end of the E Zone stopes and  on  strike  centrally  between  the  South  Flats  and  the  West  Extension.    The  zone extends from the 3920 ft elevation to the 3700 ft elevation and is accessed by a decline ramp  developed  off  the  3950  haulage  drift  level  in  2008.      This  area  was  partially explored by diamond drilling prior to 1986 and was not previously included in resource estimates.  Ore development to test the zone was carried out during 2008 resulting in the addition  of  mining  reserves.    Drift  and  slash  (on  retreat)  mining  is  ongoing  for  the relatively flat lying discontinuous veins in this zone.

## E-ZONE

The E-Zone was, historically, the main mining zone located in the central portion of the  mine.    The  ore  body  extends  vertically  above  and  below  the  3950  haulage  level. Remnant stopes and pillars range from 4100 level to 4400 level.  The last few remaining pillars will be mined during the remaining Life of Mine.

## NORTH AMERICAN TUNGSTEN CORPORATION LTD.

## SHOP ZONE

The Shop Zone is an area of mineralization located behind the shop on 3950 level. The  zone  was  developed  and  the  majority  mined  by  longhole  methods  in  2008.    The remainder was mined in the first quarter 2009. This area will now become a fill location during the commissioning of the new backfill plant.

## OPEN PIT

The open pit  mine  is  located  west  of  the  main  underground  ore  body,  at  the  4900 level.  Access is limited to the summer months, as the steep road is prone to icing and avalanche danger during the winter.  The open pit was idle from 1976 to 2004 due to unfavourable economics.

The pit was mined in the summers of 2005 and 2006 using a local contractor from Watson  Lake.    The  pit  ore  was  hauled  over  a  three  mile  haulage  road  to  a  stockpile located in the vicinity of the primary crusher, directly above the mill.  The ore, grading approximately  0.5%  WO3,  was  blended  with  underground  feed  whenever  underground production lagged below planned levels.

Mining  was  carried  out  by  use  of  conventional  open  pit  methods.    The  design parameters for the pit utilized a triple bench with the bench height being 20 ft, 25 ft safety berm,  and  12%  grade  for  the  haul  road.    In  addition,  to  accommodate  geotechnical constraints, an overall pit slope of 45  was used, with the exception of those sections of o the wall that transect the East Fault Block.  The pit sectors transected by the East Fault Block required a reduced pit slope of 40  for a portion of the wall. o

More design work is required in order to move the Open Pit Mineral Resource into Mineral Reserves.

## PUG ZONE

The PUG zone is an extension of the open pit ore body, contained within the wall of the pit.  It has been defined by drilling and exploration drifting.  A small reserve has been

## NORTH AMERICAN TUNGSTEN CORPORATION LTD.

calculated based on a block of ore immediately adjacent to current workings that can be mined by longhole methods. The ore from the PUG will be hauled to the mill stockpile via  the  open  pit  haulage  road.    More  design  work  is  required  in  order  to  move  the remainder of the PUG Zone Mineral Resource into Mineral Reserves.

## LIFE OF MINE PRODUCTION SCHEDULE

The  mine  production  schedule  is  based  on  providing  ore  from nine  sources  to  the processing facilities at an average rate of 1,100 tons per day.  These sources include the Main  Zone  Pillars,  West  Extension,  West  Extension  (Below  3700),  West  Extension (Below 3570), South Flats, Central Flats, E-Zone, PUG and some stockpiled material. To demonstrate that the Underground Mineral Reserves are an economically mineable part of Mineral Resources, the Open Pit and PUG Zones (outside of Mineral Reserves) are not included in the production schedule and discounted cash flow analysis.  The Open Pit and PUG Zones require further work before they can be included in Mineral Reserves.  Table 17-1 shows the production ore tonnes for each zone and the relative grades.

| TOTAL                       | 1,020,699        |           1.08 |

The majority of the mill feed will be from the underground mine.  Stockpiled material will be blended with underground ore and processed in the mill.  Underground Mineral Reserves  are  scheduled  from  July  2009  to  January  2012,  2.5  years  of  mining.    The production schedule is shown in Figure 17-8.

Figure: 17-8   LIFE OF MINE PRODUCTION SCHEDULE

<!-- image -->

## NORTH AMERICAN TUNGSTEN CORPORATION LTD.

Underground waste development requirements are scheduled to decline over the mine life, with development essentially complete by the end of 2009.  Ongoing development totalling 4,000 ft (90,000 tons) includes completion of ramp access and connections in the West Extension Zone below 3700 Level, pillar undercuts in the Main Zones, and ramp access and connections in the Central Flats Zone.

Stope preparation comprises advance zone and mining block development with the necessary  construction  and  service  activities for providing  a  safe and  productive environment  in  the  mine.    In  general,  the  stope  preparation  process  focuses  on  stope access,  ore  transport/transfer  development,  ventilation,  and  backfill  delivery  systems installation.

Stope sequencing is scheduled, wherever possible, to obtain a uniform and metallurgically acceptable blend of ore to the mill.  The existing sill pillars are relatively narrow  with  a  high  rock  stress,  which  limit  flexibility  in  the  sequencing  of  West Extension stopes.

The  underground  mine  has  experienced  problems  in  the  past  in  maintaining  the production rate, due largely to a period of changeover from predominately cut and fill methods to predominately long hole methods, requiring extensive stope preparation lead time.  Through 2009 ore will be sourced from development, cut and fill, pillar recovery and longhole stoping.  Upon completion of stope preparation longhole methods will be the predominate source of ore in the latter part of the mine life.

## MOBILE EQUIPMENT

The majority of the site mobile equipment belongs to NATCL.  Some light and heavy vehicles  are  leased  or  rented.  The  mobile  mining  fleet  comprises  different  makes  and ages of equipment pieces.  Although some of the units are relatively old, the life of the operation  is  short,  and  equipment  replacement  will  not  be  required.    The  underground mobile fleet is listed in the following table.

## INFRASTRUCTURE

## UNDERGROUND

The main access to the mine is via an adit collared in close proximity to the mill at 3950 level.  The concrete-paved adit serves as the main ore haulage drift for the mine and also  as  a  return  airway  for  mine  ventilation.    Fresh  air  is  delivered  to  the  mine  via  an intake ventilation adit collared at the 4350 level.  The ventilation adit is connected with a decline, serving as an escape way or an emergency access to the mine.

On  both  sides  of  the  main  haulage  drift  are  five  loadout  stations,  spaced  several hundred  feet  apart.    These  loadout  stations  receive  broken  muck  via  raises  from  the mining areas above.  Muck from the loadout stations is transferred by loader into a truck, which hauls the ore to the mill stockpile/crushing station.

The mine has a number of internal ramps connecting different levels and ore zones. A majority of the ramps are of large cross section and driven on a moderate gradient from 10% to 12%.

## SHOPS &amp; MATERIAL STORAGE

The  mine  has  an  underground  maintenance  shop  with  a  warehouse,  located  on  the 3950  level  off  the  main  haulage  drift.    The  maintenance  shop  is  a  multi-chamber excavation with large service bays and warehousing facilities.  The back and walls are well supported and appear to be in very good condition.  The shop maintenance bays are equipped with overhead cranes ranging from 5 ton to 15 ton capacity.  Electrical repair and welding stations are part of the shop service infrastructure.  The warehouse is large and stocked with a sizable inventory of parts.  The shop has a lunchroom equipped for emergency situations and a separate escapeway, in a fresh airway, to surface.

There are open field storage areas and crib facilities located in different parts of the mine.  They are stocked with typical mining consumables, such as rock bolts, wire mesh screen, pipe, fittings, and timber needed for construction and ground support applications.

## POWER

Mine  site  electric  power  is  obtained  from  the  powerhouse  via  the  site  electrical distribution system.  The electric power is delivered to the mine substations at 4160V and transformed to 600V.  From the mine substations, power is distributed via electric cables to different areas of the mine to feed the underground mobile and stationary equipment.

## VENTILATION

Two intake fans, installed in parallel, deliver 230,000 cfm of fresh air to the mine. These fans are located at the 4350 level adit on surface.  The installation includes a set of propane burners for heating the air in winter to prevent freezing of the intake drift.  The air heaters are equipped with 12 million BTU burners.  The fans push the air down the mine  through  various  levels.    The  underground  airflow  is  controlled  by  a  number  of ventilation doors, raises, and regulators.  Auxiliary fans and ducting provide ventilation in development  and  blind  areas  of  the  mine.    The  mine  ventilation  air  exhausts  back  to surface via the 3950 level haulage adit.

The ventilation schematic is shown in Figure 17-9.

## VEHICLE SERVICE

Vehicle maintenance is carried out in the underground shop.  The UG maintenance shop is well designed and furbished for providing a wide variety of services for the whole underground equipment fleet.  All regular and major maintenance services are done at this location.  Major engine rebuilds are done off-site.

The key site facilities, including: Apartment Blocks, Condominiums, First Aid Room, Kitchen,  Shops,  Warehouses,  offices,  and  other  service  buildings  appear  generally  in good condition.

The  camp  consists  of  apartment  buildings  and  kitchen  facilities.    Employees, contractors, and site visitors are accommodated in an 80 person apartment complex and in staff rooms above the main office.  The site can accommodate up to 140 people at one time.

The site has a large number of offices.  Practically, each operation at the site has an office, or a number of offices, as in the case of the processing facilities and the mine dry building. Each  office is equipped  with  a  telephone linked to the site satellite communication system.  Most of the offices are provided with computers linked to the site network.

The site  main  offices  are  located  in  a  separate  building  and  will  accommodate  the mine  manager,  maintenance  superintendent,  human  resources,  safety,  and  accounting departments.  First Aid and employee training facilities are located in the same building.

The site surface shop is located close to the warehouse and processing facilities.  It provides service to all surface mobile equipment and provides a repair facility for other miscellaneous work.  The shop is well designed and equipped with an overhead crane and welding and pipe fitting stations.

Materials are stored in several locations at the site.   A  heated  central warehouse is located close to the mill and maintenance shop.  In addition to the warehouse, there are several cold storage buildings and outdoor storage areas.  All of the buildings are in good order.

## NORTH AMERICAN TUNGSTEN CORPORATION LTD.

Water  is  sourced  from  the  Flat  River  in  accordance  with  the  Water  Licence.    The water  usage  is  restricted  by  the  Water  Licence  to  less  than  45,000  m   per  week.    The 3 water is treated and used as potable and process water.  The water pump house has its own backup power generator.

The  site  is  supplied  with  electric  power  from  a  single  powerhouse,  equipped  with diesel  generators.    Total  installed  power  at  the  site  is  approximately  8.5  MW  and  the demand in cold weather approaches 4.5 MW.  Fuel consumption for power generation is approximately  22,000  litres  per  day.    Waste  heat  from  the  genset  cooling  system  is recovered to heat the mill and other building facilities.

Diesel fuel is stored in two 360,000 litre tanks at the site.  Diesel fuel from the main tanks is delivered to the powerhouse and roaster by gravity via a five centimetre diameter pipeline, equipped with a number of control valves.  Additionally, there are day tanks in the powerhouse with a capacity of 18,000 litres.

Outside the powerhouse, adjacent to the administration building, there are spare diesel tanks  with  a  total  capacity  of  13,000  litres.    Gasoline  is  stored  in  a  9,000  litre  tank, equipped with a distribution pump for fuelling light vehicles.  The underground mobile equipment is fuelled from a diesel tank located at the portal.

Propane is used for camp heating, cooking, and mine intake air heating.  There are numerous  propane  storage  tanks  at  different  locations  on  the  site  and  at  the  mine  air intake fan station.  Tanker trucks deliver propane, diesel, and gasoline to the tanks on site.

All  sewage  is  discharged  to  the  Tailings  Containment  Area  in  accordance  with  the Water Licence provision.

The site has a small garbage incinerator located at the garbage dump.  Site garbage is incinerated at this installation and the residue, and other solid non-combustible waste, is

## NORTH AMERICAN TUNGSTEN CORPORATION LTD.

buried  at  the  existing  garbage  dump  in  a  former  borrow  pit  approximately  three kilometres southeast of the town site.

Hazardous waste is handled, stored, and disposed of in accordance with applicable regulations.    PCB  materials  previously  stored  in  a  permitted  facility  at  the  site  were removed for destruction in 2002.  There are several transformers in service, with only 2 of these transformers containing PCB's.

## TRANSPORTATION

Although the mine is situated in the Northwest Territories, the town of Watson Lake, Yukon  Territory,  is  the  staging  area  for  trucking  the  tungsten  concentrates  and  for supplying the mine site.

Travel  by  road  between  the  mine  site  and  Watson  Lake  takes  four  to  five  hours. Travel by plane between Whitehorse and the mine can take up to two hours, depending upon the type of aircraft used.

The airstrip is a 1,219 m long VFR rated gravel strip.  It has been maintained during mine closures in the past and was reopened in 2005.  The airstrip needs periodic grading to level the surface.

Employees who live outside  the  Yukon  are  transported  by  plane  between  standard points of hire and the site.  NATCL charters private aircraft (Northern Thunderbird Air) from  Vancouver  to  Prince  George  and/or  Smithers  to  transport  the  majority  of  the workforce.  From Whitehorse, employees are transported by vehicle to the mine.  Pickup of employees is made in Watson Lake and other eastern Yukon communities.

Emergency  transportation,  particularly  medical  evacuation,  will  be  by  whatever means are possible in the prevailing weather and road conditions.  Fixed-wing aircraft, helicopter,  bus,  ambulance,  or  a  company  vehicle  could  be  used  in  an  emergency situation.

## NORTH AMERICAN TUNGSTEN CORPORATION LTD.

Concentrates are shipped from the mine site to customers in two-tonne plastic tote bags by truck.  Trucks delivering materials to the mine site backhaul the concentrate.

The mine is responsible for maintaining the access road from the mine site to Km 134.  The Yukon government is responsible for maintaining the remainder of the road from Km 134 to Watson Lake.

## SAFETY

NATCL provides first aid coverage for the employees.  Certified first aid attendants who meet the requirements of the WSCC of the NWT are employed full time and provide 24 hour first aid service.  The mine has a fully equipped first aid room located in the main office  building  and  a  satellite  first  aid  room  at  the  mine  dry.    NATCL  maintains  an emergency  transportation  vehicle  (ambulance)  for  the  transportation  of  injured  or  sick personnel.  In case of critical emergency need, helicopter or a plane evacuation from the site  to  Whitehorse  or  Watson  Lake  can  be  arranged  through  EMS  dispatch  out  of Whitehorse Yukon.

A comprehensive and current compilation of procedures is maintained at the mine site satisfying the legislation of the Mines Health and Safety Act for the NWT.

All levels of personnel hold responsibilities for safety in their areas.  The Site Safety Officer supports  management,  supervision,  area  trainers  and  workers  through  the following:

- · Ensuring compliance to the regulations of the Mines Health and Safety Act of the NWT
- · Training of employees in the safety aspects of their work and promote safe work habits
- · Keeping records of employees safety training
- · Developing and maintaining current applicable procedures
- · Selecting appropriate safety and emergency response equipment
- · Ensuring the competency of  emergency response teams

## NORTH AMERICAN TUNGSTEN CORPORATION LTD.

- · Carrying out site safety inspections to ensure compliance with regulations and regulatory standards
- · Co  chair  and  manage  the  activities  of  the  Occupational  Health  and  Safety Committee
- · Ensure that a current Emergency Response Plan is in place and all employees are aware and competent to their responsibilities under the plan.
- · Reporting and recording as required

Each  new  employee  undergoes  an  induction  and  training  program  appropriate  to his/her experience level and department of employment.

The  mine  has  an  Occupational  Health  &amp;  Safety  Committee  and  its  activities  are conducted in accordance with applicable NWT regulations. All accidents and incidents (including spills) are reported and investigated with the intent of preventing recurrence. NATCL  maintains  mine  rescue  services  at  the  mine  site.    The  Mine  Rescue  Team operates from a room located at the mine dry building.  NATC provides ongoing mine rescue training to meet the requirements of the regulations. The key mine underground workings  and  facilities  such  as  the  refuge  stations,  maintenance  shop,  lunch  rooms, electric  substations,  load  out,  and  other  important  areas  are  equipped  with  telephones. This  network  is  connected  with  the  site  telephone  system.  In  case  of  an  underground emergency,  the  mine  utilizes  an  ethyl  mercaptan  stench  gas  system  for  warning underground employees.  This system relies on injecting the ethyl mercaptan gas into the compressed air lines and into the fresh air at the intake fan station.

## MANPOWER

The CanTung mine is organized as a single status fly-in / fly-out 365 day operation. NATC vehicles transport Northern employees from Whitehorse and Watson Lake to the mine site.  Southern employees are chartered to/from site with 2 Beech 1900 aircrafts on each Wednesday's crew rotation.  The charter pick up points are Vancouver, Campbell River,  Prince  George  &amp;  Smithers,  BC.    Most  employees  work  on  a  rotation  schedule, nominally three weeks on and three weeks off, 12 hours per day.  Variances for longer

## ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS

The Cantung Mine is in compliance with applicable regulations. The following is a summary from the 2008 report, with updated information supplied by NATCL:

## PERMITS

On December 5, 2003 NATCL received notification from the Mackenzie Valley Land and Water Board (MVLWB) of the renewal of the type 'A' Water License (the license) for a period of five years, expiring on November 29, 2008. The Water Licence outlines  the  permitted  water  use  and  includes  a  surveillance  program  and  criteria  for discharge.  There  are  also  a  number  of  conditions  related  to  the  operation.  The  water license was extended by 60 days to January 28, 2009 as outlined below.

In July 2007, NATCL applied to the MVLWB for a 5 year renewal to the license. The renewal process is a public process involving public consultation, comment review and public hearings. The original public hearings scheduled for July 23-25, 2008 were postponed  by  the  MVLWB  at  the  request  of  the  hosting  communities  due  to  personal tragedies in both small communities. Due to this delay NATC was requested to apply to the  MVLWB for  a  60  day  license  extension,  which  was  approved  by  the  Minister  of Indian and Northern Affairs on September 8, 2008.

The public hearings for the five year license renewal took place on October 28-30, 2008, with the new proposed license forwarded on December 9, 2008 by the MVLWB to the Minister of INAC for his approval. The new 5 year term water license was issued on January 30, 2009.

The security deposit required under the prior license was $7,900,000 (which was and is posted in support of the license). The renewed license requires that NATCL post an additional security deposit of $5,200,000 over time (see Mine Closure, below).  NATC negotiated the terms of the form of security deposit with INAC, which has jurisdiction over such an arrangement and to whose benefit the deposits are to be posted, and entered

## NORTH AMERICAN TUNGSTEN CORPORATION LTD.

into the Reclamation  Security  Agreement  (RSA).  NATCL  has  posted  a  total  of $3,900,000  in  cash  and  $6,600,000  in  the  required  form  of  secured  promissory  note pursuant to the RSA. The total security posted in favour of INAC is $10,500,000 which fulfills the security requirements of the Water License up to July 1, 2009. The amounts owing  are  secured  against  NATCL's  assets  by  way  of  a  General  Security  Agreement (GSA).

The RSA provides for the cash components payable to INAC to increase under certain  events.    Any  funds  in  excess  of  ultimate  reclamation  costs  will  be  returned  to NATCL.

## MINE CLOSURE CONSIDERATIONS AND REQUIREMENTS

In the past, there have been a number of mine abandonment and reclamation plans prepared for the Cantung site. As required in the water license, the most recent plan for final  abandonment  and  reclamation  of  the  mine  was  submitted  by  NATCL  to  the MVLWB in November 2007.  In  February  2008,  the  MVLWB  informed  NATCL  that they  could  not  approve  the  plan  as  submitted,  and  following  an  agreement  with  the MVLWB,  NATC  submitted  an  updated  Closure  &amp;  Reclamation  Plan  (CRP),  to  the MVLWB on March 31, 2009.

Mine  closure  cost  estimates  were  included  in  all  reclamation  submissions. Additional mine closure cost estimates have been prepared for NATCL, the MVLWB and INAC. The range of closure cost estimates is shown in the table below. The MVLWB selected  the  reclamation  security  of  $13.1  million  for  the  2009  license  based  upon  the estimates up to June 2008. As part of the present ongoing license renewal process, the security estimates have been updated by NATC and Brodie Consulting, as shown in the table below.

## North American Tungsten Corporation Ltd.-Cantung Mine 2009 YTD

| ACTIVITIES                      |   UNIT COST (C$/ton) |
|---------------------------------|----------------------|
| Mining                          |                53.69 |
| Milling                         |                22.34 |
| Plant and Site Services         |                32.67 |
| Site Administration             |                25.28 |
| Underground Equipment           |                10.29 |
| Corporate and Whitehorse Office |                 7.95 |
| TOTAL                           |               152.22 |

The total estimated unit cost for the project $152.22 per ton milled, including head office costs.  This cost is based on processing 1,100 tons/day of ore and producing two types of concentrates, G1 and Flotation.

Monthly total operating costs are forecast to be in the order of $5.0 million.

## MINE

The  estimated  cost  of  mining  is  substantially  higher  in  comparison  with  the  costs attained during previous years, due to higher rates for labour and consumables such as explosives and ground support.

Open pit and PUG Zone mining costs are not included in the cash flow estimate.

## MILL

The milling cost is estimated to be $22.34 per ton milled.  This cost is in line with past performance when adjusted for inflation and higher costs of materials, energy, and consumables.

## PLANT SERVICES

The plant unit cost is estimated to be $32.67 (surface plus power) per ton milled.  No major changes are expected to take place in the site services.

## NORTH AMERICAN TUNGSTEN CORPORATION LTD.

## SITE ADMINISTRATION

The administration unit cost is estimated to be $25.28 (site administration, Sodexho, employee transportation) per ton milled.  Head office costs are estimated to be $7.95 per ton  milled  in  addition  to  the  site  administration  costs.    Increased  costs  for  manpower, employee  transportation,  and  insurance  result  in  substantially  higher  costs  than  in  the past.

## MARKETS/CONTRACTS

Cantung will produce two product lines of concentrate: a premium  gravity concentrate  (G1)  containing  approximately  65%  WO3,  accounting  for  75%  of  the production  output  and  a  flotation  grade  concentrate  containing  45%  to  50%  WO3, accounting for 25%.  As discussed in the Mineral Processing section, concentrates may be blended in various configurations to maximize revenue.

NATCL sells the G1 product at prices based on free market values for ammonium paratungstate (APT).  Flotation concentrate is sold directly into the market or converted to APT through tolling arrangements prior to sale.  Customers for the Cantung products include North American, European, and Chinese APT producers.

NATCL's competitors are the tungsten producers within  China,  the  Beralt  mine  in Portugal,  and,  on  a  smaller  scale,  producers  within  Russia,  Africa,  South  America, Thailand,  and  Vietnam.    Although  China  is  unable  to  export  concentrate,  NATC  must compete against Chinese mines to supply to APT producers within China.

## PRICING

June 2009 London Metal Bulletin (LMB) European free market price quotation for APT is approximately US$200 per MTU.  Before 2005, prices were fairly consistent in the  range  of  US$40  to  US$90  per  MTU,  with  a  median  of  approximately  US$60  per MTU.  See the following Figure 17-10

Figure: 17-10 TEN YEAR AVERAGE TUNGSTEN PRICES

<!-- image -->

For cash flow estimation, Cantung revenue is based on a G1 product price of US$205 per MTU.

## MARKET OUTLOOK

According  to  the  U.S.  Geological  Survey  (USGS),  global  reserves  in  2004  were 2,900,000 tons of contained tungsten, with China accounting for the largest reserves at 1,800,000 tons followed by Canada with 260,000 tons and by Russia with 250,000 tons.

Current global tungsten consumption is approximately 85,000 tonnes and is expected to increase to 110,000 tonnes over the next five years. The estimated production for the Cantung mine for fiscal year 2009 is approximately 3,100 tonnes of WO3 or 2,450 tonnes of contained tungsten, representing approximately 3% of estimated global demand.

In  addition  to  the  sale  of  concentrates,  NATCL  is  currently  exploring  new  product potential  as  part  of  a  joint  venture  with  a  nanotechnology  manufacturing  company. NATCL will provide material for downstream processing into tungsten powders, and new tungsten composites with applications primarily in the automotive and sporting sectors with a focus on lead replacement.

## ECONOMIC ANALYSIS

The Pre-Tax Cash Flow Projection shown in Table 17-9 has been generated from the life of mine physicals as shown in Table 17-2 and capital and operating cost data.  The Cash Flow starts in July 2009 (the Mineral Reserve estimation date), and is organized by NATCL's fiscal year, which runs from October to September.  A summary of the key criteria is provided below.

## ECONOMIC CRITERIA

## PHYSICALS

- · Mine life:
- · Operations 365 days per year
- · Mill  throughput  of  1,100  tons  per  day  from  underground,  or  approximately 400,000 tons per year.
- · Metallurgy as per mill performance:
- o Tungsten recovery 79.0%
- o Gravity concentrate (G1)
-  Grade 65%
-  Distribution 75%
-  Recovery relative to mill feed 59.3%
- o Flotation concentrate
-  Grade 47%
-  Distribution 25%
-  Recovery relative to mill feed 19.7%

2.5 years

• Total mill feed: 1,020,999 tons at a grade of 1.08% WO3

## REVENUE

- · Tungsten selling price over entire life of mine
- o US$205/MTU for G1 product
- o US$245/MTU  for  APT  converted  from  flotation  concentrate  less conversion charges and process losses

## NORTH AMERICAN TUNGSTEN CORPORATION LTD.

- · Revenue recognized at the time of production
- · Average exchange rate US$1: $C1.16
- · Teck Resources Ltd. royalty 1%
- · Insurance, Freight &amp; Marketing charges of $280/ton
- · Moisture content &lt;1% (Flotation product)

## COSTS

• Sustaining capital:

$6.9 million

• Exploration:

$1.4 million

- · The average operating cost over the mine life, including head office cost, is estimated to be $152.22 per ton milled

## CASH FLOW MODEL

Considering the Cantung Mine on a stand-alone basis, the undiscounted pre-tax cash flow totals CDN$9.7 million over the remaining mine life.  As an operating mine without significant capital requirements, cash flow is anticipated to be positive over the course of the mine life.

The site Unit Cost of Production is CDN$187 per MTU of WO3.  A low discount rate is appropriate due to the short mine life, and the lower risk associated with an operating mine.  The Net Present Value (NPV) at a 6% discount rate is $9.3 million.  This is a 2009 constant  dollar  model  and,  as  mine  life  is  relatively  short  (2.5  years),  introduction  of inflation/deflation criteria to the model will make little difference to NPV figures.

## PROJECT SENSITIVITY

Figure 18-10 shows the project sensitivity to the following factors:

- · Tungsten price
- · Operating costs
- · C$:US$ exchange rate
- · Head grade
- · Mill recovery

Figure: 17-11 SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS

<!-- image -->

The  Cantung  Mine  is  most  sensitive  to  exchange  rates,  product  prices,  and  head grades.  The relative impact on undiscounted pre-tax cash flow on changes in operational and cost assumptions and estimates are shown in the table below.

## 18 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS

In NATCL's opinion, the Cantung Mine has the advantages of considerable operating history, low capital requirements, and established contacts with suppliers and customers. The Mine has operated successfully in the past, however, it should be noted that it is a relatively high cost producer, and has experienced numerous shutdowns during periods of low  tungsten  prices  and  product  demand.    In  NATCL's  opinion,  the  key  risk  to  mine profitability  lies  in  tungsten  price  sustainability,  marketing  of  concentrate  products  and mined head grades for the remainder of the mine life.

When production is taken into  account,  Mineral  Reserves  have  increased  since  the previous estimate of October 1, 2008. The increase is due to exploration of new zones, inclusion  of  lower-grade  areas  rendered  economic  by  higher  prices,  and  planned  pillar recovery in previously mined areas through the use of longhole mining methods.

There  are  Mineral  Resources  in  the  Open  Pit/PUG  Zone  that  could  potentially  be mined.  Past open pit and PUG designs proposed production in the order of more than one year of mill feed.

As  long  as  development  and  stope  preparation  continues  in  a  timely  manner, longhole  mining  should  provide  steady  production  at  a  lower  cost  than  cut  and  fill mining.    Longhole  pillar  mining  carries  a  risk  of  lower  grades  from  higher  dilution, however, production estimates carry a reasonable and appropriate allowance for expected dilution.
