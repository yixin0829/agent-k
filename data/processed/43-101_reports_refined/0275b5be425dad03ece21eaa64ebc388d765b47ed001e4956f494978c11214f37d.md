Magma Metals Limited Thunder Bay North Polymetallic Project Ontario, Canada NI 43-101 Technical Report

## 1.0 SUMMARY

AMEC  Americas  Limited  (AMEC)  was  commissioned  by  Magma  Metals  Limited (Magma Metals) to prepare an independent Qualified Person's Review and a National Instrument 43-101 Technical Report (the Report) for the Thunder Bay North polymetallic project (the Project), located in the Thunder Bay area of Ontario, Canada. The Project is held in the name of Magma Metals (Canada) Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary  of  Magma  Metals.    For  the  purposes  of  this  Report,  the  parent  and subsidiary companies are referred to interchangeably as 'Magma Metals'.

Magma  Metals  will  be  using  this  Report  to  support  an  updated  Mineral  Resource estimate on the Project, as disclosed in the press release dated 7 September 2010, and  entitled  'Thunder  Bay  North  -  Mineral  Resource  Estimate  Update;  708,000 platinum equivalent ounces now in Indicated Resources'.

## 1.1 Project Setting, Location, and Access

The  Thunder  Bay  Project  is  situated  approximately  50  km  northeast  of  the  city  of Thunder  Bay,  within  the  Thunder  Bay  Mining  Division,  Ontario,  Canada.    Project centroids  are  approximately  latitude  45º46'  N,  and  longitude  88º55'.    The  Project contains a base metal-platinum group elements (PGE) deposit that is divided into the Current Lake, Bridge and Beaver Lake Zones.

The climate is continental with a temperate marine influence from the close proximity of Lake Superior.  Exploration activities can be curtailed by snowmelt conditions.  It is expected that any future mining operations will be able to be conducted year-round.

The  Project  is  accessible  using  a  series  of  intermittently-maintained  logging  roads branching  from  Armstrong  Highway  527,  which  in  turn  branches  from  the  TransCanada Highway 11-17 a short distance east of the city of Thunder Bay.  The closest commercial airport is at Thunder Bay.

The closest community to the Project is the village of Dorion, about 35 km east of the Project  site.    The  largest  community  in  Project  proximity  is  the  city  of  Thunder Bay (45 km).    There  is  no  existing  Project  infrastructure.    Exploration  activities  are currently supplied out of Thunder Bay.

Power is available at Thunder Bay, where a medium-size coal-fired generating plant is located.  A wind-farm, the Greenwich Wind Farm is in the early construction phase, and is has a proposed capacity of 100 MW.  The farm location is about 9 km eastnortheast of the Project area.

Project No.:  164115 October 2010

Magma Metals Limited Thunder Bay North Polymetallic Project Ontario, Canada NI 43-101 Technical Report

Two major power lines, a gas pipeline, and the Canadian Pacific Railway are located between 17.5 km and 19.5 km southeast of the centre of the Project.  A second gas pipeline is located approximately 32 km to the north.

There  are  numerous  freshwater  lakes,  streams,  and  rivers  in  the  Project  area. Groundwater is also in plentiful supply and is located close to surface in most areas. These sources could provide the required potable and process water for any mining operation.

Canada  has  sufficient  experienced  and  skilled  professionals  to  run  any  mining operation that could be constructed in the Project area.

## 1.2 Mineral Tenure

The Project consists of 219 original, unpatented, mining claims (2,551 claim units of 16 ha) covering an aggregate area of 40,816 ha.   The mineral resources estimated for the Beaver Lake, Bridge and Current Lake Zones are situated within claims 842189, 842186, and 4210157.

Magma Metals owns 100% of all claims within the Project, except four claims, totalling 30 units (480 hectares), covered by two underlying option agreements.

The Project  contains  no  patented  or  leased  claims.    None  of  the  claims  have  been legally surveyed.  AMEC was advised that required fees and duties have been paid to the appropriate regulatory authorities, and the claims are in good standing.

## 1.3 Surface Rights

Mineral claims are located on Crown lands, and therefore surface rights are acquired as  part  of  the  claim  process.    Magma  Metals  has  held  preliminary  discussions  with First Nation groups in the region to discuss Project development.

## 1.4 Royalties

A  group  of  32  claims  (including  claims  842189,  and  842186  that  host  mineral resources), is  subject  to  a  3%  net  smelter  royalty  (NSR),  one-third  of  which  can  be purchased by Magma Metals at any time for C$1 million.  Advanced NSR payments of C$50,000 per annum will be paid to the Vendors from the fifth anniversary of Magma Metal's  original  listing  on  the  Australian  Stock  Exchange  (ASX).    This  anniversary occurs in 2011.

## 1.5 Permits

Magma Metals has informed AMEC that work completed to date has been under the appropriate local, Provincial and Federal laws required for exploration-level activities. Additional permits would be required to support any Project development.

## 1.6 Environmental

Magma Metals has informed AMEC that current  project  environmental  liabilities  are restricted to exploration site activities and  access  trails constructed  to service exploration programs.

Magma  Metals  contracted  DST  Consulting  Engineers  (DST)  in  November  2007  to commence environmental baseline studies in the vicinity of the Current and Escape Lake drainage areas to determine current environmental conditions and monitor levels prior  to  any  potential  disturbance  from  advanced  exploration  or  possible  mining operations.    In  2009,  monitoring  was  extended  to  include  the  areas  of  Steepledge Lake, Ray Lake, Lone Island Lake, and Fitzpatrick Lake.

## 1.7 Geology and Mineralization

Mineralization  discovered  on  the  Project  to  date  is  considered  to  be  typical  of magmatic-hosted nickel-copper sulphide deposits, in particular part of the sub-class of such deposits that are associated with rift and flood basalts (Noril'sk type).

The  mineralization  is  hosted  in  the  Current  Lake  Intrusive  Complex;  a  series  of magmatic conduits of Keweenawan (Mesoproterozoic) age that have formed along a failed  rift  related  to  the  Nipigon  Embayment  and  are  part  of  the  Mid-continent  Rift system.  Rock types within the instrusive complex comprise a leucogabbro-diorite rock that  has  incorporated  large  quantities  of  country  rock,  termed  the  'Hybrid',  olivine melagabbro,  and  lherzolite  (two-pyroxene  peridotite).    Surrounding  Archean-age country  rock  includes  granodiorite  and  tonalite  with  minor  amounts  of  granite  and pegmatitic leucogranite, and meta-sedimentary rocks that were typically derived from a muddy, silty, or fine sandy precursor sediment.

The Current Lake Zone is a narrow conduit ranging from 30 m x 30 m to 50 m wide and  70  m  tall  and  in  general  is  flat-lying.    The  olivine  melagabbro  in  the  conduit contains  sulphide  mineralization  that  includes  pyrrhotite,  pentlandite,  chalcopyrite, pyrite,  and  rare  cubanite  and  violarite.    Sulphide  mineralization  is  disseminated, ranging from a few percent to &gt;25% sulphides, and is interstitial to the silicate gangue.

Magma Metals Limited Thunder Bay North Polymetallic Project Ontario, Canada NI 43-101 Technical Report

The  Beaver  Lake  Zone  exhibits  a  shallow  east-southeasterly  plunge  and  increases from 100 m width and 15 m thickness to 550 m width and 200 m thickness towards the east.  Mineralization is developed in olivine melagabbro and lherzolite.  The sulphide mineralogy is similar to Current Lake and includes pyrrhotite, pentlandite, chalcopyrite, pyrite and rare cubanite.  Sulphide mineralization is disseminated, ranging from a few percent to &gt;25% sulphides, and is also interstitial to the silicate gangue.

The  Bridge  Zone,  which  joins  the  two  lake  zones,  is  designated  based  on  a morphology change within the magma conduit.

## 1.8 History and Exploration

Initial exploration  in  the  general  region  was  for  uranium.    In  1991,  the  Ontario Geological  Survey  completed  airborne  magnetic  and  electromagnetic  geophysical surveys in the area; magnetic anomalies were identified in the surveys.  In the period 1993  to  2005,  rock  chip  sampling,  prospecting,  lithogeochemistry,  soil  sampling, ground magnetic surveys and petrographic and geochemical research were undertaken,  culminating  in  the  discovery  by  prospectors  of  mineralized  ultramafic (peridotite)  boulders  along  the  western  shoreline  of  Current  Lake.    During  2001, ground-magnetic  and  electromagnetic  surveys  and  core  drilling  were  completed  by Pacific North West Capital Corporation, who held an option on the area.  This option was not exercised.

Magma Metals optioned the Current Lake area in 2005, and subsequently completed a number  of  airborne  and  ground  geophysical  surveys,  and  core  drilling  of  selected geophysical targets.  This work identified two major areas of Cu-Ni-Pt-Pd sulphide mineralization, one at Beaver Lake and the second at Current Lake.  In 2009, a firsttime mineral resource estimate was performed.  A major infill drill program completed in 2010 led to a revised mineral resource estimate, which is the subject of this Report.

## 1.9 Drilling

Drilling  by  Magma  Metals  commenced  in  2006,  following  the  signing  of  the  option agreement, and has continued to the present.  All drilling has been completed using core  methods  (NQ  size  or  47.6  mm  core  diameter),  and  totalled  625  core  holes (137,378.7 m) as at 31 July 2010.  Since that date, the fall 2010 drill campaign has commenced,  with  eight  drill  holes  completed  at  the  Report  effective  date,  and  two holes underway.  A total of 528 core holes (97,676 m) are used to support the mineral resource estimate.

Project No.:  164115 October 2010

Magma Metals Limited Thunder Bay North Polymetallic Project Ontario, Canada NI 43-101 Technical Report

Drill  programs  have  been  completed  by  contract  drill  crew,  supervised  by  Magma Metals geological staff.

All drill holes have been geologically logged and record lithology, structure, mineralization minerals and intensity, alteration minerals and intensity, and veins.

Drill collars for land-based, barge-based, and ice-based drilling have been picked up on  completion  using  geodetic-grade,  global  positioning  system  (GPS)  instruments. Collars for those drill holes completed on land have also been surveyed by a licensed professional surveyor.

Down-hole  orientations  of  all  drill  holes  are  surveyed  using  a  Reflex  EZ-Shot® instrument, which is a magnetic instrument.  Since September 2007, the orientation of all  inclined  drill  holes  have  also  been  surveyed  by  a  Reflex  Maxibor II®  instrument, which is a non-magnetic multi-shot tool designed to be used in areas of magnetic rock. Since  January  2010  all  vertical  and  inclined  holes  have  been  surveyed  by  a  Reflex Gyro® instrument.  Down-hole pulse electromagnetic (EM) surveys are completed at approximate  50  m  drill  spacings,  and  magnetic  susceptibility  readings  are  taken approximately every 1.5 m in mineralization.

At Current Lake, the drilling has been completed along 50 m spaced section lines with core holes spaced at 10 m intervals on each section.  The average drill section and spacing in the Current Lake Zone is 50 m and varies between approximately 30 m and 60 m.  At Beaver Lake and the Bridge Zone, drilling has mainly been completed along 50 m spaced section lines with core holes spaced at 20 m to 50 m intervals on each section.  The vertical section spacing in both zones varies between 20 m and 50 m.

Drilling is normally perpendicular to the strike of the mineralization.  Depending on the dip of the drill hole, and the dip of the mineralization, drill intercept widths are typically greater than true widths in inclined drill holes, and approximate true widths in vertical drill  holes.    Drill  orientations  for  both  Current  Lake  and  Beaver  Lake  are  generally appropriate for the mineralization style, and have been drilled at orientations that are optimal for the orientation of mineralization for the bulk of the deposit area.

Sample  collection  and  handling  of  core  was  performed  in  accordance  with  industry standard practices, with procedures to limit sample losses and sampling biases.  Core samples are taken on 2 m intervals in rocks that are considered to be non-mineralized. Mineralized intersections are sampled on 1 m intervals.

Samples are submitted for analysis with quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) samples inserted.  These comprise blank, duplicate and standard reference materials (SRMs).

No factors were identified with the drilling programs that could affect Mineral Resource estimation.

## 1.10 Sample Preparation and Analysis

All analyses were performed by accredited independent laboratories.

Sample  preparation  protocols  for  all  drill  programs  were  appropriate  for  magmatic sulphide-style deposits, consisting of drying, crushing, splitting, and pulverization.

Gold, platinum and palladium are analysed using fire assay with an inductively coupled plasma  mass  spectrometry  (ICP-MS)  finish.    Samples  that  have  grades  above  the optimal ICP-MS detection limits are analysed using an optical emission spectroscopy method  (ICP-OES).    Multi-element  and  base  metals  are  analyzed  using  a  multielement  atomic  emission  spectroscopy  (ICP-AES),  following  four-acid  digest  of  the sample.  Where samples have Ni or Cu grades above the optimal detection limits for the analytical method, they are re-analysed, using an ore-grade method.

The  density  database  totals  4,494  measurements  in  mineralized  material,  and  an additional 448 measurements in wall rock.  Measurements were collected by Magma Metals staff using the standard water displacement method.

## 1.11 Data Validation

Initial data verification was performed by SRK Consulting (SRK) in 2009, in support of the  initial  mineral  resource  estimate.    No  significant  errors  were  noted  in  the  data evaluated at the time and the database was considered suitable to support the firsttime mineral resource estimate.

The  collar,  assay,  and  lithology  data  are  adequate  to  support  mineral  resource estimation.  AMEC noted some opportunities for improvements in all of these tables that should be addressed prior to completion of detailed Project studies.

Identified discrepancies in the down-hole survey data are troublesome.  AMEC cannot ascertain,  from  the  data  provided,  which  type  of  down-hole  survey  is  accurately measuring  the  azimuth  of  the  hole.    Most  of  the  discrepancies  will  only  result  in location discrepancies of a few meters (&lt;10 m), at most, but some discrepancies may be larger.  The biases between the survey types result in significant uncertainty as to the location of the holes.

As a result, AMEC believes that the data are useable, but will restrict mineral resource classification below about 100 m to the Inferred classification, at best, in the area of

Magma Metals Limited Thunder Bay North Polymetallic Project Ontario, Canada NI 43-101 Technical Report angled drill holes because of the uncertainty of the location of the information.  Vertical holes  are  not  so  dependent  on  azimuth  corrections  and  will  not  be  affected  by  this restriction.  The data will support a scoping (preliminary assessment) study but should be investigated and corrected prior to undertaking a pre-feasibility study.

Analytical  QA/QC  data  indicate  that  the  assay  data  are  sufficiently  accurate  and precise to support mineral resource estimation.  Additional data such as pulp duplicate data  would  allow  for  more  reliable  estimates  of  precision  and  lower  detection  limits. AMEC notes that Magma Metals have commenced addition of pulp duplicates to the sample stream with the current drill program.

## 1.12 Metallurgical Testwork

Comminution  testwork  was  performed  by  SGS  Lakefield,  and  included  SMC,  SPI®, Bond low-energy impact, Bond rod mill and Bond ball mill grindability tests, as well as Bond abrasion tests.  Samples included a main, composite sample, a boulder sample, and  a  variability  sample.    Results  indicate  mineralization  that  is  moderately  hard  to hard for all the grindability indices tested.  The main composite sample was found to be mildly abrasive.

Flotation testwork by G&amp;T Laboratories, on the main composite sample, indicated that a flowsheet comprising ball mill grinding to a P80 of 86 µm, non-sulphide hydrophobic gangue pre-flotation, rougher iron sulphide-PGM flotation and Ni-Cu rougher flotation, followed by three stages of cleaning was likely to be appropriate.  Work is ongoing to refine the likely flowsheet.

Average  recoveries  were  estimated  for  the  various  elements,  and  were  used  to support mineral resource estimation. Average recoveries are summarized  in Table 1-1.  Differences in the table between the actual recoveries from testwork and those  used  to  constrain  the  mineral  resource  estimate  are  based  on  the  date  of availability of supporting data.  The target percentages used for the mineral resource estimate were based on preliminary data available as of January 2010, whereas the actual  testwork  recovery  figures  are  based  on  testwork  results  available  as  of  July 2010.

For  nickel  and  cobalt,  there  is-to  date-poor  definition  of  the  relative  amounts  of sulphide  and  non-sulphide  (primarily  silicate)  mineralization;  total  sulphur  recovery suggests (but does not confirm) that sulphide Ni + Co recoveries may be in the 80% range.  Platinum, palladium and gold recoveries were slightly (Ag, Pd) to significantly (Au, Pt) above the January 2010 target, based on the July 2010 results.  Results of a preliminary  gravity  concentration  test  (Knelson  concentrator,  pan  cleanup)  indicate potential for significant (up to 40%) recovery of gold to a gravity pre-concentrate.  On this basis, a Knelson concentrator is likely to be included in the preliminary flowsheet.

Results of variability tests on two higher-grade samples indicate significantly better pay metal recoveries to bulk concentrates at approximately the same Cu + Ni and sulphide grades in each sample.  Test results from one lower-grade variability sample indicated slightly lower recovery at equivalent Cu + Ni and sulphide grades.

Overall, test results are considered to generally support the achievability of the metal recoveries used to constrain the resource model.

## 1.13 Mineral Resource Estimates

## 1.13.1 Methodology

The 2010 database was closed for estimation purposes at 31 May 2010.

Two block models were created: one for the resource estimate for mineralization that was to be considered as able to support extraction via open pit methods, and one for the  mineralization  that  was  to  be  considered  as  able  to  support  extraction  via

Magma Metals Limited Thunder Bay North Polymetallic Project Ontario, Canada NI 43-101 Technical Report underground  mining  methods.    The  block  models  are  regular  block  models  without sub-blocks or percent models.

Wire-frame models representing topographical, geological, and grade shell boundaries were  generated  in  commercially-available  Gemcom  GEMS  and  MineSight  software from  available  drill  hole  data  and  digitized  geological  cross-section  interpretations provided by Magma Metals staff.  The topographic surface was modelled as a wireframe in GEMS from a LIDAR digital elevation model completed in 2009, and provided by Magma Metals.

The  original  drill  core  samples  were  composited  to  1 m  standard  length  for  outlier analysis and  grade  capping  studies.    The  1 m  composites  were  subsequently composited to 2 m for exploratory data analysis, continuity analysis (variography) and interpolation.

AMEC  conducted  outlier  studies  on  the  composited  grade  data  for  nine  grade elements: Ag, Au, Co, Cu, MgO, Ni, Pd, Pt, and S.  High-grade outliers in the lowgrade shell were capped; no additional special treatment or restrictions were accorded to the capped 2 m composites during interpolation in the low-grade shells.  The highgrade outliers in the high-grade shell were  not capped; instead, a restricted interpolation search strategy was used to reduce the predicted metal indicated by the capping study targets.  Outlier restriction  for  2 m  composites  in  the  high-grade  shell plus near-massive to massive sulphides was implemented during grade interpolation by  limiting  the  search  distance  to  a  specified  maximum  for  composites  with  grades above a selected threshold.  Beyond the maximum distance, the composites above the threshold are not used for grade interpolation.

Variography  was  performed  to  establish  continuity  ranges.    Unit  sill  variograms (correlograms) were calculated and modelled for Pt, Pd, Cu, Ni, and MgO.

To account for a portion of the Ni and Co occurring as silicate minerals, Ni and Co in sulphide  were  estimated  by  linear  regression  of  MgO  to  total  Ni  and  total  Co respectively.  The portion of metal occurring in silicates is unrecoverable and therefore, must be accounted for.  In ultramafic rocks where the dominant silicate minerals are olivine and orthopyroxene, the amount of MgO provides an indication of the amount of unrecoverable Ni and Co.

AMEC  also  reviewed  the  potential  for  deriving  a  regression  equation  to  estimate rhodium content.  AMEC cautions that the Rh regression should only be considered to be  appropriate  to  provide  order-of-magnitude  results  that  cannot  be  relied  upon  for mine planning or detailed revenue estimates.

Magma Metals Limited Thunder Bay North Polymetallic Project Ontario, Canada NI 43-101 Technical Report

Specific gravity (density) was estimated by linear regression of the estimated gram per tonne Pt + Pd grades in the open pit and underground block models.

Ordinary  kriging  (OK)  and  inverse  distance  weighting  to  the  first  power  (IDW)  were used for grade interpolation for the mineral resource estimate.  Ordinary kriging was used as the estimator for Cu, MgO, Ni, Pd, and Pt.  Inverse distance weighting to the first  power was used for Ag, Au, Co, and S.  A nearest-neighbour (NN) interpolated block model was used as a means of creating declustered statistics for block model estimation validation.

Estimates  were  verified  by  a  combination  of  model  volume  checks,  verification  of global statistics, Herco and swath plots.  No errors were noted with the estimations.

Classification  of  mineral  resources  was  based  on  a  combination  of  grade  and geological continuity, and distances to the nearest drill hole.

## 1.13.2 Cut-off Grades

Mineralization within an open pit shell or conceptual underground mining shapes was constrained  using  appropriate  marginal  (break-even)  cut-off  grades.    Cut-off  grades were  determined  after  consideration  of  appropriate  economic,  technical,  and  cost assumptions,  for  the  cases  of  platinum  revenue  only,  to  be  applied  to  a  platinum grade-equivalent (PtEq).  The calculation for the marginal cut-off, to define a breakeven value between revenue and cost, was based on the equation:

Marginal cut-off grade = [Sum of Ore Based Costs ($/t milled)] / [Net Revenue ($/g sold)]

As platinum is the highest value metal analyzed, a PtEq formula was used to derive the value from the secondary metals, as follows:

PtEq g/t = Pt g/t + Pd g/t x 0.2721 + Au g/t x 0.3968 + Ag g/t x 0.0084 + Cu g/t x 0.000118 + Sulphide Ni g/t x 0.000433 + Sulphide Co g/t x 0.000428 + Rh g/t x 2.7211

## 1.13.3 Assessment of Reasonable Prospects for Economic Extraction

Two mining methods were considered appropriate, conventional open pit mining, and selective underground mining.  The underground mining may consist of either a cutand-fill or drift-and-fill method, with voids backfilled.

The open pit mineralization and waste mining cost was assumed to be CAD$1.80/t. For the underground mining, the direct mining costs were assumed to be CAD$23.00/t

Project No.:  164115 October 2010

<!-- image -->

Magma Metals Limited Thunder Bay North Polymetallic Project Ontario, Canada NI 43-101 Technical Report and  the  indirect  costs  are  assumed  to  be  CAD$22.00/t,  giving  a  combined  total assumed underground mining cost of CAD$45.00/t.  A general and administrative cost of CAD$4.00/t was assumed.

The assumed throughput of the process plant for the purposes of the mineral resource estimate was 3,000 t/d.  Process plant recoveries were assumed to average 50% for Au and Ag, 75% for Pt, Pd, and Rh, and 90% for Ni in sulphide, Co in sulphide, and copper. Recoveries for the resource model  were determined on preliminary metallurgical results available in January 2010; testwork to July 2010 indicates that the assumptions are acceptable, but that actual recoveries may differ as additional data are made available.  Metallurgical testwork is ongoing.

The mineral processing cost assumption was $CAD10.00/t milled.  The concentrate transport  cost  was  $CAD2.30/t  milled  ($CAD90.00  per  dry  tonne  of  concentrate). Smelter  treatment  charges  were  $CAD3.75/t  milled  ($CAD150.00  per  tonne  of  dry concentrate).    Smelter  recoveries  were  based  on  smelter  responses  received  by Magma  Metals  in  December  2009  and  January  2010,  and  are  based  on  the information that Magma Metals had available at that time in terms of bulk concentrate metallurgical  data.    Smelter  recoveries  are  the  percentage  of  the  analyzed  metal content of the concentrate which will be paid for by the smelter.

Metal price assumptions were based on first quarter 2010 figures supplied by Magma Metals  that  were  sourced  from  CIBC  Bank.    The  exchange  rate  assumption  was $CAD1 = $US0.90.

Mineral Resources considered amenable to open pit mining methods were constrained within Lerchs-Grossmann (L-G) pit shells and a PtEq marginal grade of 0.61 g/t PtEq. Internal  dilution, comprising  low-grade  material  within  the  high-grade  shell,  was incorporated in the open pit resource model through the grade shell contours.  External or contact dilution was not accounted for in the resource model; such dilution would be addressed  in  any  future  mine  planning  process.    Mineralization  that  displayed geological  and  grade  continuity,  and  was  contained  within  the  L-G  shell,  was considered to have reasonable prospects of economic extraction.

Mineral  resources  that  were  considered  amenable  to  underground  mining  methods were constrained within a preliminary underground mining shape based on a mining economic cut-off grade of 1.94 g/t PtEq.  A 1.94 g/t PtEq grade isoshell was created in Gemcom  and  was  scrutinized  for  individual  or  isolated  blocks  which,  in  AMEC's opinion, were  not  likely to have  reasonable  prospects  of  economic  extraction. However,  individual  blocks  immediately  below  the  open  pit  resource  shell  were included in the resource as they are likely to be mined even from the open pit.  The blocks not meeting the criterion were not reported in the mineral resource.

Magma Metals Limited Thunder Bay North Polymetallic Project Ontario, Canada NI 43-101 Technical Report

Mineralization that displayed geological and grade continuity, and was contained within the  1.94  g/t  PtEq  grade  iso-shell,  was  considered  to  have  reasonable  prospects  of economic extraction.

## 1.14 Mineral Resource Statement

Mineralization within the Thunder Bay North Project at the Current Lake, Bridge and Beaver Lake Zones that demonstrates grade and geological continuity, and is either constrained by an L-G pit shell that was based on reasonable extraction assumptions, or constrained within underground mineable shapes, is considered to be classified in accordance with the 2005 CIM Definition Standards for Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves.    Mineral  Resources  are  also  compliant  with  the  Australasian  Joint  Ore Reserves  Committee  (JORC)  2004  Code,  but  have  been  reported  using  the  CIM terminology.

Mineral Resources have an effective date of 31 May 2010.  David Thomas, P.Geo., an AMEC employee, is the Qualified Person for the estimate.

Table 1-2 presents the Mineral Resources at a range of cut-off grades, with the basecase shown as highlighted.

## 1.15 Markets

Magma  Metals  initiated  a  preliminary  assessment  of  the  likely  market  for  PGE contained in copper and nickel concentrates from the Project.  A report was prepared by Caliper Metals Corp. in association with Neil S Seldon and Associates Ltd, and was based on the metallurgical results available in September 2010.  The report indicated that  the  likely  bulk  concentrate  containing  PGEs,  nickel,  and  copper  should  be marketed  to  both  nickel and  copper  smelters,  due  to  the  nature  of the bulk concentrate.

Indicative responses from selected smelters indicated that there is a potential market for bulk concentrate produced from the Thunder Bay Project and that the likely payable metals would be Pt, Pd, Rh, Au, Ag, Cu, Co, and Ni.

## 1.16 Conclusions

The Mineral Resource estimate is sufficiently robust, in AMEC's opinion, for Magma Metals to complete a preliminary assessment (PA) on the Project.  The PA is currently underway.

Magma Metals Limited Thunder Bay North Polymetallic Project Ontario, Canada NI 43-101 Technical Report

## 4.0 PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION

## 4.1 Location

The  Thunder  Bay  Project  is  situated  approximately  50  km  northeast  of  the  city  of Thunder  Bay,  within  the  Thunder  Bay  Mining  Division,  Ontario,  Canada.    Project centroids are approximately latitude 45º46' N, and longitude 88º55'W.

The  Project  contains  the  Current  Lake,  Bridge,  and  Beaver  Lake  Zones  that  occur within the Current Lake Igneous Complex.

## 4.2 Mineral Property and Title in Ontario

## 4.2.1 Mineral Title

The  Mining  Lands  Section  administers  patented,  leased  and  licensed  mining  lands across the province:

- · Unpatented mining claims are parcels of Crown land staked in accordance with the Mining  Act.    Claim  holders  have  the  exclusive  right  to  explore  for  minerals  and have a right to acquire a mining lease for the purpose of mining.  The claim holder has a right to transfer or sell an interest in the mining claim
- · A  mining  rights  patent  may  include  the  surface  rights  or  both  the  surface  and mining  rights  and  may  be  held  by  one  or  more  individuals  or  corporations.    A patent (or lease) is required in order to produce a mineral product for sale.  Mining patents were issued under the Mining Act in the past and are no longer a common method of acquiring mineral tenure
- · Other Crown patents may include mining rights.  Typically, any land granted before 1913 conveys mineral rights ownership
- · Freehold patented mining lands are lands originally granted for mining purposes, or mining rights that were severed from the surface rights after their original grant. Patented mining lands are liable to mining land tax.  Lands are taxable, if they are being  used  for  mining  purposes,  no  matter  what  legislation  they  were  granted under
- · Under the Mining Act, a lease (or patent) is required in order to produce a mineral product for sale.  Leases are now issued for 21-year terms, but leases for 10-year terms still exist.  Leases have associated work commitments and fees.  Ten-year leases are renewable in perpetuity for periods of ten years, providing the renewal application is lodged 90 days before expiry of the lease.  A 21-year lease may be renewed provided that the lessee can prove that the mining lease(s) is being used

Magma Metals Limited Thunder Bay North Polymetallic Project Ontario, Canada NI 43-101 Technical Report for mining purposes and meets(s) one of the following criteria, and application for renewal is made prior to the expiry date of the lease:

- -exploration and/or development work has been or is currently being performed on the lease, during the term of the lease; or
- -the lease is part of a larger contiguous mining land holding which, during the term of the lease, has been or is currently being explored and/or developed; or
- -the lessee will demonstrate a commitment to perform future exploration and development work (e.g. work contracts, option agreements, etc.) and will provide a certified statement(s) of expenditure after three years; or
- -a mineral deposit has been located which has the potential of being worked under favourable economic conditions; or
- -actual production (mining) and/or ongoing development work is being carried out with the intention of leading to production.
- · Rent is applied to all mining leases
- · Mining  Licenses  of  Occupation  were  historically  issued  for  lands  primarily  under water.    Licenses  do  not  expire.    Rent  also  applies  to  Mining  Licenses  of Occupation.

## 4.2.2 Surface Rights

A holder of a mining lease may be allowed to lease available surface rights within or outside  of  the  mining  lease  for  the  purpose  of  mining  or  exploration  of  the  mining rights.    Some  mining  projects  may  require  the  acquisition  of  Crown  lands  under  the Public Lands  Act  administered  by  the  Ministry of Natural Resources.    These circumstances  are  usually  related  to  the  acquisition  or  some  form  of  land  tenure  to accommodate access or infrastructure such as roads, power lines, pipelines and other facilities.  Where surface rights are held by parties other than the mining company, a legal agreement with the owners must be concluded.

## 4.2.3 Environmental

Development of a mineral project can require a variety of environmental permits and approvals  depending  on  the  size  and  type  of  project,  facilities  being  constructed, location and other factors.  Small exploration projects will trigger few actual approvals; however, many environmental regulations and standards will apply whether there is a specific  approval  to  be  issued  or  not.    Larger-scale  projects  and  mine  construction projects will require approval prior to being able to commence a particular activity.  Key areas that need to be considered are:

Project No.:  164115 October 2010

Magma Metals Limited Thunder Bay North Polymetallic Project Ontario, Canada NI 43-101 Technical Report

- · Water
- · Discharging industrial wastewater (industrial sewage works)
- · Septic systems (domestic sewage)
- · Operation of a treatment plant for human/domestic sewage
- · Drinking water (potable water)
- · Well drilling and abandonment
- · Air emissions.

## 4.2.4 Closure Plans

For all new advanced exploration or mining projects a certified Closure Plan is required prior to development.  Once filed an operator is legally required to operate according to the Closure Plan.

An operator must take all reasonable steps to progressively rehabilitate a site whether closure has commenced or a Closure Plan has been filed.  A report must be filed to the Director of Mine Rehabilitation within 60 days of completing the work.

## 4.2.5 Windpower Development on Crown Land

Procedural directions relating to development  to implement  Policy PL  4.10.04 'Onshore Windpower Development on Crown Land' (Ministry of Natural Resources, Ontario, 2010), state, in summary, that:

- · Where a mining claim was staked prior to the windpower application:
- -The mining claim holder has a first right of refusal to the surface rights, and the windpower applicant must obtain the written consent of the claim holder to release the surface rights
- -If the mining claim holder will not release the surface right, the matter may be referred to the Mining and Lands Commissioner for a determination of the surface rights
- -If a mining claim holder releases the rights to the surface, they retain the right to proceed with mineral exploration work.
- · Where a mining claim was staked after the windpower application:
- -The mining claim holder is subject to the prior application and the windpower application may proceed
- -The mining claim holder will be included as a stakeholder in the stakeholder consultation;

Project No.:  164115 October 2010

<!-- image -->

Magma Metals Limited Thunder Bay North Polymetallic Project Ontario, Canada NI 43-101 Technical Report

- -The mining claim holder has the right to proceed with mineral exploration work.

In  either  event,  both  the  windpower  applicant  and  the  mining  claim  holder  have  the right  to  pursue  their  respective  interests,  subject  to  any  other  decision  that  may  be made by the Mining and Lands Commissioner.

However, the windpower applicant must ensure that it does not cause any damage to any exploration workings or claim posts installed by the claim holder, and the mining claim holder must ensure that it does not cause any damage to any installations made by the windpower applicant.  Any such damages are subject to compensation pursuant to Sections 79(2) and (3) of the Mining Act.

## 4.3 Mineral Tenure

The  Project  consists  of  219  original,  unpatented,  mining  claims  (2,551  16  ha  claim units)  covering  an  aggregate  area  of  40,816  ha  (Figure  4-1).    Claim  details  are summarized in Appendix A.  The mineral resources estimated for the Beaver Lake, Bridge,  and  Current  Lake  Zones  are  situated  within  claims  842189,  842186,  and 4210157.

Magma Metals owns 100% of all claims within the Project, except four claims, totalling 30 units  (480  hectares),  covered  by  two  underlying  option  agreements.    These  are discussed in Section 4.6.

The Project  contains  no  patented  or  leased  claims.    None  of  the  claims  have  been legally surveyed; this is not a requirement under Ontario legislation.

AMEC was supplied  with  documentation  that  showed  that  required  fees  and  duties have been paid to the appropriate regulatory authorities, and the claims are in good standing.    Magma  Metals  advised  AMEC  that  all  work  program  reports  have  been completed as and when due.

Magma Metals is active in the greater Thunder Bay North area, and in addition to the Project, has a number of ground holdings that are at the exploration stage.

## 4.3.1 Wind Power

Magma Metals has advised that some of the claims in the Thunder Bay North area are subject to wind-power claims, as indicated in Appendix A.  These claims are located about 8-9 km from the Current Lake and Beaver Lake areas, in rugged terrain.  It is not expected that any accesses, infrastructure, or potential mining operations for the Thunder  Bay  North  Project  would  be  affected  by  construction  of  wind  turbines  or supporting facilities for power generation on these claims.

## 4.4 Surface Rights

Mineral claims are located on Crown lands, and therefore surface rights are acquired as part of the claim process.

## 4.5 Royalties

A  group  of  32  claims,  which  formed  the  initial  project  area  (refer  to  Section  4.6)  is subject  to  a  3%  net  smelter  royalty  (NSR),  one-third  of  which  can  be  purchased  by Magma  Metals  at  any  time  for  C$1  million.    Claims  subject  to  the  royalty  are summarized in Table 4-1, and are included in Figure 4-1.  These claims include claims 842189 and 842186 that host part of the mineral resource estimate.

Advanced NSR payments of C$50,000 per annum is payable from the fifth anniversary of  Magma  Metal's  original  listing  on  the  Australian  Stock  Exchange  (ASX).    This anniversary occurs in 2011.

Magma Metals Limited Thunder Bay North Polymetallic Project Ontario, Canada NI 43-101 Technical Report

## 4.7.2 Project Development

Additional permits would be required to support any Project development.  Key permits would  cover  operational  aspects,  waters,  discharges,  transport  and  access,  power, and the environment.

Preliminary discussions have been held with Provincial and Federal agencies likely to be involved in any permitting process for Project development, and have covered likely permitting frameworks and timelines.

## 4.8 Environmental

## 4.8.1 Existing Liabilities

Magma Metals has informed AMEC that current  project  environmental  liabilities  are restricted to exploration  site  activities and  access  roads  constructed  to  service exploration programs.

## 4.8.2 Baseline Studies

Magma  Metals  contracted  DST  Consulting  Engineers  (DST)  in  November  2007  to commence  environmental  baseline  studies  of  the  in  the  vicinity  of  the  Current  and Escape Lake drainage areas.  The study was designed to acquire sufficient baseline environmental  information  to  support  the  Environmental  Assessment  Process  and subsequent  project  permitting.    To  date,  the  study  has  included  evaluation  of  the following:

- · Surface water and sediment quality
- · Lake and stream sediment taxonomic diversity of benthic invertebrates
- · Fisheries resources (fish and fish habitat)
- · Hydrology (stream and river discharge).

In 2009 monitoring was extended to include Steepledge Lake, Ray Lake, Lone Island Lake and Fitzpatrick Lake.

In mid-2010, acid rock drainage (ARD) potential in association with rock geochemistry assessments, meteorological, noise, socio-economic and archaeological studies were initiated. In September  2010,  the  archaeological survey, completed  by  Ross Archaeological Research Associates on behalf of DST Consulting over likely Project footprint and  infrastructure  corridors  indicated  that  the  areas  reviewed  had  low

Project No.:  164115 October 2010

Magma Metals Limited Thunder Bay North Polymetallic Project Ontario, Canada NI 43-101 Technical Report potential for archaeological resources.  The other surveys from the above bulleted list are ongoing.

Hydrogeological assessments are planned to commence prior to the end of 2010.

As the Project advances, additional work related to the environmental assessment and permitting of a mining operation in Ontario, Canada will be conducted.

## 4.9 Socio-Economics

Magma Metals has held preliminary discussions with First Nation groups in the region to  discuss  Project  development.    These  have  been  positive  and  Magma  Metals  is working towards the growth of relationships with these groups.

A  socio-economic  study  was  initiated  by  Magma  Metals  in  September  2010,  and  is ongoing.  Traditional knowledge and traditional land use studies are planned.

## 4.10 Comment on Section 4

In the opinion of the AMEC QPs, the following conclusions are appropriate:

- · Information from legal experts support that the mining tenure held is valid and is sufficient to support declaration of Mineral Resources
- · The mineral  concessions  have  not  been  surveyed;  survey  is  not  required  under Ontario regulations
- · AMEC  was  provided  with  breakdowns  of  work  expenditures  for  the  mineral concessions.    These  indicate  the  mineral  concessions  on  which  the  Mineral Resources  have  been  estimated  are  in  compliance  with  Ontario  regulations  in relation to work expenditure requirements.
- · Mineral  claims  are  located  on  Crown  lands,  and  therefore  surface  rights  are acquired as part of the claim process.
- · Permits obtained by the company to undertake exploration are sufficient to ensure that  activities  are  conducted  within  the  regulatory  framework  required  by  the Ontario Government
- · Additional permits will be required for Project development; preliminary discussions have been held with the relevant Federal and Provincial authorities
- · At  the  effective  date  of  this  report,  environmental  liabilities  are  restricted  to exploration sites and access roads constructed to service exploration programs

Magma Metals Limited Thunder Bay North Polymetallic Project Ontario, Canada NI 43-101 Technical Report

## 5.0 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE AND PHYSIOGRAPHY

## 5.1 Accessibility

The  property  is  accessible  using  a  series  of  intermittently-maintained  logging  roads branching  from  Armstrong  Highway  527,  which  in  turn  branches  from  the  TransCanada Highway 11-17 a short distance east of the city of Thunder Bay.  Access to the Project from Thunder Bay is as follows:

- · 10 km east along Highway 11/17 to Highway 527;
- · 22.7 km north on Highway 527 to the Escape Lake logging road;
- · 17 km east on the Escape Lake road to the Shallownest East logging road;
- · 5.3 km north on the Shallownest East road to an unnamed logging road that branches to the west
- · 3 km along this road to the immediate vicinity of the Project.

The Escape Lake and Shallownest East logging roads are intermittently maintained by local  logging  contractors;  however,  the  remaining  access  roads,  to  and  within,  the Project are regularly maintained, winter and summer, by Magma Metals.

The closest commercial airport is at Thunder Bay.

## 5.2 Climate

The climate is continental with a temperate marine influence from the close proximity of Lake Superior.  Temperatures generally range from winter lows of about -35°C to summer highs of about 35°C.  Average winter temperatures are in the range of -15°C to -20°C, and average summer temperatures are in the range of 20°C to 25°C.

Annual rainfall is approximately 70 cm with 55-60 cm of rain and 200-300 cm of snow annually.  Average winter snow depths in the region are about 100-150 cm.

Exploration activities can be curtailed by snowmelt conditions.  It is expected that any future mining operations will be able to be conducted year-round.

Project No.:  164115 October 2010

Magma Metals Limited Thunder Bay North Polymetallic Project Ontario, Canada NI 43-101 Technical Report

## 5.3 Local Resources and Infrastructure

The closest community to the Project is the village of Dorion, about 35 km east of the Project  site.    The  largest  community  in  Project  proximity  is  the  city  of  Thunder  Bay (45 km).

There is no existing Project infrastructure.  Exploration activities are currently supplied out of Thunder Bay.

Power is available at Thunder Bay, where a medium-size coal-fired generating plant is located.  A wind-farm, the Greenwich Wind Farm is in initial construction stages, and is has a proposed capacity of 100 MW.  The farm location is about 9 km east-northeast of the Project area.

Two major power lines, a gas pipeline, and the Canadian Pacific Railway are located between 17.5 km and 19.5 km southeast of the centre of the Project.  A second gas pipeline  is  located  approximately  32  km  to  the  north.    Highway  527  is  located approximately 12 km west of the Project.

Communications for exploration-level activities have primarily been by email, as cellphone  service  can  be  unreliable.    A  cell  phone  booster  was  installed  in  the  main logging facility, and this provides reliable cell coverage.  Backup communications are undertaken using satellite phones.

There  are  numerous  freshwater  lakes,  streams,  and  rivers  in  the  Project  area. Groundwater is also in plentiful supply and is located close to surface in most areas. These sources could provide the required potable and process water for any mining operation.

Canada  has  sufficient  experienced  and  skilled  professionals  to  run  any  mining operation that could be constructed in the Project area.

Magma Metals holds over 40,000 ha of mineral tenure.  In the immediate vicinity of the known  Project  deposits,  and  within  the  Magma  Metals  ground  holdings,  there  is sufficient area to support construction of a mining operation, including sufficient space for an open pit and underground mine, process facilities, mining-related facilities such as workshops, offices and roads, and tailings and waste facilities.

## 5.4 Physiography

Project elevations vary by about 40 m, from 470 masl to about 510 masl, averaging approximately 485 masl.

Project No.:  164115 October 2010

Magma Metals Limited Thunder Bay North Polymetallic Project Ontario, Canada NI 43-101 Technical Report

Outcrop is locally rare.  Glacial overburden depth is generally shallow, rarely exceeds 20 m, and primarily consists of ablation till, minor basal till, and moderate expanses of outwash sand and gravel.

Swamps,  marshes,  small  streams,  and  small  to  moderate-size  lakes  are  common. Drainage  is  provided  by  the  numerous,  usually  unnamed  streams  that  lead  to  the Current and MacKenzie rivers, located to the northwest and the southeast, respectively.    Both  rivers  drain  directly  into  Lake  Superior,  which  is  situated  about 25 km to the south of the centre of the Project area.

Primary  vegetation  comprises  boreal  forest  of  black  spruce,  jack  pine,  trembling aspen, and white birch.  Large swathes of the Project area have been clear-cut logged, and  are  re-generating  after  tree  re-planting  programs  performed  by  the  logging companies.

The forest around the Project area currently provides habitat for wildlife species that are common to mixed boreal forests in Ontario.

No significant fisheries values have been identified to date within the Project area and no aquatic species at risk or endangered species have been encountered in surveys completed to date (DST Consulting, 2007).

## 5.5 Comment on Section 5

In the opinion of the QPs, the existing and planned infrastructure, availability of staff, the existing power, water, and communications facilities, the methods whereby goods are transported to the mine, and any planned modifications or supporting studies are well-established, or the requirements to establish such, are well understood by Magma Metals, and can support the declaration of Mineral Resources.

## 6.0 HISTORY

Initial exploration in the general region was for uranium, and was concentrated in the area of the Christianson uranium showing, discovered in 1949, and located about 5 km east  of  Current  Lake,  near  the  western  shoreline  of  Greenwich  Lake.    Rio  Tinto Exploration Ltd. acquired the area that contained the Christianson uranium showing in 1976 and additional ground was subsequently acquired.  Work completed consisted of field mapping and core drilling.  A portion of the mapping extended onto what is now the southern portion of the Project area, but no radioactive minerals were located.

In 1991, the Ontario Geological Survey completed airborne magnetic and electromagnetic geophysical surveys in the area; these covered approximately 20% of the southern Project area.  Magnetic anomalies were identified in the surveys.

During the period 1993 to 2000, prospectors Dr. Graham Harper, Dr. Gerald Wilson, and  F.  Manns  undertook  rock  chip  sampling,  prospecting,  and  petrographic  and geochemical research within the Onion Lake, Tartan Lake and Greenwich Lake areas. In  1999-2000,  prospecting,  lithogeochemistry,  soil  sampling,  and  ground  magnetic surveys were conducted by the same team in the vicinity of Current Lake.  This work led, in 2001, to the discovery by the prospectors, of mineralized ultramafic (peridotite) boulders along the western shoreline of Current Lake that contained elevated Pt-PdCu-Ni grades.

Pacific  North  West  Capital  Corporation  (Pacific  North  West  Capital)  optioned  the property  in  2001  and  completed  ground-magnetic  and  electromagnetic  surveys  that same year.  A six hole core drill program, totalling 813.5 m, was completed in 2002, but no mineralized ultramafic rocks were encountered.  Pacific North West Capital did not proceed with the option.

Magma Metals optioned the Current Lake area from Dr Wilson and Dr Harper in 2005. At  that  stage,  the  Thunder  Bay  North  project,  as  it  was  termed,  comprised  26 contiguous mining claims.  In 2006, the three Beaver Lake claims were optioned, and in 2007, an additional option on the CasRon property was taken up.

Magma Metals Limited Thunder Bay North Polymetallic Project Ontario, Canada NI 43-101 Technical Report

Work completed by Magma Metals to 2010 has included a number of airborne and ground  geophysical  surveys,  including  helicopter-borne  magnetic  and  gamma-ray spectrometer  surveys,  helicopter-borne  VTEM   surveys,  conventional  airborne  and 1 boat-borne magnetic surveys, ground-based induced polarization (IP)/resistivity surveys,  ground  large  loop  electromagnetic  (EM)  surveys,  and  a  HT-SQUID  TEM 2 survey.  Additional work has comprised geological and structural mapping, petrological and mineralogical studies, and commencement of baseline environmental studies.

Between December 2006 and June 2009 Magma Metals drilled 338 core drill holes.  A total  of  211  of  these  drill  holes  (18,854 m)  were  drilled  at  Current  Lake  on  sections spaced by 50 metres.    At  Beaver  Lake,  122  core  holes  (31,562  m)  were  drilled  on sections  spaced  at  100 m.    This  work  identified  two  major  areas  of  Cu-Ni-Pt-Pd sulphide  mineralization,  at  Beaver  Lake  and  Current  Lake.    A  first-time  mineral resource estimate was performed in 2009 by SRK Consulting Ltd (SRK) on behalf of Magma Metals; this estimate has been superseded.

Additional  core  drilling  and  geophysical  surveys  have  been  completed  since  June 2009,  post  the  SRK  mineral  resource  estimate,  and  preliminary  engineering  studies have commenced.  The remainder of this Report discusses the results of these drilling and  geophysical  surveys,  presents  an  updated  mineral  resource  estimate  for  the Project and discusses the exploration potential.

## 7.0 GEOLOGICAL SETTING

## 7.1 Regional Geology

The  Project  is  hosted  in  the  Quetico  Subprovince  of  the  Superior  Province  of  the Canadian Precambrian Shield (Figure 7-1).  The Quetico Subprovince is interpreted as a fore-arc accretionary prism deposited during and after peak volcanic activity within the  adjacent  Wawa,  Wabigoon,  and  Abitibi  Subprovinces  between  2,698  and  2,688 million years ago.  The subprovince is about 70 km wide, and forms a linear strip of moderately to strongly metamorphosed and deformed clastic meta-sedimentary rocks and their melt equivalents.

Sedimentary rocks that have been identified include turbiditic wacke and siltstone with rare  iron  formation,  pelite,  and  conglomerate,  which  were  deposited  within  a  large, laterally  extensive,  submarine  basin.    Volcanic  rocks  are  extremely  rare;  however, intrusive rocks are common.  These comprise biotite-hornblende-magnetite granitoid bodies of mixed felsic and mafic composition with volumetrically minor ultramafic units; and one- and two-mica granitoids.  The igneous activity is interpreted to have occurred some 5-20 million years after the accumulation of the sedimentary pile.

Overlying the Quetico Subprovince rocks in the Lake Superior region are sediments of the  1,860 Ma,  Paleoproterozoic  Animikie  Group.    These  rocks,  in  the  Thunder  Bay area, rest unconformably upon Archaean basement and form a homoclinal sedimentary  sequence  consisting  of  Gunflint  Formation  chemical  sediments  and argillites overlain by Rove Formation shales and wackes.

At about 1,590 Ma, the Mesoproterozoic Badwater Intrusion was emplaced, followed, at about 1,537 Ma, by the intrusion of the English Bay igneous complex.

Sediments  of  the  Sibley  Group  unconformably  overlie  the  Animikie  Group  south  of Lake  Nipigon,  and  consist  of  quartz  arenite,  argillaceous  dolomite,  and  mudstones. These have an age date range of 1,670 Ma to 1,450 Ma.

The final Proterozoic event was deposition of the Mesoproterozoic (1,140 to 1,090 Ma) Keweenawan  Supergroup,  comprising  a  thick  edifice  of  subaerial  lava  flows,  local concentrations of  intrusive  rocks,  and  an  upper  sequence  of  sedimentary  rocks  that were  deposited  within  normal,  fault-bounded  and  asymmetric  grabens,  developed within and marginal to the Mid-continent (Keweenawan) Rift (Figure 7-2).

Magma Metals Limited Thunder Bay North Polymetallic Project Ontario, Canada NI 43-101 Technical Report

The rift,  now largely beneath Lake Superior, contains as much as 30 km of fill, with volcanic rocks comprising about two-thirds of the total (Miller, 2007).  Geophysical data also  suggest  that  a  volume  of  magma  nearly  equivalent  to  that  filling  the  rift underplated the crust (Miller, 2007).  Considering the rift fill, the volume of underplated material, and the unknown amount of eroded material, the Mid-continent Rift is one of the  world's  largest  Large  Igneous  Provinces,  and  is  an  important  emerging  Ni-CuPGE province.

Mafic to ultramafic intrusive rocks in Ontario, related to the formation of the Keweenawan Supergroup, include:

- · Voluminous, laterally extensive diabase sills and associated dykes (Nipigon, Logan, and Pigeon River Sills)
- · Moderate to very large-size composite and layered mafic intrusions (Duluth Complex, Crystal Lake Gabbro)
- · Layered and differentiated ultramafic intrusions (Seagull, Hele, Kitto, and Disraeli Intrusions),
- · Volumetrically  minor  ultramafic  conduit-like  intrusive  complexes  (Current  Lake Intrusive Complex)

The layered and differentiated Seagull, Hele, Kitto, and Disraeli ultramafic intrusions that  are  hosted  within  and  adjacent  to  the  Nipigon  Basin  (one  arm  of  the  failed Mid-continent  Rift  valley  extended  north  to  Lake  Nipigon  in  Ontario,  forming  the Nipigon Embayment or Basin) are recognized as hosting nickel, copper and platinum group element (PGE) sulphide mineralization.  The intrusions appear to be primarily sill-like with the exception of the Seagull Intrusion, which has a distinct lopolithic form. Intrusion emplacement appears to have been fault controlled, but no distinct magma feeder zones to the intrusions have been identified.

The Duluth Complex and Crystal Lake gabbro also host low-grade Ni-Cu mineralization.    The  Duluth  Complex  consists  of  a  large  composite  intrusion  of troctolite and gabbro derived from periodic tapping of an evolving magma source.  The complex formed from up to  40  separate  sheet-like  and  cone-shaped  sub-intrusions. Low-medium-grade copper-nickel sulphide mineralization that locally contains anomalous  PGE  concentrations  were  identified  in  the  basal  zones  of  the  Partridge River and South Kawishiwi intrusions.  At least nine deposits have been delineated in the  basal  100  m  to  300  m  of  both  intrusions.    At  Crystal  Lake,  sulphide  nickel mineralization  is  associated  with  taxitic  textures  in  a  medium-  to  coarse-grained gabbro.

Project No.:  164115 October 2010

Magma Metals Limited Thunder Bay North Polymetallic Project Ontario, Canada NI 43-101 Technical Report

The conduit-like intrusions hosting at nickel, copper and platinum group element (PGE) sulphide  mineralization  at  Current  Lake  and  Beaver  Lake  are  the  first  of  that  type recognized in the province.  The complex has been termed the Current Lake Intrusive Complex,  and  is  part  of  a  network  of  magma  conduits  or  chonoliths  formed  in association with the Mid-continent Rift.

## 7.2 Project Geology

Within  the  Project  area,  the  main  rock  types  are  Archean  granites  and  metasediments,  of  the  Quetico  Subprovince,  and  Keweenawan  Supergroup  mafic  to ultramafic intrusive rocks and related intermediate to mafic hybrid intrusive rocks of the Mid-continent Rift.  The relationship of the Project area to the Mid-continent Rift was illustrated in Figure 2-1.

Rock types present within the Project area consist of:

- · A variety of felsic to intermediate granitoid rocks identified as granodiorite, tonalite, and pegmatitic leucogranite
- · Strongly deformed and metamorphosed clastic meta-sedimentary rocks identified as wacke, siltstone, and rarely pelite
- · Relatively undeformed, practically unmetamorphosed mafic to ultramafic intrusive rocks  of  the  main  phase  of  the  Current  Lake  Intrusive  Complex  have  been identified as olivine melagabbro, feldspathic peridotite, and lherzolite.  These rocks are closely associated with a variety of related intermediate to mafic intrusive rocks that  comprise  the  initial  intrusive  phase  of  the  Current  Lake  Intrusive  Complex. These early phase rocks are locally fragment/inclusion-rich, strongly contaminated, hybridized, and hematized.

## 7.2.1 Archean Lithologies

## Granitoids

The primary granitoid rocks are granodiorite and tonalite with minor amounts of granite and pegmatitic leucogranite.  Units are typically medium grained with localized, narrow intervals of pegmatitic and aplitic material.  Shearing can be intense on a local scale, forming narrow, discrete fault zones; however, the rocks are more typically massive or only weakly foliated.

A hematitic alteration zone, 2-5 m in thickness, can develop where the granitoid is in contact  with  olivine  melagabbro.    A  molten  appearance  can  develop  immediately

Project No.:  164115 October 2010

<!-- image -->

Magma Metals Limited Thunder Bay North Polymetallic Project Ontario, Canada NI 43-101 Technical Report adjacent the olivine melagabbro contact and small granite fragments may occur within the olivine melagabbro.

## Meta-sediments

Meta-sedimentary  rocks  are  typically  derived  from  a  muddy,  silty  or  fine  sandy precursor  sediment,  and  range  from  massive  to  moderately  foliated.    Foliation orientations are typically vertical to sub-vertical relative to the surface.  Rocks can be mica-rich,  display  quartz  ±  carbonate  veinlets,  and  can  be  variably  sheared  and altered.  Shearing and faulting occurs on a local scale, and can be intense.  Alteration consists of chlorite, sericite, and epidote, and is primarily associated with fractures.

Dykes  of  granitoid  composition  cut  the  meta-sediments.    Where  in  contact  with  the olivine melagabbro, the meta-sediments have been hornfelsed, and hematitic alteration may develop.

## 7.2.2 Mesoproterozoic Intrusions

## Hybrid

The  initial  phase  of  the  Current  Lake  Intrusive  Complex  is  a  hybrid  intrusion  (the Hybrid)  that  contains  large  quantities  of  incorporated  country  rock.    The  intrusion  is termed 'Hybrid' by Magma Metals geologists since it has incorporated so much of the surrounding country rock and commonly contains rock fragments and quartz inclusions as xenoliths.  The Hybrid was intruded rather forcefully along flat-lying structures and up-dip along the east-trending granite-meta-sediment contact.

Initially  a  leucogabbro-diorite,  the  quantities  of  country  rock  and  quartz  that  can  be incorporated into the Hybrid can change the composition to a rock type, that, based on mineralogy, would be classified as dioritic-primarily composed of quartz, plagioclase, and  amphibole.    The  Hybrid  locally  contains  black  pyroxene  and  serpentine  or iddingsite after olivine as well as significant quantities of ilmenite and magnetite.

The  contact  between  Hybrid  and  olivine  melagabbro,  the  second  intrusive  event,  is typically  gradational  over  one  to  two  metres.    The  contact  can;  however,  be  fairly sharp, presumably where the olivine melagabbro has thermally eroded into the Hybrid. Near the contact, Hybrid contains 0.5 cm to 2 cm patches of olivine melagabbro as xenoliths  that  gradually  diminish  as  the  olivine  melagabbro  is  approached.    Hybrid rarely contains rock fragments (xenoliths) where it is in contact with olivine melagabbro.  Hybrid appears to have been quite hot when the olivine melagabbro was intruded because the interface between the two appears, locally, to have been plastic in nature.

Contacts  with  the  surrounding  meta-sediments  of  the  country  rock  indicate  chilled margins, with fine-grained and glassy textures.  The chill zone occurs where the Hybrid is present on the lower contact of the main body on the northern margin of the Beaver Lake intrusion, throughout the Current Lake intrusion and where the Hybrid extends as 'wings' away from the main intrusive bodies, in zones where the Hybrid has intruded along the flat structures. Chilled margins are rare above the main olivine melagabbro/lherzolite  body  at  Beaver  Lake  due  to  the  large  amount  of  alteration  in these rocks.

Alteration is primarily related to fluid exsolution, with significant iron oxide staining of the Hybrid and the surrounding meta-sediments.  In general the fluids driven off by the intrusion appear to have mostly migrated upwards with significant hematite and pyrite alteration occurring above the body for metres to tens of metres, whereas the footwall contact has hematite alteration generally confined to only a few metres at most.

## Olivine Melagabbro/Lherzolite

The host rock for mineralization is an olivine melagabbro-lherzolite, which forms the conduits at both the Beaver Lake and Current Lake deposits. Analysis of petrochemical  data  indicates  formation  of  the  olivine  melagabbro-lherzolite  from  a basaltic parent magma with about 6% MgO.

There are narrow zones (10 cm to several metres) of variably-textured taxitic material within the olivine melagabbro near the contact with the Hybrid.  These zones contain large, altered, 1-2 cm plagioclases and very large, 1-10 cm pyroxenes, also altered, in an olivine-melagabbro matrix.  Alteration is fine-grained to microscopic, and although not  formally  identified,  is  likely  to  include  saussuritization  of  the  plagioclase,  and uralitization of the pyroxenes.  Taxitic zones may also contain apparent fragments, as xenoliths, of mafic intrusive material.  In the opinion of Magma Metals geologists, such taxitic rocks appear very similar to those mapped at the Noril'sk deposit in Russia.

## Current Lake

The Current Lake olivine melagabbro intrusion is a rounded conduit up to 50 m wide confined by a flat fracture-joint set as well as northeast-, northwest- and north-striking Keweenawan structures.  At Current Lake, the olivine melagabbro consists of 40-70% olivine and serpentine, 5-25% plagioclase, 4-12% clinopyroxene plus orthopyroxene, and as much as 5% magnetite.  Minor minerals can include biotite, chlorite, amphibole, carbonate, and talc.

Magma Metals Limited Thunder Bay North Polymetallic Project Ontario, Canada NI 43-101 Technical Report

## Beaver Lake

At  Beaver  Lake,  olivine  melagabbro  grades  into  a  feldspathic  lherzolite  then  to lherzolite  symmetrically  from  the  bottom  of  the  intrusion  up  and  from  the  top  down. The  distinction  between  olivine  melagabbro  and  the  lherzolite  occurs  when  the plagioclase content reaches 10%.

The Beaver Lake host rocks contain between 45-70% olivine and serpentine, 1-20% plagioclase, 10-16%  clinopyroxene plus orthopyroxene and as much as 5% magnetite.  Minor amounts of biotite, chlorite, amphibole, carbonate and talc have also been noted.

The grain size of the olivine melagabbro and lherzolite is quite small, with the olivines averaging  1.0-1.5 mm  in  size.    Additional  minerals  include  chlorite,  clinopyroxene, orthopyroxene, plagioclase and oxide phases and occasional clinopyroxene oikocrysts as large as 1 cm near the contacts.  Serpentinization increases towards the contacts, and  serpentine, chlorite, iddingsite, talc and  carbonate  are common  alteration products.

The Beaver Lake intrusion is a flattened, pipe-like (tabular) body with an irregularlyshaped floor.  The intrusion appears to be deepest on the southeast side and remains open in this direction.  The olivine melagabbro is frequently in contact with the footwall sediments  and  is  often  mineralized  on  the  contact.    Olivine  melagabbro  does  not display chill margins along the contact with meta-sedimentary rocks.  This may be due to turbulent flow or that the surrounding rocks became increasingly hot from long-term flow of magma in the conduit.  Locally, sulphide blebs and ocelli of previously molten sediment from 5 mm to 10 mm in size occur in olivine melagabbro near the contact. The olivine melagabbro-meta-sediment contact is locally irregular.

Figure  7-3  shows  the  currently  known  outlines  of  the  conduits  and  intrusion  for  the Beaver Lake and Current Lake areas.

## Serpentine

The  amounts  of  serpentine  present  within  the  Current  Lake  Intrusive  Complex  are highly variable, with the margins more strongly serpentinized (generally moderate with localized intervals of strong near the contacts, particularly the upper contact) than the centre/core  of the intrusion, which  is almost  completely  unserpentinized.    The application  of  an  average  percentage  of  serpentine  for  the  intrusion  would  be misleading in the opinion of Magma Metals staff, because it is not uniformly altered. Serpentinization  is  not  a  lower  temperature,  metamorphic  or  hydrothermal  alteration that occurred after the intrusion had cooled, but is, according to Magma Metals, a high temperature,  late  magmatic  deuteric  feature  that  is  probably  attributable  to  the concentration  and  movement  of  volatile-rich  fluids/melt  within  the  magma  while  the intrusion was still partially molten.

## 7.2.3 Structures

Structurally, the Archaean rocks were deformed by reactivated pre-existing structures and  new  Keweenawan-age structures  that  permeated  the  Archean  rocks  during  the Proterozoic.  Numerous northeast- and northwest-striking structures provided ground preparation for intrusion of the Current Lake Intrusive Complex.

Quetico  subprovince  rocks  record  a  progressive  Archean  orogeny.    Early  isoclinal folding with layer-parallel shearing and regional axial planar fabrics is overprinted by upright, open to tight, shallowly-plunging folding with an associated axial planar fabric. The Orogeny culminated with transpressional faulting, shear zone development, minor folding and localized east-west extension (Williams, 1991; Percival et al., 2006).

The transpressional deformation event includes dextral movement on east- and east northeast- striking faults including the Quetico Fault that cuts through the deposit area. Small-scale but numerous, conjugate northeast-striking sinistral and northwest-striking faults offset at least the Archean units.

Three  prominent  fault  sets  striking  north,  northwest,  and  east  to  northeast  cut  the Proterozoic  Nipigon  Embayment,  in  places  reactivating  Archean  faults  (Hart  and MacDonald, 2007).

In the Project area, the dominant regional foliation in Archean meta-sedimentary and felsic  intrusive  rocks  strikes  approximately  85º  and  dips  vertically  to  85º  south. Asymmetric minor folds associated with the regional foliation are observed in Quetico Subprovince meta-sedimentary rocks, and suggest steeply-dipping, shallowlyplunging,  isoclinal  folds  are  present  through  the  Current  Lake-Beaver  Lake  area. Proto-mylonitic  fabrics  with  weak  dextral  sigma  ( σ )-structure  of  feldspar  phenocrysts

Magma Metals Limited Thunder Bay North Polymetallic Project Ontario, Canada NI 43-101 Technical Report were  observed  in  what  is  interpreted  as  a  splay  of  the  Quetico  Fault  cutting  a peraluminous muscovite granite that bounds the Beaver Lake intrusion to the north.

The Proterozoic  mafic  to  ultramafic  intrusions  hosting  the  Current  Lake  and  Beaver Lake deposits post-date the Archean deformation events, but their geometries mimic the  strike  of  earlier  fault  sets,  including  relatively  flat  faults,  which  the  intrusions  are interpreted to have exploited as they intruded the Archean country rocks.

Post-intrusion deformation of the Proterozoic host rocks is limited.  Extreme fracturing in the immediate hanging wall is accompanied by brittle, fine-grained to coarse-grained fault gouge.  This is irregularly distributed over the intrusion with the thickest section coincident  with  the  intersection  of  an  east-striking  dextral  fault  at  the  north  edge  of Beaver Lake intrusion, a north-northeast-striking sinistral fault, and a north-northweststriking dextral fault.  In contrast to the roof of the intrusion, the base of the intrusion is largely undeformed with good examples of cooled margins preserved.  Only locally are minor shear zones developed at the base of the intrusion.

Patterns in regional and deposit-scale magnetic datasets indicate minor post-intrusion fault  offsets  including  dextral  offsets  along  reactivated  Archean  faults.    Observations from drill core tend to confirm the limited degree of post-intrusion faulting.

A summary of the Project structural setting is included as Figure 7-4.  This figure was generated by SRK during 2009, and is based on geophysical data interpretation from airborne  magnetic  surveys.    On  the  plan,  the  location  of  the  regional-scale  Quetico Fault is identified, faults are colour-coded as whether they are interpreted to be latestage or early-stage structures, and the regional fold axes are indicated.

## 7.3 Deposits

The  Current  Lake,  Bridge  and  Beaver  Lake  Zones  collectively  form  the  nickel-CuPGE  deposit  at  Current  Lake.    However,  the  different  zones  display  different morphologies,  are  disproportionately  mineralized,  and  have  slight  differences  in mineralization  tenors.    The  Bridge  Zone  is,  for  the  purposes  of  this  Report,  the  last drilled of the mineralized zones, and links the Beaver Lake and Current Lake Zones. An artificial  deposit  boundary  between  the  Current  Lake  and  Beaver  Lake  Zones  is placed at the Quetico sedimentary rock-granite structural contact since the morphology of the conduit changes at this point.

The  conduit  is  completely  composed  of  olivine  melagabbro  within  the  Current  Lake and Bridge Zone portions; the mineralization within these zones always occurs within the  olivine  melagabbro  but  mineralization  distribution  can  be  variable.    Locally,  the disseminated  mineralization  dominant  in  those  areas  can  completely  fill  the  conduit and conversely, can locally only partially fill the conduit.  The Hybrid forms a marginal phase in the hanging wall and footwall portions of the conduit, and sometimes occurs as  a  thin  skin  along  the  walls  of  the  conduit.    The  Hybrid  is  best  envisaged  as  an earlier preparatory phase of the magmatic episode(s) that lead to the formation of the conduit and its mineralization.  Rarely, mineralization has been noted to occur within the basal Hybrid as pods and veinlets, but this is not typical of the deposit mineralizing phase.

The Current and Bridge Zones form a sinuous sub-horizontal tube.  The mineralization within the tabular, sub-horizontal Beaver Lake portion of the deposit forms a variable mesh, usually at, or near, the base of the Beaver Lake portion of the intrusion.  Strong positive  correlations  between  Pt,  Pd,  Cu  and  Ni  and  very  limited  post-crystallization alteration  indicate  preservation  of  a  pristine  magmatic  system.    The  occurrence  of mineralization  throughout  the  chonolith  in  the  Current  Lake  Zone  indicates  that  the sulphides were entrained in the host magma.  Conversely, in the Beaver Lake Zone, sulphides were deposited mainly at the lowest levels of the intrusion.

Depths to the top of the mineralization vary from under 20 m in the northwest, to as much as 450 m in the southeast.  The mineralization, the conduit, and the host gabbro do not crop out at surface.

A  schematic  model  that  outlines  the  locations  of  the  deposits,  and  the  projected conduit morphology is shown in Figure 7-5.

## 7.3.1 Current Lake Zone and Bridge Zone

The  Current  Lake  and  Bridge  Zone  portions  of  the  deposit  form  a  narrow,  almost flat-lying  conduit  ranging  from  30 m  x  30-50 m  wide  and  70 m  tall.    The  olivine melagabbro  in  the  conduit  is  variably  mineralized.    Sulphide  mineralogy  includes pyrrhotite, pentlandite, chalcopyrite, pyrite, and rare cubanite and violarite.

The  Current  Lake  zone  lies  beneath  Current  Lake  and  is  sub-horizontal,  narrow, sinuous, and tube-like in its morphology.  The width, thickness, and orientation of the host  body,  and  its  contained  mineralization,  changes  along  its  length  as  it  follows intersecting,  pre-existing,  sub-vertical  and  sub-horizontal  fractures  and  faults.    The system  exhibits  a  slight  southerly  plunge  with  the  base  of  the  mineralized  body  at 45-50 m depth in  the  north  and  90-95  m  depth  in  the  south  where  it  joins  with  the Bridge Zone.  For much of its length, the upper portions of the Current Lake Zone have been  eroded  away;  however,  due  to  the  shallow  southerly  plunge  its  preserved thicknesses  gradually  increase  and  the  conduit  eventually  becomes  completely preserved at the point just prior to where the Bridge Zone is demarcated.

The Bridge Zone is hosted by granitoid rocks and is completely preserved and tubelike in form; however, it exhibits a steeper east-southeasterly plunge, when compared to  the  Current  Lake  Zone,  and  has  a  relatively  well-defined  strike.    The  top  of  the conduit in the Bridge Zone is 60 m below surface in the west and 125 m below surface in the east, whereas the thickness of the conduit averages 50 m and ranges from 35 m to 65 m in width.  Mineralization is continuous and relatively high-grade throughout the zone.

A section through the Current Lake deposit, showing the orientation of the conduit, and typical  mineralization  thicknesses  and  orientations  is  presented  in  Figure  7-6  and Figure 7-7.  Note the change in the shape of the conduit between the two example sections.  A cross-section through the Bridge Zone is included in Figure 7-8; the figure shows the changing orientation of the conduit, and typical mineralization thicknesses and orientations.  The conduit at the Bridge Zone is essentially flat-lying, as shown in the figure.

## 7.3.2 Beaver Lake

Beaver  Lake  exhibits  a  shallow  (15°)  east-southeasterly  plunge  and  has  a  tabular form.  The morphology of the Current Lake Intrusive Complex system switches from tube-like to tabular when it crosses the contact between the granitoid rocks, located north of the contact, and the fine, clastic metasedimentary rocks located south of the contact.  Figure 7-9 and Figure 7-10 display the changing orientations of the conduit, and typical mineralization thicknesses and orientations.  The figures illustrate that at the Beaver Lake zone, mineralization is typically more likely to be developed in basal depressions.

The tabular  Beaver  Lake  zone  host  intrusion  increases  from  100 m  width  and  15 m thickness  to  550 m  width  and  200 m  thickness  towards  the  east.    Beaver  Lake sulphide mineralization is largely hosted by olivine melagabbro; however, there can be significant  mineralization  within  lherzolite,  which  forms  the  core  of  the  body.    The sulphide  mineralogy  is  similar  to  Current  Lake  and  includes  pyrrhotite,  pentlandite, chalcopyrite, pyrite, and, more rarely, cubanite.

The  morphology  of  the  sulphide  mineralization  at  Beaver  Lake  differs  from  Current Lake  in  that  the  entire  conduit  is  not  mineralized.    The  sulphide  mineralization  is typically located around the margins of the conduit within the olivine melagabbro and may  wrap  around  the  northern  margin  of  the  intrusion.    Basal  mineralization  is  the most dominant and appears to have thermally eroded into the Quetico Subprovince meta-sediments and typically mineralization is thickest and highest grade in depressions in the floor of the intrusion.  This basal mineralization generally forms a complex mesh of mineralized depressions within the floor of the intrusion and varies in thickness from 2 m to as much as 30 m with widths ranging from 20 m to in excess of 50 m.  The term 'Spine Zone' is a term used by Magma Metals geologists for basal mineralization  present  within  the  central  Beaver  Lake  portion  of  the  Current  Lake Intrusive Complex.

The  tenors  of  the  sulphides  are,  in  general,  consistent  between  the  mineralization along the upper and lower contacts; however, some higher-grade 'cloud' mineralization has been identified along the upper contact. This style of mineralization,  referred  to  as  the  Cloud  Zone,  occurs  in  places  near  the  top  of  the intrusion and consists of very finely-disseminated chalcopyrite.

Drill hole BL08-66 was drilled at an angle of 81.1º.  BL07-05 is a 2007 hole that intersects the section obliquely near the base of the intrusion and the drill hole collar is to the northeast of this drill fan.  With the exception of BL07-05, these drill holes are drilled from the same set-up as a drill fan, and are drilled at an angle to the mineralization, so the drilled width reported is thicker than the true width.

Magma Metals Limited Thunder Bay North Polymetallic Project Ontario, Canada NI 43-101 Technical Report

Mineralization within the lherzolite occurs  where  the upper  and  lower  contact mineralization  are  thickest  and  therefore  continue  into  the  lherzolite.    Additional mineralization  is  developed  in  chromium-rich  horizons  within  the  core  of  the  Beaver Lake intrusion.  Typically, the olivine melagabbro and lherzolite contains 2,000-3,000 ppm chromium; however, two zones of continuous 4,000-5,000 ppm chromium with thicknesses  of  generally  2-5  m  contain  significant  sulphide  mineralization.    No chromite has been directly observed in the horizons; however, bright green chlorite is present in these areas and may be hosting the chromium.

## 7.4 Comment on Section 7

In the opinion of the QPs, knowledge of the deposit settings, lithologies, and structural and  alteration  controls  on  mineralization  is  sufficient  to  support  Mineral  Resource estimation.

## 8.0 DEPOSIT TYPES

The  deposit  type  summary  presented  below  is  sourced  from  Foose  et  al.,  (1986), Naldrett (2004), and Eckstrand and Hulbert (2007).

## 8.1 Magmatic Sulphide Deposits

Magmatic  sulphide deposits are sulphide mineral concentrations in mafic and ultramafic rocks derived from immiscible sulphide liquids.  When formed, droplets of immiscible  sulphide  liquid  settle  through  less  dense  silicate  magma.    The  sulphide liquid  acts  as  a  "collector"  for  cobalt,  copper,  nickel,  and  platinum-group  elements, because these elements are preferentially concentrated in sulphide liquids at levels 10 times  to  100,000  times  those  in  silicate  liquids.    To  a  lesser  degree,  iron  is  also preferentially partitioned into the sulphide liquid and, because of its greater abundance, most immiscible sulphide liquid is iron-rich.

There  are  two  main  subset  deposit  types  of  magmatic  sulphide  deposits.    Nickelcopper sulphide deposits have Ni and Cu as the main economic metals.  Ni constitutes the main economic commodity, generally at grades of about 1-3%.  Copper may be either  a  co-product  or  by-product,  and  Co,  PGE,  and  Au  are  common  by-products. The deposit type can be subdivided into four subtypes:

- · A meteorite-impact mafic melt sheet that contains basal sulphide ores (Sudbury, Ontario is the only known example)
- · Rift and continental flood basalt-associated mafic sills and dyke-like bodies (Noril'sk-Talnakh, Russia; Jinchuan, China; Duluth Complex, Minnesota; Muskox, Nunavut; and Crystal Lake intrusion, Ontario)
- · Komatiite (magnesium-rich) ultramafic volcanic flows and related sill-like intrusions (Thompson, Manitoba; Raglan and Marbridge, Quebec; Langmuir, Ontario; Kambalda and Agnew, Australia; Pechenga, Russia; Shangani, Trojan, and Hunter's Road, Zimbabwe).
- · Other  mafic/ultramafic  intrusions  (Voisey's  Bay,  Labrador;  Lynn  Lake,  Manitoba; Giant  Mascot,  British  Columbia;  Kotalahti,  Finland;  Råna,  Norway;  and  SelebiPhikwe, Botswana).

The second major deposit type is PGE-rich, with the PGE elements associated with sparsely dispersed sulphides in very large to medium-sized, typically mafic/ultramafic layered intrusions.

Deposits are hosted in many different geological settings, including:

Project No.:  164115 October 2010

<!-- image -->

Magma Metals Limited Thunder Bay North Polymetallic Project Ontario, Canada NI 43-101 Technical Report

- · Deformed greenstone belts and calc-alkaline batholiths associated with convergent plate margins
- · Ophiolite complexes that formed at constructive plate margins
- · Intraplate magmatic provinces associated with flood-basalt type magmatism
- · Passively rifted continental margins.

Host  rocks  are  predominantly  mafic  to  ultramafic  igneous  rocks.    Occasionally significant  ore  is  in  footwall  country  rocks  of  diverse  meta-sedimentary  or  metaigneous origin and composition.

Some  Ni-Cu-PGE  deposits  occur  as  individual  sulphide  bodies  associated  with magmatic mafic and/or ultramafic bodies.  Others occur as groups of sulphide bodies associated  with  one  or  more  related  magmatic  bodies  in  areas  or  belts  up  to  tens, even hundreds, of kilometres long.

Magmatic sulphide ore is typically associated with:

- · Abrupt variations in the cumulus-mineral succession, including major lithological changes, reversals or changes in crystallization order, discontinuities in mineral fractionation patterns and cyclic units
- · Rocks near the lower contact of an intrusion that may contain country rock xenoliths and may be characterized by irregular variations in grain size, mineralogy, and texture,
- · Rocks near the base of an ultramafic volcanic flow
- · Pegmatoids  and  rocks  enriched  in  minerals  that  crystallize  late  from  silicate magmas.

Deformation  and  alteration  can  remobilize  sulphide  minerals  into  breccia  ore  and segregate sulphide minerals into fractures, cleavage planes, and veins.  Remobilized sulphide-mineral assemblages may be copper-rich relative to sulphide-mineral assemblages that are not remobilized.  Sulphide-mineral assemblages that appear to have precipitated  from  fluids  moving  through  fault  zones  or  along  joint  surfaces  are dominated by pyrite.

Sulphide-mineral assemblages, dominated by pyrrhotite, pentlandite, and chalcopyrite, result  from  solid-state  recrystallization  of  high-temperature  sulphide  minerals.    The proportions of these three minerals are determined by the initial bulk composition of the  immiscible  sulphide  liquid.    The  sulphide  mineral  content  of  these  ore  deposits

Magma Metals Limited Thunder Bay North Polymetallic Project Ontario, Canada NI 43-101 Technical Report varies from &lt;10% to &gt;60%.  Ni grades are typically between 0.7-3.0%, and Cu grades are between 0.2-2.0%.

Magnetite is commonly intergrown with the sulphide minerals.  Minor phases include platinum-group-element minerals (sulphide, arsenide, telluride, antimonide, and alloy minerals),  nickel-  and  cobalt-bearing  arsenide  minerals  (for  example  gersdorffite), galena, sphalerite, and gold, silver, and lead telluride minerals.

Sulphide  minerals  may  be  concentrated  in  structurally  low  areas  at  the  base  of intrusions or flows or may be in zones where silicate magma interacted with xenoliths. Sulphide  mineral  concentrations  in  layered,  cumulate  sequences  may  be  related  to major  lithological  features  such  as  cyclic-unit  boundaries,  unconformities,  chromite seams,  pegmatoids,  or  stratigraphic  intervals  characterized  by  major  changes  or discontinuities in cumulus minerals.

The location of sulphide concentrations in conduits at Talnakh-Noril'sk and Voisey's Bay, and near conduits in certain of the komatiitic deposits, suggests that sulphides accumulated where the flow rate of magma was reduced and the entrained sulphides were able to settle gravitationally to form rich basal concentrations.

Gangue  mineralogy  is  the  same  as  that  of  the  host  and  consists  primarily  of plagioclase,  orthopyroxene,  clinopyroxene,  and  olivine.    Minor  secondary  phases include serpentine  minerals,  talc, magnetite,  calcite, epidote, sericite, actinolite, chlorite, tremolite, and clay minerals.

## 8.2 Mineralization Developed within Rift and Flood Basalts

Specific features of mineralization developed within rift and flood basalts (Noril'sk type) include (Naldrett, 2004):

- · A large volume of relatively primitive magma (MgNo circa 0.55), including olivinephyric magma; some flows can be picritic.  At Noril'sk, there is a lower contact gabbrodolerite marginal zone, overlain by a zone of plagioclase- and sulphide-rich taxitic gabbrodolerite, and overlain in turn by picritic gabbrodolerite.  An intrusive breccia comprising assimilated country rock fragments in a gabbro matrix may be present in the roofs of some intrusions.
- · An intrusive environment in which the magma has had the opportunity to thermally erode/react with the surrounding country rocks
- · Sulphides located in areas that have provided the principal conduits for magma flow.  Conduits developed as magma feeding the sills became concentrated along

Magma Metals Limited Thunder Bay North Polymetallic Project Ontario, Canada NI 43-101 Technical Report certain zones; the concentration of this flow resulted in thermal enlarging the channel ways by eroding the surrounding rock.

- · Country rocks can display well-developed metamorphic aureoles.
- · A magma flow that has already developed immiscible sulphides.  This enables changes in fluid flow dynamics to cause deposition of sulphides in hydrodynamic traps within the flow channel
- · Potential exposure of the sulphides to subsequent batches of magma using the same conduit as the batch from which the sulphides segregated initially.
- · Evidence of chalcophilic depletion in the magma
- · A source of sulphur in the country rocks.
- · A structural setting which exposes the intrusions feeding the lavas.  Intrusions can be very shallow, forming chonoliths.
- · Feeder conduits can be closely related to regional-scale faults.

Based on a summary prepared by Kunilov (1994), disseminated sulphide mineralization in such deposits typically occurs as droplets, schleiren and fine sulphide veinlets. Disseminated  sulphides  can  form  sheet-like  conformable  bodies  and comprise  combinations  of  chalcopyrite,  cubanite  and  pyrrhotite  with  troilite  and pentlandite.  At the Norilsk deposits, grades average 0.5 to 0.6% Ni, 0.6 to 0.7% Cu, and  5-6  g/t PGE  (Porter  Geoconsultancy,  2010)  developed  within  taxitic and gabbrodolerite rocks.

Massive sulphide mineralization typically consists of pyrrhotite, cubanite or chalcopyrite types, depending on the dominant sulphide, with associated pentlandite, mooihoekite, and talnakhite (Kunilov, 1994).  Grades are dependent on the sulphide types  present,  and  can  typically  vary  considerably  between  types.    At  the  Norilsk deposits, grades average 2.8% Ni, 5.6% Cu and 15 g/t PGE (Porter Geoconsultancy, 2010).  Massive sulphides at Noril'sk typically form in either the lowermost portions of the intrusions, or immediately underlying them.

Some deposits display evidence that the massive sulphides post-date the disseminated sulphides (Kunilov, 1994).

Norilsk deposits are typically associated with a very high proportion of sulphides (210 wt% by total mass), and these sulphides contain a significant concentration of PGE.

## 8.3 Comment on Section 8

Features that classify  the  Current  Lake  and  Beaver  Lake  deposits  as  nickel-copper sulphide  deposits,  in  particular  part  of  the  sub-class  of  such  deposits  that  are associated with rift and flood basalts (Noril'sk type) are:

- · Spatial and genetic relationship with a Large Igneous Province.  Deposits are hosted in the Current Lake Intrusive Complex; a series of magmatic conduits of Keweenawan age that have formed along a failed rift related to the Nipigon Embayment and are part of the Mid-continent Rift system
- · Presence of taxitic rocks
- · Contact metamorphism of the country rocks
- · Chonolith host units.  Mineralization developed in flattened tubes (conduits) which are feeders to larger igneous masses
- · Basaltic parental magma composition
- · High sulphide grades
- · Enriched in PGE
- · Sulphides are likely to have been derived by contamination of the magma through incorporation of sulphur from adjoining wall rocks
- · Sulphides tended to settle gravitationally, and collect in the conduits at points where magma velocity was reduced, such as within basal hollows
- · Typical  form  of  the  sulphides  as  disseminated  millimetre  to  centimetre-size spheres dispersed through the host melagabbro

## 9.0 MINERALIZATION

A  discussion  of the mineralization styles and  related depth, width (thickness), orientation and continuity is presented for the mineralized zones in Section 7 of this Report.  The discussion in this section of the Report relates to the mineralization type.

## 9.1 Current Lake and Bridge Zones

In  general,  within  the  Current  Lake  and  Bridge  Zones,  sulphide  mineralization  is disseminated, ranging from a few percent to &gt;25% sulphides, and is interstitial to the silicate gangue.

Disseminations  can  range  in  size  from  0.5  mm  to  as  much  as  1  cm  in  size,  and comprise  pyrrhotite,  chalcopyrite,  pentlandite,  minor  pyrite,  and  rare  cubanite  and violarite.

Basal net-textured (25-50%) sulphide and massive sulphide intervals have occasionally been intersected in core drilling and are more common within the Bridge Zone than the Current Lake Zone.  Within both of these zones the main concentrations of mineralization occur as elongated high-grade pods connected by narrower mediumto low-grade zones.

Significant massive sulphide veining, generally 1-2 cm wide, occurs within the Current Lake Zone.  These veins are typically either sub-horizontal or near-vertical, and are interpreted  by  Magma  Metals  geologists  to  be  the  result  of  segregation  of  molten massive sulphide during the cooling of the intrusion.  Plagioclase often occurs in these veins indicating that plagioclase had also not yet crystallized completely and was still partially molten.

## 9.2 Beaver Lake Zone

The Beaver Lake sulphide mineralization is disseminated, ranging from a few percent to &gt;25% sulphides, and is also interstitial to the silicate gangue.  Disseminations can range in size from 0.5 mm to as much as 1 cm in size.  Blebby sulphides are common and  classic  net-textured  and  massive  sulphide  mineralization  has  been  intersected regularly in core drilling within the western portions of the Beaver Lake Zone where it merges with the Bridge Zone.

In  the  Beaver  Lake  Zone,  sulphide  grades  are  generally  consistent  between  the mineralization  along  the  upper  and  lower  contacts.    However,  the  Cloud  Zone generally has higher-grade mineralization.  The basal mineralization within the Beaver Lake  Zone,  particularly  the  western  and  'Spine'  areas,  forms  a  complex  mesh  of

Magma Metals Limited Thunder Bay North Polymetallic Project Ontario, Canada NI 43-101 Technical Report mineralized subzones that concentrate within hollows or depressions in the floor of the intrusion.  These intersecting depressions appear to coincide with conjugate fracture sets within the underlying Archean meta-sedimentary rocks and may have formed by thermal erosion along the structurally-weakened fracture zones.

## 9.3 Petrography

Preliminary assessments of the PGE mineralogy were undertaken by SGS Lakefield.

SGS  Lakefield  analyzed  the  mineralogy  of  boulder  samples  found  at  the  surface. From this analysis the dominant PGE minerals are moncheite (PtTe2) and michenerite (PdBiTe) with lesser platarsite (PtAsS).  The size of the platinum group metals grains in the SGS Lakefield review ranged from 2-112 µm, with the majority being 2-5 µm in size.  The PGEs were noted to be largely contained within the sulphide phases.

Petrographic analyses performed on metallurgical samples have indicated the presence of sperrylite (PtAs2).

## 9.4 Minor PGE Elements

SGS  Lakefield  has  also  undertaken  PGE  analyses  to  test  for  the  platinum-group elements  Pt,  Pd,  ruthenium  (Ru),  rhodium  (Rh),  iridium  (Ir),  and  osmium  (Os), (collectively the 6-PGE group) in the sulphide mineralization.  Initial 6-PGE analyses indicated  there  was  potential  for  concentrations  of  Ru,  Rh,  Ir,  and  Os,  (collectively referred  to  in  this  Report  as  the  'minor  PGEs')  in  the  sulphide  mineralization. Subsequently, analyses, currently totalling 1,035 determinations, were performed on a broader range of samples.  These analyses confirmed the presence of the minor PGEs in both deposits.

## 9.5 Metal Ratios

Work completed by Dr Roland Goodgame in 2010, in association with Magma Metals geological staff, indicated that copper to nickel ratios are typically 1.4:1 to 2.0:1 and vary  depending on the proportion of sulphide nickel present.  Platinum to palladium ratios are typically of the order of 1.07:1 (Goodgame, 2010).

## 9.6 Comment on Section 9

In the opinion of the QPs, the understanding of mineralization types and settings are acceptable to support Mineral Resource estimation.

## 10.0 EXPLORATION

Magma  Metals  commenced  exploration  on  the  Project  in  2005  subsequent  to  the signing  of  the  option  agreement.    Exploration  has  primarily  been  undertaken  by Magma Metals (e.g. geological mapping), or by contractors (e.g. airborne geophysical surveys, hydrological surveys, and geotechnical studies).

A summary of all work completed to date is included as Table 10-1.

## 10.1 Grids and Surveys

A 235 km 2 LIDAR survey was conducted by Terrapoint Inc. of Ottawa, ON in 2009. The  survey  used  UTM  NAD83  Zone  16  as  a  reference.    The  topographic  model  is accurate  to  a  1 m  (x,  y,  z)  grid,  and  is  considered  sufficiently  accurate  for  resource modelling purposes and to support Preliminary Assessment-level studies.

No other topographic surveys have been undertaken.  All previous digital base-maps were constructed using the publicly available 1:20,000 scale Ontario Basemap Series (OBM) data and the National Topographic System (NTS) 1:50,000 scale data.

All drill collar surveys are reported using UTM NAD83 Zone 16 co-ordinates.

Bathymetric  surveys  were  performed  by  Magma  Metals  staff  in  2008,  over  Current Lake and Steepledge Lake, using a boat equipped with sonar unit, and a differential global  positioning  system  (GPS)  instrument  for  reading  locations.    Sonar  lines  were spaced at approximate 15 m to 20 m, and had a similar accuracy range; the survey is considered sufficiently accurate to support Preliminary Assessment-level studies.

## 10.2 Geological Mapping

During 2006, a surface reconnaissance geological mapping program was undertaken. This  program  better  defined  two  clusters  of  ultramafic  boulders  that  contained  PGE and copper nickel mineralization on the shores of Current Lake (Figure 10-1) that were originally discovered during prospecting activities in 2001 (west shore boulders) and in 2006  (east  shore  boulders).    The  east  shore  boulders  are  considered  by  Magma Metals staff to have undergone only minor movement by glacial ice and are interpreted to  be  essentially  in-situ.    The  west  shore  boulders  are  interpreted  to  have  been transported at least 200 m to the southwest by glacial ice.

Reconnaissance geological mapping of the Beaver Lake area and the eastern portion of the Current Lake area was completed during October 2008 by Dr. G.C. Wilson of Turnstone Geological Services Ltd.  This program was completed as an initial phase of a regional mapping program planned for 2009.

Mapping was completed at a scale of 1:5,000 and documented most of the Archeanage  granitoid  and  meta-sedimentary  outcrops  in  the  vicinity  of  the  known  mineral deposits underlying Current and Beaver Lakes.

The 1:5,000 scale regional geological mapping program was completed by Dr. Wilson of Turnstone Geological Services Limited over the central Project area between May and  October  2009.    This  program  also  targeted  and  examined  any  existing  surface exposures associated with known airborne magnetic anomalies.  No additional boulder exposures  of  Keweenawan-age  mafic  to  ultramafic  intrusive  rocks  were  observed; however,  several  localized  exposures  of  intermediate-hybrid  intrusive  rocks  were observed.

Regional reconnaissance prospecting and geological mapping that targeted previously unexamined magnetic anomalies was completed by Magma Metals staff at a scale of 1:5,000 in the Hicks and Greenwich Lake areas during 2010.  Maps are currently in preparation.

## 10.3 Geochemical Surveys

Geochemical sampling as part of the assessment of the boulder clusters at Current Lake  was  performed  in  2005.    Rock  chip  samples  from  the  boulders  returned anomalous Ni, Cu, and PGE elements.  The values were sufficiently encouraging to warrant the first of the airborne geophysical surveys over the Project being performed.

During 2009, Magma Metals completed a pilot program to test the efficacy of heavy mineral content (HMC) sampling, where such materials occurred on lake-side beaches within  the  Project  area.    A  test  lake  sediment  survey,  based  on  samples  of  organic materials taken from lake bottoms within the Project area, was also trialled.  Results were sufficiently encouraging for Magma Metals to plan a systematic program of HMC and lake sediment sampling for late 2010.

During the more detailed 2010 HMC sampling program, a total of 49 samples were collected  along  the  shores  of  various  lakes  throughout  the  property.    For  the  more detailed  2010  lake  sediment  survey,  a  total  of  106  samples  were  collected  from various lakes throughout the property.  Sample results are pending for both programs.

## 10.4 Geophysical Surveys

A  significant  number  of  airborne  and  ground-based  geophysical  surveys  have  been completed  between  2006  and  2010,  with  several  surveys  in  progress  at  the  Report effective  date.  Surveys  completed  on  the  Project  are  summarized  in  Table  10-2. Locations  of  the  airborne  surveys  are  shown  in  Figure  10-2,  whereas  Figure  10-3 shows the locations of the areas that were subject to ground geophysical surveys.

## 10.5 Geophysical Data Review

During 2009, a review of all geophysical data collated on the Project was completed by an independent consultant, Warren Hughes, to evaluate the quality of the data, and to help  determine  which  of  the  various  methods  was  likely  to  be  of  greater  value  in exploration targeting (Hughes, 2009).  The review indicated that the data collected to date was of acceptable quality, and that the interpretations reflected the geophysical data.    Hughes  (2009)  noted  that  input  from  site  geologists  familiar  with  the  regional geology and Project lithologies would likely improve the interpretations.

Two main geophysical methods were recommended by Hughes (2009) as potentially useful in mineralization vectoring. These were magnetometric resistivity (MMR), and Zaxis  tipper  electromagnetic  technique  (Z-TEM).    MMR  was  considered  a  promising technique  to  help  vector  into  zones  of  increased  mineralization;  the  Z-TEM  survey would  likely  be  an  effective  tool  to  search  for  deeper  disseminated  and  massive sulphides east of Beaver Lake and in the Thunder Bay area (Hughes, 2009).

## 10.6 Drilling

Drilling on the Project is discussed in Section 11 of this Report.

## 10.7 Bulk Density

Bulk density determinations are discussed in Section 12 of this Report.

## 10.8 Petrology, Mineralogy and Other Research Studies

A  series  of  limited,  purely  descriptive  petrographic  studies  (thin  and  polished  thin sections)  were  completed  between  March  and  December  of  2008  by  Dr.  Graham Wilson of Turnstone Geological Services Ltd.  No conclusions were reported from his observations.  Dr. Wilson's petrographic work described:

- · The sulphide, oxide, and silicate mineralogy of three sulphide-rich samples taken from Phase 2 Current Lake drill holes TBND020 and TBND027
- · The sulphide, oxide, and silicate mineralogy of a 'sulphide-charged' (enriched) diabase sill located near Lone Island Lake
- · The sulphide, oxide, and silicate mineralogy of 22 samples taken from 14 separate drill  holes  that  tested 2.7 km of the strike-length of the Current Lake and Beaver Lake portions of the mineral deposit.

A  catalogue  of  rock  types  associated  with  the  Current  Lake  Intrusive  Complex  was prepared using the above work as a guide.

Dr. Rebecca Sproule of the Geodiscovery Group completed a preliminary analysis of the  existing  assay  and  lithogeochemical  database  in  September  and  October  2008. The aims of the study included:

- · Characterization of the rock-types and mineralization
- · Establish the relationship between rock chemistry and mineralization
- · Investigate the metal ratios and the implications for metallogenesis
- · Determine the implications of Ni/Cu ratios and the source of Ni depletion (if present)
- · Review the sulphide metal tenors
- · Determine the genesis of the mineralization.

The  overall  findings  of  this  preliminary  stage  study  by  Dr.  Sproule  were  as  follows (Sproule, 2008):

- · The Current Lake and Beaver Lake Intrusions are derived from a tholeiitic magma
- · The data indicate a degree of crustal contamination within the magma and there appears to be only one magma type based on lithophile elements
- · PGE and chalcophile element geochemistry is very homogeneous

Project No.:  164115 October 2010

Magma Metals Limited Thunder Bay North Polymetallic Project Ontario, Canada NI 43-101 Technical Report

- · There appears to be a strong enrichment in Pt, Pd, Au, and Cu relative to Ni, Fe, Mg, and Cr
- · The narrow, likely more dynamic, Current Lake portion of the system has higher metal tenors compared to the wider and thicker Beaver Lake portion of the system
- · Potential exists to the southeast for massive Ni-Cu-PGE mineralization.

In late 2009, Magma Metals contracted Dr. V. Roland Goodgame of Taloumba Inc. to complete a pilot lithogeochemical and petrographic study on the Current Lake Intrusive Complex.  He selected 214 samples from 13 drill holes that were evenly distributed throughout the length of the deposit.  All samples were analyzed for their whole rock major oxides, trace elements, and rare earth elements.  Polished thin sections were prepared from all samples.  The olivine grains present within 48 of the sections were subjected  to  microprobe  analysis.    A  total  of  948  individual  probes  were  completed with three to five olivine grains analyzed per polished thin section.

## Dr. Goodgame concluded that (Goodgame, 2010):

- · The rocks identified in the thin sections include olivine melagabbronorite and lherzolite and are texturally olivine orthocumulate and mesocumulate.  The primary minerals observed are olivine, clinopyroxene, orthopyroxene, biotite, plagioclase and apatite.  Alteration minerals include: serpentine, amphibole, chlorite, talc, carbonate (calcite/dolomite), scapolite, kaolinite, hematite and iddingsite.  The sulfide/oxide components are composed of magnetite, ilmenite, pyrrhotite, pyrite, chalcopyrite, cubanite, pentlandite, violarite and native Cu.
- · Olivine microprobes indicated that there was no zoning within the olivine grains analyzed.  The forsterite (Fo), Ni, and Co contents of the olivines were calculated to average 79.6 mol%, 1,779 ppm, and 189 ppm, respectively.
- · The magmas that produced the mineralization formed from a plume from beneath a crustal plate.  The alkaline nature indicates that these particular magmas were early on in the sequence history from the head of the plume.
- · The complex appears to be well mixed with up to 5% contamination from wall rock material.  S/Se ratios indicate that the high-grade mineralization is magmatic with little to no sedimentary sulphur input.  The intrusion is enriched (mineralized) and is nowhere depleted.  Gd/Yb ratios indicate that the magmas came from greater than 90 km depth.
- · R-factor analysis and modelling indicates that the initial starting composition of the magma was likely 120 ppm Cu and 40 ppb Pd and the average R factor for the deposit is about 700.

Project No.:  164115 October 2010

Magma Metals Limited Thunder Bay North Polymetallic Project Ontario, Canada NI 43-101 Technical Report

- · Mantle-normalized spidergrams indicate minor contamination (weak Ti, Nb peaks) and that the samples are all mineralized.  Rare earth element (REE) spidergrams indicate that the magma is either contaminated or originated from an enriched source area or both.
- · The 6-PGE data indicate that either chromite (hosting Ru) and olivine crystallized in a lower magma chamber while the intrusion was still sulphur undersaturated or that the Ru remained behind in the source area in chromite due to low degrees of partial melting in the source area (plume head during initial rifting phase).
- · Cu grade  and  Cu  grade  /(Cu/Pd)*10,000  of  sulphide  minerals  show  promise  as vectors to mineralization especially within core holes present within poorly mineralized ultramafic rock.  Cu grades and grade-factors based on Cu/Pd should be further investigated as potential vectors to mineralization.

## 10.9 Exploration Potential

The  known  deposits  associated  with  the  Current  Lake  Intrusive  Complex  are  open along  strike  to  the  north  of  the  Current  Lake  Zone  and  along-strike  to  the  eastsoutheast of the 'Spine' area of the Beaver Lake Zone.  In addition, geophysical and drill anomalies remain to be tested outside the area of the known mineralization.

Figure 10-4 presents the locations of the major target areas within the Project.

Within  the  area  of  the  mineral  resource  estimate,  key  targets  include  testing  for  the presence  of  heavily  disseminated,  semi-massive  or  massive  sulphides  (refer  to Section 10.9.1) and follow-up of bore hole EM anomalies.

Recent drilling  on  the  South  East  Anomaly  (refer  to  Section  10.9.2)  has  shown  that mineralized  peridotite  similar  to  that  observed  within  the  defined  deposit  is  present 2 km  southeast  of  the  Beaver  Lake  Zone.    These  drill  intercepts  occur  along  the margins of the recently-defined gravity anomaly that is continuous with the portion of the  Current  Lake  Intrusive  Complex  hosting  the  Beaver  Lake  mineralization.    This strongly suggests that the gravity anomaly represents a continuation/extension of the Current Lake Intrusive Complex and has excellent potential to host disseminated and massive sulphide mineralization.

Note: Drill intercept on plan from Steepledge Lake is drill hole SL09-13; reported intercept commences at 34.00 m down hole.  The reconnaissance drill hole on the plan is SL09-41.  The intercept commenced at 220.00 m down hole.  Drill holes were vertical, so intercept thicknesses approximate true thicknesses for each drill hole.  Targets are super-imposed on a geological interpretation of a total magnetic intensity geophysical plan.  Scale adjacent the figure provides the colour-codes to the relative total magnetic intensity values. Figure courtesy Magma Metals.

The Steepledge Lake Intrusive Complex (refer to Section 10.9.3) is a mirror image of the Current Lake Intrusive Complex and is located 3.5 km to the west-northwest.  It hosts rock-types and mineralization (low- to moderate-grade) that are very similar to those within the Current Lake Complex and has the potential to host disseminated and massive  sulphide  mineralization.    At  present  no  deposits  are  defined  within  the Steepledge  Complex  and  more  drilling  needs  to  be  done  to  follow-up  the  known mineralized intercepts.

The Lone Island Lake Intrusive Complex is somewhat different in form and has not been  evaluated  in  any  detail.    Low-grade  PGE-Cu-Ni  sulphide  mineralization  is present within the system and the potential exists to find additional mineralization.

Mineralized mafic-ultramafic conduit systems such as those discovered in the Project area can occur as three-dimensional stacked clusters; the Noril'sk-Talnakh system is a good example of such a stacked system.  Therefore, there is reasonable potential for other  mineralized  conduits  to  be  present  at  depth  below  the  two  presently-defined conduits as well as near-surface elsewhere within the confines of the Project tenure.

## 10.9.1 High Sulphide Target

Magma Metals recently completed a program of drilling in the Bridge and Beaver Lake Zones  in  the  Current  Lake  Intrusive  Complex,  which  tested  13  down-hole  electromagnetic (DHEM) targets with a single hole into each.  The bore hole EM anomalies were interpreted to reflect potential high-sulphide zones containing heavily disseminated,  semi-massive  or  massive  sulphides.    Seven  intersections  of  highsulphide  zones  were  recorded  in  this  program.    In  all,  14  intersections  of  massive sulphides  have  been  made  within  a  700  m  strike  length  of  the  Bridge  and  western Beaver Lake Zones in the resource drilling and the more recent drilling targeting the bore hole EM anomalies (Figure 10-5).

High-sulphide  zones  have  the  potential  to  form  high-value  domains  within  the resource.  One area, indicated in Figure 10-5 as a white rectangle, has been selected for detailed follow-up drilling.  This area has a number of attributes which prioritize it ahead of other high-sulphide targets in the intrusion:

- · It contains four massive sulphide drill intercepts within a 100 m strike length
- · It contains a cluster of bore hole EM anomalies
- · It is associated with a prominent reversely polarized magnetic anomaly which extends from the northern margin of the intrusion to the south (green and blue colours in Figure 10-5)
- · It is located on the northern margin of the intrusion which is controlled by a major east-west-trending  crustal-scale  structure  that  could  host  feeder  zones  to  the intrusive complex.

A  27  hole  (6,000 m)  follow-up  program  to  test  this  cluster  of  massive  sulphide intercepts and bore hole EM anomalies is in progress and is anticipated to continue until  mid-December  2010.    The  program  is  designed  to  better  define  the  known massive and net-textured sulphides zones so that their connectivity can be established and their potential can be better evaluated.

Note:  Drill intercept for BL10-336 starts at 85.10 m; BL10-335 at 195.15 m, and BL10-341 intercepts commence at 150.40 and 247.80 m, respectively.  Massive sulphide intervals in BL10-304 occur at 202.40 m down hole (intercept reported as 0.55 m); in BL10-303 at 199.5 m down hole (intercept reported as 1.7 m); in BL10-282 at 168.68 m down hole (intercept reported as 1.21 m).  Drill holes are vertical.  Scale adjacent figure indicates total magnetic intensity values.  Figure courtesy Magma Metals.

## 10.9.2 South East Anomaly (Gravity Anomaly)

A magnetic anomaly, termed the South East Anomaly (Figure 10-6), was subject to a ground gravity survey during 2010 that indicated the centres of the two geophysical anomalies were off-set.  Modelling of the gravity anomaly indicated the likely presence of a 2.2 km long, 500 m wide, 200 m thick peridotite body.  Drill testing to determine if the gravity anomaly hosts ultramafic rock that is mineralized is presently underway and consists  of  a  10  hole,  10,305  m  program  that  is  likely  to  extend  into  January  2011. Modelled depths to the top of the body are in the order of 500 m to 700 m.

Magma Metals Limited Thunder Bay North Polymetallic Project Ontario, Canada NI 43-101 Technical Report

Figure 10-6:  South East Anomaly

<!-- image -->

A reinterpretation of the magnetic anomaly by Magma Metals staff suggests that it is due to a thick magnetite-rich gabbro and gabbro-hybrid body overlying a less magnetic peridotite body, which could be the source of the gravity anomaly.  This is supported by exploration drilling on the southern edge of the gravity anomaly, which intercepted peridotite  beneath  a  thick  gabbro  and  gabbro-hybrid  body,  and  encountered  PGE mineralization.

A prominent east-west magnetic feature in the South East Anomaly is interpreted as a shallow magma conduit overlying the gabbro body (refer to Figure 10-6) that may be as close as 100 m from the surface.  This target is also planned to be drill tested in early 2011.

## Regional Exploration

The Steepledge Lake intrusive complex, a magma conduit that is at least 6 km long, 4 km of which is held by Magma Metals, was drill tested in 2009.  Drill results indicated a wider and thicker body of peridotite to that encountered at Current Lake (Figure 10-9). Magma  Metals  noted  to  AMEC  that  the  average  Pt:Pd  ratio  appears  to  be  slightly lower at Steepledge Lake, and the combined Cu and Ni values significantly higher than in  the  Current  Lake  Complex,  which  to  Magma  Metals  staff  indicated  a  probable different source magma.

Note:  Intercept reported for SL09-06 commences at 67.00 m 96.00 m down hole, respectively; that for SL09-08 at 29.80m, 46.00m, and 82.00 m depth, respectively, for SL09-13 at 34.00 m depth; for SL09-29 at 67.00 m depth, and for SL09-33  at  61.60  m  depth.    Thicknesses  reported  are  vertical  thicknesses,  which  approximate  true  widths.    Scale adjacent figure indicates total magnetic intensity values.  Figure courtesy Magma Metals.

Mineralization that grades &gt;1 g/t combined Pt and Pd has been defined to date over about  500  m  of  strike,  and  additional  drilling  is  warranted.    The  Lone  Island  Lake intrusive complex is also planned to be drill tested.

## 10.10 Comment on Section 10

In the opinion of the QPs, the exploration programs completed to date are appropriate to  the  style  of  the  deposits  and  prospects  within  the  Project.    The  structural,  age dating, and petrographic research work supports the genetic and affinity interpretations.  The Project remains prospective for additional magmatic sulphide type mineralization.

## 11.0 DRILLING

Drilling  commenced late in  2006, and  has  continued  to  the  present.    All  drilling  has been completed using core methods, and, as at 31 July 2010, totalled 625 core holes (137,378.7 m).  This drill total includes all reconnaissance, delineation, and infill drilling completed on the Project to 31 July, 2010.  Of this total, 528 core holes (97,676 m) support mineral resource estimation; 35 drill holes (8,225.92 m) were drilled after the database close-out date of 31 May 2010, two of which are in progress.

A drilling summary is provided in Table 11-1.  Drill hole location plans are provided by area, and include Figure 11-1 (Current Lake), Figure 11-2 (Beaver Lake and Bridge Zone), Figure 3 (South East Anomaly), Figure 4 (Steepledge Lake), and Figure 11-5 (Lone Island Lake).

## 11.1 Drilling Methods and Equipment

Four drill contractors have been used in the period 2006-2010:

- · Dominion Drilling of Pleasantdale, Saskatchewan (Current Lake Phases 1 and 2, Beaver Lake Phase 1).  Drilling was land-based, and helicopter-supported.
- · Boart Longyear Inc. of North Bay, Ontario (Beaver Lake Phase 2).  Drilling was land-based.
- · George Downing Estate Drilling Limited of Grenville-sur-la-Rouge, Quebec (all other drilling).  Drilling included two ice-based programs, two barge-based programs, several land-based drill programs, and one helicopter-supported program.
- · Chibougamau Diamond Drilling of Chibougamau, Quebec.  Drilling consisted of the deep extension of two existing drill holes and the drilling of one short drill hole at the South East Anomaly.

Rigs  employed  during  the  programs  include  a  helicopter-portable  Boyles  37,  a  skid mounted LM-55, a DuraLite 5000, several Longyear LF-70s, and a Longyear HC-150. The Magma Metals geologists have observed that deeper drill targets in the Beaver Lake Zone and the East Anomaly target area are at the limits of the capabilities of the drill  rigs  currently  being  utilized  and  are  likely  to  require  larger  drills  for  evaluation purposes.

All core was drilled at NQ size (47.6 mm diameter).

Core is securely wrapped and stored on site at the drill rig.  If the drill rig is not roadaccessible, core is transported to the nearest road by the drilling contractor via heavy equipment for land-based drill rigs, by helicopter for helicopter-supported programs, or by pontoon boat for barge drill programs.  Magma Metals personnel pick up the drill core and transport it to the logging facility by truck.  At the logging facility the core is unwrapped by Magma Metals personnel and processed.

## 11.2 Geological Logging

Drill core is either logged in the field at Magma Metals' drill camp or at Magma Metals' secure core logging and sampling facility in Thunder Bay by qualified Magma Metals geologists.  Previous to October 2009 drill core from the Project was transported to the Thunder  Bay  facility  by  Magma  Metals  personnel  within  a  company  vehicle  for sampling.    After  October  2009  all  Project-related  core  was  sampled  on-site  at  the onsite drill camp.

From  December  2006  to  July  2008,  geological  logging  was  performed  using  laptop computers  and  a  standardized  Microsoft  Excel ® logging  template.    As  the  drill programs advanced Project knowledge, the template was modified to collect quantitative data.

During  August  2008,  logging  was  switched  to  OCRIS™,  a  SQL-based,  quantitative core logging software program, designed by St. Arnaud Data Management Pty Ltd of Perth, Western Australia, for all core logging.

The geologists log core directly  into  laptop  computers.    This  ensures  the  geologists conform to a standardized core logging format and nomenclature.  Logging of lithology, alteration,  veining,  structure,  mineralization,  and  sampling  have  been  categorized through use of drop-down legends that require the logging geologist to select from preset codes.  Features are recorded separately for each category.  Any unique feature not accounted for in the pre-set legends is noted in a comments field.  Intervals of core that are not sampled are noted with the interval and the reason for the core not being sampled;  non-sampling  can  be  as  a  consequence,  for  example,  of voids, or overburden.

The logging system also provides data entry error traps to ensure data integrity.  Quick logs are sent to the Thunder Bay office on a daily basis.  Complete log transfers are done upon the completion of the drill hole logging.

Excel spreadsheets are currently still employed for reconnaissance drill logging, where the drilling is not associated with the known mineralized zones.

Magma Metals Limited Thunder Bay North Polymetallic Project Ontario, Canada NI 43-101 Technical Report

Since  September,  2008,  core  has  been  routinely  wet-photographed  using  a  digital camera.

Magnetic  susceptibility  measurements  are  taken  on  the  drill  core  with  a  hand-held meter  approximately  every  1.5 m  along  the  entire  length  of  the  core  interval  in peridotite.    For  areas  of  sediment  or  granite,  the  approximate  measurement  interval may be as much as 3 m.  The measurements are manually keyed into a spreadsheet then imported into the Project database.

## 11.3 Geotechnical Logging

Geologists measure the core to determine recoveries and count natural core breaks to calculate rock quality designations for selected intervals of selected core holes.

Structural and geotechnical logging is currently not based on oriented core because there is no available system that can orient core from vertically-drilled holes.

No  other  geotechnical  core  logging  is  currently  being  undertaken  at  the  Project although the existence of significant fracture zones and broken and blocky ground is reasonably well documented (refer to Section 11.4).

## 11.4 Core Recovery

Core recoveries were not generally recorded. Where data are available, measurements indicate that core recoveries are generally high within the drilled units.

Average core recoveries by lithology comprise:

- · Ultramafic intrusions &gt;95%
- · Hybrid intrusive 60-95%, average 90%
- · Granitic bodies &gt;95%
- · Meta-sediments &gt;95% (exceptions listed below)
- · Fault zones within meta-sediments 20-90%, highly variable
- · Intrusive breccias 0-90%, highly variable.

There is a drill-defined area of poor ground conditions that exists above the ultramafic intrusive, located to the west side of Beaver Lake and which extends underneath the northern portion of Beaver Lake itself.  Within this zone of poor ground conditions the core recoveries were often 0% due to a tri-cone drill bit being used to penetrate the

Magma Metals Limited Thunder Bay North Polymetallic Project Ontario, Canada NI 43-101 Technical Report zone of poor ground.  From the recovered fragments of core it has been determined that this area consists of several intersecting structures and the rock type itself is the intrusive breccia.

## 11.5 Collar Surveys

Drill sites  prior  to  February  2008  were  located  in  the  field  using  a  wide  area augmentation  system  (WAAS)  enabled,  hand-held  global  positioning  system  (GPS) instrument.  From mid-February 2008 all drill holes have been sited using a differential GPS (DGPS).

On completion of drilling, all collar locations were resurveyed with the DGPS.

The UTM location (NAD83 datum, Zone 16), elevation, azimuth, and dip of all landbased  drill  collars  were  resurveyed  to  sub-centimetre  accuracy  by  Ontario  Land Surveyors J.D. Barnes Limited of Thunder Bay, Ontario.

For  drill  holes  completed  on  ice,  the  collar  survey  data  are  only  based  on  DGPS readings; the instrument has sub-metre accuracy.

## 11.6 Down-hole Surveys

Down-hole  orientations  of  all  drill  holes  are  surveyed  using  a  Reflex  EZ-Shot ® (EZshot) instrument.  Readings are taken at the base of the hole, below the casing and at nominal 50 m intervals for the remaining length of the hole.  Since September 2007, the  orientation  of  all  inclined  drill  holes  have  also  been  surveyed  by  a  Reflex Maxibor II ® (Maxibor) instrument, which is a non-magnetic multi-shot tool designed to be used in areas of magnetic rock.  Maxibor surveys typically commence 10 m from the end depth of the drill hole with readings taken every 3 m from the starting point to the surface.

From January 2010, the Magma staff geotechnicians surveyed vertical drill holes with a  leased  Reflex  Gyro ® (Gyro)  down-hole  tool.    The  Reflex  EZ-Shot  tool  is  used  for back-up and quality control of the Gyro tool.  The EZ-Shot measurements are taken at stations  approximately every 50 m.  The Gyro tool is initialized at the collar using a differential GPS manufactured by Advanced Public Safety (APS).  The dip of the drill rods is checked with an inclinometer accurate to ±½°.  The down-hole Gyro survey is conducted  from  the  top  of  the  hole  down  to  the  bottom,  and  another  survey  is performed from the bottom of the hole upwards with stations every 5 m for both in and out surveys.

Project No.:  164115 October 2010

Magma Metals Limited Thunder Bay North Polymetallic Project Ontario, Canada NI 43-101 Technical Report

The survey data are transferred from the tool to a laptop computer using Bluetooth ® connectivity.    The  raw  down-hole  survey  data  are  verified  and  processed  using  the Reflex Gyrosmart  software at the drill.  The software data verification is capable of ® alerting the geotechnicians to most potential data quality issues before they depart the drill.

Prior  to  accepting  the  Reflex  Gyro  tool  as  the  main  down-hole  survey  instrument, Magma Metals compared its results to a DGI Geoscience north-seeking Gyro survey on five drill holes and found the results generated by the two tools to be comparable.

## 11.6.1 Bore-Hole Pulse Down-Hole EM Surveys

To  provide  sufficient  coverage  for  Magma  Metals  to  generate  a  planned  threedimensional  (3-D)  geophysical  model  for  the  Project,  selected  core  drill  holes  have been surveyed using a pulse down-hole EM method and a three-axis magnetic survey. Drill holes are selected so as to provide data on 50 m x 50 m centres, such that there is sufficient overlap between data collection points to support eventual construction of a 3-D model.

A trial of the bore-hole MMR technique was performed by Crone Geophysics between April and June 2009.

## 11.7 Drill Spacing

Most of the first 41 drill holes completed within the Project, in the Current Lake Phases 1 and 2, and Beaver Lake Phase 1 programs, were inclined holes drilled at a variety of azimuths  and  dips.    Many  of  the  helicopter-supported  core  holes  drilled  from  the shoreline of Current Lake consisted of a series of fans drilled from one location with as many as eight drill  holes  completed  from  a  single  set-up.    The  majority  of  the  core holes completed since mid-February 2008 have been drilled vertically.

As a result, the bulk of the exploration drill holes are vertical holes drilled on section lines  oriented  across  the  strike  of  the  intrusion.    Approximately  14%  of  completed holes are inclined, although a number of the inclined holes were drilled under the base intrusion without intersecting it.

Prior  to  February  2008,  drill  pattern  and  density  were  not  systematic  and  were designed to individually test specific magnetic anomalies.  Since February 2008, drill holes  have  been  sited  along  systematic  section  lines,  and  where  possible,  previous drill holes have been included within these section lines.

Project No.:  164115 October 2010

Magma Metals Limited Thunder Bay North Polymetallic Project Ontario, Canada NI 43-101 Technical Report

At Current Lake, the drilling has been completed along 50 m spaced section lines with core holes spaced at 10 m intervals on each section.  The average drill section and spacing in the Current Lake Zone is 50 m and varies between approximately 30 m and 60 m.  Within the Bridge Zone, drill spacing is typically on 50 m x 10 m spacings in the centre of the zone, widening to about 50 m x 20 m on the periphery.  At one point, three lines have been drilled to provide 25 m x 10 m spacings.  At the Beaver Lake zone, initial drilling was on 100 m x 50 m spacings, this is being infilled to 50 m x 20 m spacings.

Drilling is normally perpendicular to the strike of the mineralization.  Depending on the dip of the drill hole, and the dip of the mineralization, inclined drill intercept widths are typically  greater  than  true  widths,  whereas,  in  the  vertical  drill  holes,  the  drilled intercept approximates the true width.  Because of the sub-horizontal tube-like nature of  the  Current  and  Bridge Zone portions of the conduit and the entrained, cloud-like nature  of  the  mineralization  the  drill  intercepts  from  vertical  holes  will  be  essentially true widths, no matter where the drill holes intersect the mineralization.

Drill orientations  for both  Current  Lake  and  Beaver  Lake  Zones  are  generally appropriate for the mineralization style, and have been drilled at orientations that are optimal for the orientation of mineralization for the bulk of the deposit areas.

Example drill intercepts were included for the Current Lake, Bridge and Beaver Lake Zones in Figure 7-6 to Figure 7-10.

Example  drill  intercepts  are  summarized  in  Table  11-2  and  Table  11-3  that  are illustrative  of  nature  of  the  mineralization  within  the  Beaver  Lake  and  Current  Lake Zones respectively.  The example drill holes in the figures in Section 7 and this table illustrate non-mineralized  intersections  and  areas  of  higher-grade  in  lower-grade intervals.

## 11.8 2010 Phase 9 Drill Program

Between the close-off date for the database of 31 May 2010, and the 31 July 2010 tabulation of the number of drill holes completed to date on the Project in Table 11-1, an additional 25 core holes were completed and assayed in the Phase 9 drill program. This program was designed to test bore hole EM anomalies associated with the known mineralization at the Beaver Lake zone.  The program also included three abandoned drill holes, and a deepening of BL09-161.

Magma Metals Limited Thunder Bay North Polymetallic Project Ontario, Canada NI 43-101 Technical Report

Review of the drilling that has both assay results and drill logs, indicated that the core holes  intersected  similar  lithologies  to  those  known  from  the  existing  drilling,  and confirmed the local continuation of mineralization along strike from known mineralized intercepts.    Although  local  changes  to  grade  and  lithological  interpretations  can  be expected, the results of the drilling do not materially change the interpretations for the mineral resource estimate discussed in Section 17.

## 11.9 Fall 2010 Drill Program (in progress)

As at 6 October 2010, there were two drill programs in progress within the boundaries of the Project.

A  27  hole  (6,000  m)  follow-up  drill  program  to  test  a  cluster  of  massive  sulphide intercepts  and  DHEM  anomalies  between  Beaver  Lake  Sections  357975E  and 358150E (western  Beaver  Lake  Zone)  is  in  progress  and  is  anticipated  to  continue until  mid-December  2010.    The  program  is  designed  to  better  define  the  known massive and net-textured sulphide zones so that their continuity/connectivity can be established and their potential can be better evaluated.  Proposed drill hole locations are shown in Figure 11-6.

A 10 hole, 10,305 m, drill program is underway in the northern South East Anomaly area.  This program is follow-up to a significant anomaly detected by a detailed ground gravity  survey  completed  during  the  summer  of  2010.    The  gravity  anomaly  directly connects with, and appears to be related to, the Beaver Lake portion of the Current Lake Intrusive  Complex.    The  planned  program  is  estimated  to  extend  into  January 2011, and is shown in Figure 11-7.  The planned program consists of an initial six drill holes at 400 m spacing, followed by infill drilling of four core holes at 200 m spacings if warranted.

Drill locations shown on the plans are conceptual; locations may change as additional information is incorporated from the completed drill holes of the programs.

Magma  Metals  advised  that  only  preliminary  data  were  available  for  the  eight completed drill holes (BL10-342 to BL10-349) at Beaver Lake as at 6 October 2010. Based on geological logging data, the visual inspection of the drill core indicate that depths to mineralized intercepts, intercept widths, and appearance and intensity of the sulphide mineralization are similar to those reported from existing for existing massive sulphide, net-textured, and disseminated sulphide intercepts in the Beaver Lake area.

Magma Metals Limited Thunder Bay North Polymetallic Project Ontario, Canada NI 43-101 Technical Report

Assay results for the Beaver Lake drill holes are preliminary as at 6 October, 2010. Mineralization that is regarded as higher-grade is re-assayed using a different assay technique (refer to Section 13.4) to that used for initial results, and these assays have a longer turn-around timeframe; hence results typically take longer to receive than the initial preliminary results.

The easternmost first core hole at the South East Anomaly is still in progress and yet to reach its target depth.  The first portion of this drill hole was drilled by a mid-sized drill that was not capable of reaching the targeted depth of the hole.  When a drill rig that  was  capable of deeper drilling arrived on site, a second core hole was partially completed 450 m to the west as a shakedown test of the rig at shallower drill depths. Once the shakedown was completed, the new drill moved back to the first drill hole and  is  now  extending  it  to  the  target  depth.    The  second  core  hole  (test  hole)  is planned to be completed to its final depth at a later stage of the proposed program. No core from this drilling had been submitted for analysis at the effective date of the Report.

## 11.10 Comment on Section 11

In  the  opinion  of  the  QPs,  the  quantity  and  quality  of  the  lithological,  geotechnical, collar and down-hole survey data collected in the exploration and infill drill programs completed by Magma Metals are sufficient to support Mineral Resource estimation as follows:

- · Core logging undertaken by Magma Metals meets industry standards for copper, nickel, cobalt, precious metals and PGE exploration within a magmatic sulphidestyle setting
- · Collar surveys have been performed for the Magma Metals programs using industry-standard instrumentation
- · Down-hole surveys were performed using industry-standard instrumentation
- · Recovery data, where recorded, from core drill programs are acceptable
- · Drilling is normally perpendicular to the strike of the mineralization.  Depending on the dip of the drill hole, and the dip of the mineralization, drill intercept widths are typically greater than true widths in inclined drill holes, and approximate the true widths in vertical drill holes
- · Drill orientations are generally appropriate for the mineralization style, and have been drilled at orientations that are optimal for the orientation of mineralization for the bulk of the deposit areas

Project No.:  164115 October 2010

Magma Metals Limited Thunder Bay North Polymetallic Project Ontario, Canada NI 43-101 Technical Report

- · Drill orientations are shown in the example cross-sections (Figures 7-6 to 7-10), and can be seen to appropriately test the mineralization.  The sections display typical drill hole orientations for the deposits, show summary assay values using colour ranges for assay intervals that include areas of non-mineralized and very low grade mineralization, and outline areas where higher-grade intercepts can be identified within lower-grade sections.  The sections confirm that sampling is representative of the copper, nickel, cobalt, precious metals and PGE grades in the deposits, reflecting areas of higher and lower grades
- · Drill hole intercepts as summarized in Table 11-2 and Table 11-3 appropriately reflect the nature of the copper, nickel, cobalt, precious metals and PGE mineralization
- · No material factors were identified with the data collection from the drill programs that could affect Mineral Resource estimation.

While reviewing drill data used in geological interpretations, AMEC noted the following:

- · The relatively close-spaced drill holes on section lines provide suitable information for geological interpretation and grade contouring on vertical sections.  However, the interpretation of features in the on-strike direction is more uncertain.  AMEC recommends that angled or step-out holes are drilled off-section in areas of poor geological and grade continuity to support the geological interpretation and models.
- · The vertical drill holes provide limited or no information on the location of the edges of the intrusion.  The lack of intrusion boundary data affects the open pit shell that is used to constrain mineral resources, by adding uncertainty as to the final locations of the pit shell.  AMEC recommends that Magma Metals drill angled holes towards the intrusion edges to define the boundaries to improve the confidence in the volume estimate within the pit shell.
- · To date,  the  geological  interpretation  has  been  developed  from  vertical  sections only. AMEC  recommends  that Magma  Metals also develops geological interpretations  and  grade  contours  on  plan-view  slices  through  the  intrusion  to check and support the vertical section interpretation.  AMEC understands that the plan-view interpretations were underway at the Report effective date.

The ultramafic host rock commonly varies gradationally in composition from peridotite to  olivine  melagabbro.    However,  the  different  ultramafic  lithologies  are  similar  in macroscopic appearance. Magma Metals has been successful in applying geochemistry  to  interpret  and  define  internal  lithological  contacts  to  the  ultramafic intrusions.    AMEC  recommends  Magma  Metals  continues  with  these  efforts  as  the delineation and modelling of the ultramafic lithologies will permit more detailed study of

Magma Metals Limited Thunder Bay North Polymetallic Project Ontario, Canada NI 43-101 Technical Report the  relationships  between  lithology  and  grade,  leading  to  a  better  constrained  and more robust mineral resource estimate.

AMEC recommends Magma Metals develops and implements a full geotechnical core logging program  as  soon  as  possible  to  prepare  for future mine  design  and development.

Once the fall 2010 delineation drill program has been completed, and results are to hand, these data and the drill information from the Phase 9 drill campaign should be incorporated  into  updated  geological  interpretations,  and  consideration  be  given  to updating the mineral resource estimate.

## 12.0 SAMPLING METHOD AND APPROACH

## 12.1 Geochemical Sampling

The initial geochemical sampling on the Project area has been superseded by the core data, and is not discussed further.

A test program of HMC and lake sediment surveys was undertaken in 2009.  Samples were typically about 20 kg.

For  the  2010  HMC  program,  sample  media  consisted  of  coarse  sandy  sediment screened in the field to &lt;6 mm in 10-15 kg samples.  A 1-2 kg fine-fraction (&lt;1 mm) sub-sample was also screened and collected at each site.

Lake  bottom  samples  were  acquired  using  a  steel  sediment  corer  following  the sampling protocols of the Ontario Geological Survey.  Approximately 1 kg samples of dark brown organic-rich mud were collected at each station.

## 12.2 Core Sampling

Core  samples  are  taken  on  2 m  intervals  in  rocks  that  are  considered  to  be  nonmineralized.    Mineralized  intersections  are  sampled  on  1 m  intervals.    Both  sample intervals  may  be  irregular  in  the  areas  of  mineralized/non-mineralized  contacts; sampling  in  these  instances  is  left  to  the  judgement  of  the  supervising  geologist. However, every effort is made to have the irregular interval within the non-mineralized core, rather than in the zone of mineralization.

Single samples are not taken.  Samples must be bracketed on either side by at least one  additional  sample  for  a  minimum  of  three  samples.    A  buffer  of  at  least  two samples (4 m) is required to  be  sampled  above  and  below  all  peridotite  and  hybrid intervals  as  well  as  associated  mineralization.    In  zones  of  poor  recovery,  some sample intervals may reach as much as 3 m, or the length of the drill run.

Drill  core  was  received  and  laid  out  for  logging  and  sampling  at  the  core  logging facility.  Core is split into halves using a core saw.  One half of the core is placed into a labelled sample bag; the remaining half is replaced in the core box as a record.

If broken or ground core is encountered, an attempt is made to sample approximately 50% of  the  resulting  mass.    The  interval  is  noted  for  sampling  purposes  as  having been broken or ground.

Magma Metals Limited Thunder Bay North Polymetallic Project Ontario, Canada NI 43-101 Technical Report

Four to six samples are collected into a rice bag; with the rice bags stored in the core cutting  area  until  a  batch  of  about  100  samples  is  ready.    Samples  are  sent  to  the assay laboratory upon completion of the sampling of each drill hole.  If greater than 100 samples are taken from a single  hole,  then  those  samples  are  split  by  Magma Metals staff into multiple batches of 100 samples or less.  Each sample batch is given a unique sample dispatch number and a photocopy of each sample submission sheet is placed within a plastic bag and inserted into the first rice bag of the shipment.

A Magma Metals staff person then drives all of the rice bags containing samples from a  single  core  hole  by  vehicle  to  the  ALS  Chemex  preparation  laboratory  located  in Thunder Bay,  Ontario.    All  samples  remain  in  the  custody  of  appropriately  qualified staff within  a  secure  location  until  given  directly  to  ALS  preparation  laboratory personnel.

## 12.3 Density/Specific Gravity

The  density  database  totals  4,494  measurements  in  mineralized  material,  and  an additional 448 measurements in wall rock.

Initial data were  measured  by  ALS  Chemex  in  Vancouver,  Canada,  using  a pyncnometer;  these  data  were  discarded  and  are  not  used  in  mineral  resource estimation.

Magma Metals personnel completed the remaining specific gravity testwork.  No voids or porous materials were included in the material that was measured.  Samples were conventionally weighed in air and then in water, with the specific gravity calculated via the formula:

SG = Weight in Air (Weight in Air - Weight in Water)

Table 12-1 shows the average specific gravity values for the various lithologies.

A linear regression equation for the density was developed to inform the blocks in the block model, and is discussed in Section 17 of this Report.

## 12.4 Comment on Section 12

A  description  of  the  geology  and  mineralization  of  the  deposit,  which  includes lithologies, geological controls and widths of mineralized zones, is given in Section 7 and Section 9.

A description of the sampling methods, location, type, nature, and spacing of samples collected on the Project is included in Section 10 and Section 12.

A  description  of  the  drilling  programs,  including  sampling  and  recovery  factors,  are included in Section 11 and Section 12.  All collection, splitting, and bagging of core samples  were  carried  out  by  Magma  Metals  personnel.    No  material  factors  were identified with the drilling programs that could affect Mineral Resource estimation.

Figure 11-1 and Figure 11-2, which show drill hole collar locations for the Current Lake and  Beaver  Lake/Bridge  zones  respectively,  indicate  that  the  sizes  of  the  sampled areas are representative of the distribution and orientation of the mineralization.

Figure 7-6 to Figure 7-10 show approximate drill hole collar traces in relation to the orientation of the mineralization.  The figures, using the bar thicknesses depicted on each drill trace, also show drill hole assay intervals include areas of non-mineralized and very low grade mineralization, and confirm that sampling is representative of the base metal, precious metal, and PGE grades in the deposit, reflecting areas of higher and lower grades.

Magma Metals Limited Thunder Bay North Polymetallic Project Ontario, Canada NI 43-101 Technical Report

Data validation of the drilling and sampling program is discussed in Section 14, and includes review of database audit results.

In  the  opinion  of  the  QPs,  the  sampling  methods  are  acceptable,  meet  industrystandard  practice,  and  are  adequate  for  Mineral  Resource  and  Mineral  Reserve estimation and mine planning purposes, based on the following:

- · Data are collected following Project-approved sampling protocols;
- · Sample collection and handling core was undertaken in accordance with industry standard practices, with procedures to limit potential sample losses and sampling biases.  Core handling facilities are suitable for the logging and sampling of drill core;
- · Sample intervals, comprising variable 1 m intervals in mineralized core and 2 m intervals in non-mineralized core, are considered to be adequately representative of the true thicknesses of mineralization.
- · Specific gravity determination  procedures  completed  by  Magma  Metals  are consistent with industry-standard procedures

AMEC notes that Magma Metals currently does not have a set of written procedures for core cutting, handling and chain-of-custody.  AMEC concluded, following a site visit that sample  handling and  custody procedures  were  acceptable  for preventing unintentional  sample  sequence  errors  and  sample  tag  switches;  however,  AMEC recommends  Magma  Metals  develops  and  documents  procedures  for  core  cutting, handling,  and  chain-of-custody  to  prevent  both  accidental  and  intentional  sample manipulation.

AMEC recommends that Magma Metals perform some  wax immersion  test  work  to confirm  that  the  porosity  of  the  rock  has  no  material  impact  on  the  specific  gravity values.

## 13.2 Geochemical Sampling

HMC samples were submitted to Overburden Drilling Management of Ottawa ON for magmatic massive sulphide indicator mineral (MSIM) analysis coupled with platinum group  element  (PGE)  and  gold  screening.    The  fine  fraction  sub-samples  were submitted to ALS Chemex for drying, screening to 180 µm, followed by fire-assay for platinum, palladium and gold (PGM-MS23) and four-acid 'near-total' digestion ICP-MS (ME-ICP61)  for  a  suite  of  33  elements.    Control  samples  including  standards  were inserted into the sample stream for quality control and assurance.

Lake-bottom samples were submitted to ALS Chemex where they were dried in a lowtemperature  oven,  screened  to  180  µm  then  assayed  by  fire-assay  for  platinum  palladium-gold (PGM-MS23) and aqua-regia 'partial' digestion ICP-MS (ME-MS41) for a suite of 33 elements.  Control samples including standards, duplicates and blanks were inserted into the sample stream for quality control and assurance.

No results of the programs are available at the effective date of the Report.

## 13.3 Core Sample Preparation

Sample preparation was performed by Accurassay on initial core holes TBND001 to TBND034 at the Thunder Bay Accurassay laboratory.  All samples were dried prior to any sample preparation.  Once dry, samples were crushed to 90% -8 mesh, split into 250 g to 500 g sub-samples using a Jones Riffler and then pulverized to 90% -150 mesh using a ring and puck pulverizer.  Prior to analysis, samples were homogenized. Silica cleaning was completed between each sample to prevent cross-contamination.

Magma Metals Limited Thunder Bay North Polymetallic Project Ontario, Canada NI 43-101 Technical Report

From  September  2007,  sample  preparation  was  performed  by  ALS  Chemex  in Thunder Bay.  All samples are bar coded on arrival at ALS Chemex for entry in the Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS).  This system provides complete chain-of-custody  records  for  every  stage  in  the  sample  preparation  and  analytical process from the moment that a sample arrives at the laboratory.

On  receipt,  samples  are  weighed,  dried  at  110°C  to  120 ° C,  crushed  using  a  jaw crusher  to  &gt;50%  passing  1 mm,  riffle  split  to  generate  a  250 g  sub-sample,  and pulverized to &gt;85 percent less than 75 µm.

## 13.4 Core Sample Analysis

Sample analysis performed by Accurassay comprised:

- · Method Code AL4APP:   Fire assay with atomic absorption (AA) finish for Au, Pt, Pd with detection limits of 5 ppb, 15 ppb, and 10 ppb respectively.
- · Method  Code  AL4CNC:    Aqua  regia  digest  with  AA  finish  for  Cu,  Ni,  Co  with detection limits of 1 ppm each.

At ALS Chemex, gold, platinum and palladium are analysed using a fire assay with an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) finish (method code: PGMICPMS23).  Detection limits are Au: 0.001 ppm to 1 ppm; Pt:  0.0005 ppm to 1 ppm; and Pd 0.001 ppm to 1 ppm.  Samples that have grades above the optimal ICP-MS detection  limits  are  analysed  using  an  optical  emission  spectroscopy  method  (ICPOES; method code PGM-ICP27 'ore grade').  Detection limits for this method are Au: 0.03 ppm to 100 ppm; Pt:  0.03 ppm to 100 ppm; and Pd 0.03 ppm to 100 ppm.

Multi-element  and  base  metals  are  analyzed  using  a  multi-element  atomic  emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES; method code ME-ICP61) technique following four-acid digest of the sample.  This analytical method reports 33 elements, including silver, chromium, copper, nickel, and cobalt.  Detection limits are summarized in Table 13-1.

When  samples  have  grades  above  the  optimal  detection  limits  for  the  analytical method, they are re-analysed, using an ore-grade method (methods Cu-OG62 and NiOG62.  A similar acid digest to that initially used is performed, followed by either ICPAES or atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS) techniques.  Detection ranges for Cu are 0.001% to 40%; detection ranges for Ni are from 0.001% to 30%.

## 13.5 Quality Assurance and Quality Control

## 13.5.1 Program History

Magma Metals began implementing formal analytical quality control measures when submitting  samples  to  the  primary  laboratory  early  in  the  Project  drill  programs  by inserting a single barren diabase blank and a single standard reference sample into the  sample  stream  for  every  40  samples.    During  mid-2007  the  diabase  blank  was replaced by a silica blank and by the end of 2007 a field duplicate sample was added to  the  quality  control  sample  stream  for  every  40  samples.    In  late  2009,  a  single coarse marble blank was inserted in each sample batch.

During 2008, when submitting samples to the primary laboratory, a second standard reference  material  (SRM)  sample  was  added  to  the  sample  stream  for  every  40 samples.  A minimum of one nickel-copper control sample and one platinum-palladium control sample was required in all sample series within the ultramafic to mafic intrusive rocks.  A qualified geologist decided on which platinum-palladium control sample was to be inserted based on presumed grade of the surrounding material.  Early in 2009, Magma Metals discontinued  use  of  SRMs  and  began  using  only  certified  reference materials (CRMs).

Project No.:  164115 October 2010

<!-- image -->

Magma Metals Limited Thunder Bay North Polymetallic Project Ontario, Canada NI 43-101 Technical Report

Magma Metals initially requested that ALS Chemex send a duplicate pulp sample to Actlabs directly for one in every 33 samples.  In 2009, this was amended to two coarse reject duplicate samples in every 40-sample batch.

## 13.5.2 Current Procedures

Magma Metals geologists follow a documented procedure for the insertion of control samples in the drill core sample stream.  At present the insertion of control samples is based on the following criteria:

- · Interval of ultramafic to mafic intrusive rock with greater than 30 samples:  A CRM, blank (marble,  or duplicate is inserted on every 10th sample in the following order: CRM, blank, CRM, and duplicate.  The cycle repeats every 40 samples thus ensuring that 10% of samples submitted are control samples.
- · Interval of ultramafic to mafic intrusive rock with less than 30 samples:  A minimum of two CRMs and a blank are required for the sample series.  This typically results in greater than 10% control samples for the drill hole.  It is at the discretion of the geologist where to place the control samples within the sequence.  The preference is to have the control samples at even spacings throughout the sequence, such that control samples are never placed back to back within the sample sequence.
- · Sample sequences consisting of hybrid and other non-ultramafic material with less than 30 samples:  A minimum of one control sample (CRM or blank) is required within the sample series.  If possible, control samples are submitted as every 10th sample.
- · A  minimum  of  one  Ni-Cu  CRM  and  one  Pt-Pd  CRM  is  required  in  all  sample series  within  the  ultramafic  to  mafic  intrusive  rocks.    The  qualified  geologist decides on the Pt-Pd CRM to be inserted based the geological interpretation of the presumed grade of the surrounding material.

The insertion procedure results in a minimum of 11% to 12% control sample frequency depending on the length of the sampled interval.  In addition to the control samples 5% of samples are submitted to another assay laboratory, currently Agat Laboratories Ltd., as check assays.

The current CRMs are the AMIS0124 and AMIS0064 standards, produced by African Mineral Standards, an independent laboratory owned by SetPoint Technology, which specialises in multi-metal, matrix-matched, standard reference materials.  Best values for  the  standards  are  based  on  measurement  campaigns  that  used  independent analytical laboratories.

Magma Metals Limited Thunder Bay North Polymetallic Project Ontario, Canada NI 43-101 Technical Report

The  current  blanks  are  the  BL109  powder  and  landscape  marble.    A  certificate  is available for the BL109 standard and Magma Metals has non-certified assays for the marble.

## 13.6 Database

All  Project  data  are  stored  and  maintained  in  the  form  of  a  GBis  database.    OCRIS core logs are designed to be imported into GBis.

Data from logging are manually entered into OCRIS, and then uploaded from OCRIS to the database.    Assays  are  imported  from .sif files provided  by  the  assay laboratories.  Specific gravity data are imported into the database from files where the readings have been manually entered.  The down-hole survey data are exported from the software provided by Reflex Instruments, and then cut-and-pasted into a template that is imported into the database.

The Project database is under the supervision of one database manager who has the knowledge and authority to ensure database integrity.  The data-entry process follows a  well-defined  procedure.    All  data  are  visually  inspected  and  validated  prior  to integration into the Project database by the database manager in Thunder Bay.

## 13.7 Sample Security

Sample security relied upon the fact that the samples were always attended or locked in a sample dispatch facility.  Sample collection and transportation have always been undertaken  by company  personnel  using  company  vehicles.    Chain-of-custody procedures  consisted  of  filling  out  sample  submittal  forms  that  were  sent  to  the laboratory with sample shipments to make certain that all samples were received by the laboratory.

## 13.8 Sample Storage

All core drilled to the end of 2009 is stored within a single, secure, fenced, and gated site in Thunder Bay.  All core drilled since January 1, 2010, is presently stored at the Project  site.    A  fenced  and  gated  storage  facility  at  the  Project  site  is  in  the  early construction stage and all stockpiled core will be moved to the new secure facility by year-end, 2010.

All  Project coarse rejects are stored within Magma's fenced, gated, and secure core storage facility in Thunder Bay.  All Project pulps are stored within a locked storage container stored within a gated compound in Thunder Bay.

Magma Metals Limited Thunder Bay North Polymetallic Project Ontario, Canada NI 43-101 Technical Report

## 13.9 Comment on Section 13

In  the  opinion  of  the  QPs,  the  following  conclusions  can  be  reached  for  the  sample preparation, analysis, QA/QC and sample security aspects of the Project:

- · Drill sampling has been appropriately spaced to first define, then infill, base metal and PGE anomalies to produce prospect-scale and deposit-scale drill data.
- · Sample preparation for core samples has followed a similar procedure since September 2007.  Preparation procedures since September 2007 are in line with industry-standard methods, and suitable for the magmatic sulphide deposit style
- · Sample preparation, analytical and QA/QC procedures have been undertaken by independent laboratories over the duration of the drilling programs
- · QA/QC programs comprised insertion of blank, duplicate and SRM, later CRM, samples.  During the 2009 site visit, AMEC noted that 'pulp duplicates should be inserted into the sample stream at the laboratory.  This check is important as it provides the best opportunity for determining precision analysis at the final stage of sample preparation.  If the volume of pulp is insufficient to support the testing, AMEC recommends Magma Metals request to ALS Chemex to make up sufficient fine pulp to perform the insertion.'  Magma Metals requested the change of ALS Chemex, and advised AMEC that as of the Report effective date, such pulps were being included in the sample stream.
- · The QA/QC program results do not indicate any problems with the analytical programs, therefore the analyses from the core drilling are suitable for inclusion in Mineral Resource estimation
- · Data incorporated in databases have been checked for errors, and the database is considered sufficiently error-free to support Mineral Resource estimation
- · Sample security has relied upon the fact that the samples were always attended or locked in appropriate sample storage areas prior to dispatch to the sample preparation facility.  Chain-of-custody procedures consist of filling out sample submittal forms that are sent to the laboratory with sample shipments to make certain that all samples are received by the laboratory
- · Current sample storage procedures and storage areas are consistent with industry standards.

## 14.0 DATA VERIFICATION

Data verification programs were performed by SRK Consulting in 2009, in support of a first-time mineral resource estimate, and in 2010, by AMEC, in support of an updated estimate and scoping-level studies.

## 14.1 SRK (2009)

SRK visited the Project site in 2008-2009, and during the visits:

- · Interviewed Project personnel on all aspects of the field programs
- · Reviewed drill core from several bore holes intersecting sulphide mineralization in all areas of the sulphide deposits.  SRK noted that logging information accurately reflected the actual drill core.  Lithology and sulphide mineralization contacts checked by SRK matched the information reported in the drill logs, and the boundaries of the sulphide mineralization zones examined in core matched the boundaries determined from assay results
- · Visited the site of the original boulder discoveries on Current Lake and various outcrop exposures to ascertain the geological setting of the project area
- · Inspected  the  data  entry  procedures  used  to  create,  maintain  and  update  the exploration database

SRK conducted a series of routine verifications to ensure the reliability of the electronic data provided by Magma Metals.  These verifications include auditing the electronic data against original paper assay certificate records.  Approximately 2% of the assay data were audited for accuracy.  No data entry errors were noted.  In the opinion of SRK, the electronic data were reliable, appropriately documented, and exhaustive.

SRK reviewed available QA/QC data, with the following noted:

The performance of the control samples inserted with samples submitted for assaying was  acceptable.    A  few  potential  failures  identified  in  the  dataset  relate  to  sample mislabelling and were investigated by Magma Metals.

The performance of the certified CDN Resource Laboratories reference materials was considered  acceptable,  with  ALS  Chemex  analytical  results  typically  within  one standard  deviation.    The  performance  of  the  SRM  from  Geo  Labs  Geoscience Laboratories  was  considered  passable.    SRK  noted  that  over  one  quarter  of  LDI-2 samples assayed fell below two standard deviations for palladium with an expected value  of  3.04  ppm;  this  could  indicate  ALS  Chemex  has  difficulty  in  accurately

Project No.:  164115 October 2010

Magma Metals Limited Thunder Bay North Polymetallic Project Ontario, Canada NI 43-101 Technical Report assaying higher  Pd  grades.    Likewise,  copper  and  nickel  values  for  LDI-2  generally consistently fall below the expected value and two standard deviations.  The second standard, PGMS-9, performed very well.

Due to a shortage in reference materials with adequate PGE values, Magma Metals created  or  acquired  various  non-certified  standards  labelled  ESB-A,  ESB-B,  ESB-C and APG6.  The ESB series were created from olivine melagabbro boulders found at three separate sites along Current Lake or frost heaved in the area; the APG samples were from local boulders, but the SRM was prepared by Accurassay.  SRK concluded that,  as  expected,  the  non-certified  field  control  samples  yielded  a  broader  range  of values reflecting non-homogenous samples and/or poorly defined expected values and standard deviations.

Paired assay data produced by ALS Chemex and examined by SRK suggested that platinum, palladium, gold, silver, copper, nickel and cobalt grades could be reasonably reproduced.  The variance of field duplicate sample pairs is higher than laboratory pulp replicate  paired  data,  and  the  laboratory  pulp  replicate  sample  pairs  show  better reproducibility.

Check assay paired data suggested that the umpire laboratory (Actlabs) was able to reasonably  reproduce  the  assay  results  from  the  primary  laboratory  ALS  Chemex. Most  minor  discrepancies  appeared  at  lower  grades,  especially  approaching  the detection limit.  SRK noted that no external SRMs were submitted to Actlabs.  In the opinion  of  SRK,  the  analytical  results  delivered  by  ALS  and  Accurassay  were sufficiently reliable for the purpose of mineral resource estimation.

## 14.2 AMEC, 2010

## 14.2.1 Site Visits

Greg Kulla of AMEC visited the Magma Metals Thunder Bay office and Thunder Bay North Project exploration camp during the week of November 23 to 27, 2009.  During the site visit, he reviewed a number of activities and processes related to the drilling program, core logging, core sampling, geological interpretation and data management. From April 12 to 15, 2010, Peter Oshurst, also of AMEC, and under the direction of Mr Kulla, visited the site and reviewed the drill program.

## Drill Rig Inspection

The  winter  drilling  program  was  in  full  operation  at  the  time  of  AMEC's  visit  to  the exploration  camp.    Four  drills  contracted  from  George  Downing  Estate  Drilling  were actively  drilling  within  the  Bridge  Zone  and  Beaver  Lake  Zone  areas.    Drilling  was

Project No.:  164115 October 2010

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Magma Metals Limited Thunder Bay North Polymetallic Project Ontario, Canada NI 43-101 Technical Report being  completed  in  a  professional  manner  in  accordance  with  industry  accepted practices.

## Field Collar Survey Check

AMEC checked the collar locations of 44 drill holes  in  the  Bridge  Zone  and  Beaver Lake deposit with a Magellan Explorist 210 handheld GPS during the visit.

Of  the  44  core  hole  collar  locations  checked,  12  had  final  survey  pick  ups  by  J.  D. Barnes.  Another 11 collars were picked up by the Magma Metals geologists with the differential GPS system (DGPS).  The remaining drill holes had only the planned coordinates recorded in the Project database.  J.D. Barnes was scheduled to pick up all the drill collars shortly after the completion of the winter drilling program in mid-2010.

No  misplaced  holes  were  observed  among  the  checked  collars.    The  horizontal differences  of  collar  positions  surveyed  by  J.D.  Barnes  compared  to  AMEC  GPS readings are within the error of the handheld GPS (4 m to 7 m).  The same was true of collars located using the handheld differential GPS. The average horizontal difference of  collar  positions  surveyed  by  theodolite  compared  to  the  AMEC  handheld  GPS  is 2.8 m.  AMEC considers the collar survey methods and accuracy to be good, based on these checks.

## Collar Monumenting

Completed drill hole collars are monumented with drill casing extensions and capped with heavy gauge aluminium screw tops inscribed with the drill hole number.  The drill casing extensions are required to be tall enough to be visible through snow cover to ensure that they can be located in winter.

Magma Metals reported that all drill holes on the lakes were cemented to the collar. Magma Metals records the existence of down-hole obstructions such as lost drill rods in  the  Project  database.    AMEC  is  of  the  opinion  that  the  drill  hole  abandonment procedures are in line with industry norms.

## Geological Logging

AMEC checked core from eight drill holes stored on site against paper print-outs of geological core logs for the holes.  There is some inconsistency in picking the contacts between gradational units such as the altered partial melt granitoid and the hybrid or between the  ultramafic  units.    In  addition,  there  is  some  inconsistency  in  the  visual estimates of sulphides.  The estimates provide an indication of prospective grade and are used only until assays are returned.  AMEC considers these inconsistencies to be

Project No.:  164115 October 2010

<!-- image -->

Magma Metals Limited Thunder Bay North Polymetallic Project Ontario, Canada NI 43-101 Technical Report minor  as  the  lithological  classification  and  metal  content  can  both  be  determined quantitatively from metal and whole rock analyses.

AMEC recommends Magma Metals develops suite of representative reference cores for  the  Project  lithologies  and  mineralization  types  for  reference,  so  as  to  improve consistency  in  rock  type  nomenclature  and  estimation  of  percentage  of  sulphide minerals.

## Geotechnical Core Logging

Apart from collection of recovery and RQD data in selected intervals of selected core holes,  no  comprehensive  geotechnical  logging  program  has  taken  place.    AMEC recommends Magma Metals develops and implements a full geotechnical core logging program to prepare for mine design and development.

## Hydrogeological Core Logging

No hydrogeological core logging is currently being carried out for the Project.  AMEC observed  numerous  joints  and  structures  in  core  that  exhibited  evidence  of  the presence of ground water transmission in the drill core, especially in the core from the Bridge Zone.  These included weathered and vuggy core near fractures and evidence of other small cavities lined with late euhedral pyrite or marcasite crystals.  The waterbearing structures are likely  to  act  as  conduits  for  surface  and  sub-surface  water  to enter  mine  workings.    It  is  important  that  for  future,  more  detailed  studies,  Magma Metals and its consultants understand the hydrogeological system, and have incorporated  into  mine  design  a  capacity  to  act  upon  potential  water  inflows  if warranted.

AMEC  recommends  the  development  and  implementation  of  hydrogeological  core logging procedures to be undertaken in conjunction with geotechnical core logging.

## Density (Specific Gravity) Determinations

AMEC observed the Magma Metals geologists measuring the specific gravity (SG) of core pieces using the water immersion method. Pieces of whole drill core approximately 15 cm to 20 cm long are weighed in air and water to estimate the SG. Samples are taken for every grade sample interval and every 10 m in non-mineralized ground.  A reference standard of clean quartz vein material as whole core is weighed after every tenth sample.

Moisture  content  is  not  measured.    The  core  samples  are  not  sealed,  with  wax  for instance, to prevent water uptake into voids during immersion.

Project No.:  164115 October 2010

Magma Metals Limited Thunder Bay North Polymetallic Project Ontario, Canada NI 43-101 Technical Report

AMEC recommends Magma Metals sends 20 samples per mineralized rock type and major country rock type likely to be mined to an independent laboratory for moisture and wax immersion testing to support the data from Magma Metals' own testing.

## 14.2.2 Database Verification

AMEC  reviewed  the  database  construction,  performed  checks  to  confirm  internal consistency, and audited portions of the assay and lithology tables.  Each table and the verification procedures are discussed in the following sub-sections.

## Collar Table

The collar  table  contains  location  data  for  the  collars  of  the  drill  holes.      The  collar locations  were  compared  to  a  listing  of  collar  locations  provided  by  the  surveying contractor.  AMEC noted one discrepancy in a northing for one hole and a number of discrepancies  in  elevations  that  turned  out  to  be  due  to  the  fact  that  the  top  of  the casing had been surveyed, and the final table did not reflect the difference between the casing elevation and the ground surface elevation.  No other discrepancies were noted.

Subsequently, Magma Metals staff made the adjustments and provided the corrected table to AMEC for the purposes of the mineral resource estimate.

## Down-hole Survey Table

Original  data  for  down-hole  surveys  were not provided to AMEC.  AMEC performed checks  for  internal  consistency  using  proprietary  software  and  manual  checks.    A number of issues were identified and are discussed in the section on QA/QC (refer to Section 14.2.3).

## Assay Data

AMEC retrieved the Project data directly from ALS Chemex using Webtrieve using the user name and password provided by Magma Metals.  AMEC then compiled the data into a new database and compared that database to the database provided by Magma Metals.  This allowed AMEC to audit approximately 83% of the assay data.

Accurassay  data  were  not  audited.    A  total  of  22  holes  were  involved  (3.5%  of  the assays) and only one was in material that may be considered mineralized.

AMEC noted a number of discrepancies between the compiled assay data and those provided by Magma (Table 14-1).

Those discrepancies, with rare exception, are believed to result from missing assay certificates in AMEC's compilation.  The missing certificates are believed by AMEC to represent the results returned during QA/QC reassaying.  The results in the Magma Metals  data  are  within  a  few  relative  percent  of  the  results  in  AMEC's  compilation leading  to  that  conclusion.    AMEC  did  note  five  errors  that  are  not  explained  by missing assay certificates.  Two errors resulted from swapped samples and three are unexplained.  The error rate (0.11%) is very small and is considered to be acceptable, as  the  errors  will  have  no  significant  impact  on  subsequent  resource  estimation. AMEC  is  of  the  opinion  that  the  assay  data  are  acceptable  to  support  resource estimation.

## Lithology Data

AMEC compared 14 original drill logs to the entries in the database.  There are a large number of discrepancies that appear to be undocumented re-interpretation of lithology codes.    AMEC  has  discussed  this  with  Magma  Metals  and  the  database  indeed contains updated lithology codes.  It is normal for lithology codes to evolve as a Project advances; AMEC's only concern is that there is little in the way of documentation for the changed codes.

Most of the lithology codes are not used in the geological model where the ultramafic body  is  outlined  by  wire  frames.    The  re-interpreted  codes  are  consistent  with  the descriptions of the new codes and are believed by AMEC to be adequate to support resource estimation.

However,  AMEC  recommends  that  Magma  Metals  implement  a  procedure  for documenting any changes made in lithology codes.

## 14.2.3 Quality Assurance and Quality Control - Drilling

## Collar Surveying

AMEC is unaware of any collar survey QA/QC procedures.

## Down-hole Surveying

AMEC first used a proprietary program to identify any unusual bends ('kinks') in the down-hole survey trajectories.  For this review, AMEC set the limit of deviation at 3  in o 20 m which is a moderate change in the trajectory of the hole.  Table 14-2 summarizes findings.  Only drill hole, BL09-134 could be considered to be outside of the tolerance limits; however, this drill hole does not intersect significant mineralization.

As many as five different down-hole survey instruments were utilized for the purposes of  this  work  including  Reflex  EZ-Shot,  Reflex  MaxiBor  II,  Reflex  Gyro,  Radtool,  and Theodolite for the collar orientation.

AMEC  reviewed  the  down-hole  surveys  manually  looking  for  inconsistent  dips  or azimuth  directions.    Inclinations  appear  to  be  consistent  between  down-hole  survey methods.  Azimuths, on the other hand, appear to vary between methods.

AMEC compiled twin survey data from a number of holes where Reflex EZ Shot and Maxibor, Radtool, or Reflex Gyro data were available.  These data indicate that there may be a  serious  bias  between  the  Reflex  and  Radtool  tools  and  other  tool  types. Figures 14-1 and Figure 14-2 illustrate the biases.

Note:  MAXI2 = Maxibor

For dips, there are few biases and, in most cases, dips are indistinguishable between survey types.  Azimuths are different.  The largest bias is between the Radtool and the Maxibor tool.  This discrepancy appears to be on the order of 10  which is believed by o AMEC  to  be  unreasonable.    Radtool  data  were  only  used  for  seven  holes  in  the resource estimate and of those, only TBND-001 was significantly mineralized.  That mineralization was shallow, and a small bias in the azimuth will have little impact on the location of the mineralization.  The bias in the Radtool thus appears to have an insignificant impact on the mineral resource estimate.

There appears to be a 5-7  bias between Reflex and Maxibor surveys but the biases o are  not  consistent  between  holes.    AMEC  notes  that  the  Reflex  tool  sometimes exhibits erratic behavior (refer to Figure 14-1 and Figure 14-2).  From the data, AMEC suspects that the problem is caused by magnetite in the wall rock, but cannot confirm that.

Approximately 376 holes were surveyed with a Reflex tool.  Of those, 338 are vertical or  near-vertical  holes  where  azimuth  deviations  are  minimal.    In  the  case  of  erratic behavior  of  the  Reflex  tool,  incorrect  deviations  will  have  little  or  no  impact  on  the location of mineralization because the holes remain vertical and changes in azimuth have little impact on the trajectory of the hole.  AMEC anticipates little impact on the mineral resource estimate from these holes.

AMEC found 38 angle holes in the database that were surveyed with a Reflex tool.  Of those,  only  eight  intersected  significant  mineralization  and  most  were  scattered  lowgrade  material.    If  the  bias  is  5-7 ,  the  location  of  mineralization  in  holes  BL08-68, o BL08-16 and BL08-09 would be impacted and would have a small, local impact on the mineral  resource  estimate.    The  other  angle  holes  (35  total)  have  no  impact  on  the mineral  resource  estimate  because  they  are  largely  waste  and  do  not  provide information about the location of the mineralized bodies.

Magma Metals Limited Thunder Bay North Polymetallic Project Ontario, Canada NI 43-101 Technical Report

Although  AMEC  noted  possible  biases  between  the  different  types  of  down-hole survey tools, the impact of those biases on the mineral resource estimate are believed to be minimal.  AMEC recommends that the source of the biases be investigated and eliminated, if  possible.  All  of  the  down-hole  survey  tools  used  by  the  Project  are  in common use in the industry and typically do not exhibit biases.

## 14.2.4 Quality Assurance and Quality Control - Sample Preparation

AMEC did not review any QA/QC data for sample preparation procedures; AMEC does not consider that this presents a risk to the mineral resource estimate.

## 14.2.5 Quality Assurance and Quality Control - Assay QA/QC

Magma Metals routinely inserted blank, standard, and coarse duplicate samples into the sample stream to monitor quality control (Magma Metals, 2010).  The QA/QC data were  monitored  closely and  remedial  action taken when  results were  outside acceptable limits.

## Blank Samples

Blanks  are  inserted  at  a  rate  of  about  one  in  twenty  samples,  or  more.    AMEC reviewed the data using control charts similar to Figure 14-3.  Table 14-3 summarizes the  number of blank failures.  The failure rates (5 x lower  detection limit)  are  within expected  limits;  however,  minor  contamination  is  indicated  by  the  results.    AMEC believes that the level of contamination is not significant and will not adversely impact the mineral resource estimate.  Cu and Ni appear to be infrequently contaminated to a level  of  about  50  ppm  which  is  not  significant.    Blanks  BL  109,  Marble,  and  Silica appear to have a Cu background of about 15 ppm.  Blank Marble has a Ni background of about 10 ppm and an erratic S value which may be due to sulphides or sulphates in the Marble.  No contamination or background values were noted for precious metals.

## Standard Samples

Results  of  the  review  of  the  standards  and  best  values  for  the  standards  are summarized in Table 14-4. Standards were inserted at a rate of approximately one in 15 samples.  The insertion rate is appropriate.  AMEC reviewed the data on quality control  charts  similar  to  Figure  14-4  to  evaluate  possible  biases,  trends  to  the  data, and to identify standard results that were considered to be failures.  AMEC considers a result to have failed if that result is outside three standard deviations from the mean of the data.  No significant trends were noted in any of the data and the failure rate was considered acceptable.  AMEC compared the failed samples identified in this exercise to the failed results logged by Magma and the results were consistent.

AMEC noted a number of biases (Table 14-5) that are outside AMEC's acceptance level of ±5%.  Most of the results that are outside the limit are due to the low grade of the samples and are not considered by AMEC to be a significant problem.

Magma Metals Limited Thunder Bay North Polymetallic Project Ontario, Canada NI 43-101 Technical Report

## Duplicate Samples

Duplicate  samples  are  analyzed  to  monitor  precision  in  the  analytical  process, including sample preparation.  Magma Metals routinely analyzed quarter-core samples as  a  coarse  duplicate.    These  samples  provide  information  about  the  geological variance of the mineralization and possible sampling bias.  AMEC received no data for pulp duplicate samples which are normally used to monitor analytical precision.

AMEC uses graphical and other methods to evaluate the precision of duplicate sample pairs which are based on the absolute relative difference (ARD) between the duplicate results where ARD is defined as:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

and where a and b are the samples in the sample pair.

Because the precision near the lower detection limit is generally +100%, values used for this plot are restricted to those that are more than 30 times the lower detection limit. Precision estimates for the assays in question are standardized at the 90 th percentile of the ARD for samples with average grades &gt;30 times the lower detection limit.

AMEC  also  reviewed  the  data  for  duplicate  pairs  that  had  one  assay  that  was considered  to  be  an  outlier,  in  other  words,  precision  for  the  pair  was  outside reasonable  limits.    Figure  14-5  is  an  example  of  the  plots  used  to  identify  failed duplicate  results.    Estimated  precision  is  summarized  in  Table  14-6.    The  precision estimates  in  Table  14-6  are  based  on  field  duplicates  only.    Precision  is  typically measured using pulp duplicates which were not part of Magma's QA/QC program until late September 2010.

* LDL - Lower Detection Limit

AMEC also  used  duplicate  data  to  estimate  a  lower  detection  limit  (LDL).    Coarse materials are not ideal for that purpose; however, the estimated values are generally close to the reported values and are adequate to support resource estimation.

Magma Metals Limited Thunder Bay North Polymetallic Project Ontario, Canada NI 43-101 Technical Report

In summary, considering that these are coarse (quarter-core) duplicate samples:

- · Ag and Cu are somewhat outside the ±25% that AMEC considers a reasonable limit.
- · For Ag, it is not clear from the data what the problem really is.  Part of it is the fact that the lower detection limit (LDL) is about 0.5 ppm and only 3 data pairs exceed 30 x LDL.
- · For Cu, the effective LDL is about 10 ppm which is 10x that reported by the laboratories.  This is largely due to the poor precision at this concentration.  When 10 ppm is used for the LDL, precision is about 26.5% which is still outside AMEC limits, but is close.
- · If either Ag or Cu become a significant contributor to the revenues of the deposit, the sample preparation procedures should be investigated with the goal of improving precision for these two elements.
- · All other elements are within AMEC limits for precision for coarse duplicate samples.
- · AMEC evaluated the LDL for each element except S.  Ag, Au, Co, and Ni are very close to the values indicated by the laboratories.
- · Effective LDL for Pd and Pt are somewhat higher than indicated by laboratories, but are reasonable for Pd and Pt.

AMEC  concludes  that  it  is  difficult  to  accurately  determine  the  precision  for  all elements using the field duplicates and recommends that the inclusion of within-batch pulp duplicates be instigated as part of any future QA/QC procedures. A retroactive pulp  check program is warranted to better understand the precision associated with the samples.

## 14.2.6 Quality Assurance and Quality Control - Density (Specific Gravity)

AMEC is unaware of wax coated water immersion checks being completed to allow an assessment of the possible impact of porosity on the determined SG.  Due to the low porosity  of  the  rock  the  risk  associated  with  this  is  considered  to  be  low.    AMEC recommends that a wax coated water immersion program be undertaken and that one in 20 samples be sent to a second laboratory for verification analyses.

## 14.3 Comment on Section 14

The  process  of  data  verification  for  the  Project  has  been  performed  by  AMEC  and SRK, consultants who are independent of Magma Metals.

Project No.:  164115 October 2010

Magma Metals Limited Thunder Bay North Polymetallic Project Ontario, Canada NI 43-101 Technical Report

Conclusions and recommendations arising from the data verification programs include the following.

The  collar,  assay,  and  lithology  data  are  adequate  to  support  mineral  resource estimation.  AMEC noted some opportunities for improvements in all of these tables that should be addressed prior to completion of detailed Project studies.

Identified discrepancies in the down-hole survey data are troublesome.  AMEC cannot ascertain,  from  the  data  provided,  which  type  of  down-hole  survey  is  accurately measuring  the  azimuth  of  the  hole.    Most  of  the  discrepancies  will  only  result  in location discrepancies of a few meters (&lt;10 m), at most, but some discrepancies may be larger.  The biases between the survey types result in significant uncertainty as to the location of the holes.

As  a  result,  AMEC  believes  that  the  data  are  useable,  but  will  restrict  resource classification below about 100 m to the Inferred classification, at best, in the area of angled drill holes because of the uncertainty of the location of the information.  Vertical holes  are  not  so  dependent  on  azimuth  corrections  and  will  not  be  affected  by  this restriction.  The data will support a scoping (preliminary assessment) study but should be investigated and corrected prior to undertaking a pre-feasibility study.

Analytical  QA/QC  data  indicate  that  the  assay  data  are  sufficiently  accurate  and precise to support mineral resource estimation.  Additional data such as pulp duplicate data  would  allow  for  more  reliable  estimates  of  precision  and  lower  detection  limits. AMEC notes that Magma Metals have commenced addition of pulp duplicates to the sample stream with the current drill program.

The QPs, who rely upon this work, have reviewed the appropriate reports, and are of the opinion that the data verification programs undertaken on the data collected from the Project adequately support, with the qualifications noted, the geological interpretations, the analytical and database quality, and therefore support the use of the data in mineral resource estimation.

## 16.0 MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING

Testwork was performed by the following metallurgical testwork facilities:

- · SGS Canada, Lakefield, ON (SGS Lakefield)
- · G&amp;T Metallurgical Services, Kamloops, BC (G&amp;T)

Both facilities are independent of Magma Metals, and are recognised testing facilities, although not certified; this is typical for metallurgical testing facilities.

At the signature date of this Report, metallurgical testwork was ongoing at G&amp;T, with results of the work expected toward the end of 2010.

## 16.1 Test Materials

A  main  composite  feed  sample  was  used  for  the  majority  of  the  flotation  testwork, mineralogical  studies,  and  gravity  testwork  completed  to  date.    This  sample  was composited from quarter-core, which was selected from areas that were considered likely  to  be  mined  in  the  first  few  years  of  operation  and  consists  mainly  of  average grade  material  from  the  south  half  of  the  Current  Lake  Zone  and  from  the  western Bridge Zone.  This material has a feed grade of about 2.5 g/t combined Pt + Pd, which is consistent with the average grade of the deposit.

Variability studies were undertaken on six samples selected to provide a representation of the likely mineralization types and grade ranges within the deposit:

- · A very low-grade sample (0.7 Diss)
- · A low-grade sample (1.5 Diss)
- · A high-grade non-net-textured sample (5 Diss)
- · Two high-grade net-textured samples (10 Matrix and 20 Matrix)
- · A Cloud Zone sample (Cloud).

For  grindability  tests,  more  coarse  material  was  selected,  and  comprised  half-core samples, boulder material, and a variability sample.

Magma Metals performed the sample selections, with AMEC reviewing the proposed material choices.

## 16.2 Grindability Tests (SGS Canada)

Three samples were received at the SGS Lakefield facility for comminution tests as follows:

- · SMC testwork:  SMC is a laboratory-based comminution test developed by Dr Steve Morrell as a cost-effective means of providing accurate data on the breakage characteristics of rock samples which can be used for a range of purposes including comminution circuit design and optimization, ore body profiling, geometallurgical modelling and mine-to-mill studies.
- · SPI® tests:  Minnovex semi-autogenous grind (SAG) power index, used to predict throughput of a mineralization type in a proposed grinding circuit.  The total time taken to grind a charge to a specified product size is used to relate the grinding characteristics of a particular mineralization to a large database of other materials, from which the performance of a proposed mill can be estimated.
- · Bond low-energy impact tests:  a particle test in which rocks are subjected to increasingly higher energy levels until they fracture.
- · Bond rod mill tests and Bond ball mill grindability tests:  semi-continuous (locked cycle) tests.  The Bond rod mill work index is used to determine the power draw or energy consumption to rod mill a test sample.  The Bond ball mill work index is used to determine the power draw or energy consumption to ball mill a test sample.
- · Bond abrasion test:  used to determine the abrasiveness of a test sample.  The index is used by crusher and mill engineers to determine wear rates of liners.

The results are summarized in Table 16-1.

The samples fell in the moderately hard to hard range of hardness for all the indices. The Main sample was mildly abrasive.

## 16.3 Flotation and Gravity Concentration (G&amp;T)

Flotation  testwork  by  G&amp;T  on  the  'Main  Sample'  (composite)  identified  a  flowsheet comprising:

- · Ball mill grinding to a P80 of 86 µm
- · Non-sulphide hydrophobic gangue pre-flotation (inert gas, frother)
- · Rougher iron sulphide-PGM flotation (inert gas, copper sulphate, xanthate, talc depressant)
- · Ni-Cu rougher flotation (air, additional collector and depressant)
- · Three stages of cleaning.

The conceptual process flowsheet is illustrated in Figure 16-1.

Results of a locked cycle test with this flowsheet (average recoveries from the fourth and fifth cycles) on the composite sample selected to be representative of the deposit are tabulated in Table 16-2, with the mineral resource assumptions for metal recovery where applicable.

Differences in the table between the actual recoveries from testwork and those used to constrain the mineral resource estimate (refer to Section 17) are based on the date of availability of supporting data.  The target percentages used for the mineral resource estimate were based on preliminary data available as of January 2010, whereas the actual  testwork  recovery  figures  are  based  on  testwork  results  available  as  of  July 2010.

For  copper  and  silver,  the  achieved  recoveries  are  very  close  to  the  pre-test assumptions.  For nickel and cobalt, there is-to date-poor definition of the relative amounts  of sulphide and  non-sulphide (includes silicate, carbonate and  basic sulphates/chlorides)  mineralization;  total  sulphur  recovery  suggests  (but  does  not confirm)  that  sulphide  Ni  +  Co  recoveries  may  be  in  the  80%  range.    Platinum, palladium,  and  gold  recoveries  were  slightly  (Ag,  Pd)  to  significantly  (Au,  Pt)  above target.

Results of a preliminary gravity concentration test (Knelson concentrator, pan cleanup) indicate  potential  for  significant  (up  to  40%)  recovery  of  gold  to  a  gravity  preconcentrate.    On  this  basis,  a  Knelson  concentrator  is  likely  to  be  included  in  the preliminary flowsheet.

Results of variability tests on two higher-grade samples indicate significantly better pay metal recoveries to bulk concentrates at approximately the same Cu + Ni and sulphide grades.  Test results from one lower-grade variability sample indicated slightly lower recovery at equivalent grade.

Overall, test results are considered to generally support the achievability of the metal recoveries used to constrain the resource model.

## 17.0 MINERAL RESOURCE AND MINERAL RESERVE ESTIMATES

The  mineral  resource  estimate  was  prepared  by  Peter  Oshust,  MAusIMM,  Tomasz Postolski,  P.  Eng.  and  Christo  Marais,  AMEC  employees,  under  the  supervision  of David  Thomas,  P.Geo.,  M.AusIMM.,  also  an  AMEC  employee.    Mr  Thomas  is  the Qualified Person for the estimate.

## 17.1 Database

The current resource estimate is supported by 528 core holes (97,676 m) from which over 28,600 samples were collected and analyzed.  A total of 22,698 samples were considered in the exploratory data analysis envelope.  Of the 528 core holes, four of the  core  holes  provide  only  proximal  information  used  to  inform  the  geological interpretation.    The  data  cut-off  date  for  data  used  to  inform  the  mineral  resource estimate is May 31, 2010.

## 17.2 Block Models

The resource database was subdivided into two groups: data for the area considered amenable for open pit mining and the remainder to be considered for exploitation from underground.

Two block models were created: one for the area considered amenable for open pit mining and one for the area to be considered for exploitation from underground.  The block  models  are  regular  block  models  without  sub-blocks  or  percent  models.    The models overlap, allowing for flexibility in when designing the position of the interface between the planned underground and planned open pit operations.

The dimensions of the open pit and underground block models are provided in Table 17-1, and illustrated in Figures 17-1 and 17-2.

Table 17-1: Thunder Bay North Project Mineral Resource Estimate Block Model Dimensions

| Model       | Origin   | Origin    | Block Size (m)   | Block Size (m)   | Block Size (m)   | Block Size (m)   | Count   | Count   | Count   |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|---------|---------|---------|
|             | X        | Y         | Z                | X                | Y                | Z                | Columns | Rows    | Levels  |

The block model block dimensions were chosen to achieve high geological resolution while taking into consideration mine planning and input data geometry.  The vertical block height is a factor of the preliminary planned mining bench height of 5.0 m which anticipates sub-benches or flitches of 2.5 m.  The open pit block model lateral block dimensions  were  chosen  as  a  factor  of  drill  hole  spacing  on  section  and,  as  a reasonable size for the drill hole section spacing.  The X and Y block dimensions are matching to accommodate the variability in the shape of the ultramafic chonolith.

Magma Metals Limited Thunder Bay North Polymetallic Project Ontario, Canada NI 43-101 Technical Report

The  underground  block  model  block  dimensions  were  chosen  to  achieve  high geological resolution, for suitability to the underground  mining methods  being considered, and for grade composite spacing.  The long axis of the block dimension of 10  m  was  selected  as  appropriate  for  the  nominal  section  spacing  of  50  m  in  the Beaver Lake area.

## 17.3 Wire-frame Modelling

Wire-frame models representing topographical, geological and grade shell boundaries were  generated  in  commercially-available  Gemcom  GEMS  and  MineSight  software from available drill hole data and digitized interpretations provided by Magma Metals staff.

There are 49 vertical sections in the Current Lake Zone, 12 in the Bridge Zone and 17 in the Beaver  Lake  Zone. The  vertical drill sections are generally oriented perpendicular to the ultramafic intrusion.  Three areas of the Current Lake Zone were drilled  with  fans  of  angled  holes  from  one  location  to  resolve  complex  geological interpretations.

The envelope of the ultramafic intrusion provides the main geological boundary as well as the zero cut-off boundaries for the low-grade shell used for grade estimation.  The purpose of the high-grade-shell model (high-grade shell) is to provide a hard boundary to constrain  the  grade  estimate  to  mitigate  smoothing  during  estimation.    The topographical and wall rock geological boundaries are used for resource modelling and mine planning.

## 17.3.1 Geology Model

The mineralized ultramafic chonolith in the Current Lake Zone was modelled using two sets  of  polygons  in  GEMS  software:  the  vertical  section  polygons  interpreted  by Magma  and  a  second  set  of  polygons  created  by  AMEC.    AMEC  interpreted  the second set of polygons on plan-view slices spaced 10 m apart through the Current Lake Zone to constrain the model of the intrusion in the plan-view dimension.

The  ultramafic  intrusion  in  the  Bridge  and  Beaver  Lake  Zones  was  modelled  in MineSight software from the vertical section polygons provided by Magma combined with  several  polygons  interpreted  by  AMEC.    Wire-frame  surfaces  were  created between  each  adjacent  polygon  and  then  merged  into  a  single,  closed  wire-frame. The  intrusive  complex  is  open  to  the  south  and  east  directions  in  the  Beaver  Lake Zone.  The surface trace of the geophysical magnetic anomaly provided the limits to

Magma Metals Limited Thunder Bay North Polymetallic Project Ontario, Canada NI 43-101 Technical Report constrain the model in the south.  The model was not extended past the easternmost vertical section at 358700 E.

The sub-vertical boundary between the non-mineralized metamorphosed granitic and sedimentary  country  rocks  was  modelled  as  a  wire-frame  in  GEMS  from  drill  core boundary intersections.  Where no data were available, the surface was projected in the plane of the boundary surface to the limits of the block models.

The non-mineralized Hybrid rocks and minor intrusive rocks were not wire-framed for the purposes of the 2010 resource model.

Narrow intervals of mineralized granitic, meta-sedimentary and, Hybrid rocks in contact with  the  ultramafic  host  rocks  were  modelled  as  ultramafic  rocks  and  grouped  as mineralized ultramafic rocks.

## 17.3.2 Grade-shell Models

Five  grade-shell  models  were  developed,  two  for  the  open  pit  area,  two  for  the underground area, and a massive sulphide model (Table 17-2).  All fall within the area of  the  geological  shape  of  the  ultramafic  body.    Shell  boundaries  are  illustrated  in Figure 17-3.

Table 17-2:  Grade Shell Constraints

| Model                                                            | Model Name              | Constraint/Boundary                |
|------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Ultramafic geological envelope                                   | Ultramafic              | Corresponds to 0 g/t Pt            |
| Low-grade envelope (area of  probable open pit exploitation)     | Low-grade open pit      | 0 g/t Pt to 0.25 g/t Pt            |
| High-grade envelope (area of  probable open pit exploitation)    | High-grade open pit     | >0.25 g/t Pt                       |
| Low-grade envelope (area of  probable underground exploitation)  | Low-grade  underground  | 0 g/t Pt to 0.95 g/t Pt            |
| High-grade envelope (area of  probable underground exploitation) | High-grade  underground | >0.95 g/t Pt                       |
| Massive sulphide                                                 | Massive sulphide        | Typically combined  sulphides >85% |

Figure: 17-3:  Grade-shell Boundaries

The  high-grade  shells  within  the  mineralized  ultramafic  envelope  were  modelled  as wireframes  in  MineSight  from  grade  contours  interpreted  and  digitized  by  Magma Metals staff.    The  shells  were  based  on  vertical  section  interpretation,  and  confined within set Pt grade criteria.  The high grade shells are accurate to individual drill hole grade sample intervals.

However, the high grade shell is not considered to be an accurate geological boundary or iso-grade model, because there are some grade samples below cut-off in the high grade shells and some samples above cut-off in the low grade shells.  The completed wireframes are true to Magma's interpretation and the drill hole intersections.

Typically,  the  underground  low-grade  shell  was  not  used  in  isolation,  but  combined with the underground high-grade shell.

Where mineralization was projected to be mined using open pit methods, a grade of 0.25 g/t  Pt  was  used  for  the  high-grade  shell  boundary  (refer  to  Table  17-2);  this covered the mineralization at Current Lake and the Bridge Zone.  Where underground mining methods were likely, a Pt grade of 0.95 g/t Pt was used to establish the highgrade-shell boundary (refer to Table 17-2).  This covered part of the Bridge Zone and Beaver Lake.

There is an area of underground and open pit high-grade-shell overlap in the Bridge Zone of about 150 m, which was designed to accommodate conceptual mine planning.

Project No.:  164115 October 2010

Magma Metals Limited Thunder Bay North Polymetallic Project Ontario, Canada NI 43-101 Technical Report

The open pit high-grade shell was modelled to the boundary of the Bridge Zone with the Beaver Lake Zone.  The open pit high grade shell lateral limits, based on the early assumptions for the size of the open pit, are short of the L-G resource pit shell.

AMEC recommends that, for future resource estimates, the open pit high grade shell should  be  interpreted  and  modelled  to  358100  E  or  farther,  for  the  reason  that  the open pit grade threshold is more inclusive and may potentially result in additional open pit mineral resource volumes above cut-off.

A massive sulphide wire-frame was constructed to constrain those areas of mineralization.  Massive sulphide shapes were interpreted by AMEC by digitizing and then wire-framing contours in two directions on sections and\or plan views in GEMS. Where  available,  the  wire-frame  dimensions  were  constrained  by  geophysical  EM conductor  anomaly  'plates'  provided  by  Magma  Metals.    Where  massive  sulphides were intersected in only one drill hole, the interpreted dimensions were approximately twice as long on-strike as across strike of the ultramafic host with boundaries half way to the adjacent drill holes on section.  The shapes are tapered toward the boundary edges.  In some cases, typically where the massive sulphides occur at the base of the ultramafic host intrusion, modelled depressions in the basal contact surface were used to limit the lateral extents of the massive sulphide shapes.

## 17.3.3 Topographic Surface

The  topography  surface  was  modelled  as  a  wire-frame  in  GEMS  from  the  LIDAR digital elevation model provided by Magma Metals (refer to Section 10.1).  The LIDAR x, y, and z (NAD83 Zone 16) point data were combined with the core drill hole collar locations to provide a topographic surface.

The  bedrock  surface  was  modelled  in  GEMS  as  a  wire-frame  from  the  bathymetry survey data beneath Current Lake provided by Magma Metals, combined with drill core intercepts.  Where no data were available, the overburden thickness was assumed to be 2 m.

## 17.3.4 Use of Wire-frames in Modelling

The geological wire-frame models were used to inform (flag) the rock type models in the  open  pit  and  underground  block  models.    The  wire-frame  of  the  ultramafic  host rock  provided  the  boundary  of  the  low-grade  shell  outside  of  which  no  grades  were estimated.  The low- and high-grade shells and massive sulphide shapes were used to constrain the interpolated grade estimates.

Project No.:  164115 October 2010

<!-- image -->

Magma Metals Limited Thunder Bay North Polymetallic Project Ontario, Canada NI 43-101 Technical Report

Hard boundaries were assumed between the low- and high-grade shells.  However, the  boundary  between  the  high-grade  shell  and  massive  sulphide  shapes  was assumed to be a soft boundary.

The block model rock type models were assigned unique block model codes to ensure proper identification for estimation and reporting.

The  mineralized  ultramafic  host  rock  codes  identify  the  blocks  by  grade  shell  and anisotropy zone.

## 17.4 Composites

The  original  drill  core  samples  were  composited  to  1  m  standard  length  for  outlier analysis  and  grade  capping  studies.    The  1  m  composites  were  subsequently composited to 2 m for exploratory data analysis, continuity analysis (variography) and interpolation.  The capped 2 m composites were used for grade interpolation for the low-grade  shells  for  the  open  pit  and  underground  estimates.    The  uncapped  2  m composites were used for the grade capping study and interpolation for the high-grade shells.

Compositing typically results in some composites having less than full lengths.  AMEC elected to retain the short composites by back-stitching the composites with lengths less than 0.8 m to the preceding composites to create a small number of composites greater than 2.0 m (3.9% for the open pit and 1.5% for the underground composites) and a small number of composites less than 2.0 m (8.8% for the open pit and 3.0% for the underground composites).

The expanded size of the optimized resource pit shell required combining some of the underground composites with the open pit composites for grade interpolation.

## 17.5 Exploratory Data Analysis

Descriptive statistics from original assays including histograms, cumulative distribution curves, contact plots and, swath plots were completed by AMEC.  The assay database was  analyzed  globally  and  was  also  subdivided  into  two  groups  of  data:  one, representing the assays in the Current Lake and Bridge Zones believed most likely to be considered for open pit mining and a second, of data from the Bridge and Beaver Lake Zones believed likely to be mined from underground.

The  global  assay  database  contains  22,700  assays  within  the  ultramafic  host  rock envelope.    The  database  for  the  open  pit  area  contains  over  9,300  assays.    The

Project No.:  164115 October 2010

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Magma Metals Limited Thunder Bay North Polymetallic Project Ontario, Canada NI 43-101 Technical Report database for the underground area contains almost 15,200 assays.  There is a spatial overlap  between  the  two  areas  resulting  in  approximately  1,800  assays  being considered in both groups.

The rocks of the ultramafic intrusive complex form a continuum of true ultramafic rocks (e.g. peridotite) to mafic rocks (e.g. olivine melagabbro).  In practice, drill core loggers may not be able to make a distinction between the two rock groups on a macroscopic scale.  Magma Metals is currently studying the geochemistry of the host rocks with the goal  of  devising  an  efficient  method  of  accurately  determining  the  mineralogical classification of the rocks.  For the purposes of the 2010 Mineral Resource estimate, the ultramafic and mafic host rock phases were grouped into a single domain.

The contact plots verified that hard boundaries between the assay data within the lowgrade shell and high-grade shell should be enforced for resource estimation.  The lowgrade-shell model is defined by the mineralized host rock envelope.  The high-gradeshell model was defined by contouring the assay grades on vertical sections and wireframing at 0.25 Pt g/t for the open pit resource and by contouring the assay grades on vertical sections and wire-framing at 0.95 Pt g/t for the underground.

## 17.5.1 Data Rotation

The irregular tube-like morphology of the ultramafic intrusive complex, especially the chonolith  in  the  Current  Lake  and  Bridge  Zones,  required  data  rotation  through  coordinate  transformation  (unfolding)  of  the  grade  composites  into  a  model  space  for continuity  analysis  and  the  drill  hole  spacing  study.    The  grade  composites  were subdivided according to the general trend of a section of the chonolith.  The result was seven zones: six in the Current Lake and Bridge Zones and one in the Beaver Lake Zone.  The spatial co-ordinates of the samples in each zone were rotated to a uniform direction in the model space for variography.  The grade estimates were interpolated from the composite samples in normal space using the variogram models derived for each anisotropy zone.

## 17.6 Grade Caps (Outlier/Extreme Values)

AMEC  conducted  outlier  studies  on  the  composited  grade  data  for  nine  grade elements: Ag, Au, Co, Cu, MgO, Ni, Pd, Pt and S.  Two groups of grade composites were reviewed for both the open pit and underground: 1 m composites within the low grade  shells,  and  2  m  composites  within  the  high-grade  shells,  combined  with  2  m composites from near-massive to massive sulphides.

Project No.:  164115 October 2010

Magma Metals Limited Thunder Bay North Polymetallic Project Ontario, Canada NI 43-101 Technical Report

AMEC  used  decile  analysis,  log-scale  histograms,  probability  plots  and  indicator correlation methods to identify outliers and to determine an approximate capping grade for the low-grade domains and high-grade domains.

The ultimate selections for the capping values were a considered balance of all results. The  results  indicate  that  metal  reduction  is  warranted  and  prudent.    AMEC  used  a combination  of  capping  within  the  low  grade  shells  and  outlier  restriction  within  the high grade shells, inclusive of massive sulphides, to reduce the predicted amounts of metal indicated by the capping studies.

No  additional  special  treatment  or  restrictions  were  accorded  to  the  capped  2  m composites during interpolation in the low-grade shells.  The high-grade outliers in the high-grade shell were not capped.  A restricted interpolation search strategy was used to reduce the predicted metal indicated by the capping study targets.  The high grade outliers  and  target  metal  to  be  removed  in  the  high-grade  shells  (including  massive sulphides) are provided in Table 17-4.

Outlier  restriction  for  2 m  composites  in  the  high  grade  shell  plus  near-massive  to massive sulphides was implemented during grade interpolation by limiting the search distance  to  a  specified  maximum  for  composites  with  grades  above  a  selected threshold.  Beyond the maximum distance, the composites above the threshold are not

Magma Metals Limited Thunder Bay North Polymetallic Project Ontario, Canada NI 43-101 Technical Report used  for  grade  interpolation.    AMEC  used  a  three-pass  strategy  for  interpolation  to mitigate smoothing; search ranges increase with each pass.  The search restrictions for the open pit high grade interpolation varied with each pass, yet were equidistant in each search direction (Table 17-5).

To  verify  the  capping  and  restriction  strategies,  AMEC  produced  an  un-restricted model to compare the effect of the outlier restrictions on the grade estimates for the high grade shells.  The un-restricted model of the high grade shell reported at a zero cut-off  shows  decreases  in  the  amount  of  contained  metal  that  were  similar  to  the targets determined through the capping studies.

## 17.7 Variography

Unit  sill  variograms  (correlograms)  were  calculated  and  modelled  for  Pt,  Pd,  Cu,  Ni and MgO.  The variograms were calculated for the low- and high-grade shells in the area considered likely to be mined by open pit methods and for the low plus high grade shells in the area considered likely to be exploited using underground mining methods. All structures were modelled using spherical models.

Typical ranges for the high-grade shells indicated first-structure ranges of the order of 5-7 m for Cu, Pt, and Pd.  The Ni ranges were longer, about 11 m, whereas MgO ranges longer again, about 15 m.  Nugget effects were reasonably low.

In the low-grade shells, the first-structure ranges for Cu, Pt, and Pd were about 7-9 m. Nickel first structure ranges were about 11 m, and the MgO ranges were about 14 m. Nugget effects for the Pt and Pd variograms were much higher than in the high-grade shell (Pt 0.34 vs 0.13; Pd 0.33 vs 0.13).

The  combined  low-grade  and  high-grade  shells  in  the  areas  expected  to  be  mined using underground methods displayed first-order structure ranges 14-16 m for Cu, Pt,

## 17.8 Grade Estimation

Ordinary  kriging  (OK)  and  inverse  distance  weighting  to  the  first  power  (IDW)  were used for grade interpolation for the mineral resource estimate.  Ordinary kriging was used as the estimator for Cu, MgO, Ni, Pd and Pt.  Inverse distance weighting to the first  power  was  used  for  Ag,  Au,  Co  and  S.    A  nearest-neighbour  (NN)  interpolated block model was used as a means of creating declustered statistics for block model estimation validation.

Hard  boundaries  were  enforced  between  the  low-grade  shells  and  the  high-grade shells both in the open pit and underground estimates.  Grade composite data from one domain was not used to inform blocks in the other domain.  No data beyond the ultramafic  model  envelope  was  used  to  inform  the  block  grade  estimate.    A  soft boundary was used between the high-grade shell and the massive sulphides in the underground.  A soft boundary permits data from either domain within the specified search distance to estimate the block grade; effectively there is no boundary.

A three-pass estimation strategy with expanding search ellipses was employed.  The minimum and maximum number of samples was adjusted for each pass.  An octant search  was  used  for  the  first  two  passes.    The  numbers  of  samples  used  and  the octant  restrictions  are  provided  in  Table  17-7.    The  interpolation  plans  for  OK  were refined using the results of preliminary change of support analyses.

Both the open pit and underground block model blocks were discretized on a pattern of 3 m x 3 m x 1 m.

The search orientations for the grade estimation for all seven anisotropy zones for the open  pit  high  grade  shell  are  isotropic.    The  low  and  high  grade  composites  were combined in order to calculate stable robust variograms for the underground model.

## 17.9 Regression Derivations

## Nickel and Cobalt in Silicate Minerals

The PtEq formula considers Ni and Co as metal in sulphides.  However, the Ni and Co assays  are  reported  by  the  assay  laboratory  as  total  metal.    Hence,  using  the laboratory values in the formula without adjustment has a risk of overestimating PtEq,

Magma Metals Limited Thunder Bay North Polymetallic Project Ontario, Canada NI 43-101 Technical Report possibly by a significant amount.  A downward adjustment of the Ni and Co results was therefore made in order to better estimate the total Ni and Co as metal in sulphides.

Nickel and cobalt metals typically occur within silicate (e.g. olivine and orthopyroxene) and sulphide (e.g. pentlandite) phases in magmatic nickel sulphide deposits.  Olivine ((Mg,Fe)2SiO4)  can  account  for    up  to  4,000  ppm  nickel  and  400  ppm  cobalt,  by substitution for Mg in the crystal lattice.  The amount of Ni or Co sequestered in olivine depends upon the proportions of Mg and Fe in the olivine mineral; the Mg-rich endmember forsterite (Mg2SiO4) can accommodate the most Ni or Co.

Project samples are consistently assayed for MgO because, in ultramafic rocks where the dominant silicate minerals are olivine and orthopyroxene, the amount of MgO likely correlates with the amount of unrecoverable Ni and Co in the silicate minerals.  This is one possible approach to estimating "recoverable" nickel from a "total" nickel assay. Other  possible  approaches  include  using  total  sulphur  assays  and  partial  extraction methods which either selectively dissolve sulphides (leaving silicate minerals intact) or selectively  dissolve  silicate  minerals  (and  not  sulphide  minerals).    AMEC  notes  that ultimately, the validation of any method used will rest with demonstrating how well it correlates with the recovery of clean flotation concentrate in metallurgical test work.

The portion of the Ni and Co sequestered in silicate minerals was estimated by linear regression of MgO to total Ni and Co respectively.  Barren core samples (&lt;0.1 percent sulphide as determined from sulphur assays) from the Project were selected for the linear regression analysis.  Nickel and cobalt were plotted against MgO and a linearregression calculated to predict the amount of nickel and cobalt in silicate minerals, for a  given  MgO  content.    The  estimated  Ni  and  Co  sequestered  in  silicates  was  then calculated  using  the  linear  regression  formula  and  the  MgO  result  for  each  sample, and subtracted from total Ni or total Co to derive estimated Ni and Co in sulphides.

The formula to derive estimated sulphide Ni (NiSx) is:

NiSx (in g/t) = Total Ni (in g/t) - (MgO% x 60.35 - 551.43)

The formula to derive estimated sulphide Co (CoSx) is:

CoSx (in g/t) = Total Ni (in g/t) - (MgO% x 4.45 - 9.25)

AMEC  also  reviewed  the  potential  for  deriving  a  regression  equation  to  estimate rhodium content.  Rhodium could be recovered as a saleable by-product.  In addition to rhodium, iridium, osmium, and ruthenium form a suite known as the 'minor PGEs', as distinct from Pt and Pd, the 'major PGEs'.

Magma Metals Limited Thunder Bay North Polymetallic Project Ontario, Canada NI 43-101 Technical Report

AMEC reviewed the data for the minor PGEs with the goal of defining regressions to major PGEs in order to estimate the proportions of the minor PGEs from the major PGEs.    All  PGEs  are  typically  correlated;  however,  there  is  significantly  less  minor PGE data (1,030 assays) than major PGE data (29,089 Pt assays).  AMEC based the final regressions  on  all  of  the  minor  PGE  data  excluding  outliers  because  the geological model was not separated into individual ultramafic lithologies.

For the final regression calculation, a reduction to major axis (RMA) method was used. This approach does not introduce any underlying assumptions about which data set is correct, and makes an allowance for any difference in population variance between the two data sets.  The RMA slope is the ratio of standard deviation of the y population to that of the x .  The intercept b is calculated by solving the linear equation:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

for b , using the mean of the x population for x , the mean of the y population for y , and the RMA slope for m.

AMEC  produced  scatter  plots  for  minor  PGEs  versus  Pt  +  Pd  including  Rh,  an example of which is shown in Figure 17-4.

The regression and least-squares fit is sufficient to provide a general estimate of the minor PGE data from Pt + Pd grades, but AMEC cautions that the regression should only be considered to be appropriate to provide order-of-magnitude results that cannot

Magma Metals Limited Thunder Bay North Polymetallic Project Ontario, Canada NI 43-101 Technical Report be  relied  upon  for  mine  planning  or  detailed  revenue  estimates.    R ,  in  AMEC's 2 opinion,  would  need  to  be  on  the  order  of  0.8  or  better  to  provide  very  confident estimates of minor PGE grades based on Pt + Pd grades.  The regression parameters for Rh are:

## Rh pbb = 0.0290 Pt + Pd (in pbb) - 15.6378

AMEC concluded that regressions can be used to estimate minor PGE grades based on the sum of Pt and Pd for the combined data set, but that those estimates will not be very reliable because of the fact that multiple populations of data exist within the data for each lithology.  Such multiple populations are likely the result of subtle geological and  mineralogical  differences  in  those  lithologies.    Additional  geological  information would likely allow separation of the populations and calculation of separate regressions  with  significantly  more  confidence  than  now  exists.    AMEC  used  the combined  data  set  minus  a  number  of  outliers  that  were  identified  in  the  data.    In instances where the combined Pt + Pd grade is low, a negative value was returned by the regressions.  In these cases the rhodium grade was set to zero.

AMEC concluded  that  the  confidence  in  the  Rh  regression  is  low.    It  is  likely  that additional data will render the estimated regressions invalid.  AMEC further concluded that, as the relative value of Rh is low (&lt;6%), the limited confidence in the estimated values  will  not  negatively  impact  on  the  overall  confidence  of  the  mineral  resource estimate.

AMEC recommends that additional work be undertaken on the minor PGEs, including:

- · All PGEs, including the minor PGEs, should be assayed for each mineralized sample.
- · Lithologies Upd (peridotite) and Mgm (melanocratic gabbro) should be investigated with the goal of separating those units into additional geological units which would likely  make  estimation  of  minor  PGE  grades  from  Pt  and  Pd  more  reliable. Throughout  the  data  multiple  populations  are  indicated,  and  AMEC  could  not reliably separate those populations for estimation purposes.

## 17.10 Density

Specific gravity (SG, or density) was estimated by linear regression of the estimated Pt + Pd g/t grades in the open pit and underground block models.  The open pit and underground data were analysed separately due to expected higher densities of the underground lithologies.

Project No.:  164115 October 2010

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Magma Metals Limited Thunder Bay North Polymetallic Project Ontario, Canada NI 43-101 Technical Report

The linear regression formula for density in the open pit block model is:

Density = (0.0121 x Pt + Pd (grade in g/t)) + 2.9087

The linear regression formula for density in the underground block model is:

Density = (0.0143 x Pt + Pd (grade in g/t)) + 2.8943

## 17.11 Model Validation

## 17.11.1 Density

The  SG  estimate  was  validated  by  visually  comparing  the  predicted  values  to  the nearest drill hole assay and by comparing the regression estimates to IDW estimates for  each  of  the  open  pit  and  underground  models.    The  open  pit  and  underground block SG values were interpolated using the original drill core measurements.  There are 3,928 SG measurements for the area likely to be mined using open pit methods, and 2,654 SG measurements for the area likely to be mined using underground mining methods.  Blocks not estimated by IDW were assigned constant SG values of 2.92 for the low-grade shell and 2.94 for the high-grade shell.  The global minimum, maximum and,  means  of  the  regression  estimate  and  IDW  estimate  compared  well.    The variability  in  the  regression  estimate  is  lower;  however,  the  global  means  are  very close and within expectations.

## 17.11.2 Model Volumes

The proportion of blocks flagged for each rock type was validated by comparing the analytical volume of the wireframes with the block model volume.  The volume error is typically  much  less  than  one  percent  ( ≤ 0.01%)  except  for  the  massive  sulphides volumes which are overstated by 2.6% in the open pit and 4.7% in the underground. This volume error is considered acceptable as the total volumes are low ( ≤ 3,000 m³).

## 17.11.3 Visual Inspection

The  results  of  the  OK  and  IDW  grade  estimations  as  well  as  the  regressions  were systematically compared for reasonableness of fit to input data on vertical sections and plans  on-screen  in  Gemcom  in  2D  and  3D.    The  visual  inspections  were  repeated following any adjustments to search and interpolation parameters.

## 17.11.4 Global Statistics

The NN model and the OK models for Pt, Pd, Ni, Cu, and MgO, and the IDW models for  Au,  Ag,  Co,  and  S  were  produced  using  the  same  search  criteria.    AMEC calculated  statistics  at  zero  cut-offs  for  these  models.    The  comparative  analysis shows that the OK and IDW models in open pit and underground are globally unbiased relative to the declustered statistics as represented by the NN model global means.

AMEC  also  conducted  a  check  analysis  on  the  amount  of  metal  removed  due  to capping and/or outlier restriction applied to the OK and IDW models.  This was done by  comparing  global  means  of  capped  and  uncapped  OK  and  IDW  models.    The comparison  indicated  that  the  capping  had  appropriately  removed  the  expected amounts of metal.

## 17.11.5 Selectivity

AMEC conducted selectivity analyses for Pt and Ni to account for a change of support from grade composite units to selective mining units (SMU).  The selectivity analyses were  performed  using  Herco  plots  on  mineralization  within  blocks  that  had  been classified as Indicated (refer to Section 17.10.2).

The Herco selectivity  analyses  showed that open pit models are correctly diluted at and around the economic cut-off grade.

Nearly all of the underground mineral resource will be recovered from the high-grade zone; consequently AMEC was of the opinion that selectivity analysis was not required for the underground model.

## 17.11.6 Swath Plots

AMEC  generated  charts  in  three  directions  (x,  y,  and  z)  showing  profiles  of  mean grades for Pt, Pd, Ni, Cu, MgO from the OK kriging models, and Au, Ag, Co, S, from the IDW models, as well as for the NN models and for composites versus location.

All  model  swath  plots  showed  good  to  acceptable  agreement,  indicating  that  there were no significant local biases present.

## 17.11.7 Contact Plots

AMEC produced contact plots for Pt and Ni block models for both the open pit and underground  models.    These  plots  showed  that  the  block  models  with  the  selected

Project No.:  164115 October 2010

Magma Metals Limited Thunder Bay North Polymetallic Project Ontario, Canada NI 43-101 Technical Report modelling parameters reproduced the sharp boundary contact characteristics displayed by the grade composites.

## 17.12 Drill Spacing Study

AMEC conducted  a  drill  hole  spacing  study  that  would  indicate  what  drill  spacings would be sufficient to predict potential production with reasonable precision.

For an Indicated Mineral Resource, the drill hole spacing should be sufficient to predict tonnage, grade, and metal on annual production with ± 15% relative precision at the 90% confidence level.  This means that the mine must be able to predict production outcomes within ± 15% nine years out of 10.  The same criterion applies for Measured Mineral Resources, but the ± 15% relative precision has to be achieved on a quarterly production  basis.    In  other  words,  the  mine  must  be  able  to  predict  production outcomes within ± 15% nine quarters out of 10.

A block corresponding to a monthly production was defined and the relative estimation variances of this block grade, given variogram models and several different drill hole spacing  configurations,  were  calculated  for  Pt  and  Ni.    Then  these  variances  were adjusted for quarterly and annual production periods.

The study indicates drill hole spacing of 50 m x 10 m for Indicated Mineral Resources and  20 m x  10  m  for  Measured  Mineral  Resources  in  the  open  pit  model.    In  the underground model the drill hole spacing as demonstrated by the study is 50 m x 20 m for Indicated Mineral Resources and 30 m x 10 m for Measured Mineral Resources.

AMEC treated the study results as a guide to inform mineral resource classification; while at the same time the proposed drill hole spacing should be easily amenable to the existing drill  hole  patterns.    As  a  result  AMEC  suggests that in the underground model  a  50  m  x  20  m  is  a  reasonable  drill  hole  pattern  to  support  upgrading mineralization from the Inferred category to the Indicated category.

The  drill  hole  spacing  study  revealed  that  Pt has  higher  grade  variability  than  Ni. Higher variability means higher risk, but a risk which can be mitigated with tighter drill spacing.  For this reason, AMEC's recommendations for confidence classifications in Section 17.13 are based on the results of the Pt drill hole spacing study.

## 17.13 Mineral Resource Confidence Classification

Classification of mineral  resource  confidence  categories  took  the  following  into account:

Project No.:  164115 October 2010

<!-- image -->

Magma Metals Limited Thunder Bay North Polymetallic Project Ontario, Canada NI 43-101 Technical Report

- · The coefficients of variation of the base metal and PGE grade data are low.
- · The modelled geometry of the mineralized host rocks is reasonably well-informed and is continuous.
- · The average spacing of the vertical sections across the ultramafic chonolith in the Current Lake and Bridge Zone areas is approximately 50 m.

The  underground  preliminary  mining  shapes  were  clipped  to  the  nearest  matching economic open pit adjusted to eliminate individual and isolated blocks not likely to be mined due to separation distance.

In  the  Current  Lake  Zone  and  Bridge  Zone within the area of the open pit resource model,  AMEC  considered  the  data  acceptable  to  support  an  Indicated  resource classification  in  the  open  pit  model  where  the  estimated  blocks  within  the  low-grade and high-grade shells were within 30 m of the nearest drill hole.

The remainder of the blocks in the open pit model within the low-grade and high-grade shells were classified as Inferred.

In the Bridge Zone and Beaver Lake Zone areas of the underground resource model AMEC  considered  the  data  acceptable  to  support  Indicated  resource  classification where  the  shapes  of  the  modelled  high-grade  shell  were  continuous  across  two  or more sections, and where the blocks were within 30 m of the nearest drill hole.

The remainder of the blocks in the underground model within the high grade shell were classified as Inferred.  Blocks in the underground model in the low-grade shell were not classified.

At  the  current  drill  spacing,  AMEC  considered  that  declaration  of  Measured  mineral resources was not supported.

A small number (17) of angled core holes &gt;100 m in length were used to define the underground  high  grade  shell  and  were  used  for  grade  data  to  support  the  mineral resource estimate in blocks classified as Indicated.  AMEC reviewed the core holes individually for survey consistency and corroboration with adjacent vertical holes and considers that the data are acceptable for resource classification as Indicated for the current level of study.  AMEC nevertheless is of the opinion that the down-hole survey issues  should  be  investigated  and  corrected  prior  to  undertaking  more  advanced studies.

## 17.14 Derivation of Cut-off Grades and Equivalency Formula

Resource  model  materials  within  the  conceptual  mining  shapes  were  constrained using appropriate marginal cut-off grades.  Marginal cut-off grades were determined after consideration of appropriate economic, technical, and cost assumptions, for the cases of platinum revenue only, to be applied to a platinum grade-equivalent (PtEq).

## 17.14.1 Cut-off Grades

The calculation for the marginal cut-off, to define a break-even value between revenue and cost, was based on the initial equation:

Marginal cut-off  grade  =  [Sum  of  Ore  Based  Costs  ($/t  milled)]  /  [Net  Revenue  ($/g sold)]

Revenue  grades  were  based  on  the  assumed  process  and  smelter  recoveries presented in Table 17-8, and the commodity price assumptions in Table 17-9.

Table 17-8: Assumed Process and Smelter Recoveries used in the Cut-off Grade and PtEq Formulae

| Process Recovery   | Process Recovery   | Smelter Recovery   | Smelter Recovery   |
|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Metal              | Recovery (%)       | Metal              | Recovery (%)       |
| Ag                 | 50                 | Ag                 | 85                 |
| Au                 | 50                 | Au                 | 85                 |
| CoSx               | 90                 | Co                 | 50                 |
| Cu                 | 90                 | Cu                 | 85                 |

| Rh                 | 75                 | Rh                 | 85                 |

Table 17-9: Assumed Metal Prices used in the Cut-off Grade and PtEq Formulae

| Metal Prices   | Metal Prices   | Metal Prices   |
|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| Metal          | Units          | Price          |
| Ag             | US$/oz         | 14.30          |
| Au             | US$/oz         | 875.00         |
| Co             | US$/oz         | 13.00          |
| Cu             | US$/lb         | 2.10           |
| Ni             | US$/lb         | 7.30           |

| Pt             | US$/oz         | 1,470.00       |
| Rh             | US$/oz         | 4,000.00       |

Process  recovery  figures  are  based  on  preliminary  testwork  results,  available  as  of January 2010.  Subsequent testwork indicates that the assumptions are acceptable for this level of study, but for more detailed studies, some modifications can be expected to  recovery  percentages  (refer  to  Table  16-2).    Smelter  recoveries  are  based  on smelter responses received by Magma Metals in December 2009 and January 2010, and  are  based  on  the  information  that  Magma  Metals  had  available  at  that  time  in terms of bulk concentrate metallurgical data.  The smelter recoveries (accountability) are the percentage of the analyzed metal content of the concentrate which are likely to be  paid  for  by  the  smelter,  and  therefore  are  effectively  smelter  payables  after deductions.  AMEC notes that depending on the grade within of the concentrate, cobalt values may be treated as either payable metals at some smelters, or as a minimum deduction at other smelters.

Metal prices were supplied by Magma Metals, and are based upon price predictions sourced by Magma Metals from the CIBC Bank in the first quarter of 2010.

The marginal cut-off grade, based on Pt, for the open pit was derived as 0.61 g/t PtEq.

The derivation for the open pit marginal cut-off grade was as follows:

Open Pit COG = Process Costs + Conc. Transport + Smelter Treatment + G&amp;A Pt Price / FNX / g/oz x PR% x SR% x (1 - Royalty%)

- = C$10.00 /t + C$2.30 g/t + C$3.75 /t + C$4.00 /t US$1470 /oz / 0.90 / 31.1035 x 75% x 85% x (1 - 2%)
- = 0.61 g/t PtEq

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Magma Metals Limited Thunder Bay North Polymetallic Project Ontario, Canada NI 43-101 Technical Report where COG = cut-off grade; FNX is the US$/CAD$ exchange rate; PR% is process recovery; and SR% is smelter recovery.

The open pit cut-off grade presented is the internal or mill cut-off grade.  The internal cut-off grade is used to delineate ore and waste within defined pit limits, and does not include  mining  costs.    However,  mining  costs  were  used  in  the  generation  of  the optimized pit shell.  Once mining limits are established, mining costs are sunk costs, required to provide access to the material at the bottom of the pit.  The mill (ore)/waste decision  is  effectively  made  at  the  pit  rim,  where  the  choice  is  whether  to  route  the loaded truck to the mill or the waste dump.  At this point, the costs of drilling, blasting, loading and hauling to the pit limit are sunk costs.

For the underground, the break-even cut-off grade was 1.94 g/t PtEq.

The derivation for the underground break-even cut-off grade was as follows:

UG COG = UG Mining Cost + Process Cost + Conc. Transport + Smelter Treatment + G&amp;A Pt Price / FNX / g/oz x PR% x SR%

- =      C$45.00 /t + C$10.00 /t + C$2.30 g/t + C$3.75 /t + C$4.00 /t US$1470 /oz / 0.90 / 31.1035 x 75% x 85%
- =      1.94 g/t PtEq

where COG is the cut-off grade, UG is underground; FNX is the US$/CAD$ exchange rate, PR% is process recovery and SR% is smelter recovery.

Royalty payments are only applicable to open pit mine production.

## 17.14.2 Equivalency

A platinum grade equivalent formula is used for conceptual mining shape generation, the application of cut-off grades within the conceptual mining shapes, and for reporting the Mineral Resource statement.  The derivation of the platinum equivalency formula that is used to report the Mineral Resource statement is based on generally-accepted industry practices.

As platinum is the highest value metal analyzed, a platinum equivalent formula is used to  derive  the  value  from  the  secondary  metals  in  terms  of  in-situ  Pt  and  to  add  the contributions of the secondary metals to the Pt grade.  It is important to note that the PtEq  grade  is  an  in-situ  grade.    To  determine  the  recovered  PtEq  metal,  both  the process  and  smelter  recoveries  must  be  applied.    The  result  is  that  the  recovered

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Magma Metals Limited Thunder Bay North Polymetallic Project Ontario, Canada NI 43-101 Technical Report dollar value of the PtEq will be equal to the recovered dollar value of the platinum plus the secondary metals added together.

The factors in the PtEq formula, which convert the secondary metal grade of interest into an in-situ PtEq value based on the ratios of the value of the secondary metal being converted to PtEq to the value of recovered the platinum to the recovered value of the secondary metal being converted to  PtEq,  are  provided  in  Table  17-10.    The  metal factors are based on the assumed process and smelter recoveries that were presented in Table  17-8, and  the commodity  price  assumptions  that  were  presented  in Table 17-9.

Table 17-10:  Secondary Metal Factors.

| Metal Factors   | Metal Factors   |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| Metal           | Factor          |
| Ag              | 0.0084          |

| Rh              | 2.7211          |

Assumed metal values, mineral processing recoveries and smelter recoveries are all accounted for in the PtEq formula.

The PtEq formula is:

PtEq g/t = Pt g/t + Pd g/t x 0.2721 + Au g/t x 0.3968 + Ag g/t x 0.0084 + Cu g/t x 0.000118 + Sulphide Ni g/t x 0.000433 + Sulphide Co g/t x 0.000428 + Rh g/t x 2.7211

## 17.15 Assessment of Reasonable Prospects for Economic Extraction

The general approach taken by AMEC, during the process of constraining the mineral resources, was to maximise the available mineral resources.  This was undertaken by allowing underground extraction.  The mineralization that was amenable to underground mining methods was then determined from blocks outside the optimized pit shell. the pit optimization to run independent  of considerations of potential

Magma Metals Limited Thunder Bay North Polymetallic Project Ontario, Canada NI 43-101 Technical Report

For the purposes  of  constraining the mineral resources  to assess  reasonable prospects  for  economic  extraction,  the  following  exchange  rate  assumptions  were used:

$CAD 1 = $US0.90 and conversely $US1.00 = $CAD1.11

Mining  and  process  cost  assumptions  for  the  likely  open  pit  and  underground extraction methods are summarized in Table 17-11. Costs are based on benchmarking  against  existing  underground  operations  in  Ontario,  and  on  AMEC's experience with such projects.

## 17.15.1 Open Pit

Mineral Resources considered amenable to open pit mining methods were constrained within  a  Lerchs  -Grossmann  (L-G)  pit  shell    that  was  based  on  the  optimisation parameters listed  in  Table  17-11,  the  platinum  metal  prices  and  recoveries  listed  in Table 17-8 and Table 17-9 respetively, and a PtEq marginal grade of 0.61 PtEq.  The Pt-Eq grades were used to determine block revenues.

Magma Metals Limited Thunder Bay North Polymetallic Project Ontario, Canada NI 43-101 Technical Report

Internal dilution was accounted for during the grade interpolation process.  External or contact dilution was not accounted for in the resource model.  External dilution would be addressed in any future mine planning process.

Mineralization  that  displayed  geological  and  grade  continuity,  had  grades  above  the marginal  cut-off  of  0.61  g/t  Pt-Eq,  and  was  contained  within  the  L-G  shell,  was considered to have reasonable prospects of economic extraction.

## 17.15.2 Underground

The  underground  mining  method  is  expected  to  be  a  selective  mining  method,  and may consist of either a cut-and-fill or drift-and-fill method, with voids backfilled.

The mineralization that is likely to be extracted by underground mining methods was assessed  by  AMEC  to  determine  the  continuity  of  the  resource  material  above  the economic cut-off within the boundaries of the mineralized envelope and by determining if in AMEC's experience it would be feasible to economically extract the resources now or in the foreseeable future.  AMEC established the resource material above cut-off is sufficiently continuous to be likely to be mined at a profit.

Mineral  resources  that  were  considered  amenable  to  underground  mining  methods were constrained within a preliminary underground mining shape based on a mining economic cut-off grade of 1.94 g/t PtEq.  A 1.94 g/t PtEq grade isoshell was created in Gemcom and was scrutinized for individual or isolated blocks which in AMEC's opinion were  not  likely  to  have  reasonable  prospects  of  economic  extraction.    However, individual blocks immediately below the open pit resource shell were included in the resource  as  they  are  likely  to  be  mined  even  from  the  open  pit.    The  blocks  not meeting the criterion were not reported in the mineral resource.

Only the blocks above break-even cut-off are part of the isoshell. The internal dilution was accounted for during the interpolation process.  External or contact dilution was not accounted for in the resource model.  External dilution would be addressed in any future  mine  planning  process.    In  AMEC's  experience,  dilution  of  5-10%  could  be expected when a method such as selective cut-and-fill mining is employed.

Mineralization that displayed geological and grade continuity, and was contained within the  1.94  g/t  PtEq  grade  iso-shell,  was  considered  to  have  reasonable  prospects  of economic extraction.

## 17.16 Mineral Resource Statement

Mineralization within the Thunder Bay North Project at the Current Lake, Bridge Zone and Beaver Lake deposits that demonstrates grade and geological continuity, and is either  constrained  by  L-G  pit  shells  that  were  based  on  reasonable  extraction assumptions,  or  constrained  within underground  mineable  shapes  based  on  a selective mining method assumption, is considered to be classified in accordance with the  2005  CIM  Definition  Standards  for  Mineral  Resources  and  Mineral  Reserves. Mineral Resources are also compliant with the 2004 edition of the Australasian Joint Ore Reserves Committee (JORC) Code.

Mineral Resources have an effective date of 31 May 2010.  David Thomas, P.Geo, an AMEC employee, is the Qualified Person for the estimate.

Table  17-12  presents  the  Mineral  Resources  at  a  range  of  cut-off  grades,  with  the base-case  shown  as  highlighted.    Higher  and  lower  cut-off  grades  are  shown  to illustrate sensitivity of the estimate to cut-off grade.

## 17.17 Sensitivity Analysis Using Grade-Tonnage Curves

Grade-tonnage curves within the resource pit shell were compiled, commencing at a 0.3 g/t PtEq cut-off.  Figure 17-6 shows the grade-tonnage curve for the mineralization that  was  classified  as  Indicated  mineral  resources  using  assumptions  of  open  pit mining.

Figure 17-7 shows an equivalent grade-tonnage curve for the mineralization that was classified as Indicated mineral resources using underground mining assumptions.  The grade-tonnage curve represents the material outside of the open pit shell.  Due to the highly constrained modelling of the underground high-grade shell, the grade-tonnage curve does not alter below the marginal economic cut-off of 1.94 g/t PtEq.

Magma Metals Limited Thunder Bay North Polymetallic Project Ontario, Canada NI 43-101 Technical Report

## 17.18 Comment on Section 17

The QPs are of the opinion  that  the  Mineral  Resources  for  the  Project,  which  have been estimated using core drill data, have been performed to industry best practices, and conform to the requirements of CIM (2005).

Mineral Resources have considered factors such as environmental, permitting, legal, title,  taxation,  socio-economic,  marketing,  and  political  factors  and  constraints,  as discussed in Section 4 and Section 5 of this Technical Report, at a level sufficient to ensure that reasonable prospects of economic extraction are likely for the estimate.

Areas of uncertainty that may materially impact Mineral Resource estimation include:

- · There are limited density determinations.  Changes to the average density values used to estimate tonnages will result in changes to the Mineral Resources
- · Additional minor PGE assays sufficient to permit direct estimation of Rh will result in more accurate estimates and may result in changes in the estimated values
- · Refinements to the grade shells used to constrain the mineralization, and determination of more accurate values for recoveries and mining costs may result in changes to the Mineral Resources
- · Extrapolation of the open pit block model as discussed in Section 17.2 may result in additional mineralization being captured within the L-G pit shell, which may be able to support estimation as Mineral Resources
- · The application of geochemistry to improve host rock classification and domaining may lead to more accurate grade estimates
- · Additional quality control on down-hole surveys in the database including resurveying selected open holes will lead to more accurate models and estimates
- · Use of more sophisticated geostatistical methods, such as probability-assisted constrained kriging, may improve the accuracy of the high grade shell models and resulting grade estimates
- · Cobalt was  included in the mineral resource estimate because  there are reasonable prospects of economic extraction using a smelter route, and the initial smelter  feedback  received  by  Magma  Metals  in  December  2009-January  2010 indicated that cobalt was likely to be a payable metal.  In late September, 2009, additional  indicative  information  from  selected  smelters  suggested  that  some smelters  may  consider  the  cobalt  to  be  a  minimum  smelter  deduction,  whereas others consider cobalt to be a payable metal.  If the selected smelter were to apply a minimum smelter deduction, then there is a potential that the cobalt in the Project bulk concentrate could become unpayable.

Magma Metals Limited Thunder Bay North Polymetallic Project Ontario, Canada NI 43-101 Technical Report

No reconciliation  was  performed  to  the  2009  resource  model,  as  the  2010  model  is based on nearly double the drilling metreage.  The 2010 estimate is supported by 528 core  holes  (97,676 m),  whereas  the  2009  estimate  was  based  on  333  core  holes (50,416 m).  In addition, the cost parameter and recovery assumptions used for the 2010 mineral resource estimate are significantly different to the assumptions for the 2009 mineral resource estimate.

## 19.0 OTHER RELEVANT DATA AND INFORMATION

## 19.1 Potential Market

Magma  Metals  initiated  a  preliminary  assessment  of  the  likely  market  for  PGE contained in copper and nickel concentrates from the Project.  A report was prepared by Caliper Metals Corp. (Caliper) in association with Neil S Seldon &amp; Associates Ltd, and was based on the metallurgical results available in September 2010.

The  report  indicated  that  the  likely  bulk  concentrate  containing  PGEs,  nickel,  and copper should be marketed to both nickel and copper smelters, due to the nature of the bulk concentrate.

Indicative responses from selected smelters indicated that there is a potential market for bulk concentrate produced from the Thunder Bay Project and that the likely payable metals would be Pt, Pd, Rh, Au, Ag, Cu, Co, and Ni.

## 19.2 Preliminary Assessment Study

In November  2009, Magma  Metals  retained AMEC  to  perform a preliminary assessment  study  on  the  Current  Lake  and  Beaver  Lake  deposits.    The  study  is expected to be completed in December 2010.

## Work to date indicates that:

- · A combination of underground and open pit mining is likely.  Open pit mining could be via a conventional truck-and-shovel operation; the underground operation may employ either cut-and-fill or drift-and-fill mining methods, with backfill
- · The likely process route is production of a bulk concentrate using a flowsheet comprising ball mill grinding to a P80 of 86 µm, non-sulphide hydrophobic gangue pre-flotation, rougher iron sulphide-PGM flotation and Ni-Cu rougher flotation, followed by three stages of cleaning.
- · The  concentrate  is  saleable,  based  on  initial  metallurgical  testwork  results  and preliminary smelter discussions.

## 20.0 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS

The following interpretations and conclusions are made based on the updated mineral resource estimate discussed in this Report.

- · There is no existing Project infrastructure.  Exploration activities are currently supplied out of Thunder Bay.  The Project is accessible by road, and within 45 km of major infrastructure such as a power station, power lines, gas line, railway line, and a major highway.  Potable and process water could be provided from freshwater lakes, streams, and rivers in the Project area.  Canada has sufficient experienced and skilled professionals to run any mining operation that could be constructed in the Project area.
- · AMEC was provided with legal opinion that confirmed that the mineral tenure held by Magma Metals in the areas for which Mineral Resources are estimated is valid. All but four claims are held in the name of Magma Metals; the remainder are under option.
- · Mineral claims are located on Crown lands, and therefore surface rights are acquired as part of the claim process.  Magma Metals has held preliminary discussions with First Nation groups in the region to discuss Project development.
- · There is sufficient area within the claims held by Magma Metals to support construction of mining and processing infrastructure.
- · The Current Lake group of claims are subject to a 3% net smelter royalty (NSR), one-third of which can be purchased by Magma Metals at any time for C$1 million. The royalty is only payable for mineralization extracted using open pit mining methods.
- · Permits obtained by the company to undertake exploration are sufficient to ensure that activities are conducted within the regulatory framework required by the Ontario Government.  Additional permits will be required for Project development; preliminary discussions have been held with the relevant Federal and Provincial authorities.
- · Environmental permits are required by various Canadian Federal, Provincial, and municipal agencies to support Project development.  Environmental baseline studies commenced in 2007.
- · At the effective date of this report, environmental liabilities are restricted to exploration sites and access roads constructed to service exploration programs.
- · Understanding of the Project geology and mineralization, together with the deposit type, is sufficiently well established to support Mineral Resource estimation.

- · Exploration completed to date by Magma Metals has included geological and structural mapping, petrological and mineralogical studies, commencement of baseline environmental studies, airborne and ground geophysical surveys, and core drilling.  This work identified two major areas of Cu-Ni-Pt-Pd sulphide mineralization, at Beaver Lake and Current Lake.  A first-time mineral resource estimate was performed in 2009.  Completed exploration programs are appropriate to the mineralization style and have identified additional exploration targets. Exploration potential remains in the overall Project area, and there is an expectation that additional mineralization is likely to be identified with continued exploration and infill drilling.
- · Drilling completed to 31 July 2010 comprises 625 core holes (137,378.7 m).  An additional nine drill holes (2,187 m) were completed at 6 October 2010.  All drilling was performed using core methods.  It is likely that a rig capable of drilling 1 km+ drill hole depths will be required to test deeper zones at Beaver Lake.  To support detailed modelling of ultramafic boundaries for mineral resource estimation for mine planning purposes, it is recommended that additional drilling be performed to establish the edges of the unit.
- · Core samples are taken on 2 m intervals in rocks that are considered to be nonmineralized.  Mineralized intersections are sampled on 1 m intervals.  These intervals are considered appropriate for a magmatic sulphide-type deposit, and are considered to be adequately representative of the true thicknesses of mineralization.  Sample collection and handling of core was undertaken in accordance with industry standard practices.
- · Sample security has relied upon the fact that the samples were always attended or locked in the on-site sample preparation facility.  Chain-of-custody procedures consist of filling out sample submittal forms that are sent to the laboratory with sample shipments to make certain that all samples are received by the laboratory.
- · Sample preparation and analysis has been conducted by independent analytical laboratories.  Typically, Magma Metals drill programs from 2008 included insertion of blank, duplicate and standard reference material samples.  QA/QC submission rates meet industry-accepted standards of insertion rates.
- · A detailed data verification program was undertaken in support of the updated mineral resource estimate:
- -AMEC concludes that the collar, assay, and lithology data are adequate to support resource estimation.  AMEC noted some problems in all of these tables that should be addressed prior to completion of a pre-feasibility study.
- -AMEC concludes that adjustments should be made to the selected data in the down-hole survey table.  Those adjustments are required because of

Magma Metals Limited Thunder Bay North Polymetallic Project Ontario, Canada NI 43-101 Technical Report unreasonable changes in trajectory of the azimuths related, in general, to mixing data from different types of down-hole survey tools and theodolite data. Most of the problems occur at the collar of the hole, but there are examples at depth in some holes.  The source of the discrepancies is not known.

- -There appears to be a significant bias between the three major instruments used for down-hole surveys.  These biases should be investigated and adjustments made if the source of the discrepancy can be discovered.  The largest bias is between the RADTOOL and the MAXI2 tool.  This discrepancy appears to be on the order of 10  which is unacceptable.  The discrepancy o between the Reflex and MAXI2 tools is on the order of 5  which is about the o value used for declination, but the data appear to be properly corrected for declination.
- -Because of the identified problems, all of the down-hole survey data are suspect.  AMEC cannot ascertain, from the data provided, which type of downhole survey is accurately measuring the azimuth of the hole.  Most of the discrepancies will only result in location discrepancies of a few (&lt;10) meters, at most, but some discrepancies may be larger.  The biases between the survey types result in significant uncertainty as to the location of the holes.
- -AMEC believes that the data are useable, but will restrict resource classification below about 100 m to Inferred, at best, in the area of angle holes because of the uncertainty of the location of the information.  Vertical holes are not so dependent on azimuth corrections and will not be affected by this restriction.  The data will support a scoping study but should be investigated and corrected prior to undertaking a pre-feasibility study.
- -Analytical QA-QC data indicate that the assay data are sufficiently accurate and precise to support resource estimation.  Additional data such as pulp duplicate data would allow for more reliable estimates of precision and lower detection limits.
- · Comminution and flotation tests have been performed and indicate that a conventional process route is likely.  This will consist of ball mill grinding to a P80 of 86 µm, non-sulphide hydrophobic gangue pre-flotation, rougher iron sulphidePGM flotation and Ni-Cu rougher flotation, followed by three stages of cleaning.  A Knelson concentrator is likely to be added to the circuit.
- · Metallurgical testwork results are considered to generally support the achievability of the metal recoveries used to constrain the resource model.  Recoveries for the resource model were determined on preliminary metallurgical results; current testwork to July 2010, indicates that the assumptions are acceptable, but that actual recoveries may differ during operation.

- · Geological and grade shell models were developed that are appropriate to the deposits.  Models are based on vertical sections only; orthogonal and plan view interpretations should be developed to provide three-dimensional interpretations. For future resource estimates, the open pit high grade shell should be interpreted and modelled to 358100 E or farther, for the reason that the open pit grade threshold is more inclusive and may potentially result in additional open pit mineral resource volumes above cut-off.
- · Outlier studies indicated grade caps were warranted to restrict high grade samples. A combination of capping within the low-grade shells and outlier restriction within the high-grade shells, including massive sulphides, to reduce the predicted amounts of metal indicated by the capping studies.
- · Ordinary kriging was used as the estimator for Cu, MgO, Ni, Pd and Pt.  Inverse distance weighting to the first power was used for Ag, Au, Co and S.  A nearestneighbour interpolated block model was used as a means of creating declustered statistics for block model estimation validation.
- · Validation checks indicated no modelling errors or biases.
- · Confidence categories for mineral resource estimation were based on drill spacing studies, which supported classification of the mineralization as Inferred and Indicated Mineral Resources.
- · Two mining methods were considered appropriate, conventional open pit mining, and selective underground mining.  The underground mining may comprise either a cut-and-fill or drift-and-fill method, with voids backfilled.
- · Open pit mineral resources were confined using a L-G shell based on a 0.61 g/t PtEq  cut-off, underground  mineral  resources  were  confined  within  mineable shapes based on a 1.94 g/t PtEq cut-off.  Mineralization that was contained within these  shapes,  and  showed  geological  and  grade  continuity  was  considered  to have reasonable prospects of economic extraction.

The Mineral Resource estimate is sufficiently robust for Magma Metals to proceed with a preliminary assessment (PA) on the Project.

## 21.0 RECOMMENDATIONS

A two-phase work program is recommended for the Project, to support advancement of the Project to more detailed studies.  Magma Metals devised the programs, which AMEC reviewed.  AMEC concurs with the proposed work programs.

Phase 1 of the work program is based around additional drilling on the Project, two campaigns  of  which  have  already  commenced  and  completion  of  a  preliminary assessment study; this study is also underway.

Phase 2 of the work program is predicated on the results of Phase 1, and will consist of additional drilling, that will allow an updated mineral resource estimate that may be used to support more detailed studies.

The planned work programs are summarized in Table 21-1.

## 21.1 Phase 1

The Phase 1 program, depending on drill conditions, could take as long as six months, and cost approximately CAN$3.8 million.

## 21.1.1 Database and Data Collection

As a result of the data verification program on data collected on the Project to date, AMEC has proposed a number of recommendations that should be incorporated into Project activities.  AMEC recommends that Magma Metals:

- · Create  a  procedure  for  documenting  changes  to  lithology  codes  such  that  the documentation becomes part of the permanent Project record.
- · Evaluate all down-hole survey data prior to inclusion in the database.
- · Use  a  gyroscopic  tool  for  down-hole  surveys  in  all  drill  holes.    This  will  avoid problems caused by magnetite interfering with the Reflex and RADTOOL instruments.
- · Calibrate  down-hole  survey  instruments  on  a  rack  with  known  azimuth  and inclination prior to each use.  This may eliminate some of the erratic readings from the Reflex instrument if it continues to be used.

These recommendations should be incorporated into regular day-to-day practices.

Magma Metals Limited Thunder Bay North Polymetallic Project Ontario, Canada NI 43-101 Technical Report

## 21.1.2 Infill and Step-out Drilling

The mineralization defined to date within the Project requires additional infill drilling to better  delineate  the  extent  of  the  high-grade  massive  and  net-textured  sulphide mineralization occurrences, particularly in the Bridge Zone and west part of the Beaver Lake Zone.  The ongoing drill program, which commenced in late September, 2010, is testing a number of in-hole and off-hole bore hole EM-modelled plate conductors along the  north  margin  of  the  Beaver  Lake  Zone.    Based  on  an  inclusive  drilling  cost, including  assays  and  deviation  surveys,  of  $150/m,  Magma  Metals  estimates  that approximately 6,000 m of drilling in 27 core holes is required, at an approximate total cost of $0.9 million.  The holes are planned to be drilled on a 12.5 m by 10 m grid spacing.

The recently commenced drill program testing the South East Anomaly involves drilling to test the gravity and magnetics anomalies that extend from the Beaver Lake Zone eastwards into the South East Anomaly.  Based on an inclusive drilling cost of $150/m, Magma Metals estimates  that  approximately  6,000  m  of  drilling  in  six  core  holes  is required, at a cost of $0.9 million.  The initial six core holes are planned to be drilled at approximately 400 m intervals along the peak of the gravity anomaly.

Magma  Metals  is  planning  to  have  down-hole  and  surface  geophysical  surveys undertaken in order to detect any off-hole mineralization and better map the host unit in three-dimensional space.  The geophysical surveys are likely to include bore hole EM and bore hole MMR surveys, plus surface MMR and inductive source resistivity (ISR) surveys, at a total approximate cost of approximately $185,000.

Geological research studies are planned to be completed on the mineralization and the host unit.  Magma Metals plans to carefully select samples of drill core for petrographic description, and have such samples analysed via complete research-quality geochemical analyses.  Analyses will include the major PGE elements and the trace elements  rhodium,  ruthenium,  osmium  and  iridium.    The  budget  for  this  work  is estimated at about $50,000.

## 21.1.3 Exploration and Regional Drilling

Given  the  size  of  the  Project  and  the  number  of  prospective  target  areas  identified from  geophysical  data,  AMEC  recommends  that  exploration  and  regional  drilling should be continued, and concurs with the approach proposed by Magma Metals.  Key aims of the exploration drilling program should be continued exploration of previouslyidentified favourable host units at Steepledge Lake, Lone Island Lake, and the EastWest  Connector.    In  addition,  under-explored  areas  should  be  assessed  based  on

Project No.:  164115 October 2010

Magma Metals Limited Thunder Bay North Polymetallic Project Ontario, Canada NI 43-101 Technical Report reconnaissance  knowledge  and  generation  of  new  targets  should  be  undertaken through further geological and geophysical work and synthesis.

For the first  six  months,  exploration  work  programs  proposed by Magma Metals are likely to include about 11,500 m of drilling in approximately 50 core holes.  Assuming an  all-in  drilling  cost  of  $150  per  metre,  the  total  cost  of  the  drilling  program  is approximately $1.7 million.  Bore hole EM and ground magnetic surveys will be used as follow-up to the drill program; a budget of about $160,000.

## 21.1.4 Preliminary Assessment

A  preliminary  assessment  of  the  Project  is  underway.    The  Phase  1  work  program includes provision for the completion of the study, comprising allocations for engineering  studies,  completion  of  metallurgical  testwork,  baseline  environmental monitoring,  community  relations,  and  financial  modelling.    This  work  is  estimated  to take about two months to complete, at a total cost of approximately $400,000.

## 21.2 Phase 2 Work Program

The Phase 2 work program is estimated to require from 6-9 months to complete at a total cost of approximately CAN$3.3 million.

## 21.2.1 Infill and Step-out Drilling

Pending the results from Phase 1, Magma Metals plans to select a second cluster of bore hole EM-modelled plate conductors for infill drill testing.  The most likely area for such testing is in the vicinity of BL10-197.  Based on an inclusive drilling cost, including assays and deviation surveys, of $150/m, Magma Metals estimates that approximately 6,500  metres  of  drilling  in  25  holes  may  be  required,  at  a  total  cost  of  $1  million. Magma  Metals  plans  that  the  drilling  will  be  completed  on  a  12.5  m  by  10  m  grid spacing.  The proposed drilling will commence at 25 m spacing, with infill drilling at closer spacings as dictated by drill hole results.

Pending favourable results from the Phase 1 work program drilling at the South East Anomaly, Magma Metals plans to infill drill the 400 m-spaced core holes of the Phase 1 work program.  Based on an inclusive drilling cost of $150/m, AMEC estimates that approximately  4,300  metres  of  drilling  in  four  core  holes  is  required,  at  a  cost  of $645,000.  This program would narrow the drill spacing to 200 m along the peak of the gravity anomaly.

Magma Metals Limited Thunder Bay North Polymetallic Project Ontario, Canada NI 43-101 Technical Report

As  for  the  Phase  1  work  program,  Magma  Metals  plans  down-hole  and  surface geophysical surveys to be undertaken in order to detect any off-hole mineralization in the Bridge Zone and Beaver Lake Zone and to better map the host unit(s) within the area of the South East Anomaly.  The geophysical surveys are likely to include bore hole EM and bore hole MMR plus surface MMR/ISR tests, at a total budgeted cost of approximately $185,000.

Geological research studies are planned to be undertaken on samples of mineralized drill core and the host unit.  Magma Metals intends to have petrographical studies and research-quality geochemical analyses completed, including analysis of major elements with SiO2 and analysis of the trace elements rhodium, ruthenium, osmium, and iridium.  The budget for this work is about $50,000.

Additional SG  measurements  should  be  taken  on  Project  core,  and  comprise measurements  on  both  likely  waste  and  mineralized  materials.    This  program  is estimated to cost about $10,000.

At the completion of the drill program, all available information should be collated and verified in support of an updated mineral resource estimate.  AMEC estimates that the mineral resource update would cost approximately $100,000.

## 21.2.2 Exploration and Regional Drilling

Magma  Metals  has  planned  about  8,000  m  of  exploration  and  regional  drilling  to follow-up the results of the Phase 1 drilling, and to test new targets generated from additional  geological  and  geophysical  reviews.    Some  of  the  drilling  may  require helicopter support, due to limited accessibility.  Based on an approximate allocation of 5,000 m of conventional drilling at $150/m plus 3,000 m of helicopter-supported drilling at $200/m, Magma Metals estimates the total cost of the proposed Phase 2 exploration and regional drilling program to be $1.4 million.
