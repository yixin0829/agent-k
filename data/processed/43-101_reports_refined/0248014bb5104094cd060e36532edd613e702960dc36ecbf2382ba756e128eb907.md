## 1 SUMMARY

## 1.1 Introduction

Newcrest Mining Limited (Newcrest) has prepared this Technical Report (the Report) on the Red Chris Operations (Red Chris Operations or the Project), in British Columbia (BC), Canada.  The Project location is shown in Figure 2 1.

The  Red  Chris  Operations  are  managed  by  an  unincorporated  joint  venture,  the Newcrest  Red  Chris  Joint  Venture,  between  Newcrest  Red  Chris  Mining  Limited,  a wholly-owned Newcrest subsidiary, and Red Chris Development Company Ltd. a whollyowned subsidiary of Imperial Metals Corporation (Imperial).  Newcrest has a 70% joint venture interest through Newcrest Red Chris Mining Limited, and is Project manager. Imperial has a 30% interest.

The  Red  Chris  Operations  are  an  open  pit  operation,  producing  10-11 Mt/a  ore. Newcrest  plans  to  transition  to  a  block  cave  underground  mining  operation  that  will produce 13.6 Mt/a.  This Report discusses the remaining open pit life-of-mine (LOM) plan, and the results of the 'Red Chris Block Cave Pre-Feasibility Study' (the 2021 PFS) evaluating the proposed block cave (the block cave project).

## 1.2 Terms of Reference

This  Report  supports  Newcrest's  disclosures  in  the  news  release  dated  12  October, 2021, entitled 'Red Chris Block Cave Pre-Feasibility Study confirms Tier 1 potential'.

The Report also supports Imperial's disclosures in the news release dated 11 October, 2011, entitled 'Red Chris Block Cave Pre-Feasibility Study Confirms Low Cost, Long Life'.

For the purposes of this Report, the name Newcrest is used interchangeably for the Newcrest  parent,  Newcrest  operating  subsidiary  and  the  Newcrest  Red  Chris  Joint Venture.

All  measurement  units  used  in  this  Report  are  metric  unless  otherwise  noted,  and currency is expressed in United States (US$) or Canadian (C$) dollars as identified in the text.  Cost estimates for the open pit operations are generally reported in US$, and the 2021 PFS costs for the proposed block cave project are typically in C$.

Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves were initially classified using the 2012 edition of the Australasian Joint Ore Reserves Committee (JORC) Code (2012 JORC Code).

## 1.3 Project Setting

The  Red  Chris  Operations  are  a  copper-gold  open  pit  mining  operation  located  in northwest British Columbia, Canada, approximately 18 km southeast of the Iskut village, 80 km south of Dease Lake, and 12 km east of the Stewart-Cassiar Highway 37.

Road access to the Project area from Highway 37 is via an 18 km-long gravel road.  Most of the Project is accessible only by foot or by helicopter.

The nearest airports with regular commercial flights are in Terrace and Smithers, each approximately 500 km to the south.  The Dease Lake airport, approximately 80 km to the north via BC Highway 37, is the transit point for the fly-in/fly-out operations.  Chartered aircraft fly employees to the Dease Lake airstrip from where they are transported by bus to the mine site.

A range of infrastructure and associated facilities are available in Terrace and Smithers. Dease Lake is the service and government centre for residents of the region.  Stewart is the nearest port with ship loading facilities, a distance of 320 km by road from the Red Chris Operations.

The climate in the Project area is northern temperate with moderately warm summers and  cold  dry  winters.    Mining  operations  are  conducted  on  a  year-round  basis. Exploration activities can be temporarily curtailed by winter conditions.

The Project is situated on the eastern portion of the Todagin upland plateau that forms a subdivision of the Klastine plateau along the northern margin of the Skeena Mountains. Elevations  on  the  plateau  are  typically  1,500  ±  30  m,  with  relatively  flat  topography broken by several deep creek gullies.

Vegetation consists of spruce and balsam forest cover with stands of aspens and scrub conifers at the lower elevations while buckbrush, willow and slide alder are common along the steep-sided, incised creek valleys.  At higher elevations dwarf birch, willow and balsam dominate.  Above the tree line at about the 1,370 m elevation contour, alpine grasses and flowers are the predominant vegetation.

The Red Chris Operations are located within the territory of the Tahltan Nation.  The Tahltan collectively hold rights to hunt, fish, trap and harvest berries and other food and medicinal plants throughout their asserted traditional territory.  Tahltan members of local communities traditionally hunt moose, caribou, sheep, goat and groundhog in the Project vicinity.

The  mine  area  falls  within  the  area  covered  in  the  Cassiar  Iskut  Stikine  Land  and Resource Management Plan.  Exploration and development for minerals and energy, including development of road access, are acceptable activities throughout the plan area outside of protected areas, subject to regulations or statutes.

## 1.4 Mineral Tenure, Surface Rights, Water Rights, Royalties and Agreements

The Project comprises the Red Chris Main claim group and the Red Chris South claim group.  The two groups collectively consist of 77 mineral tenures covering a total area of approximately 23,142 ha.  The main tenures for purposes of the LOM plan are five mining leases issued on 20 June 2012, for a term of 30 years, with an expiry date of 20 June 2042.

All land in the immediate vicinity of the Red Chris Operations is Crown land.  Surface rights  to  support  the  open  pit  operations  are  permitted  by the  granted  Environmental Assessment Certificate and permit M-240 issued pursuant to the Mines Act .    Permit amendments would be required to support planned underground mining activities.

Applications for groundwater licences under the Water Sustainability Act were submitted and are under review by the Ministry of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations &amp; Rural Development (FLNRORD) for new and existing groundwater use for 'Mining Use' (tailings impoundment area (TIA) production wells) and for groundwater existing use for 'Industrial Purpose' (camp wells).

An Impact, Benefit and Co-Management Agreement (IBCA) between the Tahltan Central Government, the Iskut First Nation, the Tahltan Band and the Red Chris Operations is in place.  The IBCA was restated and amended on 15 August 2019 in connection with Newcrest's acquisition of its interest in the Project.  The IBCA provides the basis for a life-of-mine partnership covering royalties, education, training, employment, contracting opportunities, capacity support, provisions for communication, and interaction on social and environmental matters.

## 1.5 Geology and Mineralization

The  Red  Chris  deposit  is  considered  to  be  an  example  of  a  porphyry  copper-gold deposit.

The regional geological setting comprises island arc volcanic, sedimentary, and plutonic rocks of the Middle to Late Triassic Stuhini Group, the Early to Middle Jurassic Hazelton Group, and the Middle and Upper Jurassic to Lower Cretaceous Bowser Lake Group, which form the accreted geological terrane of Stikinia in the northern Intermontane Belt of  the  Canadian  Cordillera.    Several  large  calc-alkalic  Late  Triassic  plutons  (Stikine suite), including the Red Stock, host to the Red Chris deposit, cut the Stuhini Group.

The Red Stock is about 8 km long by 1.5 km wide at surface, and elongate in the eastnortheast direction.  It is divided into three main intrusive phases.  Several significant faults cut the Red Stock, influence patterns of mineralisation and alteration, and involve late mineral and/or post-mineral displacement.

The Red Chris deposit is about 3.4 km in strike length, 0.3 km in width and over 1.3 km in vertical extent.  There are two main zones, East and Main.  The Main zone is 1,200 m in strike length, 300 m width and has been drill tested to 1,300 m depth.  The East zone is 1,200 m in strike length, 300 m in width and has been drill tested to 1,400 m depth.

Mineralisation consists of thin wavy or thicker planar quartz veins containing chalcopyrite, bornite and magnetite.  These minerals are also disseminated outside the veins.  In the upper part of the deposit, the bornite rich mineralisation was overprinted by -sericite  and  clay  alteration  and  associated  sulphidation.    Gold  occurs as microscopic inclusions in the copper sulphides, and occasionally as free grains in high-grade zones.

## 1.6 History

Prior  to  Newcrest  acquiring  its  Project  interest,  companies  that  had  been  actively exploring  in  the  Project  area  included:    Bolero  Resources  Corporation,  Conwest Exploration Ltd., Great Plains Development Company of Canada Ltd. (Great Plains), Silver Standard Mines Ltd. (Silver Standard), Ecstall Mining Limited (Ecstall), Texasgulf

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Canada  Ltd.  (Texasgulf),  Dryden  Resource  Corp.  (Dryden),  Falconbridge;  Norcen Energy; Teck Corporation, American Bullion Minerals Ltd. (American Bullion), bcMetals Corporation (bcMetals), and Imperial. From 1956-2018, activities included: reconnaissance  and  geological  mapping;  geochemical  sampling  (soil,  rock  chip, trenches);  geophysical  surveys  (induced  polarization,  ground  magnetic,  very  low frequency electromagnetic, seismic, direct current induced polarization and magnetotellurics,  borehole  acoustic  televiewer  surveys);  core  drilling;  metallurgical testwork; mineral resource and mineral reserve estimates; acid base accounting studies; baseline  environmental  studies;  petrographic  studies;  water  bore  and  condemnation drilling in support of mine development; environmental studies and surveys in support of project permitting; and mining studies.  Imperial commenced mine construction in May 2012, and was completed May 2014.  The first full year of open pit mine production was 2016.

Newcrest acquired a 70% interest in the Red Chris Operations in 2019.  Work conducted since that date includes updates to Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve estimates, internal mining studies to assess potential block caving operations, additional environmental and supporting studies, core drilling, geophysical surveys (ZTEM, gravity, magnetics) and completion of the 2021 PFS.

Production from 2015 to Q3 2021 totalled 66 Mt processed, generating 491 Mlb copper, 305 koz gold and 962 koz silver contained in concentrates.

## 1.7 Drilling and Sampling

Project-wide,  a  total  of  1,477  drill  holes  and  test  pits  (about  400,974  m),  has  been completed.  Core drilling is the predominant drill type.

A total of 487 core holes  (287,535 m) support the Mineral Resource estimates, from the Texasgulf, American Bullion, bcMetals, Imperial, and Newcrest drill programs.

Core sizes included PQ3 (83.1 mm core diameter) HQ (63.5 mm), HQ3 (61.1 mm), NQ (47.6 mm), NQ3 (45.1 mm), and BQTK (40.7 mm).

Geological logging varied by operator.  During Imperial and Newcrest programs, data collected included qualitative descriptions of lithology, alteration, mineralisation, veining, and structure, including orientation of key geological features.  The geotechnical data collected included core recovery, rock quality designation (RQD), fracture counts, core strength, and overall ratings, with special attention paid to the occurrence of slickensides and fault gouge.  All drill cores were photographed, prior to cutting and/or sampling the core.  Magnetic susceptibility readings were taken.  Core recovery is close to 100% and the sample quality is considered to be excellent.

Drill collar locations were surveyed using either total station or global positioning system instruments.  Down-hole surveys were performed using Reflex or TruShot tools.

In the opinion of the QP, the quantity and quality of the logged geological data, collar, and  downhole  survey  data  collected  in  the  exploration  and  infill  drill  programs  are sufficient  to  support  Mineral  Resource  and  Mineral  Reserve  estimation  and  mine planning.

Prior to Imperial acquiring the Project, the length of the sampled interval depended upon geological  rock  contacts,  core  size,  and  changes  in  mineral  intensity,  but  generally averaged 3 m with NQ core and 2 m with HQ core.  During Imperial's programs, sample

<!-- image -->

intervals were marked at 2.5 m (maximum) intervals starting from zero, or less if required by major geological contacts.  Where a geological contact affected the grade distribution, the geologist would mark a sample contact at the geological contact as well.  During the Newcrest programs, core was cut using a manual or automatic core-cutter and half core sampled at 2 m intervals.  Cover sequences were not sampled.

Density data were obtained using the Archimedes method.  Several thousand density measurements support Mineral Resource estimation.

Third-party, independent analytical and sample preparation laboratories have included Min-En Laboratories, Smithers, BC; Chemex Laboratories Ltd., North Vancouver, BC; International  Plasma  Laboratory  Ltd.,  Vancouver  BC;  ALS  Chemex,  Vancouver,  BC (successor  to  Chemex);  Acme  Laboratories,  Vancouver  BC;  and  Bureau  Veritas Commodities Canada Ltd., Vancouver, BC.  Imperial used the Mt Polley and Red Chris mine laboratories, which are not independent, for check assaying and grade control, respectively.

Sample preparation and analytical methods varied over time.  Early sample preparation consisted of crushing to minus ¼ inch, and pulverizing to 95% passing 150 mesh; or crushing to -10 mesh, and pulverizing to 95% passing 150 mesh.  More recently, sample preparation consisted of crushing to 80% passing a nominal 3-5 mm, and pulverizing to 85% passing 200 mesh, and crushing to 95% passing 4.75 mm, and pulverizing to 95% passing 106 μ m.

Initially copper assays were performed using atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) on a three- or four-acid digest.  Later, copper and iron were analysed by inductively coupled plasma (ICP) atomic emission spectroscopy (AES) with an aqua-regia digestion.  During early programs, gold was assayed using fire assay on a 30 g or one assay ton sample weight.    Later  programs  used  a  30  g  sample  by  fire  assay  with  an  ICP-AES  finish. Selected  samples  were  analysed  using  a  30-,  31-,  36-  or  48-element  suite  via  ICP. Carbon and sulphur were determined by Leco.

QA/QC procedures were in place for the Imperial and Newcrest drill programs.  The process  generally  involved  submission  and  analysis  of  standard  reference  materials (SRMs), blanks, and duplicates.  Newcrest conducted a detailed QA/QC review of the data in the database as at end-February 2021.  Drilling results  reviewed were primarily from  the  Imperial  (2007-2018)  and  Newcrest  (2019-2021)  campaigns.    Overall,  the dataset is acceptable for use in preparing a Mineral Resource estimate for copper and gold.

The  Red  Chris  Operations  assay  and  geological  data  are  electronically  loaded  into acQuire and the database is replicated in Newcrest's centralised database system in Melbourne.  The database is regularly backed up, and copies are stored both offsite and in Newcrest facilities.

Sample  security  at  the  Red  Chris  Operations  has  not  historically  been  monitored. Sample collection from drill point to laboratory relies upon the fact that samples are either always attended to, or stored in the locked on-site preparation facility, or stored in a secure area prior to laboratory shipment.  Chain-of-custody procedures consist of sample submittal forms to be sent to the laboratory with sample shipments to ensure that all samples are received by the laboratory.

In the opinion of the QP, the sample preparation, analysis, and security practices, data collection,  and  quality  are  acceptable,  meet  industry-standard  practices,  and  are

<!-- image -->

adequate  to  support  Mineral  Resource  and  Mineral  Reserve  estimation  and  mine planning purposes.

## 1.8 Data Verification

Over 90% of the Imperial assay data were electronically loaded into acQuire from the original laboratory assay files.  Historical assay data prior to Imperial's Project interest were  imported  and  validated  as  part  of  verification  in  support  of  technical  reports prepared under NI 43-101.

Newcrest includes both internal and third-parties in the data verification steps:

- · Internal  verification:    laboratory  inspections;  review  of  geological  procedures, resource models and drill plans; sampling protocols, flow sheets and data storage; specific gravity data; logging consistency, down hole survey, collar coordinate and assay QA/QC data; geology and mineralisation interpretation;
- · External  verification:    a  number  of  data  verification  programs  were  conducted  in support of technical reports on the Project, from 2004-2021.  These indicated, that at the time each database iteration was reviewed, there were no significant issues that  would  have  precluded  Mineral  Resource  estimation  or  imposed  confidence classification limits on certain data support.

The QP reviewed the reports and is of the opinion that the data verification programs indicate that the data stored in the Project database accurately reflect original sources and  are  adequate  to  support  geological  interpretations  and  Mineral  Resource  and Mineral Reserve estimation, and in mine planning.

Observations made during the QP's site visit, in conjunction with discussions with sitebased technical staff also support the QP's conclusion that Newcrest's processes for geological  interpretations,  and  analytical  and  database  quality  are  being  followed. Adequate steps were undertaken to verify assay data prior to Newcrest's Project interest.

## 1.9 Metallurgical Testwork

## 1.9.1 Open Pit

The Red Chris process plant was commissioned on open pit ore in 2015.  Testwork on the open pit ores was primarily completed at G&amp;T Metallurgical Services in Kamloops, BC during 2004.

The metallurgical testwork on open pit ores supporting the current process plant design included mineralogy, grind size tests, batch flotation tests, locked cycle flotation tests (pulp density, pH, reagent dosage, flotation residence time and grind size effects), gravity concentration  testwork,  ball  mill  and  rod  mill  grinding  work  index  tests,  evaluation  of metallurgical variation between the Main and East zones, and a pilot plant program.  The testwork indicated that a conventional grinding and flotation process plant design could be used.

Recovery predictions made prior to Newcrest's Project interest were significantly higher than  seen  in  actuality  from  the  plant.    Newcrest  performed  two  orebody  knowledge programs to more reliably predict the performance of the remaining ore in the open pit.

Recovery for copper and gold are defined by four metallurgical domains with recovery formulas  being  a  function  of  the  gold  and  copper  grade  in  combination  with  the  mill production rate.  The LOM copper recovery was estimated to be 79% and gold recovery was estimated to be 51% within the Mineral Reserves amenable to open pit mining.

The equation used to forecast the copper recovery is:

- · Cu recovery = (9.7*Cu Head Grade * 100 + 80.224) / 100 * 0.945 - 0.39 / 100

Where the copper head grade format is, for example, 0.40%.

The equation used to forecast the gold recovery is:

- · Gold recovery = (1.859 + 0.124 * LN (Au head grade) - 0.169 * LN (1403)) * 0.95 Where the gold head grade is in g/t.  LN = natural log.

These regression equations are informed by plant recovery performance data.

## 1.9.2 Block Cave Underground

Laboratories used since 2019 include Base Met Laboratories in Kamloops, BC, ALS Laboratories in Burnaby, BC and Amtel in London, ON.

Testwork completed in support of the 2021 PFS consisted of mineralogy; comminution tests  (hardness  (hardness  index  testing  (HIT);  JK  breakage  parameters  (Axb);  semiautogenous  grind  (SAG)  mill  comminution  (SMC)),  SAG  mill  specific  energy,  Bond indices (drop weight index (DWi), Bond ball mill work index (BWi)), abrasion index (Ai), specific  gravity);  gravity-recoverable  gold;  flotation  optimization  tests;  open  circuit cleaner  at  standard  and  optimized  conditions;  rougher  flotation;  re-grind;  cleaner flotation; locked cycle tests; concentrate dewatering; HydroFloat; and material classification for environmental purposes.  The testwork completed is adequate to ensure an  appropriate  representation  of  metallurgical  characterisation  and  the  derivation  of corresponding metallurgical recovery factors for the open pit mineralization.  The 2021 PFS metallurgical testwork program confirmed that a flowsheet incorporating crushing, grinding, flotation, and concentrate dewatering was suitable for the mineralization within the planned block cave.

Recoveries for copper are a function of the copper grades in combination with the mill production rate.  In the case of gold recoveries, the gold to sulphur ratio is the primary factor impacting plant recoveries.

A linear model with head grade was fitted to the copper recovery data at a grind size P80 of 150 µm; a maximum of 92% copper recovery was applied to the equation as a logical constraint:

- · Copper recovery (%) ~= 76.5 + 11.9*Cu (maximum copper recovery of 92%)

Where: Cu = copper head grade in percent.

This recovery equation gives a LOM average recovery range of 81-86%.

The block cave samples show significantly higher gold recovery than open pit material at equivalent head grades as well as greater variance.  The predictive equation for gold recovery of the block cave ore at a grind size P80 of 150 µm is:

- · Gold recovery (%) ~= 72.5 + 9.3 * LN (Au/S)

Where: Au = head grade in g/t, and S = sulphur head grade in percent.  LN = natural log.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

The  forecast  LOM  average  recovery  range  for  gold  for  the  mineralization  within  the proposed block cave is 60-75%.

The underground variability program showed that most ore samples had lower pyrite content than open pit ores, and some had secondary copper minerals such as bornite. Results indicated that, on average, concentrate grades  in the second  cleaner concentrate in laboratory tests exceeded the current operational target of 23% Cu.  A maximum of 28% Cu was assumed in regressions to predict concentrate grade.  It is possible that the favourable mineralogy of underground ores could result in still higher concentrate grades from time to time.

The equation is:

- · Copper grade in concentrate (% Cu) ~= 13.2+21.8 * Cu:S in feed (minimum 23%, maximum, 28%)

Where: Cu  = copper head grade in percent, and S = sulphur head grade in percent.

Deleterious elements potentially include mercury and antimony.  The current limit for mercury  penalty  payment  is  40  ppm  in  concentrate.    Approximately  one-third  of  the mercury in the plant feed is highly floatable and will be recovered to copper concentrate. However,  indications  are  that  most  underground  ores  are  not  expected  to  produce concentrates that would trigger penalty mercury levels.  These observations are based on a combination of laboratory testwork results as well as predictions from underground mine plan mercury head grades.

Antimony has generally been observed in open pit and underground concentrates at levels below those that would trigger a penalty (0.01%).

## 1.10 Mineral Resource Estimation

The key lithologies are the porphyry units (P1, P2, P3), the Stuhini Group volcanic and sedimentary rocks, the Bowser Lake Group, and the mafic dykes.  The mafic dykes were not modelled separately at the block model scale, as they are narrow and discontinuous. The other lithologies were modelled.  A geologically-based six-domain alteration model was built for the East Zone using Leapfrog software, based on drill hole logging data, photo relogs, assays, and Corescan data.  A geologically-based five-domain sulphide model was built  using  Leapfrog  software  based  on  drill  hole  data  that  was  primarily collected by Newcrest.  Due to the diffusive nature of the porphyry, the copper and gold mineralisation are primarily within the different porphyry phases, rather than within the major alteration zones; hence, the lithology domains were used in estimation.

Geostatistical  analysis  was  conducted  to  review  individual  elements  and  correlations between elements.  Contact plots were constructed to determine boundary constraints between  domains.    Histogram  plots  were  constructed  in  support  of  grade  capping evaluation.    Both  copper  and  gold  had  positively  skewed  distributions.    Density  data approximated a normal distribution.

Sampling was typically on 2.5 m intervals, which were composited to 12 m lengths.  The 12  m  composite  length  was  considered  appropriate  for  the  mineralization  style  and matches the vertical dimension (RL) of the selective mining unit.

Bulk  density  data  were  interpolated  using  an  inverse  distance  weighting  to  the  third power (ID3) interpolation.  No grade caps were imposed on the gold or copper data.

However, to make sure that the potential smearing of outlier grades was reduced, a grade and distance restriction was applied to selected variables during the estimation process.

Variograms for the Red Stock domains were run on copper, gold, silver, iron, sulphur, mercury,  antimony  and  arsenic.    Kriging  neighbourhood  analysis  was  carried  out  to determine  the  appropriate  estimation neighbourhood  parameters  for  use  in  the estimation of copper and gold.

Estimation used a panel block size of 80 mE x 80 mN x 12 mRL and a selective mining unit block size of 20 mE x 20 mN x 12 mRL.  Two block models were constructed, the first with the selective mining unit size and the second with the panel size.  The domains were initially flagged using MineSight software at the selective mining unit size, then the flagged  block  model  was  imported  to  Isatis.    All  estimation  was  performed  in  Isatis software.

In the Red Stock domain, the following steps were undertaken:

- · Estimate copper, gold, iron and sulphur using a three-dimensional ordinary krige (OK) and uniform conditioning method;
- · Estimate calcium and magnesium using a three-dimensional co-ordinary krige and multivariate uniform conditioning method;
- · Localize the uniform conditioning and multivariate uniform conditioning results to the selective mining unit;
- · Estimate silver, arsenic, antimony, mercury and carbon to the selective mining unit.

The remaining three domains, sediment, volcanic and Bowser, were estimated using the following:

- · Three-dimensional OK or co-ordinary kriging to estimate copper, gold, silver, iron, sulphur, arsenic, antimony and mercury grades;
- · Carbon was estimated using OK in the sediment and volcanic domains;
- · Carbon was estimated using a nearest-neighbour method in the Bowser domain.

Validation checks included examination of the block model and composites in plan and section views, domain level statistical checks, global statistical checks, comparison of the estimated value with a metal-at-risk analysis for copper and gold, comparison of the multivariate  correlation  of  the  input  value  and  the  block  estimate,  discrete  Gaussian models, and conditional simulation models (swath plots).  All checks indicated that the estimates were acceptable.

The Mineral Resource was classified based on an evaluation of factors including search strategy,  number of informing composites, average distance weighting of composites from blocks, kriging quality parameters, geological and grade continuity, drill spacing and drill data quality, mining method and mining selectivity, and mining rate and cut-off value. Classifications included:

- · No Measured Mineral Resources were classified for material other than stockpiles. Stockpile classifications are supported by grade control models;
- · An Indicated Mineral Resource was classified where the average weighted distance between informing data was &lt;100 m, and the slope of regression was &gt;0.7;

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

- · An  Inferred  Mineral  Resource  was  classified  where  the  block  was  outside  the Indicated classification, the average weighted distance of the informing data was &lt;175 m, and the slope of regression was &gt;0.4.

Mineral  Resources  were  estimated  assuming  both  open  pit  and  underground  mining methods.

The  Mineral  Resources  potentially  amenable  to  open  pit  mining  methods  were constrained within a pit shell that assumed the following:

- · Conventional truck and shovel operation;
- · 11 Mt/a mining rate;
- · Copper price:  US$3.40/lb;
- · Gold price:  US$1,400/oz;
- · Exchange rate:  C$:US$ of 0.80;
- · Unit  cost  assumptions  of  C$2.27/t  mining,  C$0.15/t  stockpile  rehandle,  C$7.72/t processing,  C$4.33/t  G&amp;A,  with  off-site  concentrate  transport,  treatment,  and refining costs included in the net smelter return (NSR);
- · LOM average metallurgical recoveries range from 50-61% for gold and 81-83% for copper;
- · Overall pit slope angles range from 34-46º;
- · Relative level restriction of 1,112 mRL to define the open pit to underground interface at approximately 50 m below the current LOM open pit design;
- · NSR  marginal  cut-off  value  of  C$12.20/t  to  meet  processing  and  general  and administrative (G&amp;A) costs.

The  Mineral  Resources  potentially  amenable  to  underground  mining  methods  were constrained within a conceptual cave footprint based on a potentially economic outline determined by the NSR of each block in the resource model below the open pit shell, assuming the following parameters:

- · A mass mining method (block cave or sub-level cave) with no internal selectivity, hence the entire in situ contents of the outline were reported;
- · 13.6 Mt/a mining rate;
- · Copper price:  US$3.40/lb;
- · Gold price:  US$1,400/oz;
- · Exchange rate:  C$:US$ of 0.80;
- · Unit cost assumptions of C$6.56/t mining, C$10.05/t processing, C$4.33/t G&amp;A, with off-site concentrate transport, treatment, and refining costs included in the NSR;
- · LOM average metallurgical recoveries range from 50-61% for gold and 81-83% for copper;
- · Underground footprint based on a minimum approximate footprint of 160 x 160 m area with vertical walls and variable height of draw;

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

- · NSR breakeven cut-off value of C$21.00/t to meet mining, processing, and G&amp;A costs.

Both estimates assume that the process method will be a conventional sulphide flotation producing a gold-bearing copper concentrate, and that there will be no penalties imposed on the concentrate.

## 1.11 Mineral Resource Statement

Mineral Resource estimates are reported with an effective date of 30 June, 2021, and are  reported  inclusive  of  those  Mineral  Resources  converted  to  Mineral  Reserves. Mineral Resources that are not Mineral Reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability.

Mineral Resources are tabulated in Table 1-1 for the Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources and in Table 1-2 for the Inferred Mineral Resources.  Mineral Resources were estimated as at 31 March 2021, and depleted to 30 June 2021.

The Qualified Person for the estimate is Mr. Rob Stewart, FAusIMM, whose job title at Newcrest is Group Manager Resources.  Mr. Stewart is a Newcrest employee.

Factors  that  may  affect  the  Mineral  Resource  estimate  include  changes  in  local interpretations of mineralization geometry and continuity of mineralized zones; changes to  geological  and  grade  shape  and  geological  and  grade  continuity  assumptions; changes to metallurgical recovery assumptions; changes to the input assumptions used to derive the conceptual open pit used to constrain the estimate; changes to the input assumptions for assumed block caving operations; changes to the NSR cut-offs applied to the estimates; variations in geotechnical, hydrogeological and mining assumptions; forecast dilution; and changes to environmental, permitting and social license assumptions.

## 1.12 Mineral Reserve Estimation

Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources were converted to Proven and Probable Mineral Reserves with the application of modifying factors.  Inferred Mineral Resources were set to waste.  Mineral Reserves were estimated using open pit and block cave underground mining assumptions.

## 1.12.1 Open Pit

Mineral  Reserves  were  estimated  from  the  resource  block  model  with  the  following modifying factors:

- · Pit design volumes (phase triangulations) for Phase 5, Phase 7 and Phase 8;
- · Material routing (Codee) variable, which was the value descriptor for material routing and  used  in financial year (FY) FY22Q1  operating  and  sustaining capital assumptions used for net smelter return (NSR) calculations;
- · Ore types were based on marginal, break-even and elevated cut-offs.  An NSR script calculated the value of each block model block by determining revenue after element recovery and selling costs.  Six ore types were differentiated;

- · Dilution was assumed to be fully accounted for in the resource block model.  No ore loss or dilution was applied to the Mineral Reserves.

## 1.12.2 Block Cave Underground

Three macroblocks (MBs) were defined, MB1, MB2 and MB3.  Two mining throughputs were reviewed, one, the Central Case (that forms the base case) at 13.6 Mt/a, and the second, Upside Case (that forms an alternative case) at 15 Mt/a.  The macroblocks were sized  and  designed  to  produce  up  to  15  Mt/a,  except  for  MB2,  which  had  a  limit  of 7.0 Mt/a applied.  Although the block cave has the potential to produce at a higher rate, the  production  rate  was  governed  by  the  planned  capacity  of  the  process  plant  and potential upgrades.

Mining boundaries were determined using the commercially-available PCBC   software   to evaluate the potential column values over various elevations and over an extended area.

A  shut-off  value  of  C$21.00/t  was  used  to  determine  the  footprint  boundaries.    Two footprint options were designed, a traditional post undercut block cave and a single pass cave establishment, which eliminates the undercut level.  The post undercut method was the base case, as the single pass cave establishment is still under trial at Newcrest's Cadia East operation.

A specified shut-off value was subsequently used for each block and draw column:

- · MB1:  C$22.00/t milled;
- · MB2:  C$22.80/t milled;
- · MB3:  C$22.80/t milled.

MB1 caving will be initiated from the northwest corner of the footprint in order to avoid the  principal  stress  being  parallel  or  sub-parallel  to  the  caving  front.    MB2  caving  is planned to start from the northeast corner towards the southwest.  MB3 caving will be initiated from the southeast corner of the footprint towards the northwest.

Dilution was modelled using the external drawpoint method to simulate surface toppling, rilling, and open pit failure.  Dilution was defined as material below C$20.70/t that enters the planned ore extraction via mixing.  Dilution accounts for about 5.0% of the tonnage (approximately 20.2 Mt).

## 1.13 Mineral Reserve Statement

Mineral  Reserves  for  the  Red  Chris  Operations  were  reported  using  the  confidence categories set out in the 2014 CIM Definition Standards.

Mineral Reserves are reported with an effective date of 30 June 2021 in Table 1-3.

Notes to Accompany Red Chris Mineral Reserves Table:

- 1. Mineral Reserves are reported with an effective date of 30 June, 2021, using the 2014 CIM Definition Standards.  The Qualified Person responsible for the estimate of the Mineral Reserves amenable to open pit mining methods and in stockpiles is Mr. Brett Swanson, MMSAQP, and the Qualified Person responsible for the estimate of the Mineral Reserves amenable to underground block cave mining methods is Mr. Michael Sykes, FAusIMM, both of whom are Newcrest employees.
- 2. Mineral Reserves are reported on a 100% basis.  Newcrest holds a 70% interest in the Red Chris Joint Venture.
- 3. Mineral Reserves that will be mined using open pit mining methods are constrained within a pit design that uses the following input assumptions:  metal prices of US$3.00/lb Cu, US$1,300/oz Au; metallurgical recoveries that average 79% for copper and 51% for gold; mining costs of C$3.2/t mined, and process and general and administrative (G&amp;A) costs of C$12.5/t processed; and pit slope angles that range from 34-46º.

- 5. Tonnages are metric tonnes.  Gold ounces and copper tonnes are estimates of in-situ metal and do not include allowances for processing losses.
- 6. Rounding as required by reporting guidelines may result in apparent differences between tonnes, grade and contained metal content.  Rounding is to two significant figures.

Factors that may affect the Mineral Reserve estimates include changes to long-term gold and  copper  price  assumptions;  changes  to  exchange  rate  assumptions;  changes  to metallurgical recovery assumptions; changes to the input assumptions used to design the optimized open pit shell; changes to the input assumptions used to derive the cave outlines  and  the  mine  plan  that  is  based  on  those  cave  designs;  changes  to  include operating, and capital assumptions used, including changes to input cost assumptions such as consumables, labour costs, royalty and taxation rates; variations in geotechnical, mining, dilution and processing recovery assumptions; including changes to designs as a  result  of  changes  to  geotechnical,  hydrogeological,  and  engineering  data  used; changes to the NSR cut-off criteria used to constrain the open pit estimates; changes to the  shut-off  criteria  used  to  constrain  the  underground  estimates;  changes  to  the assumed  permitting  and  regulatory  environment  under  which  the  mine  plan  was developed;  ability  to  maintain  mining  permits  and/or  surface  rights;  ability  to  obtain mining permits and environmental approvals for underground mining, and the ability to maintain social and environmental license to operate.

Factors that are risk-specific to block cave operations, and which may affect the Mineral Reserves include:  inrush of water into the underground workings including decline, cave levels and infrastructure areas; poorer rock mass quality and quantity than interpreted; inability to achieve planned decline development rates having impact on schedule and cost; incorrect estimation of cave propagation potentially leading to air blast; and damage to mine workings due to a seismic event.

## 1.14 Mining Methods

## 1.14.1 Open Pit

Open pit operations are conducted using conventional methods and a conventional truck and shovel fleet.

Golder  Associates  (Golder)  defined  six  geotechnical  domains  within  the  open  pit. Recommended inter-ramp angles ranged from 41.9-52.8º.  These were adjusted to take the pit ramps into account, leading to designed slope angles from 34-46º.  The greatest area of concern for pit stability is on the southern wall and in particular the Bowser Lake Group sediments.  Two areas that show a factor of safety risk are associated with the Bowser Lake Group sediments near the pit crest, and are only problematic with elevated pore water pressures.

The majority of the water presenting to the open pit is derived from precipitation falling directly  onto  the  pit  walls.    Groundwater  is  sourced  from  infiltration  into  near  surface weathered country rock and open structures.  Water management in the pit is based around the use of surface drains to direct water from the benches and ramp towards sumps at the base of the pit from where it is pumped into the production circuit, either directly to the mill or TIA storage.  No active or passive groundwater drainage is currently installed within the pit.

Pit optimization used the revenue factor 0.98 pit.  The designs resulted in three remaining pit phases, Phase 5 and Phase 8 in the East zone and Phase 7 in the Main zone.

Non-acid generating (NAG) rock is used to line the waste rock storage facilities (WRSFs) and  for  construction  purposes.    Potentially-acid  generating  (PAG)  rock  is  sent  to designated PAG WRSFs.  WRSF space is limited to 150 Mt unless other PAG disposal areas can be permitted.

The mine uses rotary blasthole drills, and 28 m³ electric hydraulic shovels loading 230 t capacity  haul  trucks  from  12  m  benches.    The  operation  is  supported  by  standard ancillary equipment including an 18 m³ front-end loader, track and rubber-tired-dozers, and graders.

Ore and waste are drilled and blasted together on 12 m benches and mined in a single pass.  Where practicable, walls are drilled with a pre-split to ensure stable wall rock conditions.

Ex-pit ore is allocated by gold and copper grade and either sent to the mill crusher pocket directly  or  sent  to  low-grade  or  mineralized  waste  stockpiles  (material  below  Mineral Reserve cut-off grade).

NAG rock is used to line the WRSF and for construction.  PAG rock is sent to designated PAG WRSFs.

## 1.14.2 Block Cave Underground

The  proposed  mine  plan  uses  technology  conventional  to  block  cave  operations, including mine design and equipment.  The planned mining equipment is conventional to block cave operations.

The ground conditions at Red Chris are interpreted to be 'very good', based on data collected from 2018-2020.  Six geotechnical domains were assessed for the proposed underground development and cave extents.  Cave fragmentation analyses concluded that  orebody  pre-conditioning  via  high  undercut,  blast,  and  hydraulic  means  will  be required due to the rock quality.  All pre-conditioning works will extend from the extraction level of the macroblocks to within 75 m of the ultimate floor of the open pit (580 m above the underground footprint).  Modelled cave subsidence shows no major risks with respect to surface mining infrastructure or surface features such as Kluea Lake.  Camp Creek may be impacted, and further study is required in terms of in-situ stress measurements and rock mass characterisation.  The creek may require diversion.  The crater limit will be at the end of the LOM, at year 34, and the crater depth will be 350-400 m below the bottom of the final pit.

The main source of water that will present to the underground was determined to come from  direct  precipitation  (rain  and  snowmelt)  flowing  through  the  caved  mass.    The planned water management capacity will range from 200 m 3 /hr during initial development to 1,500 m 3 /hr during mining of MB2 and MB3.

Each  macroblock  footprint  will  consist  of  an  extraction  level,  undercut  level,  and infrastructure development.  A single crusher and tipple arrangement will be used for all macroblocks.    A  perimeter  drive  on  the  extraction  and  undercut  level  will  provide extraction and drill drive access and ventilation to the working areas.  The footprint will be ventilated via the access decline and the 1,000 mRL return air raise via the 1,000 mRL access drive.  A series of internal ventilation raises will provide exhaust ventilation for the crusher, conveyor, and tipple areas.

Access  to  the  mine  will  be  via  two  declines:  the  exploration/access  and  conveyor declines.  The mine layout includes declines, ventilation infrastructure, footprint access, crusher location, and footprint layout.  Primary ventilation will be achieved through three fresh air intakes, both portals and VR3, and two exhaust raises, VR1 and VR2.

Extraction levels for all macroblocks are based on the standard extraction level layout using an El Teniente layout with spacing of 32 x 20 m, a 60° turn-out angle and 5.4 m wide x 4.6 m high drives.  Extraction levels will be accessed from the north of each block, with access from both east and west of each block (to extraction and undercut levels) with an additional two internal ramps to the undercut level.  The extraction level was designed so that all drives in the three macroblocks drain to the south, away from the mine infrastructure that will be located on the northeast corner of the footprint.

The undercut level will be 25 m above the extraction level to accommodate the high post undercut method by ramps up from the extraction level for each macroblock.  The slot drill drive will be 20 m from the closest drawbell, to allow appropriate stand-off.

The planned mining sequence is based on a combination of grade and geotechnical considerations.  MB1, which hosts the high-grade portion of the Mineral Reserve will be the first to be mined.  MB2 will be a southern extension of MB1, and with cave rules and stress orientation dictating that MB3 is opened from southeast to northwest, MB2 must be opened prior to MB3.

<!-- image -->

The proposed material handling system will include a single crusher to service the three macroblocks.  The footprint material handling system will direct feed the crusher with load-haul-dump vehicles (LHDs), with five tip points on the 500 mRL above a ROM bin leading to the crusher on the 450 mRL.  The crusher will be serviced by a five-tipple dump arrangement with a sixth access for ventilation and loader access to the rock box.

There will be an equal number of extraction drives reporting to each tipple from MB1 and MB2 to enable as high a production rate as possible with as little loader interaction as possible.  A dedicated haulage loop was designed for MB3 to access the western side of the tipple arrangement.

Crushed ore will be transferred to the decline conveyor via a fine ore bin, from where it will progress to the collection conveyor and the transfer station on the 420 mRL.  From the conveyor decline, ore will be transported to surface with additional transfer stations located at the 1,200 and 1,400 mRLs.

The mine will be ventilated by a 'pull' or exhausting type ventilation system and was designed based on the use of diesel equipment.  The primary mine ventilation fans will be located at the primary exhaust airways of the mine and will develop sufficient negative pressure  to  ensure  all  workplaces  are  supplied  with  the  required  fresh  air  such  that contaminants  are  removed  to  the  exhaust  air  system  and  ultimately  to  the  surface. Airflows  were  allocated  based  upon  maintaining  ventilation  for  all  concurrent  mine activities.

Heating will be employed.  The minimum targeted delivery air temperature for trafficable airways is 2°C.

The block cave mine will produce about 2.9 Mt of PAG waste, which will be stored on the existing permitted facilities.  NAG material will be used for site construction, including the TIA.

## 1.14.3 Production Schedule

The Red Chris East Zone is currently being mined by open pit mining.  The open pit mine is due for completion of the final phase (Phase 8) in FY26, producing a total of 63.6 Mt of ore from Q4 FY21 to Q4 FY26.  The first cave ore from MB1 (located directly below Phase 8) is scheduled for the second half of FY26, with full production from MB1 in FY30. During the block cave production ramp-up the process plant feed will be supplemented by  stockpiled  ore.    The  projected  underground  mine  life  is  from  FY26  to  FY57,  with nameplate capacity of 13.6 Mt/a scheduled to be reached in FY30.

## 1.15 Recovery Methods

Plant design for open pit ores was based on metallurgical testwork assuming open pit mining methods, and was a standard porphyry copper flowsheet employing SAG and ball milling, flotation, regrinding, thickening and filtering to produce a gold-bearing copper concentrate at a moisture content of 8% for export.  Subsequent to the initial construction, the plant has undergone the following changes:  installation of a pebble bypass system on the SAG mill, installation of an additional rougher flotation cell to increase rougher flotation residence time, and installation of a third flotation column to increase capacity of the cleaner circuit.

<!-- image -->

The 2021 PFS metallurgical testwork program confirmed that a flowsheet incorporating crushing, grinding, flotation, and concentrate dewatering was suitable for the planned underground block cave material.

## 1.15.1 Current Plant

The plant consisted of a SAG mill-ball mill-pebble crushing (SABC) comminution circuit housed in a single process building.  The target grind size was a P80 of 150 µm, with throughput taking precedence over grind size, resulting in typical grind sizes closer to 170-180 µm.

The flotation circuit as of May 2021 consisted of:

- · Copper rougher: five Outotec TC-200;
- · Mixed duty (copper rougher/sulphide rougher): one TC-200 and one TC-160;
- · Regrind: primary ball mill in series with a secondary Vertimill targeting a regrind size P80 of 30 µm;
- · Cleaner  circuit:  two  cleaner  columns  and  a  bank  of  five  Outotec  TC-50  cleaner scavengers;
- · Concentrate storage tank, thickener, and pressure filter.

Subsequently, in June 2021, the third flotation column was commissioned.

The flotation circuit is configured to produce a copper concentrate with a grade of 2324% Cu.  Originally configured as a two-stage cleaning circuit, the plant is often operated with only a single stage of cleaning due to insufficient capacity in the cleaner columns. This no longer occurs as the third flotation column is in place.

Process improvements are underway, and include:

- · Installation of a third Eriez Cavitation Tube Column in the cleaners, which started commissioning in June 2021;
- · Installation of two pre-rougher duty Eriez StackCells, due to be completed by Q1 2022.

Newcrest is investigating the installation of a tailings thickener for NAG cyclone overflow. A new tailings cyclone cluster will be installed adjacent the tailings thickener, should this project proceed.

## 1.15.2 Plant Requirements, Block Cave Underground

The  2021  PFS  evaluated  process  plant  upgrades  required  to  meet  the  different  ore characteristics of underground ores compared with open pit ores, specifically increased hardness and higher copper head grades.  Two process options were evaluated:

- · A Central Case (that forms the base case), that would treat 13.6 Mt/a of underground ore  through  the  existing  SABC  circuit  plus  a  new  single-stage  SAG  circuit;  this concept was within the within the current maximum permitted throughput of 38,000 t/d average, 13.87 Mt/a;
- · An  Upside  Case  (that  forms  an  alternatives  case),  that  would  treat  15  Mt/a  of underground ore through the existing SABC circuit plus a new single-stage SAG

circuit, with SAG mill discharge configurations modified to allow coarsening of grind size, and addition of a HydroFloat coarse particle flotation circuit.

In  both  cases,  flotation  and  concentrate  dewatering  upgrades  were included to allow processing of higher head grade underground ore.

The  Central  Case  expansion  largely  kept  the  existing  process  operation,  added  an additional  grinding  line  and  expanded  some  unit  operations  to  suit  block  cave  ore. Upgrades  include  a  new  coarse  ore  stockpile,  single-stage  SAG  mill,  pre-rougher StackCells, new regrind circuit and expansion of the concentrate dewatering circuit. The ore  properties  of  underground  ore  are  expected  to  be  sufficiently  favourable  to discontinue sulphide scavenger flotation, which is required for most open pit ores. The existing regrind ball mill would be removed to create space for an expanded cleaner flotation circuit. The  expansion  scenario  considered  that  the  ongoing  process improvement  projects  would  be  online  prior  to  the  block  cave  expansion,  including Cleaner Column 3, Phase 1 pre-rougher StackCells (treating cyclone overflow from the existing SABC circuit), and NAG tailings thickening.

The Upside Case for the block cave process plant upgrade was an extension of the Central Case, and assumed HydroFloat coarse particle flotation and an increase in grind size at a higher throughput rate.  The concept included:

- · In the single-stage SAG circuit the pebble crusher will be installed in the transfer building included in the Central Case;
- · The  discharge  and  screen  configurations  of  the  SAG  mills  and  hydrocyclone components will be modified to allow coarsening of grind size;
- · A HydroFloat circuit will be installed on rougher tailings after classification;
- · HydroFloat concentrate will be reground in a re-configured Vertimill VTM1500;
- · Reground HydroFloat concentrate will be upgraded in a new HydroFloat rougher flotation stage that will incorporate StackCells, smaller than the ones nominated for pre-roughing duty, and the HydroFloat rougher concentrate will be blended with the existing rougher concentrate streams to feed the cleaner flotation circuit.

The Upside Case assumed that the maximum permitted throughput could be increased, sufficient make-up water could be provided to sustain the higher production rate, and the economics of the expansion to the Upside Case could be confirmed to be favourable.

## 1.16 Project Infrastructure

## 1.16.1 Infrastructure

The existing mine infrastructure includes an open pit, divided between the East and Main zones; one coarse ore stockpile, one low-grade stockpile, a WRSF; the TIA complex; non-contact water diversion structures; power supply; process plant, process facilities; exploration  facilities;  medical  and  ambulance  facilities  administrative  and  warehouse facilities; maintenance facilities; water treatment facilities; waste treatment facilities; and accommodations camp.

The  transition  to  block  cave  mining  and  associated  changes  to  processing  will  be supported by existing infrastructure as well as infrastructure upgrades.  Infrastructure upgrades that have recently been completed or are currently in progress for ongoing

<!-- image -->

open pit operations, and will be integrated with the block cave project, are as required in the following areas:  new mobile equipment maintenance and workshop facility; pumping upgrade  from  the  North  Reclaim  dam  to  the  booster  station;  seepage  mitigation modifications for the TIA; new cyclone sand plants and tailings thickener for dewatering NAG  tailings  cyclone  overflow;  associated  modifications  to  tailings  pipelines  for  the cyclone sand plants, thickeners. and short-term tailings deposition; dust cover for the existing coarse ore stockpile; and accommodations camp upgrades.

New  infrastructure  requirements  for  the  block  cave  project  include:    operations accommodation complex, site asset operation centre, mine dry, concrete/shotcrete batch plant; expansion of existing North dam and South dam, new northeast dam, relocated North Reclaim dam and South Reclaim dam, new northeast reclaim dam, North Valley pumping wells, North Valley seepage wells, make-up water booster pumps and pipelines for fresh and reclaim water, potable water treatment plant, fire water supply to operations accommodation complex, decline conveyor; propane, diesel storage and distribution; air compressors to supply compressed air to underground utility stations; sewage treatment plant, septic field; ditches around the operations accommodation complex; expansions to switchgear and substations, mine substation, site-wide reticulation; communications backbone  feeding  surface  and  underground  facilities;  surface  haul  roads,  access  to conveyor portal, ventilation raises, process plant, TIA dam access roads; laydown areas, construction offices, warehouse, maintenance shops, water utility supply pump/pipeline from south reclaim pond; and stockpile pads, TIA reclaim dam diversion ditches, Camp Creek diversion, and Beaver Creek diversion.

## 1.16.2 Tailings Impoundment Area

The TIA is currently permitted for 302 Mt of tailings, the containment of which is provided by a single impoundment with natural topography, and the LOM design incorporates three dams, the North, South, and Northeast dams, to a final elevation of 1,180 m.  The North and South dams are operational and raised as needed.  There are two water reclaim dams located downstream of the North and South dams, referred to as the North and South Reclaim dams, respectively.

The current mine permit requires the segregation and separate deposition of NAG and PAG tailings.  PAG tailings consist of cleaner-scavenger tailings and sulphide scavenger concentrate  when  the  sulphide  scavenger  stage  is  in  operation.    PAG  tailings  are required to be separately disposed of in the TIA and maintained in a saturated area (this is a permit condition).  NAG tailings can either be deposited whole into the impoundment or  cycloned  to  produce  a  cyclone  sand  product  used  for  embankment  construction. Cyclone  underflow  (the  coarser  fractions  of  NAG  tailings  cyclone  sand)  and  cyclone overflow (the finer fractions of NAG tailings) are deposited in the impoundment.

To support the proposed block cave operation (including development of MB2 and MB3), the TIA will be expanded to a capacity of about 550 Mt.  The design assumes raises on the North, South and Northeast dams above that which is currently permitted, to a final elevation of 1,207 m.  The 2021 PFS assumes decommissioning of the existing north and south reclaim dams and associated seepage interception systems, and reconstruction of those facilities further downstream; construction of a new Northeast Reclaim dam will also be required.  Existing instrumentation and wells (monitoring and pumping) may need to be decommissioned and new infrastructure installed.  Existing water diversion channels or sections of existing channels will be decommissioned and

<!-- image -->

new channels built around the expanded TIA to route contact water into the TIA and noncontact water away from the TIA.

## 1.16.3 Water Management and Supply

The main source of water for the process plant is reclaim from the main pond at the TIA. When the planned tailings thickener is constructed, it will become the largest source of process water, supplemented by a reduced volume of reclaim water from the TIA.  Other sources  include  seepage  recovery  from  the  north  and  south  reclaim  seepage  ponds formed by the North Reclaim dam and South Reclaim dam, respectively.  Groundwater pumping from the deep aquifer is the main source of makeup water when needed to meet process water demands.

The TIA will be the main water management reservoir for the Red Chris Operations. Inputs to the TIA will include water from the tailings, runoff from the TIA catchment area, direct precipitation, and pump-back from the reclaim dams.  Collected water from the pit and WRSFs, including the low-grade ore stockpile, will be initially routed through the mill for process use before reporting to the TIA with the tailings.  Diversion ditches around the TIA will divert non-contact runoff water to the north and south of the TIA as much as practicable.  Storm water will report to the TIA.  No settling or sediment control will be required prior to discharge; and there will be no storm water treatment or management infrastructure at the site for storm water runoff.

The North and South Reclaim dams will collect runoff and groundwater seepage that reports to surface from the TIA.

Three existing potable water systems  support the accommodations  camp  and operations.  Raw water is sourced from three groundwater wells, and treated through potable water treatment plants.

## 1.16.4 Camps and Accommodation

The current  accommodation camp has an approximate 800-person capacity, and an estimated remaining usage life of 10 years.  An additional 400 to 600 beds will be needed to support the construction and development phases of the Project as envisaged in the 2021 PFS.

## 1.16.5 Power and Electrical

Power  to  the  Red  Chris  Operations  is  provided  by  BC  Hydro  via  the  Northwest Transmission Line.  The current contract with BC Hydro sets the authorized demand at 55  MVA  at  0.95  power  factor  or  better,  and  current  site  demand  typically  fluctuates around 48 MVA.  Emergency power requirements for critical systems are provided by two  1.27  MW  diesel  generators  for  the  operations  areas,  and  one  500  kW  diesel generator for the camp.

The preliminary load list indicates the total site load requirements to support the block cave project will increase from 45 MW to 100 MW.  The existing 287 kV substation will be increased in capacity with the addition of a third 287 kV/25 kV transformer.  A new mine substation  dedicated  to  the  underground  area  will  be  constructed.    Emergency power requirements in the form of two 1.2 MW diesel generators will be provided at the mine substation at the conveyor portal.

## 1.17 Environmental, Permitting and Social Considerations

Extensive  environmental  baseline  data  collection  and  monitoring  of  the  area  has occurred since 2003.  Site-specific baseline studies were completed to support the 2004 Environmental  Assessment  Application  and  subsequent  2010  Joint Mines  Act and Environmental  Act Permit  Application,  as  well  as  associated  addendums  to  permit applications.

Following receipt of the Environmental Assessment (EA) Certificate (M05-02), Mines Act Permit  (M-240),  and Environmental  Management  Act Permit  (105017),  approvals  for mine construction commencement (2012) and operational authorization (June 2015), the Red  Chris Operations have continued to collect comprehensive environmental monitoring data to support effective environmental management.

## 1.17.1 Environmental Considerations

Baseline characterization studies included data collection on dust, noise and vibration, potential  visual  impacts,  air  quality  and  meteorology,  groundwater  and  surface  water quality and quantity, hydrogeology, aquatic resources and fisheries, terrestrial ecosystems including vegetation and wildlife, and cultural heritage and archaeological studies.

A gap analysis completed as part of the 2021 PFS identified several areas requiring additional baseline characterisation work, such as hydrogeology, aquatic resources and fisheries.  Additional information is planned to be collected in the areas of dust, noise, and air quality to assess the impacts of potential incremental Project increases.  Closure studies are also planned to reduce risks associated with long-term water (quantity and quality) and metals leach/acid rock drainage management post-closure, and incorporate input from Tahltan engagement.

There  is  an  environmental  management  system  (EMS)  in  place  for  the  open  pit operations, which includes associated plans, procedures, policies, guidelines, auditing, and  compliance.    The  EMS  and  environmental  management  plans  (EMPs)  will  be updated to incorporate the block cave project.  Key mitigation measures that have been identified for impacts assessed during the 2021 PFS will inform the updates to the EMPs.

## 1.17.2 Closure and Reclamation Planning

A closure plan was developed for the 2021 PFS for the closure of the proposed block cave  operation  in  its  entirety,  including  works  associated  with  the  existing  open  pit operations.

The closure plan currently approved is for the closure of the existing facilities to support the open pit mine at Red Chris.

A reclamation bond is required to be updated according to the disturbance areas and facilities associated with the M-240 permit.

The closure plan for the proposed block cave project was completed for the purposes of development of a closure cost estimate.  A total  exit  cost  for  the  block  cave  project including decommissioning, closure, and reclamation of mine infrastructure associated with the existing open pit mine was estimated at a concept study level of C$181 M.

## 1.17.3 Permitting Considerations

The Red Chris Operations are fully permitted for open pit mining.

The  BC  Reviewable  Projects  Regulation  sets  out  the  criteria  for  determining  which projects are required to undergo an EA; however, Newcrest understands that the block cave project does not meet or exceed the thresholds defined in the Reviewable Projects Regulation; therefore, except in the event that the Project is designated by the Ministry of Environment and Climate Change Strategy, Canada (ENV), the Project will not require a new Environmental Assessment (EA) certificate.  However, amendments to the EA certificate will be required in connection with certain phases of the block cave project (such as underground mining) where the activities to be undertaken during such phases are not authorized by the existing EA certificate.  An EA certificate holder may apply to the Environmental Assessment Office for an amendment.  Depending on the potential complexity of the proposed amendment, the Environmental Assessment Office may set out  supplementary  application  requirements  that  may  include  information  typically included  in  a  detailed  project  description.    The  Minister  of  Indigenous  Relations  and Reconciliation is authorized, on behalf of the government, to negotiate an agreement with  the  Tahltan  Central  Government  relating  to  the  consent  of  the  Tahltan  Central Government in respect of decisions under the Environmental Assessment Act related to the Red Chris Operations and the block cave project.

The permitting strategy will follow a phased approach, including:

- · Phase 1: exploration decline box cut and portal;
- · Phase 2: exploration decline construction;
- · Phase  3:  pre-mining  underground  development  including  an  extension  to  the decline,  development  of  the  conveyor  decline,  access  to  the  ore  body  and underground development to support the block cave infrastructure;
- · Phase 4: block cave mining of MB1;
- · Phase 5: block cave mining of MB2 and MB3.

Permitting for development of the exploration decline (Phases 1 and 2) is complete and the decline is under construction.

MB1  is  expected  to  be  able  to  be  permitted  at  the  provincial  level,  through  an  EA certificate amendment  and  amendments  to the Mines Act and Environmental Management Act permits.  The application review process is assumed to be carried out jointly  or  concurrently  by  the  Tahltan  Central  Government  and  provincial  regulators pursuant to an agreement under Section 7 of the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples  Act . Mines  Act and Environmental  Management  Act permit  amendment applications  are  expected  to  be  submitted  and  reviewed  concurrently  during  the  EA certificate amendment process.  It is possible that EA certificate amendment process will include modernization, which may broaden the scope of the review.

Extension of the mine's operating life beyond 2040 through the mining of MB2 and MB3 will likely trigger the need for environmental review at the federal level under the Impact Assessment Act and  additional  permitting  under  the Fisheries Act .    These  permitting activities are estimated to be initiated after 2035.

## 1.17.4 Social Considerations

The mining operations are located entirely  within  the  Tahltan  Nation's  territory.    The proposed block cave project requires an approach that aligns with the Tahltan Nation and  leadership  and  with  provincial  governments.    Since  initiating  discussions  on exploration and  Red  Chris  Operations  activities, Newcrest  representatives  have continued to meet regularly with Tahltan Central Government representatives, Tahltan leadership, and the Tahltan Nation.  While feedback has been largely positive, a range of concerns and interests have been raised.  Newcrest is actively working with Tahltan Central  Government  representatives,  Tahltan  leadership,  and  the  Tahltan  Nation  to address concerns that have been raised.

## 1.18 Markets and Contracts

## 1.18.1 Markets

An evaluation of the copper concentrate market was undertaken as part of the 2021 PFS.

The Red Chris Operations' current market for the open pit concentrate is Asia (primarily China) due to China's comparative advantage i.e., nil or low penalties imposed on the elevated mercury and antimony, and lower transportation cost compared to Europe.

An ongoing dialogue is maintained with smelters globally regarding their interest in the Red Chris Operations' concentrate.  For the reasons mentioned above, the strongest demand will remain to be from Chinese smelters, though counterparty evaluation needs to be carefully considered.

The  assumption  in  the  2021  PFS  is  that  the  additional  concentrate  tonnage  that  is produced from the block cave project will either be added to existing contracts (those contracts will be expanded) or sold to new smelters customers in Asia or Europe with whom direct communication already takes place.  It is not expected that Newcrest will need to pay a premium for market access.  At an average grade of 24.4% Cu, Red Chris concentrate is slightly below premium concentrate grade levels, but is still expected to attract market interest.

## 1.18.2 Metal Price and Contract Assumptions

Metal price assumptions were provided by Newcrest management.  Newcrest considers analyst and broker price predictions, and price projections used by peers as inputs when preparing  the  management  pricing  forecasts.    The  metal  price  and  exchange  rate assumptions used are included in Table 1-4.

Contracts are in place in support of the open pit mining and processing operations and include  mill consumables,  power,  explosives,  transportation,  and  camp  facilities. Contracts  are  also  in  place  with  equipment  vendors,  drilling  contractors,  and  for concentrate loading and storage.

<!-- image -->

Table: 1-4: Metal Price Forecast

|               | Units   | FY22   | FY23   | FY24   | FY25   | FY26+   |
|---------------|---------|--------|--------|--------|--------|---------|
| Gold price    | US$/oz  | 1,750  | 1,700  | 1,550  | 1,500  | 1,500   |
| Copper price  | US$/lb  | 3.75   | 3.50   | 3.30   | 3.30   | 3.30    |
| Exchange rate | C$:US$  | 0.80   | 0.80   | 0.80   | 0.80   | 0.80    |

Contracts that are likely to be concluded in support of the block cave underground project include decline development, pipelines, conveyors, camp construction, port and roads. Major contracts in support of operations are likely to include:  accommodations camp management,  building  maintenance,  underground  mine  infrastructure  development, cave establishment, road maintenance, explosives supply, ground support and consumables  supply,  material  transport  and  logistics  to  the  preferred  port  site, infrastructure engineering procurement and construction management, labour training, and infrastructure construction.

Current contracts are typically reviewed and negotiated on a frequent basis.  Contract awarding is in accordance to the procurement standard and a delegation of authority process.    Based  on  Newcrest's  knowledge,  the  contract  terms  are  typical  of  similar contracts  both  regionally  and  nationally.    It  is  expected  that  future  contracts  will  be awarded and negotiated in a similar manner to contracts that are currently in place.

## 1.19 Capital Cost Estimates

## 1.19.1 Open Pit

The capital costs for the open pit operations are considered to be sustaining capital and are summarized in Section 1.20.1.  As the open pit is operating, the estimated life-ofmine  costs  are  based  on  actual  expenditure  as  of  FY21Q4  and  forward-looking estimates.

## 1.19.2 Block Cave Underground

Capital cost estimates were prepared for the process plant expansions and underground development  to  produce  an  estimate  with  a  target  accuracy  of  ±25%.    Costs  were estimated using a bottom-up unit cost and productivity approach, cross-referenced with benchmark data.  Footprint mine designs considered haulage scenarios that use single as well as multiple crusher layouts.  The reduced distances and the inclusion of a truck loop resulted in a single crusher configuration being selected as the preferred option, substantially  reducing  the  capital  required  in  MB2  and  MB3.    Capital  costs  were estimated based on the 13.6 Mt/a Central Case.

The capital cost estimate for the proposed block cave is divided into:

- · Initial capital for MB1:  includes all expenses up to the completion of underground mine development required to access MB1, material handling systems, and process plant upgrades;
- · Initial capital for MB2:  includes the incremental underground development capital expenditure required to access this section of the orebody;

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

- · Initial capital for MB3:  includes the incremental underground development capital expenditure required to access this section of the orebody;
- · Sustaining capital;
- · Closure and rehabilitation costs.

The total contingency was C$396 million or 17.9% of the base estimate for initial capital (including MB 1, MB2 and MB3).

The capital cost estimate from the 2021 PFS on the block cave underground project is summarized in Table 1-5 for the planned underground operation.

## 1.20 Operating Cost Estimates

## 1.20.1 Open Pit

The Red Chris open pit is an operating mine with production history.  As such, capital costs  are  treated  as  sustaining  capital  operating  costs  rather  than  treated  as  initial capital.    The  operating  costs  were  estimated  during  FY21Q4  forecast  period  and represent  the  total  open  pit  cost  estimate  for  the  remaining  LOM  (e.g.,  before  the underground block caving operation is fully implemented).

Four major line items make up the open pit operating cost estimate:  the processing cost; G&amp;A; sustaining capital operating cost; and the mining cost.  The estimated LOM open pit cost forecasts are mining cost at US$2.90/t mined, milling cost at US$6.70/t milled, G&amp;A costs at US$3.30/t milled and sustaining capital at US$3.60/t milled for an overall process cost of US$13.60/t processed.  These values were used to define the open pit mine plan.  Values used for the operating cost estimate will not necessarily match those provided in the economic analysis that has validated the mine plan.

The operating cost estimate for the remainder of the open pit operations is summarized in Table 1-6.

## 1.20.2 Block Cave Underground

The operating cost estimate is presented at an estimation accuracy of ±25%.  All inputs were in Q2 2021 Canadian dollars.  No escalation was included in the operating cost estimates, nor was a contingency allocation made during estimation.

The basis of the costs for mining operations was developed as part of the integrated mine  production  plan  and  schedule,  which  includes  the  required  number  of  units  of equipment and operators on a monthly basis for the LOM.  The labour positions indicated on the mine plan were mapped to the master labour positions, with variable manpower numbers, depending on the mine plan requirements.  Mine production equipment costs include maintenance and fuel consumption based on the hourly rates and equipment utilization.  Permanent equipment operating costs include maintenance supplies, power, and fuel for all underground systems and infrastructure.

Inputs for these costs were provided by third-party consultants.  These costs vary from year to year based on operating parameters.

The process area assumed a personnel count of 105, including management, technical services,  and  operators.    Equipment  maintenance  and  power  costs  for  the  existing process plant were based on a nominal process capacity of 11 Mt/a, cost estimates, and FY23 operating budget forecasts.  Equipment maintenance and power costs for the new process plant operations were based on a 13.6 Mt/a throughput rate.  Reagents and consumables  costs  for  the  process  plant  were  jointly  developed  by  a  third-party consultant and the Red Chris Operations.

The  TIA  operating  cost  includes  allocations  for  personnel,  and  tailings  and  reclaim equipment maintenance and power costs.

Infrastructure  costs  include  all  maintenance  personnel  for  above-ground  facilities, including process plant, infrastructure, ancillary buildings, tailings equipment, and site services.  Maintenance and power costs for existing infrastructure were based on the FY23 forecast operating budget.  Maintenance and power costs for new infrastructure were based on third-party estimates.  Allocations were made for propane and water and sewage treatment.

Note:  numbers have been rounded.  Totals may not sum due to rounding.

The economic evaluation used the Mineral Reserves summarized in Table 1-3, which support a mine life of 36 years, from FY22 to FY57.  Over the LOM, copper recoveries will range from approximately 81-86% and gold recoveries will range from 60-75%.  The average concentrate grade over the LOM is forecast at approximately 24.4% Cu.  Royalty provisions in the financial model include provisions made to the Tahltan Nation on the five  mining  leases  under  the  IBCA,  and  a  1%  NSR  payable  to  Royal  Gold  on  all  or portions of four of the mining leases.  Federal income tax is levied at a rate of 15% on taxable income and provincial income tax in BC is levied at a rate of 12%, resulting in a combined tax rate of 27%.  The BC minerals tax was included, as were closure costs of C$181 M.  The base case economic analysis assumes 100% equity financing and is reported on a 100% project ownership basis.  Newcrest holds a 70% interest in the Red Chris Operations, and Imperial holds the remaining 30% interest.

## 1.21.3 Cashflow Results

The economic analysis for the combined open pit and block cave underground project shows a net present value at 4.5% of C$2,242 M, and an internal rate of return of 16.1%. A payback period of 3.2 years is based on the earliest date that net accumulated free cash flow is equal to zero.  This is calculated from first commercial production that is defined as the date of achieving critical hydraulic radius for the Red Chris block cave, which is assumed to be FY27.  All metrics are presented prior to shareholder loans.

Table 1-8 presents the financial metrics for the Red Chris Operations.

## 1.21.4 Sensitivity Analysis

A deterministic  point-estimate  sensitivity  analysis  was  conducted  on  each of  the key project variables and value drivers.  The sensitivity analysis reflects the changes in IRR (%) and NPV (C$ M) for the corresponding individual movement in each factor.

The Red Chris Operations, including the proposed block cave, are most sensitive to changes in the copper price, less sensitive to changes in the gold price, copper grade, capital costs, gold grade, foreign exchange, gold recovery, copper recovery and least sensitive to changes in operating costs.

## 1.22 Risks and Opportunities

A number of risk workshops were conducted during the 2021 PFS.

## 1.22.1 Risks

Key risks identified are summarized by discipline area:

- · Geology:
- -Lower  grades  encountered  in  mining.    Potentially  mitigate  by  completing additional drilling campaigns, and performing cave flow modelling;
- -Presence of unidentified faulting.  Potentially mitigate by completing a structural geology  interpretation;  evaluation  of  available  data  collection  including  face mapping and digital scanning;

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

- · Mining:
- -Geotechnical risk associated with potential pit wall failure;
- -Increased costs or reduced grades impacting the end of mine life production;
- · Seismicity:
- -A seismic event, either from earthquake or mining-related activity, remobilizes the Kluea lake landslide complex that is located to the south of the open pit. Potentially mitigate by completing mine seismicity modelling and the effect of seismic events on infrastructure and local features; evaluate the impact of block cave induced seismicity on the complex; conduct a structural geology interpretation;
- · Water balance and water quality:
- -Uncertainty  around  operational  water  balance  projection  that  may  impact permitting, design and production.  Potentially mitigate using data verification by independent review and de-risk option studies, monitoring, and completion of site-specific remediation and mitigation projects;
- -Wells cannot supply sufficient volume of quality raw water to maintain operation. Although current modelling shows that the capacity of the wells is sufficient to support the block cave project, there is a risk that the modelling completed to date  is  inaccurate.    This  could  be  mitigated  by  conducting  the  planned hydrogeological  surveys  and  modelling  work;  monitoring  of  water  usage requirements; implementing seepage reduction measures; minimizing evaporation  losses  by  reducing  the  pond  size;  utilizing  thickener  to  increase water  usage  efficiency,  and  apply  for  additional  water  extraction  permits  if needed;
- -Uncertainties  as  to  the  long-term  water  quality  (e.g.  TIA  seepage  quality). Potentially  mitigate  by  continuous  monitoring,  using  existing  extraction  wells, installing  new seepage interception system, implementing natural remediation measure and installing a water treatment plant if necessary;
- · TIA:
- -TIA failure.  Potentially mitigate by retaining a third-party engineer with significant experience in BC and with sand tailings dam experience; establishing additional project/corporate/site interface and alignment on third party oversight requirements,  regulatory  requirements  and  IBCA  commitments;  completing assessment  of  valley  dump  geotechnical  risk;  careful  management  during construction to ensure dam constructed to design;
- -A seismic event, either from earthquake or mining-related activity, causes a TIA failure.    Potentially  mitigate  by  completing  mine  seismicity  modelling  and  the effect of seismic events on infrastructure and local features; conduct a structural geology interpretation; review designs during next study phase;

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

- -Required  quantities  of  borrow  materials  (till,  sand  and  gravel,  rockfill)  not available to support dam raises (includes North dam, South dam, Northeast dam and  reclaim  dams).    Potentially  mitigate  by  extensive  site  investigations identifying borrow materials that are of required quality, accessible, and within an economic distance of the TIA dam construction sites.  Manage and maintain consistent sand recovery operations from mine ore feed, to process plant, and to tailings cycloning system to ensure that borrow material requirements do not increase;
- -Dam raise assumptions.  The 2021 PFS assumes that sufficient inventory of tailings  sand  will  have  been  accumulated  by  2041  to  allow  for  the  final embankment raise.  This will require the site to  achieve the target sand yield at the  required  quality  and  quantity.    Failure  to  achieve  the  yield  target  would significantly increase embankment construction costs later in the mine life due to the need for additional borrow materials, or alternatively if borrow sources are constrained,  may  limit  the  height  of  the  final  dams  and  the  associated  TIA capacity;
- · Closure:
- -There is a risk that closure costs will increase as a result of additional reviews and feasibility study design, resulting from alternative concepts for TIA and RSA covers, water quality controls and post-closure land use;
- · Cost estimation:
- -There is a risk that estimates of sustaining capital, non-sustaining capital and operating costs could escalate more than anticipated, due to external economic pressures (e.g. labour shortages in BC, commodity prices, oil, steel, consumables and reagent prices), and/or changes to technical or operational issues underpinning the cost estimates (e.g. water treatments, TIA construction);
- · Permitting and contracts:
- -Permitting a block cave operation in BC in the anticipated timeframe.  Potentially mitigate  by  identifying  the  various  government  departments  and  regulations which will govern the approvals process; develop applicable permitting strategies; complete all environmental surveys and supporting studies; engage and consult with Major Mines Office prior to mining proposal submission; identify all potentially  interested  parties  and  stakeholders;  develop  monitoring  and mitigation plans;
- -Uncertainties as to assumed timelines to negotiate contracts in support of the planned block cave operations (e.g. contracts deemed to be direct award under the IBCA);
- · Human resources:
- -Skilled  personnel shortage.  Potentially mitigate by monitoring labour market; providing upgraded onsite accommodation; developing strategic partnerships;

<!-- image -->

## 1.22.2 Opportunities

Key opportunities are summarized by discipline area:

- · Geology:
- -Identification  of  additional  mineralization  at  higher  grades  within  the  known porphyry copper corridor that hosts the Red Chris Operations;
- -Identification of new targets or prospects within the Project area;
- · Incorporation of innovative technology in the next study stage:
- -Potential  to  include  state-of-the-art  design  and  technology,  such  as  eccentric rolls  crusher,  single  pass  cave  establishment,  novel  cave  footprint  designs, continuous miner, and autonomous vehicles;
- -Electrification of underground fleet to reduce carbon emissions and improve air quality;
- · Use of a dry cover on the TIA to potentially reduce closure costs;
- · North dam construction:
- -Once a 300 m or longer beach is established at North dam, as planned, following the relocation of the pump barge to the central location, the dam is no longer considered as a water dam; then the zoned structure can be simplified into a uniform cyclone sand dam similar to the South dam.  This change will simplify the construction process and hence increase dam stability, and presents a cost saving.
- · Combine NAG/PAG disposal:
- -This opportunity could be realized if the neutralizing potential ratio is above 2 after  appropriate  and  practical  mixing  of  NAG  and  PAG  tailings  streams  and deposited into the pond. Further study is needed to confirm this potential.

## 1.23 Interpretation and Conclusions

Under the assumptions in this Report, the Red Chris Operations show a positive cash flow over the life-of-mine and supports the Mineral Reserve estimate.  The mine plan is achievable under the set of assumptions and parameters used.

## 1.24 Recommendations

The QPs prepared a recommended two-phase work program that focuses on an infill drill program in the first  phase and work to support feasibility-level studies in the second phase.  The phases are independent and can be completed concurrently.

The cost estimate to complete the first phase of the proposed work is a total of about C$27.6 M.  The suggested budget to complete the second work phase is approximately C$50.2 M.

The Phase 1 program will include:

## 2 INTRODUCTION

## 2.1 Introduction

Newcrest Mining Limited (Newcrest) has prepared this Technical Report (the Report) on the Red Chris Operations (Red Chris Operations or the Project), in British Columbia (BC), Canada.  The Project location is shown in Figure 2 1.

The  Red  Chris  Operations  are  managed  by  an  unincorporated  joint  venture,  the Newcrest  Red  Chris  Joint  Venture,  between  Newcrest  Red  Chris  Mining  Limited,  a wholly-owned Newcrest subsidiary, and Red Chris Development Company Ltd. a whollyowned subsidiary of Imperial Metals Corporation (Imperial).  Newcrest has a 70% joint venture interest through Newcrest Red Chris Mining Limited, and is Project manager, and Imperial has a 30% interest.

The Red Chris Operations are an open pit operation, with an annual throughput rate of about 10-11 Mt/a.  Newcrest plans to transition to a block cave underground mining operation that will produce 13.6 Mt/a.  This Report discusses the remaining open pit lifeof-mine (LOM) plan, and the results of the 'Red Chris Block Cave Pre-Feasibility Study' (the 2021 PFS) evaluating the proposed block cave (the block cave project).

## 2.2 Terms of Reference

This  Report  supports  Newcrest's  disclosures  in  the  news  release  dated  12  October, 2021, entitled 'Red Chris Block Cave Pre-Feasibility Study confirms Tier 1 potential'.

The Report also supports Imperial's disclosures in the news release dated 11 October, 2011, entitled 'Red Chris Block Cave Pre-Feasibility Study Confirms Low Cost, Long Life'.

For the purposes of this Report, the name Newcrest is used interchangeably for the Newcrest  parent,  Newcrest  operating  subsidiary  and  the  Newcrest  Red  Chris  Joint Venture.

All  measurement  units  used  in  this  Report  are  metric  unless  otherwise  noted,  and currency is expressed in United States (US$) or Canadian (C$) dollars as identified in the text.  Cost estimates for the open pit operations are generally reported in US$, and the 2021 PFS costs for the proposed block cave project are typically in C$.

Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves were initially classified using the 2012 edition of the Australasian Joint Ore Reserves Committee (JORC) Code (2012 JORC Code). The confidence categories assigned under the 2012 JORC Code were reconciled to the confidence  categories  in  the  Canadian  Institute  of  Mining,  Metallurgy  and  Petroleum (CIM) Definition Standards for Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves (May 2014; the 2014 CIM Definition Standards).  As the confidence category definitions are the same, no modifications to the confidence categories were required.

## 4 PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION

## 4.1 Introduction

The  Red  Chris  Operations  are  a  copper-gold  open  pit  mining  operation  located  in northwest British Columbia, Canada, approximately 18 km southeast of the Iskut village, 80 km south of Dease Lake, and 12 km east of the Stewart-Cassiar Highway 37.

The Project is located at approximately 57 o  44' N, 129 o  45' 30' E.

## 4.2 Property and Title in British Columbia

The Ministry of Energy, Mines and Low Carbon Innovation is largely responsible for the mining  sector.    The  Ministry  of  Environment  and  Climate  Change  Strategy,  the Environmental Assessment Office and the Ministry of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development provide for additional oversight of mining operations through  their  respective  mandates.    Applicable  legislation  and  regulation  in  British Columbia includes:

- · Mineral Tenure Act (MTA);
- · Land Act ;
- · Mines Act (and the accompanying Health, Safety and Reclamation Code for Mines in British Columbia);
- · Mineral Land Tax Act ;
- · Mineral Tax Act ;
- · Environmental Assessment Act ;
- · Environmental Management Act .

Rights  to  mineral  resources  on  public  lands  are  generally  held  by  the  Crown.    The ownership of lands and minerals situated in a province generally belong to the province. Each  provincial  government  exercises  administration  and  control  of  ownership  and disposition of most mining rights and lands through provincial legislation.

## 4.2.1 Mineral Title

Prior to 1 June 1991, registrations in respect of a mineral claim or mining lease were manually recorded on, or attached to, the original application document for a mineral claim or the original lease document for a mining lease.  From June 1991 to 11 January 2005,  all  records  were  entered  into  a  computer  database,  maintained  by  the  Gold Commissioner's Office.  On 12 January 2005, the British Columbia mineral titles system was converted to an online registry system, MTO, and ground-staking of claims was eliminated in favour of map-staking based on grid cells.  Claims recorded prior to 12 January 2005 are referred to as legacy claims.  Claims acquired through map staking are referred to as cell claims.  From and after the date of changeover to map-staking, claim holders could convert legacy claims to cell claims, or maintain the original legacy

claim.  Legacy claims vary in size and shape, depending on the regulations that were in force at the time of staking and recordation.

Cell  claims  can  consist  of  1-100  cells  which  range  from  21  ha  in  southern  British Columbia to 16 ha in the north.

A mineral claim is valid for one year and can be extended for as many as 10 years from the  application  date  or  on  a  year-to-year  basis.    The  extension  period  depends  on whether the claimholder has opted to undertake work on the property or make payment in lieu.

To keep claims in good standing in accordance with the MTA, a minimum value of work or cash-in-lieu is required annually.  The minimum value of work required to maintain a legacy or cell mineral claim for one year is currently set at $5/ha for the first and second anniversary years, $10/ha for the third and fourth anniversary years, $15/ha in the fifth and sixth anniversary years, and $20/ha for each subsequent anniversary year.  The cash-in-lieu required to maintain a mineral claim for an anniversary year is double the value of the work commitment requirement.

A mining lease is required if the claim holder wishes to produce more than 1,000 t of ore in a year from each unit in a legacy claim (typically 25 ha) or each cell in a cell claim. The holder of a mineral claim may obtain a mining lease for that claim if certain requirements are met (surveying if required, payment of fees, and posting of notices).

Unpatented  mineral  claims  must  generally  be  converted  into  mineral  leases  before production-level activities and resource extraction can occur.  To convert an unpatented mineral claim to a mineral lease in British Columbia, the claimholder must register an application  for  a  mining  lease  with  the  province's  mineral  titles  registry  and  pay  a prescribed fee.  The claimholder must then post a notification in the province's Gazette and in a newspaper circulating within the area of the claim, and the BC government requires that the mineral claims be surveyed by a land surveyor.

Mineral leases are generally granted for terms that may range from 10-30 years.  The initial term of a mineral lease cannot exceed 30 years.  A lessee can renew for a period of a maximum of 30 years if the lessee complies with the Mineral Tenure Act.

## 4.2.2 Surface Rights

The holder of a mineral claim or mining lease issued under the Mineral Tenure Act does not have exclusive possession of the surface or exclusive right to use the surface of the land.  However, the holder of such claims and leases does have the right to access the lands for the purpose of exploring for minerals and to use the surface for mining activities (exploration, development, and production).

The surface of a mineral claim or mining lease may either be privately owned or owned by the Crown.  The Mineral Tenure Act provides for a recorded claim holder to use, enter and occupy the surface of a claim for the exploration and development or production of minerals, including the treatment of ore and concentrates, and all operations related to the exploration and development or production of minerals and the business of mining, subject to production limits.  Permits are required before undertaking most exploration or mining activity.

<!-- image -->

A recorded claim holder must give surface owners of private land and leaseholders of Crown land notice before entering for any mining activity.  A recorded holder is liable to compensate the surface owner for loss or damage caused by the entry, occupation or use of the area for exploration and development or production of minerals.

## 4.2.3 Environmental Regulations

The Environmental Assessment Act provides a mechanism for reviewing proposed major projects in British Columbia, including major mining projects, to assess their potential impacts.    The  Environmental  Assessment  Office  (EAO)  manages  the  assessment  of proposed major projects as required by the Environmental Assessment Act .

Certain large-scale project proposals must undergo an Environmental Assessment (EA) and obtain an EA certificate before they can proceed; an Application must be prepared for an EA certificate which identifies and assesses any potential effects that may result from the proposed project, and ways to mitigate any adverse effects where possible. Federally, this information is compiled into an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). Under  a  joint  EA  process,  the  proponent  submits  one  document  that  meets  the requirements of both governments.

If  the  project  is  allowed  to  proceed,  an  EA  certificate  is  issued  and  is  subject  to compliance and reporting requirements.  The EA certificate specifies a deadline by which the project must have substantially commenced and is generally at least three years and not more than five years after the issue date of the Certificate.  Once the project has substantially started, the EA certificate remains in effect for the life of the project unless suspended or cancelled for breaches of the conditions.  Proponents may apply to amend their EA certificate as project circumstances change.

## 4.2.4 Water Regulations

All water in British Columbia is owned by the Crown on behalf of the residents of the province. There are authorized uses of water outside of the licensing system, such as the use of groundwater for domestic purposes. All other ground or surface water uses, including for mining, require a license.

The  Ministry  of  Forests,  Lands,  Natural  Resource  Operations  &amp;  Rural  Development (FLNRORD) authorizes licences and approvals, and holders must comply with provincial, local and in some cases federal regulations.  Separate licenses are required for all nondomestic uses of surface and ground water.  The licence contains the terms of use, including the quantity that can be taken, the purpose for which the water will be used, and  the  time  of  year  that  water  can  be  harvested.    Water  licences  are  subject  to  a compulsory review after a 30-year period.

## 4.2.5 Royalties

Under the Mineral Tax Act in British Columbia, operators pay tax at the following rates:

- · 13% of the net revenue proceeds derived from the operations of a mine for the current fiscal year;
- · 2% of the net current proceeds derived from the operations of a mine for the current fiscal year.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

The owners of mineral lands under the Mineral Land Tax Act also pay an annual tax on mineral  lands  regardless  of  whether  minerals  are  produced  from  that  land.    The  tax amount depends on the size of the mineral lands. In British Columbia, the rate ranges between C$1.25/ha (up to 20,235 ha) and C$4.94/ha (more than 404,686 ha).

## 4.2.6 Indigenous Peoples

The  status  of  Indigenous  land  rights  and  land  holdings  must  be  considered  when acquiring  mineral  rights  in  Canada.    "Indian  reserve"  lands  under  the Indian  Act are subject to a unique federal regulatory process.  Over the past few decades, Canada has entered into modern treaties with many Indigenous groups which transferred mineral rights  ownership  in  certain  prescribed  lands  in  consideration  of  surrender  of  title  on broader  areas  of  Crown  lands.    Extracting  minerals  from  these  treaty  lands  typically requires the consent of the rights-owning Indigenous group.

## 4.2.7 Fraser Institute Survey

The QP used the 2020 Fraser Institute Annual Survey of Mining Companies report (the 2020 Fraser Institute Survey) as a reasonable source for the assessment by peers in the mining industry of the overall political risk facing an exploration or mining project in British Columbia.  Each year, the Fraser Institute sends a questionnaire to selected mining and exploration companies globally.  The Fraser Institute survey is an attempt to assess how mineral  endowments  and  public  policy  factors  such  as  taxation  and  regulatory uncertainty affect exploration investment.

The QP used the 2020 Fraser Institute survey because it is globally regarded as an independent  report-card  style  assessment  to  governments  on  how  attractive  their policies are from the point of view of an exploration manager or mining company and forms  a  proxy  for  the  assessment  by  industry  of  political  risk  in  specific  political jurisdictions from the mining industry's perspective.

Of the 77 jurisdictions surveyed in the 2020 Fraser Institute survey, British Columbia ranks  17 th for  investment  attractiveness,  41 st for  policy  perception  and  10 th for  best practices mineral potential.

## 4.3 Project Ownership

The  Project  is  70%  owned  by  Newcrest  Red  Chris  Mining  Limited,  a  wholly-owned Newcrest subsidiary, and 30% owned by Red Chris Development Company Ltd., an Imperial subsidiary.  The operating entity is the unincorporated Newcrest Red Chris Joint Venture.  Newcrest, through Newcrest Red Chris Mining Limited, is operator.

## 4.4 Mineral Tenure

The mineral tenure is registered 100% to Newcrest Red Chris Mining Limited.

The Project comprises the Red Chris Main claim group and the Red Chris South claim group.  The two groups collectively consist of 77 mineral tenures covering a total area of approximately 23,142 ha.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

A layout plan of the claim locations is provided in Figure 4-1, and the claim details are summarized in Table 4-1 for the Red Chris Main claims and Table 4-2 for the Red Chris South claims.

The main tenures for purposes of the LOM plan are five mining leases issued on 20 June 2012, for a term of 30 years, with an expiry date of 20 June 2042 (Figure 4-2).  The location of the key infrastructure that is envisaged in the 2021 PFS is shown in relation to the lease boundaries in Figure 4-3.

A rent payment for each mining lease is required by 20 June each year to keep the leases in good standing.  The leases are currently in good standing until 20 June 2022.

As part of the 2021 PFS, the proposed South Reclaim dam (see discussion in Section 18) may need to be constructed on a portion of lands occupied by Mineral Claim 541621. The Mineral Tenure Act appears to provide mineral claim holders with sufficient rights to use the surface for this purpose.  However, permitting authorities typically require that an applicant holds a mining lease or surface tenure before granting authority to carry out surface operations of this nature.  Newcrest intends to apply to convert Mineral Claim 541621 to a mining lease in advance of applying for the amendment to Mines Act Permit M-240 and EMA Permit 105017 (see discussion in Section 20.5), and an amendment to the site occupational licence to cut to perform work on lands covered by Mineral Claim 541621.

## 4.5 Surface Rights

All land in the immediate vicinity of the Red Chris Operations is Crown land.  Surface rights  to  support  the  open  pit  operations  are  permitted  by the  granted  Environmental Assessment Certificate  and  the  Mines  Act  permit  M-240  (see  Section  20.5).    Permit amendments would be required to support planned underground mining activities.

Newcrest  Red  Chris  Mining  Limited  holds  the  following  surface  tenure  issued  by FLNRORD under the Land Act (RSBC 1996, c. 245):

- · Right-of-way tenure number 6408389 over 68.95 ha of unsurveyed Crown land in the vicinity of Jackson Creek, Coyote Creek, Ealue Lake, and a portion of District Lot 2977, on which a portion of the Red Chris power line is located.  This tenure was issued on 14 July 2018 and has an expiry date of 14 July 2024.  The tenure can be renewed prior to its expiry by submitting a renewal application to FLNRORD.

Newcrest submitted an application to extend the duration of the occupational licence to cut; this is currently under review by FLNRORD and the Tahltan Central Government.

## 4.6 Water Rights

Applications for groundwater licences under the Water Sustainability Act were submitted and are under review by the FLNRORD for new and existing groundwater use for 'Mining Use'  (TIA  production  wells)  and  for  groundwater  existing  use  for  'Industrial  Purpose' (camp wells).  Under the Water Sustainability Act , a new licence application is required to increase (or reduce) the quantity of water authorized to be diverted (an amendment of an existing water licence to increase or reduce the authorized quantity is only available where  the  quantity  was  erroneously  estimated).    If  Newcrest  must  divert  a  greater quantity of groundwater in connection with further phases of the Project, a new Water Sustainability Act license may be required.

## 4.7 Royalties and Encumbrances

The five mining leases and 31 of the mineral claims are subject to a net smelter return royalty held by the Tahltan Central Government, and subject to the confidentiality terms of the Impact, Benefit and Co-Management Agreement (IBCA).  Annual advance royalty payments commenced in October 2016.

All or portions of four of the mining leases and 19 mineral claims are also subject to a 1.0% net smelter return royalty held by International Royalty Corporation, a subsidiary of Royal Gold Inc. (Royal Gold).

The Red Chris South claim group is subject to a 1.5% net smelter return royalty held by Canada Carbon Inc. The royalty may be reduced to 0.5% by payment from Newcrest to Canada Carbon Inc. of $1 million.

## 4.8 Property Agreements

An IBCA between the Tahltan Central Government, the Iskut First Nation, the Tahltan Band and the Red Chris Operations is in place.  The IBCA was restated and amended on 15 August 2019 upon Newcrest's acquisition interest.

The IBCA provides the basis for a life-of-mine partnership covering royalties, education, training, employment, contracting opportunities, capacity support, provisions for communication, and interaction on social and environmental matters.

## 4.9 Permitting Considerations

Permitting considerations are discussed in Section 20.

## 4.10 Environmental Considerations

Environmental considerations are discussed in Section 20.

Current environmental liabilities are in line with those to be expected from a long-life mining operation where mining activities are conducted via open pit mining methods. These include the open pit, operations infrastructure, and access roads.

## 4.11 Social License Considerations

Social license considerations are discussed in Section 20.

## 4.12 QP Comments on 'Item 4; Property Description and Location'

In the opinion of the QP:

- · Information provided by Newcrest's legal and tenure experts on the mining tenure held by Newcrest in the Project area supports that the Red Chris Joint Venture has valid title that is sufficient to support declaration of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves;
- · Newcrest holds sufficient surface rights to allow open pit mining activities at Red Chris;
- · Additional  negotiations  and  permits  are  required  for  the  proposed  block  cave operations (see discussion in Section 20);
- · Newcrest holds permits that allow abstraction of groundwater and surface water for current operational needs;
- · Environmental liabilities for the Project are typical of those that would be expected to be associated with a long-lived open pit mining operation.

To the extent known to the QP, there are no other significant factors and risks that may affect  access,  title,  or  the  right  or  ability  to  perform  work  on  the  Project  that  are  not discussed in this Report.

## 5 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE, AND PHYSIOGRAPHY

## 5.1 Accessibility

Road access to the Project area from Highway 37 is via an 18 km-long gravel road.

Most of the Project is accessible only by foot or by helicopter.

The nearest airports with regular commercial flights are in Terrace and Smithers, each approximately 500 km to the south.  There are irregularly maintained airstrips in Iskut, and approximately 100 km to the south at Bob Quinn Lake.

The Dease Lake airport, approximately 80 km to the north via BC Highway 37, is the transit point for the fly-in/fly-out operations.  Chartered aircraft fly employees to the Dease Lake airstrip from where they are transported by bus to the mine site.

Stewart is the nearest port with ship-loading facilities, a distance of 320 km by road from the Red Chris Operations.

## 5.2 Climate

The climate in the Project area is northern temperate with moderately warm summers and cold dry winters.  Typical daytime temperatures range from 20°C in the summer to -20°C or lower in the winter.  The Project area receives an average of 530 mm total annual precipitation which is more or less evenly distributed throughout the year, with April-May typically receiving the least rainfall and August-December the most.

Mining operations are conducted on a year-round basis.  Exploration activities can be temporarily curtailed by winter conditions.

## 5.3 Local Resources and Infrastructure

A range of infrastructure and associated facilities are available in Terrace and Smithers. Dease Lake is the service and government centre for residents of the region.

The nearest significant settlement to the Project is the village of Iskut.

Project infrastructure is discussed in more detail in Section 18.

## 5.4 Physiography

The Project is situated on the eastern portion of the Todagin upland plateau that forms a subdivision of the Klastine plateau along the northern margin of the Skeena Mountains. Elevations  on  the  plateau  are  typically  1,500  ±  30  m,  with  relatively  flat  topography broken by several deep creek gullies.

The majority of the Project area is covered by several metres of glacial till.  Bedrock exposure is confined to the higher-relief drainages and along mountainous ridges.

<!-- image -->

The south TIA, open pit and waste rock storage facilities (WRSFs) are within the Iskut River watershed, with downstream tributaries flowing into Trail Creek, and Kluea and Todagin  Lakes.    Thurston's  Trickle  and  two  unnamed  creeks  are  ephemeral  water courses that report to the TIA.  Camp Creek drains waters south of the open pit into Trail Creek.

Vegetation consists of spruce and balsam forest cover with stands of aspens and scrub conifers at the lower elevations while buckbrush, willow and slide alder are common along the steep-sided, incised creek valleys.  At higher elevations dwarf birch, willow and balsam dominate.  Above the tree line at about the 1,370 m elevation contour, alpine grasses and flowers are the predominant vegetation.

## 5.5 Tahltan Nation

The Red Chris Operations are located within the territory of the Tahltan Nation, which covers approximately 95,933 km 2  and goes from the mouth of the Iskut River in the south to the Rancheria River in the Yukon, from the eastern slopes of the Coastal Mountains in the west to the headwaters of the Stikine and the upper half of the Turnagain River in the east.  Tahltan territory also extends into the Yukon.

The Tahltan collectively hold rights to hunt, fish, trap and harvest berries and other food and medicinal plants throughout their asserted traditional territory.  Tahltan members of local communities traditionally hunt moose, caribou, sheep, goat and groundhog in the Project vicinity.

Tahltan  Nation  peoples  have  a  long  history  of  cooperation  with  the  mining  and exploration sectors, and are an important source of both skilled and semi-skilled labour regionally.    The  Tahltan  Nation  Development  Corporation  is  a  local  and  regional employer,  and  has  participated  in  the  mining,  road  construction,  hydroelectric  power generation, forestry, catering, custodial work, heavy construction, road development and transportation sectors.

## 5.6 Land Usage

The  mine  area  falls  within  the  area  covered  in  the  Cassiar  Iskut  Stikine  Land  and Resource Management Plan.  Exploration and development for minerals and energy, including development of road access, are acceptable activities throughout the plan area outside of protected areas, subject to regulations of statutes.  The Red Chris Operations also overlap the Todagin Zone which includes Todagin Plateau and Tsatia Mountain, and  the  eastern  boundary  extends  to  the  treeline  of  the  Klappan  drainage.    The management intent for the Todagin Zone is to integrate management for Stone's sheep and other wildlife, recreational activities, and mineral exploration, mine development, and reclamation.

Land Act tenures in the area around the operations include a recreation reserve around Ealue  Lake,  and  another  near  the  Tatogga  Lake  Resort;  a  railway  right-of-way designated use area running north-south about 13 km east of the mine; and the tenure for Highway 37 running north-south about 12 km east of the operations.  There is an

interim licence for a power line right-of-way running northeast from Tatogga Lake to a point about 8 km from the mine, and a small sand and gravel tenure on the east side of Eddontenajon Lake about 14 km northwest of the mine.

Other land uses in the area include hunting and trapping.  The operations are in Region 6 (Skeena Region) within Management Unit 6-20, and lie within trapline TR620T001, which covers 2,324,370 ha, registered to members of the Iskut Band.  The Project is in the  guiding  territory  registered  to  Jerry  Creyke  (Guiding  Certificate  601025),  which stretches from the Klappan River to Mount Edziza.  Kinaskan Lake Outfitters, operated by the Creyke family, generally guides in the area from August to October, concentrating hunts  for  stone  sheep,  mountain  goat,  moose,  black  bear,  and  wolf  in  the  Todagin Mountain area (Kinaskan Lake Outfitters, 2019).

The  operations  are  located  within  the  Cassiar  Timber  Supply  Area,  which  covers 13,131,876  ha;  of  this,  210,681  ha  (or  1.6%)  are  available  for  timber  harvesting (Government  of  British  Columbia,  2013).    Forestry  activity  within  the  Cassiar  IskutStikine Land and Resource Management Plan area is limited because of extensive alpine and sub-alpine areas with very low timber volumes, with only localized concentrations of stands suitable for timber harvesting.

## 5.7 QP Comments on 'Item 5; Accessibility, Climate, Local Resources, Infrastructure, And Physiography'

In the opinion of the QP, the existing local infrastructure, availability of staff, methods whereby goods could be transported to the Project area are well-established and well understood by Newcrest, and can support the declaration of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves.

Surface rights are outlined in Section 4.5.

Operations are conducted year-round.

## 6 HISTORY

## 6.1 Exploration History

The Project exploration and development history is summarized in Table 6-1.

## 6.2 Production History

Production  from  the  commencement of  mining  in  2015  is  provided  in  Table  6-2.    Newcrest obtained a 70% Project ownership interest in 2019, and was entitled to 70% of the production from that date forward.

## 7 GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND MINERALIZATION

## 7.1 Regional Geology

The regional geological setting comprises island arc volcanic, sedimentary, and plutonic rocks of the Middle to Late Triassic Stuhini Group, the Early to Middle Jurassic Hazelton Group, and the Middle and Upper Jurassic to Lower Cretaceous Bowser Lake Group, which form the accreted geological terrane of Stikinia in the northern Intermontane Belt of the Canadian Cordillera.

Several large calc-alkalic Late Triassic plutons (Stikine suite, ca 222-216 Ma (Zhu et al., 2018)) cut the Stuhini Group, and are interpreted to mark an approximate Late Triassic arc axis formed as a result of southward subduction.

The  Stikine  terrane  hosts  a  number  of  porphyry,  epithermal,  and  volcanic  massive sulphide deposits, including the Red Chris deposit (Figure 7-1).

## 7.2 Project Geology

## 7.2.1 Lithologies

A Project geology plan is provided in Figure 7-2.

The  basement  rocks  in  the  Project  area  are  Late  Paleozoic  metavolcanic  and metasedimentary rocks of the Stuhini Group, which have been intruded by granodiorite/diorite bodies.

Overlying  the  Stuhini  Group  are  feldspathic  sandstones,  siltstone,  basaltic-andesitic volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks of the Late Triassic Stuhini Group that are intruded by a  series  of  diorite  to  quartz  monzonite  dikes  (Red  Stock).    A  deformation  event, interpreted  to  be  Late  Triassic  in  age,  pre-dated  intrusion  of  the  Red  Stock  and  is evidenced by the intrusions being relatively upright and less deformed than their Stuhini Group host rocks.

Overlying these units are siltstones, sandstones and limestones of the Early to Middle Jurassic Hazelton Group that have been intruded by alkali granite bodies.  Uplift and erosion that occurred in the Early Jurassic resulted in these rocks being uncomformably deposited on the Stuhini Group and Red Stock lithologies.

The Bowser Lake Group, Middle Jurassic in age, consists of sandstone, siltstone and conglomerates, and paraconformably overlies the Hazelton Group.  Intrusive into these sediments are leucogranite and quartz monzonite bodies.

The topmost lithology consists of olivine basalts of the Mio-Pliocene Maitland Volcanics. Glacial and post-glacial sediments overlie all units.

## 7.2.2 Metamorphism

Metamorphic grade in the Stuhini Group is very low (sub-greenschist) although there is local hornfelsing around intrusions. The Stikine Assemblage displays greenschist facies metamorphism.

## 7.2.3 Structure

Significant faults in the region have a dominant northeast trend.  A series of faults with demonstrated southeast side-down relative  displacements have been mapped in the Red Chris area, locally truncating the northwestern limit of the Hazelton and Bowser Lake units.

## 7.2.4 Weathering

Typically, the effects of weathering are limited due to the recent retreat of glaciers that formerly covered the area.

Prominent limonitic gossans and natural kill zones occur within the steep slopes and drainages over the Gully and Far West zones.  However, in areas without drainage relief such as over the East and Main zones, weak limonite extends only 1-2 m beneath the top of the bedrock.  The overlying gravel till layer is often very limonitic or composed of ferricrete.

Supergene  chalcocite  mineralization  was  intersected  in  shallow  drilling  near  the headwaters of the East Gully drainage.  Chalcocite occurs along with malachite, azurite and manganese oxides in this oxidized zone.

## 7.3 Local and Deposit Geology

## 7.3.1 Lithologies

The Late Triassic Red Stock hosts the Red Chris deposit.  The Red Stock is about 8 km long by 1.5 km wide at surface, and elongate in the east-northeast direction series of multiphase porphyritic diorite to quartz monzonite stocks and dikes.  It is interpreted to have been tilted to about 15° to the south-southeast.  It has three main phases (Table 7-1).

Two subunits of the Stuhini Group are recognized.  The lower subunit is dominated by mudstone,  siltstone,  and  sandstone,  with  minor  lenses  of  volcanic  rocks.    Within approximately 500 m of the stock contact, the mudstones form competent, massive to laminated hornfels.  The upper subunit consists predominantly of volcanic flows, flow breccias, and epiclastic rocks of basaltic to andesitic composition.

A cross-section through the East zone showing the lithologies is provided as Figure 7-3.

## 7.3.2 Oxidation

Supergene oxidation of the system is mostly of negligible thickness.  In the low relief areas overlying the Main and East zones, weak limonite extends only 1-2 m below the top of bedrock.  It appears that glaciation removed any significant supergene copper mineralisation that might have existed over the Red Chris deposit.  Fracture-controlled and  weak  selective  oxidation  locally  occurs  to  depths  &gt;100  m,  especially  in  close proximity to structures.

## 7.3.3 Structure

Significant faults in the region have a dominant northeast trend.  A series of faults with demonstrated southeast side-down relative displacements has been mapped in the Red Chris area, locally truncating the northwestern limit of the Hazelton and Bowser Lake units.

Several  significant  faults  cut  the  Red  Stock,  influence  patterns  of  mineralisation  and alteration, and involve late mineral and/or post-mineral displacement.

The earliest fault generation is a series of west-northwest-striking, moderately to steeply northward-dipping, DZ faults.  The DZ faults are localized in the hydrolytically-altered rocks generally along the margins of the different porphyry phases.  In drill holes the faults are variable related to alteration and mylonitic to cataclastic fault rock fabrics.  The DZ faults offset the different porphyry phases and associated mineralisation suggesting northside down and dextral strike-slip with offsets of &lt;50 m.

The South Boundary fault is an important post-mineral fault cutting the Red Stock.  At the surface, it forms part of the southern margin of the stock and limits mineralisation in the East zone area.  It appears to have up to 500 m of sinistral displacement of the mineralization,  based  on  mapping  at  surface,  reconstruction  of  East  Zone,  and  the location of the recently-discovered East Ridge deposit.

The sub-parallel EZ fault, at surface, is a sub vertical splay of the South Boundary Fault, limiting the extent of mineralisation near surface.

## 7.3.4 Alteration

Potassic alteration is best preserved below the 1,200-m elevation in the East zone, and at  somewhat deeper levels in the Main zone.  The original upper and outer limits of potassic alteration are difficult to define due to strong overprinting by later sericite-claycarbonate  assemblages.    Potassic  and  intermediate  argillic  alteration  appear  to  be directly related to the mineralization.

A laterally-extensive phyllic alteration halo extends laterally &gt;500 m from the high-grade core.  It is typically characterised by quartz-sericite-pyrite alteration as vein halos and as pervasive alteration of the groundmass of Red Stock intrusive phases.

An outer propylitic  (chlorite-epidote-albite-carbonate-hematite)  halo  primarily  affects the Stuhini Group volcanic and sedimentary rocks on the north side of the deposit.  It

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

truncates mineralization in the core of the deposit as late post-mineral stage monzonite intrusions and/or mafic dykes.

Late  calc-potassic  (K-feldspar-albite-biotite-chlorite-epidote-magnetite  ±  actinolite) alteration associated with late and post-mineral intrusions cuts all of the other alteration phases.

Deep sodic (albite-quartz-actinolite-illite-carbonate) alteration affects the Stuhini Group sediments and late-mineral monzonite.

Post-mineral  mafic  dykes  cut  all  other  lithologies  and  are  variably  altered  to  clay, propylitic alteration or minor carbonate.  Bowser Lake Group sediments are relatively unaltered.

An example cross-section showing the alteration types is included as Figure 7-4.

## 7.3.5 Mineralization

The Red Chris deposit is about 3.4 km in strike length, 0.3 km in width and over 1.3 km in vertical extent.  There are two main zones, East and Main.  The Main zone is 1,200 m in strike length, 300 m in width and has been drill tested to 1,300 m depth.  The East zone is 1,200 m in strike length, 300 m in width and has been drill tested to 1,400 m depth.

Figure 7-5 is a cross-section through the mineralization in the East zone, showing quartz vein percentages.  Figure 7-6 is a cross-section through the mineralization in the East zone showing sulphide mineral types.

The zone of &gt;0.2% Cu%, is &gt;3 km long, oriented west-southwest-east-northeast and can reach 650 m in width.  Quartz-magnetite stockworks are overprinted by higher gold and  copper  grades.    The  highest  copper-gold  grades  occur  in  and  around  the  P2 porphyries and associated igneous breccias.

Mineralisation consists of thin wavy or thicker planar quartz veins containing chalcopyrite, bornite and magnetite; these minerals are also disseminated outside the veins.  In the upper part of the deposit, the bornite rich mineralisation was overprinted by -sericite  and  clay  alteration  and  associated  sulphidation.    Gold  occurs as microscopic inclusions in the copper sulphides, and occasionally as free grains in high-grade zones.

Molybdenite occurs locally in quartz veins, especially deeper and outside the high grade -core.

## 7.4 Prospects/Exploration Targets

Exploration potential is discussed in Section 9.

## 7.5 QP Comments on 'Item 7:  Geological Setting and Mineralization'

In the opinion of the QP:

- · The  understanding  of  the  Red  Chris  deposit  setting,  lithologies,  and  geological, structural, and alteration controls on mineralization is sufficient to support estimation of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves;
- · The geological knowledge of the deposit area is acceptable to reliably inform mine planning.

## 8 DEPOSIT TYPES

## 8.1 Overview

Red Chris is considered to be an example of a porphyry copper deposit with elevated gold values, characterized by the composition of its host rocks, its alteration, and its copper-gold signature, with only minor molybdenum.  It is classified as belonging to the high-potassium calc-alkalic type of porphyry system, which includes several world-class deposits such as Bingham Canyon (Utah).

## 8.2 Porphyry Copper Deposits

The following discussion of the typical nature of porphyry-copper deposits is sourced from Sillitoe, (2010), Singer et al., (2008), and Sinclair (2007).

Porphyry  copper  systems  commonly  define  linear  belts,  some  many  hundreds  of kilometres long, as well as occurring less commonly in apparent isolation.  The systems are closely related to underlying composite plutons, at paleo-depths of 5 km to 15 km, which represent the supply chambers for the magmas and fluids that formed the vertically elongate (&gt;3 km) stocks or dyke swarms and associated mineralization.

Commonly, several discrete stocks are emplaced in and above the pluton roof zones, resulting  in  either  clusters  or  structurally  controlled  alignments  of  porphyry  copper systems.  The rheology and composition of the host rocks may strongly influence the size, grade, and type of mineralization generated in porphyry copper systems. Individual systems have life spans of circa 100,000 years to several million years, whereas deposit clusters or alignments, as well as entire belts, may remain active for 10 million years or longer.

Deposits are typically semicircular to elliptical in plan view.  In cross-section, ore-grade material in a deposit typically has the shape of an inverted cone with the altered, but lowgrade, interior of the cone referred to as the 'barren' core.  In some systems, the barren core may be a late-stage intrusion.

Figure  8-1  shows  a  schematic  section  of  a  porphyry  copper  deposit  illustrating  the relationships of the lithocap to the porphyry body, and associated mineralization styles.

The alteration and mineralization in porphyry copper systems are zoned outward from the stocks or dyke swarms, which typically comprise several generations of intermediate to felsic porphyry intrusions.  Porphyry copper-gold-molybdenum deposits are centred on  the  intrusions,  whereas  adjacent  carbonate  wall  rocks  commonly  host  proximal copper-gold skarns and less commonly, distal base metal and gold skarn deposits.

Beyond the skarn front, carbonate-replacement copper and/or base metal-gold deposits, and/or  sediment-hosted  (distal-disseminated)  gold  deposits  can  form.    Peripheral mineralization is less conspicuous in non-carbonate wall rocks, but may include base metal- or gold-bearing veins and mantos.

Data compiled by Singer et al. (2008) indicate that the median size of the longest axis of alteration surrounding a porphyry copper deposit is 4-5 km, while the median size area of alteration is 7-8 km 2 .

Alteration is typically zoned laterally from the core of the deposit and vertically.  Figure 8-1 is a schematic illustration of alteration zoning and overprinting relationships in an idealized porphyry system. Alteration is defined by the alteration mineral assemblages that  occur  in  each  alteration  zone.  In  silicate-rich  rocks,  the  most  common  alteration minerals are K-feldspar, biotite, muscovite (sericite), albite, anhydrite, chlorite, calcite, epidote,  and  kaolinite.  In  the  core  of  the  deposit,  alteration  is  typically  potassic  and consists of  secondary K-feldspar, biotite,  anhydrite,  and  quartz  with  possible  bornite, chalcopyrite, gold, magnetite, and pyrite.  Outward and upward from the potassic core, alteration includes argillic with various clay minerals, pyrite and chalcopyrite, propylitic with actinolite, epidote, chlorite, pyrite, carbonate, pyrite, and albite.

In carbonate rocks, the most common minerals are garnet, pyroxene, epidote, quartz, actinolite, chlorite, biotite, calcite, dolomite, K-feldspar, and wollastonite.

Other alteration minerals commonly found in porphyry-copper deposits are tourmaline, andalusite, and actinolite.

## 8.3 Red Chris

The Red Chris deposit was initially interpreted to be an example of an alkalic or 'hybrid' alkalic  deposit.    Interpretations  of  chemical  data  on  synmineral  porphyry  phases completed by Rees et al., (2015) suggests that the host porphyries are high-potassium, calc-alkalic in composition, similar to the monzonitic copper-(molybdenum-gold) class of porphyry deposits, which includes Bingham and Bajo de la Alumbrera.  Red Chris is also  classified  as  an  A-vein  type  deposit,  due  to  the  strong  control  on  higher-grade copper-gold by A-vein stockworks with abundant disseminated copper sulphides.

Whole rock analyses from early and intermediate stage porphyries in the Red Stock fall marginally on the calc-alkaline side of the alkaline/subalkaline divider, suggesting that Red Chris should be assigned to the high-K calc-alkalic category of Lang et al. (1994). However,  late-mineral  stage  porphyries  plot  in  the  alkalic  field.    The  mineralizing (intermediate-stage) quartz monzonite porphyries plot in the high-K calc-alkalic field.

In Seedorff  et  al.'s  (2005)  classification  scheme,  Red  Chris  conforms  with  their 'monzonitic Cu (Mo-Au) class' of porphyry copper deposits.  This class features an uncommon association of copper with both gold and molybdenum credits, although at Red Chris the molybdenum relationship with copper-gold is irregular.

Proffett (2009) recognized two types of porphyry-copper systems, based on differences in  mineralization  style  (copper  in  A-type  quartz  veins  versus  copper  in  early-formed fracture  halos),  and  the  corresponding  genetic  correlation  with  a  particular  porphyry magma  phase  (a  high  versus  a  low  correlation,  respectively).    He  attributed  the differences to depth of formation, and whether a two-phase or a single-phase fluid was responsible for sulphide behaviour.  Red Chris has the hallmarks of an 'A-vein type'

system, and probably formed at a relatively shallow level in the crust from a two-phase mineralizing fluid.

Mineralization related to magmatic-hydrothermal brecciation is not evident at Red Chris.

## 8.4 QP Comments on 'Item 8:  Deposit Types'

The  QP  considers  the  use  of  a  calc-alkalic  porphyry  copper  model  for  exploration programs is a reasonable basis for exploration targeting for copper-gold mineralization in  the  Project  area.    Skarn-style  models  are  also  applicable,  although  economic mineralization of the tenor of the porphyry deposits has not been identified to date.

## 9 EXPLORATION

## 9.1 Grids and Surveys

The grid and co-ordinate system used for the mining operations is UTM NAD83/9N.

Exploration activities away from the mine site use UTM NAD83/9N.

Topographic control is established from PhotoSat topographic data and derived digital elevation model.  The data are considered accurate to within 15 cm.

## 9.2 Geological Mapping

Surface  geological  mapping  was  performed  by  Imperial  Metals  staff.    Mapping  was completed at a range of scales, from prospect (1:5,000) to regional (1:50,000).

## 9.3 Geochemical Sampling

## 9.3.1 Legacy

The term 'legacy' is used to refer to all work conducted by companies other than Imperial and Newcrest.

A total of 934 samples were collected by unknown parties during regional reconnaissance, consisting of five rock chip, two silt, 31 soil and 896 samples of unknown methodology.

## 9.3.2 Imperial

A total of 188 B-horizon soil samples were collected from the Peggy mineral showing, located north of the open pit.

About 118 rock chip samples were collected from across the Red Chris porphyry corridor.

## 9.3.3 Newcrest

Since Newcrest assumed operatorship, geochemical samples collected included 128 soil samples collected  across  the  East  Ridge  surface  expression.    Sample  locations  are shown in Figure 9-1.

Surface geochemical sampling has principally been used as a mineralisation vectoring tool to prioritise exploration prospects and generate direct drill targets.

## 9.4 Geophysics

## 9.4.1 Legacy

In the period 1968-1970, Great Plains conducted ground magnetic and IP surveys as part  of  reconnaissance  exploration  activities.    American  Bullion  completed  ground magnetic and IP surveys, and an airborne VLF EM survey.

A series of conductivity and magnetic anomalies were generated.

## 9.4.2 Imperial

In  2009,  Imperial  undertook  a  Titan-24  deep  imaging  IP-MT  geophysical  survey, consisting of 13 north-northwest-oriented lines perpendicular to the orientation of the Red Stock, and extending into country rocks and structurally-overlapping rock units.  This survey provided high-quality resistivity and chargeability imaging of the subsurface.  A property-wide aeromagnetic survey was also completed, and field crews ran extensive proton ground magnetometer surveys over the Titan grid and throughout the Todagin plateau.

A series of conductivity and magnetic anomalies were generated, and number of these anomalies warrant drill follow-up.

## 9.4.3 Newcrest

In 2020, Newcrest undertook an airborne geophysical survey campaign.  The campaign consisting of  a combined airborne Z Tipper axis electromagnetic (ZTEM) and gravity -survey followed by an airborne magnetic survey.  The airborne ZTEM and gravity surveys were completed across the entire Red Chris claim package at 250 m line spacing for a total of 1,922 line km.  The airborne magnetic survey was completed across the northern and southern portion of the Red Chris claim package, complementing previous surveys at a 100 m line spacing for a total of 1,328 line km.

A series of anomalies including conductivity and magnetic were generated and will be followed up in future exploration programs.

## 9.5 Petrology, Mineralogy, and Research Studies

Multiple petrological studies were conducted as part of broader research studies and to directly understand the mineralogy of the Red Chris deposit.  Petrology was completed on selected core and rock samples

<!-- image -->

Corescan  infra-red  and  near-infra-red  hyperspectral  analyses  were  conducted  on selected drill core.  This technique provides accurate mineralogical information through very high-resolution scanning of the sample and use of specific algorithmic processing of the acquired spectra.  This technique can be used to accurately identify hydrothermal alteration  minerals  that  are  not  readily  identifiable  during  geological  logging.    As  the targeted mineralisation styles are well known to have predictably zoned hydrothermal alteration patterns around mineralised centres, being able to identify the mineralogical assemblages of drilling samples can be a useful tool for improving the understanding of the known deposit areas and vectoring towards deposits in exploration.

## 9.6 Exploration Potential

## 9.6.1 Red Chris

A number of areas remain prospective at depth in the immediate vicinity of the open pit operation (Figure 9-3 and Figure 9-4):

- · In the East Zone, drilling continues to confirm the potential for additional high-grade mineralisation  south  of  the  South  Boundary  Fault.    The  South  Boundary  Fault currently defines the southern extent of mineralisation across the East Zone, Main Zone and Gully Zone;
- · In  the  Main  Zone,  drilling  has  confirmed  the  potential  for  further  higher-grade mineralisation beneath and to the south west of the open pit.  The mineralisation is located immediately adjacent to the South Boundary Fault and is open at depth and along strike.  Drilling to define the extent and continuity of this potential high grade mineralisation is underway;
- · In the Gully Zone, drilling has confirmed the potential for discrete zones of highergrade mineralisation that will require follow up drilling to determine their full extent.

The East Ridge discovery is located 300 m to the east of the East Zone (Figure 9-5). Drilling to date has demonstrated continuity of the East Ridge zone (&gt;0.3 g/t Au over dimensions of 400 m high, 400 m long and 125 m wide, with the higher-grade (&gt;1 g/t Au) portion now extending over an area of over 300 m high, 300 m long and 100 m wide. Mineralization is open to the east and at depth, and extends the eastern dimensions of the mineralized porphyry corridor.

## 9.6.2 Regional Prospects

No work has been completed by Imperial or Newcrest on the Red Chris South claims package.  Bolero Resources Corp. completed 818 soil samples, 15 rock chip samples and four drill holes totalling 1,450 m in 2011.  No evidence from drilling, rock and soil sampling, or prospecting gave direct indications of Red Chris-style copper-gold porphyry mineralization; however, drilling did not test beneath the Bowser Group cover sequence.

## 9.7 QP Comments on 'Item 9:  Exploration'

In the QP's opinion:

- · The  exploration  programs  completed  to  date  are  appropriate  to  the  style  of  the deposits and prospects;
- · Additional exploration has a likelihood of generating further exploration successes particularly depth extensions of known zones.

## 10 DRILLING

## 10.1 Introduction

Table 10-1 summarizes all drilling in the Project area to 30 September, 2021.  Across all programs,  a  total  of  1,477  drill  holes  and  test  pits  (about  400,974  m),  has  been completed.  Core drilling is the predominant drill type.

A total of 487 core holes  (287,535 m) support the Mineral Resource estimates, from the Texasgulf,  American  Bullion,  bcMetals  (referred  to  as  legacy  drilling),  Imperial,  and Newcrest drill programs.  (Table 10-2).

A total of 82 drill holes were removed from estimation support because the holes were drilled for geotechnical purposes; were &lt;30 m in depth; or were drilled by bcMetals, and the assay results did not reflect the assay values from later drilling in the same area.

A Project-wide drill collar location plan is included as Figure 10-1.  A drill collar location plan showing the drilling supporting the Mineral Resource estimates is provided in Figure 10-2, and a long-section showing the drilling is shown in Figure 10-3.

## 10.2 Drill Methods

Drill contractors and rig types are summarized, where known, in Table 10-3.  Core sizes included PQ3 (83.1 mm core diameter) HQ (63.5 mm), HQ3 (61.1 mm), NQ (47.6 mm), NQ3 (45.1 mm), and BQTK (40.7 mm).

Core from inclined drill holes during the Newcrest drilling is oriented on 3 m or 6 m runs using an electronic core orientation tool (Reflex ACTIII or Boart Longyear Trucore).  At the end of each run, the bottom of hole position is marked by the driller, which is later transferred to the whole drill core run length with a bottom-of-hole reference line.

## 10.3 Logging Procedures

## 10.3.1 Legacy

Geological logging procedures are not well documented for any program prior to 2003. Core recovery, and rock quality designation (RQD) were logged, and specific gravity measurements were completed.  All data were entered into a computer database.

## 10.3.2 Imperial

Once drill core was received at the core shack, the core was washed and logged.

Geological logging consisted of qualitative descriptions of lithology, alteration, mineralisation, veining, and structure.

The geotechnical data collected included core recovery, rock quality designation (RQD), fracture  counts,  core  strength,  and  overall  ratings,  with  special  attention  paid  to  the occurrence of slickensides and fault gouge.

The core was also logged with a KT-9 magnetic susceptibility instrument over every sample  interval.    Ten  susceptibility  readings  were  taken  for  each  sample,  and  then averaged.    Geology  data  were  recorded  into  the  commercially-available  Northface Lagger software, a database program designed for exploration drilling.

## 10.3.3 Newcrest

Geological  logging  using  Toughbook  computers  recorded  qualitative  descriptions  of lithology, alteration, mineralisation, veining, and structure, including orientation of key geological features.

Geotechnical  measurements  were  recorded  included  RQD,  fracture  frequency,  solid core recovery, and qualitative rock strength measurements.

Magnetic susceptibility measurements were recorded every metre.

All geological and geotechnical logging was conducted at the Red Chris mine site.

Digital data were captured, validated and stored in an acQuire database.

All drill cores were photographed, prior to cutting and/or sampling the core.

## 10.4 Recoveries

The recovery recorded by Imperial at Red Chris is close to 100% and the sample quality is  considered  to  be  excellent.    The  sampling  does  not  result  in  any  biases  and  is representative of the areas drilled.

During  the  Newcrest  programs,  core  recovery  was  systematically  recorded  from  the commencement of coring to the end of the hole, by reconciling against driller's depth

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

blocks  in  each  core  tray  with  data  recorded  in  the  database.    Drillers'  depth  blocks provided the depth, interval of core recovered, and interval of core drilled.

Core recoveries were typically 100%, with isolated zones of lower recovery associated with fault zones.

## 10.5 Collar Surveys

## 10.5.1 Legacy

In 2003, proposed drill hole sites were surveyed in by McElhanney Consulting Services Ltd. using a total station instrument and established property grid controls.  The final drill hole  collar  locations  were  surveyed  by  McElhanney  using  both  a  total  station  and  a survey quality global positioning system (GPS) instrument.

## 10.5.2 Imperial

Imperial drill hole collars were surveyed with a handheld Garmin 60csx GPS.

## 10.5.3 Newcrest

Drill collar locations were surveyed using a RTK GPS with GNSS with a stated accuracy of ± 0.025m.  Drill rig alignment was attained using an electronic azimuth aligner (Reflex TN14 GYROCOMPASS).

## 10.6 Downhole Surveys

## 10.6.1 Legacy

In 2003, the drill contractor, Hy-Tech Drilling, was responsible for all down-hole surveys. Two systems were used, with the Reflex digital magnetic instrument being the primary survey system and the Accushot photo system as a backup in case of Reflex breakdown or unavailability.  Twenty-four of the 235 down-hole surveys were deemed unacceptable due to incorrect azimuth readings and were rejected.  Blocked bits and operator error were responsible for most survey failures.

## 10.6.2 Imperial

Down hole surveys were periodically conducted using a Reflex EZ-Trac downhole probe. Measurements were taken every  9.14  m  (three  rods),  with  the  probe  suspended  by aluminium running gear 7.0 m beyond the drill bit.  Magnetic interference of the EZ-Trac is negligible at Red Chris due to the low amount of magnetite.  Data recorded at each survey station included azimuth, dip, temperature, and magnetic field strength.

## 10.6.3 Newcrest

Downhole  surveys  were  collected  at  9-30  m  intervals  using  single  shot  survey instruments, either Reflex EZ-SHOT or Boart Longyear TruShot tool.  At the end of the

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

drill  hole,  all  holes  were  surveyed  using  a  continuous  Reflex  EZ-GYRO  gyro  survey instrument to surface.

After the final hole survey, the single shot priorities were downgraded in priority and the continuous data assigned a priority of 1 for final hole plotting.

## 10.7 Geotechnical and Hydrological Drilling

A 2003 geotechnical drill program was completed to provide design parameters for the proposed pit slopes, plant site foundations, WRSF, low-grade stockpile, and the TIA, and included:

- · Pit area:  nine orientated, inclined core holes (2,499 m);
- · WRSF site:  two shallow (approximately 35 m) inclined drill holes and six test pits;
- · Plant site:  two shallow vertical drill holes (approximately 35 m), two test pits;
- · TIA site:  Four core holes (210 m), 16 test pits.

Selected drill holes had 1' standpipe piezometers and 2' groundwater monitoring wells installed.

A second program was completed in 2009, consisting of four geotechnical holes in the newly-proposed plant site area, two geotechnical holes in potential crusher site areas, and two geotechnical holes in the valley bottom of the TIA site.  Additional information was collected from three embankment cuts along the TIA access, data from previouslyinstalled groundwater monitoring wells and piezometers, and from site material mapping.

A 2010 program comprised 41 drill holes (1,888.48 m) at plant and TIA sites, and areas designated as potential borrow material sites.

Geotechnical  and  hydrological  considerations  in  support  of  mining  activities  are discussed in Section 16.

## 10.8 Grade Control

Grade control spacing is carried out at a nominal 9 x 9 m spacing, with hole depths of approximately 12 m.  Drill holes are completed using Atlas Copco PV351 and CM780D blast hole rigs.

## 10.9 Drilling Completed  Since  Close-out  Date  for  Database  Supporting  Mineral Resource Estimate

The database for resource estimation was closed as of 1 July, 2021.  A total of 127 core holes (approximately 128,357 m) was drilled to 30 September 2021.  This drilling focused on areas outside of the Mineral Resource estimate, and was primarily completed for exploration purposes in the new East Ridge discovery and for geotechnical support of the proposed underground infrastructure.  Drilling was ongoing at the Report effective

date.  All exploration drilling was logged and sampled.  Geotechnical drilling was logged and sampled if required, and when made available.

In the QP's view the few new drill holes that will intersect the area of the current Mineral Resource estimate will have no material effect on the overall tonnages or average grades of the current Mineral Resource estimate.

## 10.10 Sample Length/True Thickness

Drill spacing varies in the deposit ranging from approximately 50 x 50 m in the better drilled deposit areas in the East zone to about 100 x 200 m spacing on the less well drilled portions of the deposit in the Gully zone.

The term 'true thickness' is not generally applicable to porphyry-style deposits as the entire rock mass is potentially mineralised and there is often no preferred orientation to the mineralisation.  In areas that display porphyry-style mineralisation, in general, most drill  holes  intersect  mineralised  zones  at  an  angle,  and  the  drill  hole  intercept  widths reported for those drill holes are typically greater than the true widths of the mineralisation at the drill intercept point.

## 10.11 QP Comments on 'Item 10:  Drilling'

In the opinion of the QP, the quantity and quality of the logged geological data, collar, and  downhole  survey  data  collected  in  the  Texasgulf,  American  Bullion,  bcMetals, Imperial  and  Newcrest  exploration  and  infill  drill  programs  are  sufficient  to  support Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve estimation and mine planning as follows:

- · Core and RC logging meets industry standards for copper and gold exploration;
- · Collar surveys have been performed using industry standard instrumentation at the time the drill program was conducted;
- · Downhole surveys were performed using industry standard instrumentation at the time the drill program was conducted;
- · Recovery data from core and RC drill programs are acceptable;
- · Drill  orientations  are  generally  appropriate  for  the  mineralization  style  and  the orientation of mineralization for the bulk of the deposit area (refer to Figure 9-4);
- · Drilling  has  generally  been  done  at  regularly-spaced  intervals  and  is  considered representative of the deposit.  Drilling was not specifically targeted to the high-grade portions of the deposit, rather, a relatively consistent drill spacing was completed.

## 11 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES, AND SECURITY

## 11.1 Sampling Methods

## 11.1.1 Core Sampling

## 11.1.1.1 Legacy

## 1956 to 1994

There is no information available on the earliest drill sampling programs.

## 1994-1995

Drill  core  was  split  in  half  lengthwise  using  a  Longyear  manual  splitter  and  sampled between drilling length blocks; usually at 3.05 m (10 ft) intervals.  A duplicate sample of every 20 th   sample  was  inserted  into  the  sampling  sequence  as  a  'blind'  check-assay sample  duplicate.    All  samples  were  labelled,  double-bagged  and  flown  to  a  secure landing and collection site at Tatogga Lake Resort, situated on Highway 37.

## 2003-2004

The length of the sampled interval depended upon geological rock contacts, core size, and changes in mineral intensity, but generally averaged 3 m with NQ core and 2 m with HQ core.  The core was split in half lengthwise using a Longyear manual splitter and half the sample, between the assay interval tags, was placed in labelled, tagged, doublebagged plastic sample bags.  These were placed in rice bags (nominally five samples per rice bag) and shipped to a secure site at Tatogga Lake Resort.

## 11.1.1.2 Imperial

From 2007 to August 2019, drill core was delivered directly from the drill to the core shack where geological and geotechnical logging was completed.  Sample intervals were marked at 2.5 m (maximum) intervals starting from zero, or less if required by major geological  contacts.    Where  a  geological  contact  affected  the  grade  distribution,  the geologist would mark a sample contact at the geological contact as well.

Sample tags were filled out and inserted into the core box by a geologist.  The marked and tagged core were photographed and then cut axially with a rock saw (rarely with a hydraulic splitter).  One half of the cut core was placed in a clear poly-ore bag with a sample tag and zap-strapped.  The other half remained in the core box for storage on site in sturdy wooden racks.

Sample bags were placed into plastic white rice bags, driven to Iskut and stored on pallets in a locked container at the Bandstra Depot.  Samples were shipped via Bandstra to the Acme Analytical (Acme) preparation laboratory in Smithers.

## 11.1.1.3 Newcrest

Core was cut and sampled at the Red Chris Operations core processing facility.  PQ, HQ and NQ diameter cores were drilled on a 3 m or 6 m run.  Core was cut using a manual or automatic core-cutter and half core sampled at 2 m intervals.  Cover sequences were not sampled.

Half-core samples were collected in plastic bags together with pre-numbered sample tags and grouped in plastic bags for dispatch to the laboratory.  Sample weights typically varied  from  5-10  kg,  and  sample  sizes  are  considered  appropriate  for  the  style  of mineralisation.  Drill core samples were freighted by road to the laboratory.

## 11.1.2 Ore Control (Blasthole) Sampling

Blasthole sampling is conducted in the open pit on the cone of material produced when drilling  an  open  hole  percussion  hole,  approximately  311  mm  diameter  to  a  depth of approximately 12 m. This generates approximately 2 t of sample.

Sampling is carried out with a push tube (pipe spear) manually inserted into the blast cone at 4-5 locations and deposited in a calico bag for an approximate 2-3 kg sample.

## 11.2 Density Determinations

In 1994-1995, 6,934 specific gravity measurements were recorded at 8 m intervals.  The method used is not reported.

In 2003, 134 15-cm-long core samples were selected for specific gravity testing at the University  of  British  Columbia  Mining  and  Mineral  Process  Engineering  Group.    The process used to measure bulk density was ASTM C97 - Standard Test Methods for Absorption and Bulk Specific Gravity of Dimension Stone, with the following deviations:

- · Several core samples received with 46 mm diameter, undersized for 2' (50.4 mm) minimum dimension for test,
- · Samples  heated  at  110°C  for  48  hours  (standard  designates  60°C  same  time period).

These deviations from the standards were not considered to impact the testwork results.

The current database holds a total of 7,311 historical dry density measurements that were  undertaken  by  Acme  on  10  cm  long  whole-core  samples  on  a  nominal  100  m downhole spacing.  Acme used the following equation to determine the bulk density:

- · Dry weight in air / (Wet weight in air - Wet weight in water).

Newcrest is currently undertaking validation measurements from an infill drilling program within the East zone using the Archimedes method on whole-core samples on a nominal 30 m downhole spacing.  Newcrest is also currently taking specific gravity measurements using  the  Archimedes  method  at  100  m  downhole  spacing  on  step-out  exploration drilling.

## 11.3 Analytical and Test Laboratories

A number of laboratories were used during the exploration and operational history:

- · Min-En Laboratories in Smithers, BC (Min-En), used as the primary laboratory in 1994-1995; independent.  Accreditations during the time used are not recorded in the Project database;
- · Chemex  Laboratories  Ltd.,  North  Vancouver,  BC  (Chemex);  used  as  check laboratory for Min-En work; independent; accreditations at the time not recorded in the Project database;
- · International Plasma Laboratory Ltd. in Vancouver BC (IPL), used as the primary laboratory in 2003-2004, independent, held ISO 9002 registration;
- · ALS Chemex, Vancouver, BC (successor to Chemex; ALS Vancouver); used as check laboratory for IPL work; independent; accreditations at the time not recorded in the Project database;
- · Acme, used as the primary laboratory in 2011-2012, independent.  From 2007 to 2010,  samples  were  prepared  at  Acme  Smithers,  BC  and  analysed  at  Acme Vancouver.    Acme  has  been  ISO  9001  certified  since  1996.    Acme  Vancouver obtained ISO 17025 accreditation for selected analytical techniques in 2011;
- · Bureau  Veritas  Commodities  Canada  Ltd.  in  Vancouver,  BC  (Bureau  Veritas; formerly Acme), used as the primary laboratory from 2019, independent.  Holds ISO 17025 accreditation for selected analytical techniques;
- · ALS Vancouver, used as check laboratory for Bureau Veritas work; independent. Holds ISO 17025 accreditation for selected analytical techniques;
- · Mt  Polley  mine  laboratory,  used  from  2011-2012;  not  independent  and  is  not accredited;
- · Red  Chris  mine  laboratory,  used  for  grade  control  drilling  in  the  open  pit;  not independent and is not accredited.

## 11.4 Sample Preparation

Sample preparation and analytical methods have some variations over time.  Typically, the following were used:

- · Min-En:    samples  were  dried,  crushed  to  minus  ¼  inch,  and  pulverized  to  95% passing 150 mesh;
- · IPL:  samples were dried, crushed to -10 mesh, and pulverized to 95% passing 150 mesh;
- · Acme:    samples  were  dried,  crushed  to  80%  passing  a  nominal  3-5  mm,  and pulverized to 85% passing 200 mesh;

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

- · Bureau Veritas:  samples were dried at 65ºC, crushed to 95% passing 4.75 mm, and pulverised to 95% passing 106 μ m.

## 11.5 Sample Analysis

Analytical methods varied with time (Table 11-1).

## 11.6 Quality Assurance and Quality Control

## 11.6.1 Legacy

The 1994-1995 program used a standard reference material (standard) and a blank as quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) measures.  Results from the standard were required to be within two standard deviations (SD) of its best value or the whole batch was reassayed.

Approximately  10%  of  the  submitted  samples  were  assayed  in  duplicate.    Selected samples were re-assayed by Chemex for copper and gold, using similar methods to those of Min-En.

The 2003 program used three in-house standards and blanks.  Approximately one in every 20 samples from IPL were re-assayed at Chemex.  At Chemex these pulps were then renumbered with a random number sequence to produce a set of 'blind' samples that were then sent back to IPL for re-analysis.  A selected set of higher-grade samples from the first hole drilled in 2003 (03-248) were sent to Acme for re-analysis.  A second sampling  of  half-cores  for  analysis  at  IPL  was  completed  to  provide  an  indication  of inherent geological (short range sampling) variability.

## 11.6.2 Imperial

During  2007-2012,  standards,  duplicates,  and  blanks  were  randomly  inserted  within every 17 consecutive core samples.  Three custom standards were used, prepared from material at Imperial's Mt Polley deposit.  The duplicates were prepared from quartering the half-core sample at the time of cutting or splitting.  Blanks consisted of crushed rock from a highway gravel pit located along the Likely highway in the central interior of British Columbia.

If a blank sample returned copper and gold assay values over a pre-determined threshold (0.05% Cu and 0.05g/t Au), the blank reject along with at least 10 sequential core rejects (above and below the blank) would be re-processed and re-assayed.  If the re-processed reject  failed  to  meet  the  QA/QC  requirements,  the  half-core  was  quartered  and  new samples in the affected range were re-submitted to the laboratory for processing and assaying.  The majority of the blank samples assayed at or below the detection limit.

## 11.6.3 Newcrest

The  Newcrest  QA/QC  program  consisted  of  the  insertion  of  standards,  blanks,  and duplicates into the sample stream.  Sieve checks were also conducted.

Newcrest conducted a detailed QA/QC review of the data in the database as at endFebruary  2021.    Drilling  reviewed  were  primarily  from  the  Imperial  (2007-2018)  and Newcrest (2019-2021) campaigns.

The frequency of QA/QC assaying (19.1% of primary assays) exceeded the planned compliance of 17.5% of the primary assays.

Particle sizing was undertaken after the two stages of comminution at the laboratory.  For both  crushing  and  pulverising  this  was  undertaken  at  roughly  twice  the  frequency specified.  For the combined 8,703 tests only seven crush sizing failures were recorded

<!-- image -->

from the early batches.  The compliance for achieving crush and pulverising sizing is very good.

Blanks were inserted at a nominal 1:40 rate to check for contamination and smearing.  A total of 41 failures for gold out of 1,356 blank assays were noted with a maximum of 117 ppb Au.  Investigations found that there were no adjacent high-grade samples that suggest smearing or contamination.  Given the relatively low level of the gold grades the batches were accepted.  Copper blanks showed some smearing in December 2019 in the first batches submitted and minor issues have been investigated.

Crush and pulp duplicates were collected by the laboratory at a higher frequency than the 1:20 required.  In addition, the Bureau Veritas laboratory reported pulp replicates (same packet, same batch) as well as the pulp duplicates (different packet, same batch). All  crush,  pulp  and  replicate  duplicates  performed  better  than  the  target  Newcrest Corporate Guidelines for precision.

Commercially available standards were sourced to cover the gold and copper ranges expected.    Geologists  selected  the  standards  appropriate  for  the  grade  interval  at  a frequency of 1:20 from a library of four standards.  Assay batch review was undertaken by site geologists before loading the results into the Acquire database.  Any issues or concerns were noted in the Sharepoint-hosted 'Issues Register', including two cases where batch re-assays were requested. In both cases the primary assays were accepted as  the  re-assays  were  similar.    Z-score  charts  were  used  to  monitor  standards performance on a weekly and monthly basis

Gold standards demonstrate a 1.49% positive bias and individual standard plots show one (of the four) standards has been the main cause of the long-term bias.  This is the lowest-grade material, just above the 20 times detection limit.  The other three standards performed well with a local exception in late October 2020 when another standard also began showing a positive bias.  Trend analysis of this bias lead to a written response from the laboratory and extensive discussion during a laboratory inspection in November 2020.

Copper standard Z-scores were plotted for the two ICP methods.  This shows that the three lower-grade standards are assayed by MA250 and all show the negative bias.  The MA370 CRM performance is informed by one standard that shows no bias.  In a similar way to the gold bias,  the  laboratory  has  undertaken  an  investigation  report  and  had discussions with Newcrest during the November 2020 laboratory inspection.  This work will  continue  and  will  benefit  from  the  use  of  matrix-matched  CRMs  rather  than  the current supply of commercially-available standards.

The sulphur standard charting for the ICP method shows a strong negative bias.  The data used in Mineral Resource estimation is collected by infra-red combustion and the standards are not certified for this method.  The non-matrix matched standards have presented some problems during QA/QC monitoring.

The  sulphur  and  associated  carbon  assays  are  expected  to  be  better  supported  by matrix-matched standards.  In lieu of this, the second laboratory assays will give some measure of the sulphur and carbon assay accuracy.

Assayed pulps from the primary laboratory, Bureau Veritas, were auto-selected by an acQuire database algorithm to provide a grade coverage &gt;100 ppb Au and &gt;40 ppm Cu. Two anonymous batches were prepared, one returned to the primary laboratory and one sent  to  ALS  Vancouver,  an  independent  laboratory.    The  primary  laboratory  checks performed well against target precision of CV%AVR &lt;15 for gold and &lt;12 for copper, with calculated values of 7.7% and 3.2% respectively.  Sulphur by ICP also performed well with a CV%AVR of 6.4% that improved to 4.1% when sulphur was analysed by infrared combustion.  Second laboratory checks also performed well with target precision of CV%AVR &lt;18 for gold and &lt;14.5 for copper, with calculated values of 7.7% and 3.6% respectively.  Sulphur by ICP also performed well between laboratories with a CV%AVR of  4.5%.  The  second  laboratory  gold  precision  of  7.7%  is  the  same  as  the  precision reported for primary laboratory resubmission.

Overall, the dataset is acceptable for use in preparing a Mineral Resource estimate for gold and copper.

## 11.7 Databases

Assay and geological data are electronically loaded into acQuire and the database is replicated  to  Newcrest's  centralised  database  server.    The  geological  team  on-site currently manages all data.  Data are collected from geotechnical logging, geological logging and drilling data (collar, survey) and imported/logged directly into the acQuire database.

Exclusive control over the checking and entry of analyses from the laboratory is restricted to database administrator(s) and designated geologists at Red Chris.  Log-in and access permissions are limited to control access to the database and to maintain the integrity of the  resource  data.    Data  access  is  generally  limited  to  project  geologists  and  the database administrators.

Additional information on data verification is included in Section 12.

The  database  is  regularly  backed  up,  and  copies  are  stored  in  both  offsite  and  in Newcrest facilities.

## 11.8 Sample Security

Sample  security  at  the  Red  Chris  Operations  has  not  historically  been  monitored. Sample collection from drill point to laboratory relies upon the fact that samples are either always attended to, or stored in the locked on-site preparation facility, or stored in a secure area prior to laboratory shipment.

Chain-of-custody  procedures  consist  of  sample  submittal  forms  to  be  sent  to  the laboratory  with  sample  shipments  to  ensure  that  all  samples  are  received  by  the laboratory.

Chain-of-custody  management  was  achieved  through  solid  boxing  of  samples  with tamper proof tags.

## 11.9 Sample Storage

Core samples drilled before 2019 are stored as half and full core within wooden trays at the Red Chris Exploration core yard.  Older core has degraded due to weather conditions and many drill holes are no longer available.  Newcrest core drilled from 2019 onwards is stored at the same facility and top trays are covered with wooden lids to provide some weather protection.

No  laboratory  crush  reject  samples  are  retained  from  the  pre  2019  drill  programs. Newcrest core assayed at Bureau Veritas Vancouver from 2019 has the crush reject material retained at Bureau Veritas Vancouver.

Pulp (nominal 300g packets) retained for some programs before 2019 are stored at the Red Chris core yard. Bureau Veritas Vancouver store all of the Newcrest pulp retained packets after 2019.

No RC samples are retained at the core yard.

## 11.10 QP Comments on 'Item 11:  Sample Preparation, Analyses, and Security'

In the opinion of the QP, the sample preparation, analysis, and security are acceptable, meet industry-standard practice, and are adequate to support Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve estimation and mine planning purposes, based on the following:

- · Drill  sampling  was  adequately  spaced  to  first  define,  then  infill,  copper  and  gold anomalies to produce prospect-scale and deposit-scale drill data;
- · Sample preparation for core samples has followed a similar procedure since 2007. The preparation procedure is in line with industry-standard methods;
- · Analytical  methods for core samples used similar procedures for the 2007-2021 core  drill  programs.    The  analytical  procedure  is  in  line  with  industry-standard methods;
- · QA/QC submission rates are typical for the time of collection, and do not indicate any problems with the analytical programs, therefore the copper and gold analyses from the core drilling are suitable for inclusion in Mineral Resource estimation;
- · Imperial  and  Newcrest  used  a  QA/QC  program  comprising  blank,  CRM  and duplicate samples.  The QA/QC submission rate meets current industry-accepted standards of insertion rates;
- · Data  collected  were  subject  to  validation,  using  inbuilt  program  triggers  that automatically checked data on upload to the database;
- · Verification  is  performed  on  all  digitally-collected  data  on  upload  to  the  main database, and includes checks on surveys, collar co-ordinates, lithology, and assay data.  The checks are appropriate, and consistent with industry standards;
- · Sample security has relied upon the fact that the samples were always attended or locked  in  the  on-site  sample  preparation  facility.    Chain-of-custody  procedures

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

consist  of  filling  out  sample  submittal  forms  that  are  sent  to  the  laboratory  with sample shipments to make certain that all samples are received by the laboratory;

- · Current sample storage procedures and storage areas are consistent with industry standards.

## 12 DATA VERIFICATION

## 12.1 Internal Data Verification

## 12.1.1 Data Verification at Newcrest 2019 Acquisition

Over 90% of Imperial assay data were electronically loaded into acQuire from the original laboratory  assay  files.  Historical  assay  data  prior  to  Imperial's  Project  interest  were imported and validated as part of verification in support of technical reports prepared under NI 43-101.

## 12.1.2 Database

Data were manually checked for errors and gaps prior to database upload, and where issues arose, these were corrected.  If the data related to laboratory analysis, any issues were  recorded  in  an  Issues  Register  and  actioned  according  to  internal  Newcrest Corporate  Standards.    After  the  data  were  checked,  they  were  imported  into  the Newcrest acQuire database and internal validation reports were used to ensure there were no conflicting (e.g., overlapping intervals or assays recorded beyond the end of hole) entries.  Data validation was undertaken by the Red Chris site team under the supervision of the Regional Exploration Manager.

Regular  reviews  of  data  quality  are  conducted  by  site  and  corporate  teams  prior  to resource estimation, in addition to external reviews.

## 12.1.3 QA/QC

Data verification of the QA/QC data is discussed in Section 11.6.

Newcrest  personnel  conduct  regular  laboratory  audits.    Physical  inspections  were conducted of the Bureau Veritas Vancouver laboratory in 2017, 2018 and 2019.  Due to restrictions relating to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 audit was a virtual laboratory audit.

## 12.2 Data Verification by Qualified Person

The QP visited the site most recently in April 2019 (refer to Section 2.4).  Observations made during the visit, in conjunction with discussions with site-based technical staff also support the geological interpretations, and analytical and database quality.

The  QP's  role  as  the  Group  Manager  Resources  includes  review  of  the  estimation processes in place for Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve estimation, mine planning, and the control procedures in place to ensure the process is being executed as intended.

## 12.3 Resources and Reserves Steering Committee

Newcrest has implemented a steering committee, termed the Resources &amp; Reserves Steering Committee, to ensure appropriate governance of development and

<!-- image -->

management  of  resource  and  reserve  estimates,  and  the  public  release  of  those estimates.    This  is  achieved  by  ensuring  regular  Resources  &amp;  Reserves  Steering Committee  review  meetings,  internal  competent  reviews,  and  independent  external competent reviews.

In particular, the  Resources  &amp;  Reserves  Steering  Committee  is  responsible  for monitoring  performance  of  Mineral  Resource  and  Mineral  Reserve  models,  ensuring governance  over  changes  to  estimation,  and  reporting  of  resources  and  reserves including  critical  input  parameters  of  cost  base  assumptions,  metallurgical  recovery algorithms and mining dilution.  The Resources &amp; Reserves Steering Committee also monitors reconciliation of extracted metal to the resources and reserves and provides governance to resolving reconciliation variance. The committee ensures that independent external reviews of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserve estimates for each deposit are conducted at a minimum of every three years or more frequently when a material change has occurred.

The Resources &amp; Reserves Steering Committee has permanent committee members that  represent  the  following  areas:    operations,  resource  management,  commercial, mining, and metallurgy.

## 12.4 External Data Verification

A number of data verification programs were conducted in support of technical reports on  the  Project,  from  2004-2021.    These  indicated,  that  at  the  time  each  database iteration  was  reviewed,  there  were  no  significant  issues  that  would  have  precluded Mineral Resource estimation or imposed confidence classification limits on certain data support.

## 12.5 QP Comments on 'Item 12:  Data Verification'

The process of data verification for the Red Chris Operations was performed by Newcrest personnel and external consultancies contracted by Newcrest.

The QP reviewed the reports and is of the opinion that the data verification programs indicate that the data stored in the project database accurately reflect original sources and are adequate to support geological interpretations and Mineral Resource estimation. The  data  support  Mineral  Reserve  estimation  and  mine  planning  for  the  Red  Chris deposit.

The QP visited the site most recently in April 2019 (refer to Section 2.4).  Observations made during the visit, in conjunction with discussions with site-based technical staff also support the geological interpretations, and analytical and database quality.

The  QP's  role  as  the  Group  Manager  Resources  includes  review  of  the  estimation processes in place for Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve estimation, mine planning, and the control procedures in place to ensure the process is being executed as intended.

## 13 MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING

## 13.1 Introduction

The Red Chris process plant was commissioned on open pit ore in 2015.  Testwork on the open pit ores was primarily completed at G&amp;T Metallurgical Services in Kamloops, BC during 2004.

Testwork since 2019 was completed by Base Met Laboratories in Kamloops, BC, ALS Laboratories in Burnaby, BC, and Amtel in London, ON.

## 13.2 Testwork Programs

Table 13-1 summarizes the various testwork programs that are pertinent to the open pit and underground block cave and their respective life-of-mine (LOM) plans.

## 13.3 Open Pit Testwork

The results  of  the  G&amp;T  2004  metallurgical  programs  were  used  as  the  basis  for  the design and consumption parameters for the Red Chris concentrator.  The G&amp;T 2004 programs  confirmed  that  the  mill  flowsheet  for  Red  Chris  would  use  conventional processing techniques for a porphyry copper-gold flotation plant.

Metallurgical testwork was performed in support of the original plant design.  Subsequent testwork focused on the material planned to be mined as part of block cave operations.

The  metallurgical  testwork  supporting  the  current  process  plant  design  included mineralogy, grind size tests, bench tests, locked cycle flotation tests (pulp density, pH, reagent  dosage,  flotation  residence  time  and  grind  size  effect),  gravity  concentration testwork,  ball  mill  and  rod  mill  grinding  work  index  tests,  evaluation  of  metallurgical variation between the Main and East zones, and a pilot plant program.  The testwork indicated that a conventional process plant design could be used.

A primary grind of 150 µm K80 was determined as optimum for the Red Chris ore.  At this feed sizing, 50% of the chalcopyrite and bornite particles were liberated, together with 90% pyrite liberation and 95% non-sulphide gangue minerals.

Red Chris ore required an approximate 15% mass pull resulting in a rougher concentrate grade of 3% Cu.  The regrind circuit power was specified based on a design weight recovery of 15%.

Gravity concentration testwork resulted in minimal gold recovery, no additional work was performed, and the inclusion of a gravity stage was not recommended in the flowsheet.

An average 16.1 kW-hrs/t ball mill work index was used to calculate power requirements for mill sizing at 30,000 t/d.

The copper recovery to concentrate forecast ranged from 85-90% while gold recoveries varied  between  45-65%.    Gold  recovery  in  both  zones  was  dependent  on  the  head grades and pyrite content, and was higher in East zone.

Recovery predictions made prior to Newcrest's Project interest were significantly higher than seen in actuality from the plant.  This has primarily been attributed to the following causes:

- · The grind size has been somewhat coarser than the original design target of 80% passing 150 um;
- · The original design rougher flotation residence time was not sufficient to support high rougher stage recoveries;
- · There were process constraints in the cleaning circuit that have been subsequently addressed by Newcrest through the installation of an additional flotation column;
- · Faulted open pit ore has caused periodic metallurgical issues in the plant.

Newcrest performed two orebody knowledge programs (BL0511 and BL0662) to more reliably predict the performance of the remaining ore in the open pit.  These were based on  66  samples  from  the  mineralization  captured  within  the  open  pit  resource  shell. Thirteen samples were identified as potentially fault-impacted.

Samples identified as fault impacted were assessed for metallurgical performance.  A copper recovery loss of  up  to  25-30%  copper  was  indicated  for  the  extremely  faultimpacted samples.  Fault material was seen to have a large impact on copper recovery in  the  orebody  knowledge  testwork  programs.    In  practice,  the  process  of  mining significantly dilutes the fault material and recovery decreases in the process plant in the order of 2-4% recovery were observed when processing open pit ores.

## 13.4 Underground Block Cave Testwork

This subsection summarizes the testwork completed in support of the 2021 PFS.

## 13.4.1 Sample Selection

A total of 34 samples from the mineralization captured within the underground resource shell were used in the underground metallurgical testwork.  One of these samples was later determined to be waste material and was excluded from further evaluation.  Five samples were found to later be outside the confines of the underground model (Figure 13-1).  Two samples were identified as potentially fault-impacted.

The initial samples had a minimum copper grade requirement of 0.25%.  The samples selected were representative of the material expected to be mined using underground mining methods, both spatially and with respect to the mineralization grade.

Additional composites representing underground material were collected from 40 m long core samples, composited into five composites (the 'Horizon' composites) was centred at key spatial levels (RL) as shown in Figure 13-2.

Each RL slice (or horizon) was representative of a time period in the early mine life, with Composite 1 representing the first two years of production.

## 13.4.2 Testwork Conducted

The testwork programs informing the 2021 PFS process design included:

- · Mineralogy:  gold diagnostic analysis;
- · Gold diagnostic leach tests:  help infer gold deportment;
- · Comminution  tests: hardness  (hardness  index  testing (HIT); JK  breakage parameters (Axb); semi-autogenous grind (SAG) mill comminution (SMC)), SAG mill specific energy, Bond indices (drop weight index (DWi), Bond ball mill work index (BWi)), abrasion index (Ai), specific gravity;
- · Gravity recovery:  gravity recoverable gold;
- · Flotation optimization tests:  two-stage flotation;
- · Open circuit cleaner at standard and optimized conditions;

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

- · Rougher flotation:  grind recovery series, size by size recovery, kinetics, reagent optimization;
- · Regrind:  Levin tests, Bond indices;
- · Cleaner flotation  :  batch cleaner tests, cleaner dilution tests;
- · Locked cycle tests;
- · Concentrate dewatering:  concentrate settling, concentrate filtration;
- · HydroFloat tests;
- · Material classification for environmental purposes.

## 13.4.3 Mineralogy

Mineralogical data were collected for underground samples using the internal Newcrest mineral liberation analyzer (MLA) to provide scanning electron microscopy information, and quantitative X-ray diffraction (XRD) and optical microscopy performed by the Amtel laboratory, located in Ontario, Canada, to provide information on gold deportment.

Samples from the area to be mined by underground methods were found through MLA analysis  to  have  significantly  lower  quartz  and  pyrite  contents  (0.5%  average  pyrite content) versus samples from the open pit area (5.6% pyrite on average).  There was a subtle  shift  in  mineralogy  from  predominantly  intermediate  argillic  and  phyllic  altered material  higher  in  the  system  (higher  kaolinite,  quartz,  and  pyrite)  to  predominantly potassic  alteration  at  depth.    Copper  distribution  was  almost  solely  contained  within chalcopyrite in the open pit environment (average 92.7% of the copper distribution), and the average bornite content was 6%.  In the proposed underground area, the bornite content averaged 21.4%, and the chalcopyrite content was about 77.3%.  The S:Cu ratio was,  on  average,  significantly  higher  and  more  variable  for  open  pit  ores  than  for underground ores.

Copper sulphide grain size varied for the underground mineralization from a P80 between 45-150 µm.  The open pit samples had a similar grain size, with the P80 range between 50-120 µm.  Pyrite was coarser-grained than the copper sulphides, but still exhibited similar grain size ranges in the open pit (P80 of 100-300 µm) and underground (P80 of 90-400 µm) areas.

The Amtel work indicated that the gold was primarily in the form of gold-silver-mercury alloys.  At a grind size of approximately 150 µm, free gold grains contributed 30-58% of the gold balance, and typically contributed about a third of the grade.  Most of this free gold reported to the &lt;7 µm size fraction.

Gold carried  by  free  sulphides  accounted  for  16-26%  of  the  gold  balance,  and  gold carried by sulphide rock binaries accounted for 13-49% of the grade.  The proportion of gold carried by gangue ranged from 4-14%, equating to between 0.048-0.096 g/t Au. Gold  mineralization was  always  predominantly  associated  with  copper  sulphide mineralization  rather  than  pyrite.    All  samples  contained  some  gold  mineralization associated  with  gangue  particles.    The  size  distribution  of  gold  inclusions  and

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

attachments was similar in all samples; with attached gold particles approximately 8 µm (range from 6-12 μ m) in size and inclusions averaging 3 µm.

Samples  sourced  from  a  plant  survey  in  August  2019  were  sent  to  Amtel  for  gold deportment analysis and to determine the mineralogy and potential cause of penalty elements (antimony and mercury) reporting to the concentrate.

The concentrate contained:

- · 63.3 wt% copper minerals:  63% of which was chalcopyrite, the other 0.3% was tetrahedrite;
- · 21.8 wt% pyrite:  75% of the pyrite reporting to the concentrate was liberated, the rest was in binaries with chalcopyrite;
- · 14.7 wt% gangue particles:  primarily micas and clay with lesser carbonates or nonlayered silicates (quartz, feldspar).

The combined pyrite and gangue particles carried 6% of the gold grade and 4% of the copper, with gold mainly associated with pyrite.

Antimony in the concentrate was dominantly (98%) in the form of tetrahedrite, which was primarily liberated or associated with chalcopyrite).  Antimony in solid solution was a minor component that was nearly equally carried by pyrite and chalcopyrite.

Mercury in the concentrate was dominantly (93%) in the form of coloradoite (HgTe) and cinnabar.  The final 7% of the mercury in concentrate was as solid solution in pyrite.

The nature of these penalty elements indicates that unless the deportment of antimony and  mercury  changes  significantly  in  the  underground  environment,  these  elements could be potentially problematic in future concentrates.

## 13.4.4 Comminution

A total of 32 samples were selected for SMC, HIT, and Bond index testing.

Comminution results are summarized in Table 13-2 for the 2021 PFS design, with the original design parameters for open pit ores used to size the existing mill provided for comparison.

Among the 32 samples, some samples had both SMC and HIT test results, others only had HIT test results.  For those samples that did not have the SMC test results, the HIT test results were used to give approximations of the ore competence.  The SMC test Axb parameter  and  HIT  Axb  parameter  (or  converted  DWi  parameter)  were  found  to  be reasonably correlated, particularly for Axb range of 30 to 50 (medium to hard in terms of resistance to impact breakage).

The data set showed a moderate variability for the DWi parameter as measured by the coefficient of variation (20%), suggesting that the variability in the dataset was less than optimum for good characterization of the deposit.  For the Bond ball mill tests, the data set showed a low coefficient of variation (8.4%), suggesting acceptable variability in the dataset to be treated as a single ore type.

The underground ores are substantially harder (about 30%) than the open pit ores.  The 75 th percentile database values in terms of ore hardness were selected for comminution circuit design.

## 13.4.5 Recovery Circuit

The recovery circuit at the Red Chris process plant currently consists of a sequential flotation circuit to produce a saleable gold-bearing copper concentrate.

A two-stage cleaner flotation flowsheet that replicated the current Red Chris Operations flowsheet was used to test the underground mineralization with the intent of optimizing the  flotation  operating  conditions  (Figure  13-3).    Test  results  showed  similar  copper recoveries and deportment between open pit and underground samples, with a slight improvement for the underground ores due to higher grades, which will result in higher copper grades in the concentrate.

This contrasted with gold where the recoveries were higher for underground versus open pit with underground showing different deportment characteristics in the different flotation streams.

## 13.4.5.1 Rougher Flotation

The rougher flotation circuit design investigated residence time/chemistry, mass pull, and primary grind size.  From these data, linear predictions of grind dependence on recovery were estimated for use in options analyses.

The recovery benefit of increasing the retention from 8-12 mins (laboratory) averaged 2.3% for copper and 3.3% for gold at 150 μ m with a similar recovery benefit at 200 μ m.

The 2021 PFS design assumed a 12 minute target laboratory retention time.  A scale-up factor of 2.5 was used when scaling up laboratory retention times to conventional tank cells,  which  is  consistent  with  industry  standards  for  copper  rougher  flotation.    This equated to a 30 minute retention time for rougher flotation capacity using conventional tank cells.  The 2021 PFS used a target installed retention time of 30 minutes when using conventional tank cells.

Note:  Figure prepared by Base Met, 2021.

StackCells were selected as the preferred flotation technology for incremental rougher capacity because pilot plant testwork indicated that the flotation kinetics of the StackCell was four times quicker than a conventional tank cell (see additional discussion on the StackCells in Section 17).

Primary grind size versus rougher recovery was investigated for copper and gold; using:

- · Grind series of primary grind versus rougher flotation recovery:  100 μ m, 125 μ m, 150 μ m, 175 μ m, and 200 μ m.  Direct test results at the varying primary grind sizes;
- · Size-by-size recovery and rougher Bazin analysis.  An indirect interpretation of the metal deportment in the various size fractions and resulting recovery in that specific size fraction.

The optimized testwork dataset showed that mass pull would not exceed the 2021 PFS design target, and that copper and rougher recoveries would not be limited by mass pull. Considering the testwork results and examining the variability, a design value of a 15% mass pull was supported for the 2021 PFS.

## 13.4.5.2 Regrind

The  uncorrected  specific  energy  requirement  using  ball  mills  for  each  underground composite was interpolated to achieve a product P80 of 30 μ m from a feed F80 of 120 μ m. The mean value was 26.3 kWh/t and the 70 th  percentile value was 27.7 kWh/t.

Levin standard tests were performed on the rougher concentrates from the plant regrind survey  and  laboratory  flotation  testing;  the  plant  samples  showed  a  higher  specific energy requirement than all five underground composites.  The Levin test results were corrected  by  applying  the  standard  Bond  correction  factors  together  with  operational efficiency factors.

Plant operating data from the existing regrind circuit were analyzed by comparing total specific energy (sum of regrind ball mill and Vertimills) to the achieved grind size.  The unmeasured recirculating load of the cleaner scavenger concentrate was estimated from survey data at 5% of the fresh cleaner feed flowrate.

From historical data, approximately 14 kWh/t of energy will be required to achieve the target grind size of 30 μ m.

## 13.4.5.3 Cleaner Flotation

The cleaner flotation circuit testwork investigated the effects of pH and regrind size using the flowsheet in Figure 13-4.

With regrinding it was possible to achieve the 2021 PFS design target for all composites except one, where it is interpreted that the composite had increased levels of pyrite in comparison to the other composites tested.

The current design philosophy with a Jameson Cell in cleaner scalper duty was used for the 2021 PFS.  The flowsheet will operate the 1 st  cleaner column and 3 rd  cleaner column in series.  The 2 nd cleaner column will be retained for standby duty.

## 13.4.6 Dewatering

A number of static settling tests were carried out on open pit final concentrates from the plant, and the underground final concentrates from the locked cycle tests.  This testwork showed that the underground composites exhibited similar settling characteristics as the plant concentrate.

Additional settling tests were performed including: repeat tests to understand the testing reproducibility,  and 1 L cylinder tests at varying feed solid content to understand the impact of the feed solid content on settling rate and final underflow density.

A number of filtration tests were carried out on the open pit final concentrates from the plant, and the underground final concentrates from the locked cycle tests.  Additional comparative filtration tests were performed on laboratory-produced open pit concentrate to develop an understanding of the variability.

The concentrate filtration testwork was completed with feed solids density of 50 w/w%. A unit area of 200 kg/hr/m 2  was used.  The cycle time and t/cycle for the horizontal press filters will be 15 to 20 minutes per cycle and 11.5 to12.0 dry t/cycle.

## 13.4.7 Environmental Considerations Regarding Tailings from Process Plant

Tailings from the process plant are segregated to meet environmental criteria for metal leaching-acid  rock  drainage  (ML/ARD).    The  main  goal  is  to  produce  a  non-acid generating (NAG) tailings stream from copper rougher tailings.  When pyrite in ore is elevated,  an  additional  pyrite  scavenging  step  is  required  to  achieve  designed  NAG tailings  characteristics.    Cleaner-scavenger  tailings,  combined  with  pyrite  scavenger concentrate  when  this  circuit  is  operated,  form  the  potentially  acid-generating  (PAG) tailings stream.

Neutralizing potential ratio (NPR) is determined for tailings streams, defined as:

- · The ratio of the acid potential (AP), determined by the sulphur content of the material to the neutralizing potential (NP), based on the amount of carbonates present.

Tailings  are  considered  to  be  NAG  when  NPR &gt;2.  The anticipated NPR for tailings generated from underground mineralization and open pit mineralization were compared.

In-situ neutralizing potential of material within the long-term planning model was based on  the  calcium  and  magnesium  grades  of  the  samples  (carbon  was  not  routinely measured during Imperial's drilling programs), with the AP determined from the sulphur grade.

The  mean  NPR  for  the  underground  samples  was  4.87  (median  3.97),  which  is significantly  higher  than  the  results  seen  in  the  open  pit  environment  (average  2.07; median 1.27).  Only 12% of the underground samples were classified as PAG, whereas 65% of the open pit samples were classified as PAG.  This variation was driven by the reduced  amount  of  pyrite  present  in  the  underground  environment.    The  carbonate contents were similar between the open pit and underground.

<!-- image -->

The  final  storage  location  tailings  was  determined  by  NPR,  following  conservative verification sampling.  The TIA provides a sub-aqueous environment for the storage of PAG material, which is managed by centralized subaqueous deposition in the Tailings Impoundment, impounded at the centre of the valley by NAG sand beaches where NAG tailings are exposed to the atmosphere and serve as the primary material for construction of the TIA dams and beaches.  Data analysis of the open pit and underground sulphur to carbon ratio data using histograms indicated that sufficient NAG sand can be produced for LOM purposes.

## 13.5 Recovery Forecasts

## 13.5.1 Open Pit

Recovery for copper and gold are defined by four metallurgical domains with recovery formulas  being  a  function  of  the  gold  and  copper  grade  in  combination  with  the  mill production rate.  The LOM copper recovery was estimated to be 79% and gold recovery was estimated to be 51% within the Mineral Reserves amenable to open pit mining.

The equation used to forecast the copper recovery is:

- · Cu recovery = (9.7 * Cu Head Grade * 100 + 80.224) / 100 * 0.945 - 0.39 / 100

Where the copper head grade format is percent, for example, 0.40%.

The equation used to forecast the gold recovery is:

- · (1.859 + 0.124 * LN (Au head grade) - 0.169*LN (1403)) * 0.95

Where the gold head grade is in g/t.  LN = natural log.

These regression equations are informed by plant recovery performance data.

## 13.5.2 Underground

Recoveries for copper are a function of the copper grades in combination with the mill production rate.  In the case of gold recoveries, the gold to sulphur ratio is the primary factor impacting plant recoveries.

## 13.5.2.1 Copper

A linear model with head grade was fitted to the copper recovery data at a grind size P80 of 150 µm; a maximum of 92% copper recovery was applied to the equation as a logical constraint:

- · Copper recovery (%) ~= 76.5 + 11.9*Cu (maximum copper recovery of 92%)

Where: Cu = copper head grade in percent.

This recovery equation gives a LOM average recovery range of 81-86%.

## 13.5.2.2 Gold

The block cave samples show significantly higher gold recovery than open pit material at equivalent head grades as well as greater variance.  A lower pyrite content in the ore can

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

reduce the quantity of refractory gold and, therefore, an improvement in flotation recovery of gold.  This was confirmed in the diagnostic leach results, which showed significantly higher gravity and cyanide soluble gold deportment for the samples from the block cave. The diagnostic leach results (gravity plus cyanide soluble components) show a general trend directly proportional to the overall gold recovery, and the same diagnostic leach categories are strongly related to the ratio of gold to sulphur in the sample head grades

The predictive equation for gold recovery of the block cave ore at a grind size P80 of 150 µm is:

- · Gold recovery (%) ~= 72.5 + 9.3* LN (Au/S)

Where: Au = head grade in g/t, and S = sulphur head grade in percent.  LN = natural log.

This recovery equation gives a LOM average recovery range of 60-75%.

## 13.5.2.3 Silver

The  silver  value  contribution  is  low;  however,  it  is  still  a  significant  payable  value  if present in concentrate at over 30 g/t.  Silver recovery in the underground samples was found to be significantly greater than in open pit samples tested to date.

The average silver recovery in the testwork was 63% with P25 and P75 values of 57% and 71%, respectively.

## 13.6 Metallurgical Variability

Samples selected for metallurgical testing were representative of the various styles of mineralization within the different deposit areas.  Samples were selected from a range of  locations  within  the  deposit  zones.    Sufficient  samples  were  taken  and  tests  were performed using sufficient sample mass for the respective tests undertaken.

Additional samples have been collected for confirmatory testwork to support future more detailed studies.

## 13.7 Concentrate Quality

The  underground  variability  program  results  indicated  that,  on  average,  concentrate grades  in  second  cleaner  concentrate  in  laboratory  tests  exceeded  the  current operational  target  of  23%  Cu.    This  is  mainly  attributed  to  two  characteristics  of  the underground test samples:

- · The presence of bornite (an enriched copper mineral) in addition to chalcopyrite (copper deportment in the open pit ore is dominantly in chalcopyrite);
- · Lower  pyrite  content  in  underground  ores  tested  compared  with  open  pit  ores, leading to easier separation of copper sulphides from pyrite.

A  minimum  and  maximum  concentrate  grade  of  23%  and  28%,  respectively,  were applied to any forecast concentrate grades.  There was sufficient evidence that the plant can achieve a minimum of 23% Cu concentrate grade on much lower Cu:S ratios from open pit material by manipulating the pH in the cleaners and adjusting collector additions.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

The maximum of 28% Cu is considered to be a conservative view on the upper end of the scale.  It is possible that the favourable mineralogy of underground ores could result in still higher concentrate grades from time to time.

## The equation is:

- · Copper grade in concentrate (% Cu) ~= 13.2+21.8 * Cu:S in feed (minimum 23%, maximum, 28%)

Where: Cu = copper head grade in percent, and S = sulphur head grade in percent.

## 13.8 Deleterious Elements

Deleterious elements potentially include mercury and antimony.

The current limit for mercury penalty payment is 40 ppm in concentrate.  Approximately one-third of the mercury in the plant feed is highly floatable and will be recovered to the copper concentrate.  A predictive formula for the mercury in copper concentrate was developed:

- · Hg  in  final  concentrate  (ppm  Hg)  ~=  0.332  *  Hg  in  feed  *  copper  concentrate grade/copper feed grade

Indications are that most underground ores are not expected to produce concentrates that trigger penalty mercury levels.  These observations are based on a combination of laboratory testwork results as well as predictions from underground mine plan mercury head grades.

Antimony has generally been observed in open pit and underground concentrates at levels below those that would trigger a penalty (0.01%).

## 13.9 QP Comments on 'Item 13:  Mineral Processing and Metallurgical Testwork'

The QP notes:

- · The  testwork  completed  is  adequate  to  ensure  an  appropriate  representation  of metallurgical  characterisation  and  the  derivation  of  corresponding  metallurgical recovery factors for the open pit mineralization;
- · The 2021  PFS  metallurgical testwork program confirmed that a flowsheet incorporating crushing, grinding, flotation, and concentrate dewatering was suitable for the planned block cave;
- · Additional  characterization  of  the  mineralization  at  depth  is  planned  to  provide greater spatial coverage of the proposed block cave;
- · Underground  ore  was  determined  to  be  significantly  harder  than  open  pit  ore, therefore, requiring increased power input per tonne of ore treated for a given grind size.  There is a general increase in hardness with depth, implying that throughput rates  and  grind  size  will  be  impacted  positively  over  the  progression  of  each macroblock  within  the  block  cave  design  (see  section  15.3.1  for  definition  of macroblocks);

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

- · Copper and gold head grades were confirmed to be significantly higher than open pit material, especially for macroblock 1.  Underground ore was also shown to have significantly lower pyrite content than open pit ore, which may help moderate water quality risks associated with potential acid generation in the TIA;
- · The  flowsheet  development  testwork  confirmed  that  grinding  and  flotation  are suitable unit operations for Red Chris block cave ore and can allow recoveries of approximately 81-86% for copper and 60-75% for gold;
- · Marketable concentrates can be produced from underground ore, with some ore zones enriched in secondary copper minerals such as bornite producing elevated concentrate grades;
- · Some samples showed elevated mercury levels in the concentrate, but these were not high enough to cause any significant marketing concerns;
- · Additional variability testwork was performed subsequent to the completion of the 2021 PFS.  Preliminary results have been received, and are in the process of being interpreted.  The provisional reviews suggest that there is no significant difference between these samples and the results of the testwork that the 2021 PFS was based upon.

## 14 MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATES

## 14.1 Introduction

The close-out date for the drill database supporting the estimate is 8 February, 2021.

## 14.2 Modelling Approach

Due to the mixed nature of the data from different companies over time, the lithology interpretation  of  the  historical  data  is  heavily  reliant  on  the  lithology  logging  and  the associated assay data.  The key lithologies are the porphyry units (P1, P2, P3), the Stuhini Group volcanic and sedimentary rocks, the Bowser Lake Group, and the mafic dykes.  The mafic dykes are not modelled separately at the block model scale, as they are narrow and discontinuous.  The other lithologies are modelled.

Five lithology domains were constructed and used in estimation:

- · Red Stock porphyry phases P1+P3;
- · Red Stock porphyry phase P2;
- · Bowser Lake Group;
- · Stuhini volcanic;
- · Stuhini sediment.

A  geologically-based  alteration  model  was  built  for  the  East  Zone  using  Leapfrog software, based on drill hole logging data, photo relogs, assays, and Corescan data.  The combined implicit and sectional model consists of six alteration domains:

- · Sodic;
- · Propylitic;
- · Phyllic;
- · Intermediate argillic;
- · Potassic;
- · Calc-potassic.

A geologically-based sulphide model was built using Leapfrog software based on drill hole data that was primarily collected by Newcrest.  Five domains were constructed:

- · Bornite-chalcopyrite domain;
- · Chalcopyrite-bornite domain;
- · Chalcopyrite-pyrite domain;
- · Pyrite-chalcopyrite domain;
- · Pyrite domain.

<!-- image -->

Due  to  the  diffusive  nature  of  the  porphyry,  the  copper  and  gold  mineralisation  are primarily  within  the  different  porphyry  phases,  rather  than  within  the  major  alteration zones; hence, the lithology domains were used in estimation.

## 14.3 Exploratory Data Analysis

Univariate statistics and scatter plots were run on the different lithology domains for the Main, East and Gully zones.  A moderate correlation was apparent between iron and sulphur, and between calcium and magnesium.

Contact plots were constructed to determine boundary constraints between domains.  A soft  boundary  was  used  between  the  P1+P3  and  P2  phases  within  the  Red  Stock intrusion.  Hard contacts were used between all other domains.

Histogram plots were constructed in support of grade capping evaluation.  Both copper and  gold  had  positively  skewed  distributions.    Density  data  approximated  a  normal distribution.

Diffusion  examinations  were  run  to  determine  whether  a  Gaussian-based  or  nonparametric  multiple-indicator  kriged  estimation  method  best  applied  to  Red  Chris. Checks  were  done  for  gold,  copper,  iron,  sulphur,  calcium  and  magnesium.    These indicated a Gaussian-based interpolation method was the preferred estimation method.

Gaussian  (normal  scores)  transformations  were  used  on  declustered  weights.    The transform and back-transform was accomplished using Hermite polynomials.

## 14.4 Density (Specific Gravity) Assignment

Available  bulk  density  data  consisted  of  6,404  determinations  in  the  Red  Stock, averaging 2.78, 742 in the volcanic domain, averaging 2.79, 37 in the sediment domain, averaging 2.80, and 16 in the Bowser domain, averaging 2.58.

The bulk density data were interpolated using an inverse distance weighting to the third power (ID3) interpolation.

## 14.5 Grade Capping/Outlier Restrictions

No grade caps were imposed on the gold or copper data.

However, to make sure that the potential smearing of outlier grades was reduced, a grade and distance restriction was applied to selected variables during the estimation process  (Table  14-1).    The  selected  restriction  was  an  iterative  process,  based  on inspection of histograms and log probability plots, to ensure a reasonable agreement between the value estimated, and the declustered composite value.

## 14.6 Composites

Sampling was typically on 2.5 m intervals, which were composited to 12 m lengths.  Any residual  interval  was  equally  distributed  into  the  composite  intervals.    The  12  m composite length was considered appropriate for the mineralization style and matches the vertical dimension (RL) of the selective mining unit.

## 14.7 Variography

Variograms for the Red Stock domains were run on copper, gold, silver, iron, sulphur, mercury, antimony and arsenic Gaussian transformed data using Isatis software.  The variogram  directions  were  consistent  with  the  broad  domain  geometry.    Crossvariograms  were  used  for  calcium  and  magnesium  as  the  two  elements  showed reasonable correlations.  All Gaussian variogram and cross-variograms were modelled with a nugget and two spherical structures, then back-transformed to the raw space and re-modelled.

The  experimental  variogram  for  the  Sediment,  Volcanic  and  Bowser  domains  for  all variables were generated using real data.  Due to the strong correlation between ironsulphur  and  calcium-magnesium,  experimental  direct  and  cross-variograms  were generated for those elements.

## 14.8 Quantitative Kriging Neighbourhood Analysis

Kriging neighbourhood analysis was carried out to determine the appropriate estimation neighbourhood parameters for use in the estimation of copper and gold, consisting of:

- · Establish the optimum panel size by maximising the kriging efficiency and slope of regression;
- · Select the minimum and maximum sample limits by maximising slope of regression while at the same time ensuring that the percentage of negative kriging weights is manageable;
- · Maximise  the  search  ellipse  ensuring  that  the  previously-established  slope  of regression and negative kriging weight thresholds are not violated.

## 14.9 Estimation/Interpolation Methods

Estimation used a panel block size of 80 mE x 80 mN x 12 mRL and a selective mining unit block size of 20 mE x 20 mN x 12 mRL.  Two block models were constructed, the first with the selective mining unit size and the second with the panel size.  The domains were initially flagged in MineSight software at the selective mining unit size, then the flagged block model was imported to Isatis.  All estimation was performed using Isatis software.

For the Red Stock domain, the block model used for interpolators was populated with local rotations based on the orientation of the main structures.  A series of trend surfaces were used.

In the Red Stock domain, the following steps were undertaken:

- · Estimate copper, gold, iron and sulphur using a three-dimensional ordinary krige (OK) and uniform conditioning method;
- · Estimate calcium and magnesium using a three-dimensional co-ordinary krige and multivariate uniform conditioning method;
- · Localize the uniform conditioning and multivariate uniform conditioning results to the selective mining unit;
- · Estimate silver, arsenic, antimony, mercury and carbon to the selective mining unit.

The remaining three domains, sediment, volcanic and Bowser, were estimated using the following:

- · Three-dimensional OK or co-ordinary kriging to estimate copper, gold, silver, iron, sulphur, arsenic, antimony and mercury grades;
- · Carbon was estimated using OK in the sediment and volcanic domains;
- · Carbon was estimated using a nearest-neighbour method in the Bowser domain.

## 14.10 Block Model Validation

Validation checks included examination of the block model and composites in plan and section views, domain level statistical checks, global statistical checks, comparison of the estimated value with a metal-at-risk analysis for copper and gold, comparison of the multivariate  correlation  of  the  input  value  and  the  block  estimate,  discrete  Gaussian models, and conditional simulation models (swath plots).

All checks indicated that the estimates were acceptable.  However, if the mining block selectivity is significantly smaller than 20 mE x 20 mN x 12 mRL selective mining unit assumption  in  the  Mineral  Resource  estimate,  then  the  OK  estimate  will  be  a  poor predictor of the actual tonnage and grade that will be achieved at given drill hole data spacings.

## 14.11 Classification of Mineral Resources

The Mineral Resource is classified based on an evaluation of factors including search strategy,  number of informing composites, average distance weighting of composites from blocks, kriging quality parameters, geological and grade continuity, drill spacing and drill data quality, mining method and mining selectivity, and mining rate and cut-off value.

No  Measured  Mineral  Resources  were  classified  for  material  other  than  stockpiles. Stockpile classifications are supported by grade control models.

An  Indicated  Mineral  Resource  was  classified  where  the  average  weighted  distance between informing data was &lt;100 m, and the slope of regression was &gt;0.7.

An Inferred Mineral Resource was classified where the block was outside the Indicated classification, the average weighted distance of the informing data was &lt;175 m, and the slope of regression was &gt;0.4.

A cross-section showing the blocks classified is provided in Figure 14-1.

## 14.12 Reasonable Prospects of Eventual Economic Extraction

Mineral  Resources  were  estimated  assuming  both  open  pit  and  underground  mining methods.

The  Mineral  Resources  potentially  amenable  to  open  pit  mining  methods  were constrained within a pit shell that assumed the following:

- · Conventional truck and shovel operation;
- · 11 Mt/a mining rate;
- · Copper price:  US$3.40/lb;
- · Gold price:  US$1,400/oz;
- · Exchange rate:  C$:US$ of 0.75;

- · Unit  cost  assumptions  of  C$2.27/t  mining,  C$0.15/t  stockpile  rehandle,  C$7.72/t processing,  C$4.33/t  G&amp;A,  with  off-site  concentrate  transport,  treatment,  and refining costs included in the NSR;
- · LOM average metallurgical recoveries range from 50-61% for gold and 81-83% for copper;
- · Overall pit slope angles range from 34-46º;
- · Relative level restriction of 1,112 mRL to define the open pit to underground interface at approximately 50 m below the current LOM open pit design;
- · Net smelter return (NSR) marginal cut-off value of C$12.20/t to meet processing and general and administrative (G&amp;A) costs.

The  Mineral  Resources  potentially  amenable  to  underground  mining  methods  were constrained within a conceptual cave footprint, based on a potentially economic outline determined by the NSR of each block in the resource model below the open pit shell, assuming the following parameters:

- · A mass mining method (block cave or sub-level cave) with no internal selectivity;

- · 13.6 Mt/a mining rate;
- · Copper price:  US$3.40/lb;

## 14.13 Mineral Resource Statement

Mineral Resource estimates are reported with an effective date of 30 June, 2021, and are  reported  inclusive  of  those  Mineral  Resources  converted  to  Mineral  Reserves. Mineral Resources that are not Mineral Reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability.

Mineral Resources are tabulated in Table 14-2 for the Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources and in Table 14-3 for the Inferred Mineral Resources.  Mineral Resources were estimated as at 31 March 2021, and depleted to 30 June 2021.

The Qualified Person for the estimate is Mr. Rob Stewart, FAusIMM, whose job title at Newcrest is Group Manager Resources.  Mr. Stewart is a Newcrest employee.

## 14.14 Factors That May Affect the Mineral Resource Estimate

Factors that may materially impact the Mineral Resource estimates include:

- · Changes to long-term commodity price and exchange rate assumptions;
- · Changes  in  local  interpretations  of  mineralization  geometry  and  continuity  of mineralized zones;
- · Changes  to  geological  and  grade  shape  and  geological  and  grade  continuity assumptions;
- · Changes to metallurgical recovery assumptions;

## 14.15 QP Comments on 'Item 14:  Mineral Resource Estimates'

The QP is of the opinion that Mineral Resources have been performed using industryaccepted  practices  and  conform  to  the  2014  CIM  Definition  Standards.    Mineral Resource estimates are based on underground and open pit mining assumptions.

There are no other known environmental, legal, title, taxation, socioeconomic, marketing, political or other relevant factors that would materially affect the estimation of Mineral Resources that are not discussed in this Report.

## 15 MINERAL RESERVE ESTIMATES

## 15.1 Introduction

Mineral  Reserves  were  converted  from  Measured  and  Indicated  Mineral  Resources. Inferred Mineral Resources were set to waste.

Mineral Reserves were estimated using open pit and block cave underground mining assumptions.

## 15.2 Open Pit

## 15.2.1 Optimization

Pit optimization and pit design assumptions are outlined in Section 16.2.3 and Section 16.2.4.

## 15.2.2 Model Coding

The material routing variable (Codee) defined the ore and waste classification.  This variable was defined in the Red Chris mine model and executed by a MineSight software block model script.

Reserves were estimated from the resource block model with the following modifying factors:

- · Pit design volumes (phase triangulations) for Phase 5, Phase 7 and Phase 8;
- · Codee variable,  which was the value descriptor  for  material  routing  and  used  in financial year (FY) FY22Q1 operating and sustaining capital assumptions used for net smelter return (NSR) calculations;
- · Density was set to 2.78 t/m 3  where a density value was missing in the resource model.

## 15.2.3 Cut-off

Ore types were based on marginal, break-even and elevated cut-offs.  An NSR script calculated the value of each block model block by determining revenue after element recovery and selling costs.  Three ore and three waste types were differentiated as set out in Table 15-1.

## 15.2.4 Dilution and Ore Loss

Dilution was assumed to be fully accounted for in the block model.  No ore loss or dilution was applied to the Mineral Reserves.

| NPR <2 and all Bowser Sediment                   | Waste           |                       |
| NPR   2 (excluding Bowser sediment)  ≥           | Waste           |                       |
| NSR   PCST + GA + (1 * SPRC)  ≥                  | Waste           | 10.61                 |
| NSR   PCST + GA + (0.50 * SUS) + (1.0 * SPRC)  ≥ | Ore             | 12.40                 |
| NSR   PCST + GA + SUS + (0.2 * SPRC) + 5  ≥      | Ore             | 17.47                 |
| NSR   PCST + GA + SUS + (0.2 * SPRC) + 20  ≥     | Ore             | 28.72                 |
| Default                                          | Waste           |                       |

Notes:  NPR = neutralizing potential ratio.  NSR = value of ore as placed into crusher as processing decision point; NSR is fully costed.  PCST = concentrator unit cost.  GA = G&amp;A unit cost.  SPRC = stockpile recovery cost - 20% reclaim assumption.  SUS = sustaining capital unit cost.

## 15.3 Block Cave Underground

## 15.3.1 Development of Mining Case

A block cave method was selected for the 2021 PFS based on:

- · Deposit grade;
- · Total potential operating margin of each method;
- · Resource/ore conversion;
- · Deposit shape, dimensions, and continuity;
- · Potential mining rate.

Three  macroblocks  (MBs)  were  defined,  MB1,  MB2  and  MB3.    These  have  a  total footprint size of approximately 750 x 400 m, and a total area of about 271,000 m 2 .  Two mining throughputs were reviewed, one, the Central Case (base case) at 13.6 Mt/a, and the second, Upside Case (alternative case) at 15 Mt/a.  The macroblocks were sized and designed to produce up to 15 Mt/a, except for MB2, which had a limit of 7.0 Mt/a applied. Although the block cave has the potential to produce at a higher rate, the production rate for the purposes of the 2021 PFS was governed by the planned capacity of the process plant and potential upgrades.

Mining boundaries were determined using the commercially-available PCBC   software   to evaluate the potential column values over various elevations and over an extended area. A  shut-off value of C$21.00/t  was  used  to  determine  the  footprints; this was refined/validated with the final operating cost estimates.

<!-- image -->

Macroblock cave directions are mostly driven by geotechnical factors to ensure footprint long-term stability and reliability for continuous production.  MB1 caving will be initiated from northwest corner of the footprint in order to avoid the principal stress being parallel or sub-parallel to caving front.  MB2 caving is planned to start from the northeast corner towards the southwest.  MB3 caving will be initiated from southeast corner of the footprint towards northwest

## 15.3.2 Shut-off Values

Due to the nature of the Red Chris orebody and the layout of the macroblocks, a specific optimized cut-off grade strategy was not adopted; instead, a specified shut-off value was used for each block and draw column.  The Red Chris orebody has a distinct high-grade zone on which MB1 is located.  Grade management is via MB1; which is designed to deliver as much as 15 Mt/a and to incorporate, where practical, the higher-grade columns such that high grade is not deferred or displaced reducing project value.

There is a significant grade drop after MB1, and because MB2 has a reduced production capacity of 7 Mt/a, the transition between blocks focuses on production continuity rather than grade optimization.

Due to the relatively consistent low grade of the blocks beyond MB1, a single shut-off value was adopted that was in line with the break-even costs, rather than elevating shutoffs between MB transitions.  The shut-off values used are shown in Table 15-2.

Development ore is defined at having an NSR &gt;$16.50/t prior to the establishment of the underground conveyor system.  A figure of $16.50/t is the value of the processing plant feed that it would otherwise be displacing.  Due to the elevated cost of trucking waste to the surface, post-commissioning of the conveyor system, the development ore cut off is $10/t, which is approximately the same cost as processing.

## 15.3.3 Dilution

Dilution was modelled using the external drawpoint method to simulate surface toppling, rilling, and open pit failure.  Dilution was defined as material below C$20.70/t that enters the planned ore extraction via mixing.  Dilution accounts for about 5.0% of the tonnage (approximately 20.2 Mt).

All unclassified and Inferred classification materials were set to waste and zero grade.

## 15.3.4 Input Values

The Mineral Reserves amenable to block cave underground mining were reported using:

- · Gold price:  US$1,300/oz;
- · Copper price:  U$3.00/lb;
- · Canadian to US dollar exchange rate (C$:US$): 0.80;
- · Australian to US dollar exchange rate (A$:US$):  0.75.

Factors that are risk-specific to block cave operations, and which may affect the Mineral Reserves include:  inrush of water into the underground workings including decline, cave levels and infrastructure areas; poorer rock mass quality and quantity than interpreted; inability to achieve planned decline development rates having impact on schedule and cost; incorrect estimation of cave propagation potentially leading to air blast; and damage to mine workings due to a seismic event.

## 15.6 QP Comments on 'Item 15:  Mineral Reserve Estimates'

The QP is of the opinion that Mineral Reserves were estimated using industry-accepted practices, and conform to the 2014 CIM Definition Standards.  Mineral Reserves are based on open pit and underground mass mining assumptions.  The Mineral Reserves are acceptable to support mine planning.

There are no other known environmental, legal, title, taxation, socioeconomic, marketing, political or other relevant factors that would materially affect the estimation of Mineral Reserves that are not discussed in this Report.

## 16 MINING METHODS

## 16.1 Overview

## 16.1.1 Open Pit

Open pit operations are conducted using conventional methods and a conventional truck and shovel fleet.

## 16.1.2 Block Cave

The Red Chris Operations have the potential to transition to block cave underground mining.

The proposed block cave considered in the 2021 PFS envisages development of three successive macroblocks (MB1, MB2, and MB3), using a conventional post-undercut, El Teniente-style layout (an intersecting pattern of parallel extraction and parallel drawpoint drives)  with  diesel  load-haul-dump  (LHD)  machines  to  transport  rock  to  a  central crusher.  From the crusher, rock will be transported to surface, where it will be directed either to the existing coarse ore storage stockpile via a transfer conveyor, or to a new coarse  ore  storage  stockpile  feeding  a  new  grinding  train.    An  underground  mine dewatering system will pump collected water from sumps and settlers to the process plant for re-use.  Primary access to the mine workings will be via an extension of the exploration decline.

The  proposed  mine  plan  uses  technology  conventional  to  block  cave  operations, including mine design and equipment.  The planned mining equipment is conventional to block cave operations.

## 16.2 Open Pit

## 16.2.1 Geotechnical Considerations

The pit design parameters for Red Chris are designed to control bench scale stability and  rockfall  issues  more  than  the  global  stability  of  the  pit  walls.    In  2020,  the geotechnical parameters were updated based on geotechnical and operating history at the Project.

Golder defined six geotechnical domains within the open pit (Figure 16-1). Recommended inter-ramp angles ranged from 41.9-52.8º.  These were adjusted to take the pit ramps into account, leading to designed slope angles from 34-46º.

The greatest area of concern for stability is on the southern wall and in particular the Bowser  Lake  Group  sediments.    The  results  of  the  overall  slope  stability  analyses indicated that the proposed south wall design is expected to exhibit adequate factors of safety with respect to overall slope circular type failure that involves failure from the crest of the scope through the South Boundary Domain and South Domain rock mass.

Two areas that show a factor of safety risk are associated with the Bowser Lake Group sediments  near  the  pit  crest,  and  are  only  problematic  with  elevated  pore  water pressures.

The benches are expected to be relatively free draining, and significant pore pressures are unlikely to be generated at the crest of the slope.  Consequently, provided that good quality wall-controlled blasting is used along the south wall, and relative pore pressures are appropriately maintained, the Bowser Lake Group sediments are expected to exhibit adequate stability with respect to inter-ramp scale circular failure through the south wall.

## 16.2.2 Hydrological Considerations

The Red Chris open pit is located on a plateau that water generally drains from north to south, following the topography.  Seepage on the pit walls is minimal, is generally along major and continuous fault structures in the pit walls, and is currently not causing any signs of large-scale instability.

There is limited information available with respect to groundwater pressures within the Red Chris open pit.  Approximately six standpipe piezometers were installed within the Main and East Zone Pit areas, prior to open pit development.  These historic piezometers were located near the centre of the Main and East Zone Pits and indicated that the water

level was within approximately 10 m of ground surface prior to open pit development. The instruments were mined out during the early mining phases.

Precipitation  at  Red  Chris  occurs  throughout  the  year  as  both  rain  and  snow,  with  a period of spring snowmelt (or freshet). The majority of the water presenting to the open pit is derived from precipitation falling directly onto the pit walls. Groundwater is sourced from infiltration into near surface weathered country rock and open structures.

Water management in the pit is based around the use of surface drains to direct water from the benches and ramp towards sumps at the base of the pit from where it is pumped into the production circuit, either directly to the mill or TIA storage.  No active or passive groundwater drainage is currently installed within the pit.

Groundwater levels are not considered a limiting  factor  on  the  internal  ramp  angles. Installation  of  vibrating  wire  piezometers  and  improving  dewatering  records  is  being undertaken as part of a pit optimization study.

## 16.2.3 Pit Optimization

The block model was depleted using the May 2021 end of month survey topography for use in pit optimisations.  Phase designs that formed the basis of reserves were depleted using June 30 end of month survey topography.  Values used for pit optimisation will not necessarily match those provided in the economic analysis.

Metal prices of US$1,300/oz Au and US$3.00/lb Cu were used in optimization.

Metallurgical recoveries were coded into the block model by metallurgical domain.  The recovery formulas for each domain were originally a function of mill production rate and SAG throughput per shift.  For pit optimisation, the original formulae were modified for a consistent 11 Mt/a Mill throughput.

Mining  costs  were  based  on  a  US$2.27/t  reference  mining  cost  with  an  incremental bench sinking cost of US$0.03/bench.  The average cost applied to the optimisation was calculated to be US$2.54/t. Long term processing costs average US$13.60/t milled and are a combination of sustaining capital, general and administration (G&amp;A) costs plus mill operating costs.

Selling  costs  included  concentrate  shipment,  charges  and  refining  penalties.    The additional costs once the concentrate leaves the front gate average US$18/oz Au and US$0.505/lbs Cu.

The final design used the revenue factor 0.98 pit (Figure 16-2).

## 16.2.4 Pit Designs

The Mineral Reserve open pit design was subject to several limitations:

- · Pit slopes are controlled by bench stability rather than global wall angle stability;
- · Ore at the pit bottom can be mined by block cave or stoping;
- · WRSF space is limited to 150 Mt unless other PAG disposal areas can be permitted;
- · Pit optimisation guidance.

Note:  Figure prepared by Newcrest, 2021.

<!-- image -->

The Mineral Reserve phase designs included the following design criteria and objectives:

- · A minimum mining width of 70 m was targeted for all benches in both Main pit and East pit, including upper benches;
- · The Main pit was mined before the East pit due to a lower strip ratio and better economics;
- · The  Main  pit  Phase  7  was  designed  maintaining  the  minimum  mining  width surrounding the existing Phase 4 design, and is integrated into the Phase 5 design;
- · The  East  pit  Phase  8  was  integrated  into  Main  pit  Phase  7  and  maintains  the minimum mining width surrounding Phase 5.
- · The east and west haulage merged at elevation 1330;
- · The  East  pit  ramp  exit  was  aligned  along  the  southern  wall  integrating  with  the existing ex-pit haul road alignment;
- · Ramps were circular around pit limits with no switchbacks;
- · Single lane ramps were used for the bottom four benches in the Main and East pits;
- · 5 m fractional bench access was provided on either side of the ramp for service vehicles;

<!-- image -->

- · Single lane ramps targeted a 28 m width at 10% grade;
- · Default ramp widths targeted a 35 m width at 10% grade;
- · The selective mining unit was 5 x 5 x 12 m for the grade control model and 20 x 20 x 12 for the reserves model.  No additional dilution or mine recovery factors were applied;
- · The mine schedule had a one bench per month per phase limitation to control the bench sinking rate.

The designs resulted in three pit phases, Phase 5 and Phase 8 in the East zone and Phase 7 in the Main zone (Figure 16-3).

## 16.2.5 Operations

The mine uses rotary blasthole drills (drilling variable diameter holes up to 311 mm) and 28 m³ electric hydraulic shovels loading 230 t capacity haul trucks from 12 m benches. The operation is supported by standard ancillary equipment including an 18 m³ front-end loader, track and rubber-tired-dozers, and graders.

Ore and waste are drilled and blasted together on 12 m benches and mined in a single pass.  Where practicable, walls are drilled with a pre-split to assure stable wall rock conditions.

Ex-pit ore is allocated by gold and copper grade and either sent to the mill crusher pocket directly  or  sent  to  low-grade  or  mineralized  waste  stockpiles  (material  below  Mineral Reserve cut-off grade).

NAG rock is used to line the WRSF and for construction.  PAG rock is sent to designated PAG WRSFs.

## 16.2.6 Stockpiles

The Red Chris Operations use a grade binning ore control system based on NSR value of  mineralized  material.    High-grade  (Codee  1)  and  medium-grade  ore  (Codee  2)  is generally fed to the crusher directly with low-grade ore (Codee 3) stockpiled for later use as required.

Mineralized waste is also stockpiled but is not estimated as part of the Mineral Reserves.

Figure 16-3 shows the spatial distribution of grade bin ore in relation to the Red Chris phase designs.

Due to the potentially acid forming nature of the ore, the low-grade stockpiles (Including mineralized  waste)  overlie NAG  material  and  are  segregated  from  the  WRSF. Environmental controls direct contact water away from at-risk catchments.

A mineralized waste stockpile has been retained as a potential buffer for the mill in the event of production interruptions from the mine, should low-grade ore stockpiles become depleted.  Mineralized waste treatment would be contingent on sufficiently high metal spot prices to make processing the material economically viable.

## 16.2.7 Waste Rock Storage Facilities

The locations of the WRSFs at the end of the open pit mine life are shown in Figure 16-4.

NAG waste rock will generally be used as base below the PAG rock storage area, as road-topping material, or as general construction material.  Depending on the available quantity of NAG rock, the base below the PAG waste will be designed from 1-5 m thick.

Low-grade material is stockpiled on a base of NAG material.  PAG waste is hauled to the north WRSF (north of the open pit limits) and placed upon a base of NAG waste material.

Sufficient WRSF space was designed to store 150 Mt of NAG and PAG waste, assuming a loose density of 2.2 t/m 3 .  The open pit schedule requires 120 Mt of waste be stored.

Current  seismic  hazard  assessment  is  based  on  regional  earthquake  reviews,  and estimates  derived  from  rock  mass  behaviour  in  numerical  models.    With  the  current reliability on  key  inputs  (rock  strength,  structure  material  properties,  stress  field orientation, etc.), detailed prediction of seismic hazard is difficult.

## 16.3.1.2 Rock Mass Characterisation

The ground conditions within orebody at Red Chris Underground Mine are interpreted to be 'very good', based on data collected from 2018-2020.  The rock mass rating (RMR) is in the range of 75-95 and the RQD is approximately &gt;90.  The rock mass is typically massive, strong, and brittle, with minimal natural open features.  However, exceptions do occur adjacent to modelled mine-scale fault structures where conditions vary from blocky conditions to highly-broken zones of weak rock including the South Boundary Fault.

Data used for domain characterisation and strength parameters were collected from a zone close to economic mineralisation.  Limited geotechnical data exist within the rock mass along the eastern corridor where access development is proposed.  A detailed geotechnical data collection program was conducted at the site of the exploration decline boxcut.  An extrapolation of ground conditions based on the general geology was made to this area.  Additional data collection is in progress to improve current understanding.

The magnitude and direction of the in-situ stress was indirectly measured using acoustic emission  (AE)  and  the  results  conflicted  with  the  regional  stress  indicators  such  as geological features and the world stress map.  The acoustic emission test results were adopted for the purposes of the 2021 PFS, in conjunction with the AE stress results, sensitivity analyses on stress magnitude  and  direction were  completed  in the geotechnical modelling.

## 16.3.1.3 Rock Mass Domains

Six geotechnical domains were assessed for the proposed underground development and cave extents.

Five  domains  were  broadly  based  on  the  lithological  units  and  they  are,  Bowser Sediments,  Stuhini Volcanics, Stuhini Sediments,  Porphyry  Main  and  P2.    As geotechnical data suggested that the vicinity of the South Boundary Fault is a zone of significantly poorer rock mass quality, the South Boundary Fault was identified as the sixth  domain.    Available  data  suggested  the  HW1,  HW2  and  EZF  faults  were  more discrete structures with minimal impact on surrounding rock mass quality.

## 16.3.1.4 Pre-Conditioning and Fragmentation

All  pre-conditioning  works  will  extend  from  the  extraction  level  of  the  macroblocks  to within 75 m of the ultimate floor of the open pit (580 m above the underground footprint).

Fragmentation assessments were taken by Golder (Golder, 2021) and Itasca (Itasca, 2021).  Cave fragmentation analyses concluded:

- · Orebody pre-conditioning via high undercut, blast, and hydraulic means is required as &gt;90% of the orebody can be considered massive rock;
- · Primary  fragmentation:    primary  fragments  rather  than  being  controlled  by  preexisting discontinuities (e.g., joints) will likely be controlled by the level of stresses around  the  cave  (above  yielded  zone)  and  strength  and  intensity  of  the  weak features present in the rock mass;

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

- · Secondary fragmentation: secondary fragmentation curves expected at the drawpoints show a percentage oversize decreasing from 45% to 5% and percentage fines increasing from 10-50% over the LOM.

## 16.3.1.5 FLAC3D Modelling

A large-scale FLAC3D model was constructed (Itasca, 2021) consisting of the regional extent of the Red Chris Operations, including the Red Chris final open pit geometry to capture the correct pre-mining in-situ stress condition (prior to cave mining).

Following initiation, the cave will propagate to the surface by approximately Q4 of year 2 to Q1 of year 3 of cave draw.  The fracture limit was observed to breach the ground surface, showing the first signs of cave-induced subsidence between the fourth quarter of year 2 using AE stress and the first quarter of year 3 with a reduced stress in sensitivity analysis. The cave breakthrough (mobilized zone) was forecast during year 4.

The  cave  limit  during  the  LOM  in  the  south  and  southeast,  and  the  potential  for uncontrolled dilution, is controlled by the South Boundary Fault.  The areal extent of the caving zone (fracture limit) will extend beyond the final open pit crest (Figure 16-5; Figure 16-6).  The crater limit will be at the end of the LOM, at FY57, and the crater depth will be 350-400 m below the bottom of the final pit.

Modelled  cave  subsidence  shows  no  major  risks  with  respect  to  surface  mining infrastructure or surface features such as Kluea Lake.  A potential impact to Camp Creek was identified and a creek diversion should be considered.  In addition, analysis with an updated  in-situ stress measurement  and  rock  mass  characterisation  should  be undertaken and possible mitigation measures assessed.

Numerical modelling using FLAC3D was used to assess potential damage to the planned underground structures.  The results suggest:

- · All major chambers (i.e. crusher chamber) are stable and supportable with little risk of instability;
- · The damage in the footprint before opening MB2 will be focused in the southwestern corner of MB1 due to the in-situ stress orientation;
- · Elevated damage may occur to underground openings around the cave abutment; this damage is considered acceptable and the underground openings may require rehabilitation during operations;
- · LOM ventilation raises may experience minor but acceptable damage.

The perimeter drives in the southeastern corner of MB2 (including the cross-cuts through the South Boundary Fault) are forecast to experience significant slabbing/cracking due to the influence of the south boundary fault, and will require rehabilitation during the LOM.

## 16.3.1.6 Ground Support and Reinforcement

Static support assessment was applied to excavations less than 700 m below surface where the stress level (ratio between maximum stress and compressive strength of rock at  the  opening)  is  estimated  to  be  &lt;0.4.    Excavations  &gt;700 m  below  surface  and/or impacted  by  the  cave  abutment  stresses  were  assessed  using  a  deformation-based approach.

Empirical assessments were completed using the Q-system (Barton et al, 1974) for static analysis.  The majority of the main decline and conveyor decline will be excavated within the Stuhini Group sediments under purely static conditions, and will not warrant dynamic support  application.    An  excavation  support  ratio  of  1.6  was  selected  to  represent permanent mine openings.  The excavation support ratio safety requirements depend on the use (purpose) of the excavation.  Typical ground support in static condition will be resin grouted bolt and weld mesh.  Fibre-reinforced shotcrete and cable bolts will be required at large excavation such as transfer chamber

Other  openings  below  700  m  depth  where  the  stress  level  is  estimated  &gt;0.4  will  be evaluated  using  a  dynamic  support  approach.    Assessment  of  dynamic  support  was based on the Kaiser deformation-based design approach (Kaiser, 2020).  Typical ground support in dynamic condition will be fibre-reinforced shotcrete, mesh (woven or minax), resin-grouted bolts, and cable bolts, or a combination of these methods.

## 16.3.1.7 Inrush

Based on the results of simulations done in the site-wide numerical groundwater flow model report by BGC Engineering Inc. (BGC), high water inflow rates into the block cave are not likely to occur.  The simulation showed that seepage inflow rates increased as development progresses, from 200-222 m 3 /hr, and that the zone of influence expanded as  the  block  cave  progressed,  with  expansion  along  the  alignment  of  the  orebody. Sensitivity  analysis  of  the  block  cave  inflow  rates  to  variable  recharge  indicated  a potential range of 185-355 m 3 /hr.  However, short-term temporal events (e.g., freshet or one-in-100-year 24-hour rainfall events) may result in groundwater inflows exceeding this range.

With increased rock mass characterisation, improved details on weathering, oxidation and alteration styles will be developed that can allow improved estimation of fine and muds creation, leading to inrush risks.

## 16.3.1.8 Monitoring

Cave  markers  and  beacons  will  be  seeded  within  the  cave  to  provide  greater understanding  of  the  cave  propagation  rates  (in  conjunction  with  the  microseismic system), and material flow in the broken caved material muck pile.  A preliminary design was  generated,  using  proprietary  software  to  select  detector  locations  (array),  and simulate the detector arrays' ability to track beacons in the cave.

A microseismic monitoring system is planned to be in place prior to the commencement of the hydraulic preconditioning program.  The system will use a combination of surface and underground boreholes equipped with geophones.

## 16.3.2 Hydrogeological Considerations

The hydrostratigraphic regime is divided into four different hydrostratigraphic units:

- · Basement (including Bowser Sediments, Stuhini Sediments, Stuhini Volcanics and Porphyry):    a  fractured  rock  unit  with  hydraulic  conductivity  that  decreases  with depth.  Not considered to be a water source for local communities or significantly contribute to regional flow within the Project area of influence;
- · Mobilized zone:  represents the muck pile after the development of the cave; creates an increased conductivity due to the fracturing and comminution of the rock mass;
- · Fracture zone:  a zone of hydraulic conductivity surrounding the mobilized zone, with hydraulic conductivities that are higher than the intact basement surrounding the cave;
- · South Boundary Fault:  fault zone; no indication that possible increases in hydraulic conductivity  associated  with  changes  in  stress  or  relaxation  of  the  faulting  zone would have a significant influence on the inflows seen in the workings.

The  groundwater  flow  direction,  based  on  piezometer  data,  is  closely  related  to topography, and dominantly west to east.  The South Boundary Fault is interpreted to be acting as a hydraulic barrier.  Piezometer measurements show there is little influence from the open pit on groundwater levels at the depth of the block cave.

The main source of water that will present to the underground was determined to come from direct precipitation (rain and snowmelt) flowing through the caved mass.  Under natural  conditions,  it  is  assumed  that  most  deep  infiltration  would  report  to  surface drainage  at  lower  elevations,  similar  to  the  surface  drainage  regime.    Under  current conditions, the shallow discharge regime is altered by the development of the existing pit, with flow towards the existing pit due to the changed piezometric elevation.  With the propagation  of  the  cave,  it  is  assumed  that  similar  changes  will  occur  at  the  deeper elevations.

A numerical representation of flow was developed to characterize inflow groundwater flow rates and flow directions and estimate inflow rates to the underground workings. During  the  modelling  process,  various  combinations  of  infrastructure,  cave  size  and rainfall were modelled for consideration.  The 24 hour return period precipitation values were used to estimate inflow.  The average climate scenario was based on a precipitation value of 1.4 mm/d to estimate a reasonable baseline water production rate for the block cave and development.  About 85% of the water reporting to the underground is forecast to come from the block cave or muck pile; however, the amount of flow is dependent on the estimated hydraulic conductivity of the muck pile and precipitation.

The underground water management system proposed for the Red Chris block cave was developed  based  on  the  initial  model  results  and  estimations.    The  planned  water management capacity will range from 200 m 3 /hr during initial development to 1,500 m 3 /hr during mining of MB2 and MB3.  The latter figure includes an allowance for a peak surge for a one-in-50 year event for 24 hours.

## 16.3.3 Design Considerations

Orebody characteristics indicated that block caving, sub-level caving, and sub-level open stoping  were  appropriate  mining  methods.    Block  caving  was  selected  based  on  the potential  to  convert  more  of  the  resources  to  reserves,  favourable  production  rate requirements and the potential to create the highest operating margin.

A trade-off study was completed on the footprint to surface material handling system (inclined conveyor vs shaft) with the inclined conveyor being the selected option.

The resource model and inputs were used in Footprint Finder (a component of the PCBC software suite) to determine the approximate elevation of the extraction level.  The initial results indicated that footprint elevations between 450-600 mRL were applicable.  These elevations showed  consistent  grade  distribution allowing preliminary macroblock evaluation with PCBC to refine the footprint elevation selection process.

The final results indicated that to optimize the resource conversion the footprint should be  separated  into  three  macroblocks  (MB1,  MB2,  and  MB3).    The  optimal  footprint elevation for MB1 and MB2 was 500 mRL, and for MB3 was 550 mRL.  It was decided to keep the same 500 mRL footprint elevation for all three macroblocks to simplify the material handling system, thus reducing cost and complexity, and optimizing the value of the total project.

A schematic showing the footprint design is provided in Figure 16-7.

Based  on  the  defined  footprint  targets,  the  extraction  and  undercut  layouts  were designed, and access, and the infrastructure including ventilation and materials handling development were added to build the total mine design.  All design was undertaken adhering to mine design and geotechnical parameters.

Each  macroblock  footprint  will  consist  of  an  extraction  level,  undercut  level,  and infrastructure  development.  A single crusher and tipple arrangement will be used to facilitate production for all macroblocks.  A perimeter drive on the extraction and undercut level will provide extraction and drill drive access and ventilation to the working areas. The footprint will be ventilated via the access and conveyor declines as well as three ventilation  raises  extending  from  surface.    A  series  of  internal  ventilation  raises  will provide exhaust ventilation for the crusher, conveyor, and tipple areas.

The  exploration/access  decline  portal  is  constructed,  and  is  located  at  the  lowest accessible point above the ultimate height of the TIA.  Access to the mine will be via two declines: exploration/access and conveyor declines (Figure 16-8).  Both declines will have the portals located east of the mine footprint.

The exploration decline started construction in June 2021, and is the critical item required for Project development.  It will be developed west towards the orebody, from which an exploration platform will be developed that will be used for drilling and LOM ventilation. From this point the decline will switch back to the east to intercept the third leg of the conveyor decline before switching back to the west towards the footprint.

The access decline gradient will be 1:6.5 because the decline will be used for haulage prior to the conveyor installation.  The exploration decline will connect to the exploration level before connecting to the footprint.  The exploration level will become a ventilation transfer drift once exploration drilling is completed.

The  conveyor  decline  is  designed  to  house  a  straight  conveyor,  minimize  conveyor transfers, and have a minimum transfer angle of 11°.  It was also designed to keep the transfer stations accessible from surface via a ventilation raise if required, as well as keeping the 1,200 L transfer north of the decline portal due to poorer ground conditions identified at depth south of the decline portal.  The conveyor decline is designed at 1:5.3 gradient.  There will be a lateral connection between the exploration decline and leg two of the conveyor decline.  It is currently planned that traffic in the conveyor decline will be limited to conveyor maintenance and secondary egress.

Ventilation shafts from surface will be developed along the length of the access decline, to provide ventilation during decline development as well as supporting LOM ventilation requirements.  The decline strategy is to have multiple touch points between declines allowing for the conveyor decline to be mined from multiple fronts so that the average development rate per heading can be reduced taking it off the project critical path.

The mine access will consist of about 17,400 m of lateral development and approximately 3,700 m of vertical development.  The declines were designed with stockpiles and sumps

at spacings that will allow for future use of the excavations as refuge chambers, pump cuddies, sub-station cuddies, passing, and storage.

## 16.3.4.2 Primary Mine Design Parameters

The primary mine design parameters are summarized in Table 16-2.  The parameters for the block cave design are outlined in Table 16-3.  The cave schedule metrics are shown in Table 16-4.  Designs included:

- · The default density for caved material is 2.2;
- · Drawbell spacing is 32 x 20 m;
- · Draw cone radius is 14 m;
- · PCBC Template mixing of 45º rilling and 40º toppling.

The layout includes declines, ventilation infrastructure, footprint access, crusher location, and footprint layout.  Primary ventilation is achieved through three fresh air intakes, both portals and VR3, and two exhaust raises, VR1 and VR2.

## 16.3.4.3 Extraction Levels

Extraction levels for all macroblocks are based on the standard extraction level layout using an El Teniente layout with spacing of 32 x 20 m, a 60° turn-out angle and 5.4 m wide x 4.6 m high drives.

Extraction levels will be accessed from the north of each block, with access from both east and west of each block (to extraction and undercut levels) with an additional two internal ramps to the undercut level.  This is to manage the air velocities and provides an additional means of egress on each level.  The design inputs for the extraction levels are summarized in Table 16-5.

The extraction level was designed so that all drives in the three macroblocks drain to the south, away from the mine infrastructure that will be located on the northeast corner of the footprint.  Extraction drives were designed at a gradient of 1:50 to the south, draining back to the perimeter drives that will be graded to drain to the sumps on the southern perimeter drives.  This will also serve as flood mitigation by directing water away from critical infrastructure such as the crusher and main pump station.

From the perimeter drive sumps, water will be pumped to the main mine pump station that will be located near the conveyor transfer station on the 420 mRL level, below the extraction level.  The mine pump station will then pump water to surface via a rising main that will be located within the decline via the conveyor portal to the process plant.

## 16.3.4.4 Undercut Levels

The undercut level will be 25 m above the extraction level to accommodate the high post undercut method by ramps up from the extraction level for each macroblock.  The slot drill drive will be 20m from the closest drawbell, to allow appropriate stand-off.

The  total  development  metres  and  drilling  required  on  the  undercut  level  in  each macroblock is provided in Table 16-6.

The undercut level drainage design is similar to that described for the extraction level.

## 16.3.4.5 Production Sequence

The mining sequence will be, in order, MB1, MB2, and MB3.  This sequence is based on mining the high-grade portion of the Mineral Reserve first (MB1).  MB2 will be a southern extension of MB1, and with cave rules and stress orientation dictating that MB3 is opened from southeast to northwest, MB2 must be opened prior to MB3.

Development and operation will be as follows:

- · Exploration decline;
- · Conveyor declines and access decline (and required ventilation infrastructure);
- · First footprint access reached;
- · MHS mass excavation;
- · MHS construction and ventilation infrastructure;
- · MB1 development;
- · MB1 first drawbell firing and cave establishment;
- · MB1 full production;
- · MB2 development starts;
- · MB2 first drawbell firing and cave establishment;
- · MB3 development starts;

- · MB3 first drawbell firing and cave establishment;
- · MB3 full production;
- · End of MB3 production.

MB1 caving will be initiated from the northwest corner of the footprint in order to avoid the principal stress (determined via AE testing) being parallel or sub-parallel to caving front.  MB2 caving is planned to start from the northeast corner towards the southwest in order to avoid the caving front being parallel or sub-parallel to the South Boundary Fault located at the southeast corner of the footprint, start caving from the MB1 cave, and to start caving from a tight footprint area to a wider undercut area.  It will also commence in the stress shadow provided by the MB1 cave against the principal stress.  MB3 caving will be initiated from southeast corner of the footprint towards the northwest to avoid the principal stress being parallel or sub-parallel to the caving front, and to start caving from the existing cave.

## 16.3.5 Materials Handling System

A schematic showing the planned material handling system is included as Figure 16-9.

A single crusher was designed to service the three macroblocks, and will be located to the northeast of the footprint, 95 m north of MB1.  The crusher will be offset 95 m from the closest undercut, to place the crusher outside the effects of mining-induced abutment stress.

The footprint material handling system will direct feed the crusher with LHDs, with five tip points on the 500 mRL above a ROM bin at the extraction level.  The crusher will be serviced by a five-tipple dump arrangement with a sixth access for ventilation and loader access to the rock box.

There will be an equal number of extraction drives reporting to each tipple from MB1 and MB2 to enable as high a production rate as possible with as little loader interaction as possible.  A dedicated haulage loop was designed for MB3 to access the western side of the tipple arrangement using trucks.

Crushed ore will be transferred to the decline conveyor via a fine ore bin, from where it will progress to the collection conveyor and the transfer station on the 420 mRL.  From the conveyor decline, ore will be transported to surface with additional transfer stations located at the 1,200 and 1,400 mRLs.

Conveyors will be mounted from the backs, with a 3.7 m minimum height clearance for service vehicles.

## 16.3.6 Ventilation

The ventilation system was designed to meet the required mines regulations outlined in the Health, Safety, and Reclamation Code for Mines in British Columbia, and modelled using Ventsim.

The mine will be ventilated by a 'pull' or exhausting type ventilation system and was designed based on the use of diesel equipment.  The primary mine ventilation fans will be located at the primary exhaust airways of the mine and will develop sufficient negative pressure  to  ensure  all  workplaces  are  supplied  with  the  required  fresh  air  such  that contaminants  are  removed  to  the  exhaust  air  system  and  ultimately  to  the  surface. Airflows  were  allocated  based  upon  maintaining  ventilation  for  all  concurrent  mine activities.

VR1 and VR2 will be the primary exhaust airways, and VR3 the intake airway (Figure 16-10).  The primary fan exhaust fan installations are planned to be located on surface and will be controlled with variable frequency drives to allow fluctuation in air volumes during the life of the mine as well as ensure effective dust and contaminant removal.

Fresh air will be sourced from VR3 as well as the access and conveyor decline portals. After exiting the primary fresh air routes, fresh air will be distributed through each of the declines to the production panel accesses.  Airflow for each extraction access will be controlled by fans located above ventilation doors positioned at the beginning of each extraction drift.

Air direction will be from the access towards the crusher tip point.  Air will be exhausted through the crusher direct to the exhaust so that air contaminated by dust will not return back towards the panel.

Raiseboring  was  selected  as  the  preferred  method  of  excavation  for  the  ventilation raises.

## 16.3.7 Heating

Heating will be employed.  For both of the portals, the heating system is required to raise the temperature from a design minimum of -35°C up to +2°C.  For VR3, the first trafficable airway  will  be  at  the  extraction  level.    Air  will  be  heated  to  -7.5°C,  as  due  to  autocompression effects, the air will increase in temperature as it descends.  The minimum targeted delivery air temperature for trafficable airways is 2°C.

## 16.3.8 Waste Disposal

All waste is scheduled to be trucked out of the mine via the access decline portal, except for waste development directly related to conveyor decline development, which will use the conveyor portal where possible.  Ore is scheduled to be trucked out of the access decline until Q4 FY26; after that date the materials handling system will be complete and ore will be hauled via conveyor to the surface.

The block cave mine will produce about 2.9 Mt of PAG waste, which will be stored on the existing permitted facilities.  NAG material will be used for site construction, including the TIA.

## 16.3.9 Underground Infrastructure

The mine design will include the following infrastructure:

- · Primary ventilation network including fans, doors and barricades;
- · Underground workshop, offices, refuge stations;
- · Dewatering facilities to handle snow melt and spring freshet with a maximum inflow of 1,500 m 3 /hr (one-in-50 year event) after the cave reaches the surface;
- · Utility and fire water distribution;
- · Electrical power supply and distribution;
- · Diesel fuel supply and distribution;
- · Concrete supply and distribution.

## 16.3.10  Equipment

Total  fleet  requirement  during  development  shown  in  Table  16-7  and  the  production equipment is shown in Table 16-8.

## 16.4 Production Schedule

## 16.4.1 Open Pit

The Red Chris East Zone is currently being mined by open pit mining.  The open pit mine is due for completion of the final phase (Phase 8) in FY26, producing an estimated total of 63.6 Mt of ore from Q4 FY21 to Q4 FY26.  The first cave ore from MB1 (located directly below Phase 8) is scheduled for2H FY26, with full production from MB1 in FY30.  During the  block  cave  production  ramp-up  the  process  plant  feed  will  be  supplemented  by stockpiled ore.

A figure showing the remainder of the open pit mine life with the proposed transition to the block cave operation is provided as Figure 16-11.

## 16.4.2 Block Cave Underground

The mining sequence will be, in order, MB1, MB2, and lastly MB3 (Figure 16-12).

## 16.4.3 Combined Open Pit and Underground

The combined open pit and underground production schedule forecast is shown in Figure 16-13.  The forecast tonnage profile transitions from a predominantly open pit feed in FY26 to an exclusively underground mill feed in FY30 when the nameplate capacity of 13.6 Mt/a is scheduled to be reached.

Figure 16-14 is a forecast metal production profile.  In this figure, the gold equivalent value  is  based  on  assumptions  of  a  gold  price  of  US$1,500/oz,  copper  price  of US$3.30/lb, C$:US$ exchange rate of 0.80, LOM gold recovery of 66%, and LOM copper recovery of 82%.

## The equation is:

- · Gold equivalent production (by-product basis) = recovered gold oz + (copper price US$/lb) x 2,204 / (gold price US$/oz) x (recovered copper tonnes).

## 17 RECOVERY METHODS

## 17.1 Introduction

Plant design for open pit ores was based on the metallurgical testwork assuming open pit  mining  methods  outlined  in  Section  13.1,  and  was  a  standard  porphyry  copper flowsheet employing SAG and ball milling, flotation, regrinding, thickening and filtering to produce a copper concentrate at a moisture content of 8% for export.

Subsequent to the initial construction, the plant has undergone the following changes:

- · Installation of pebble bypass system on the SAG mill.  The main purpose of this change was to allow continued operation in the event of breakdowns in the pebble recycling system;
- · Installation of an additional 160 m 3 rougher flotation cell for a copper roughing/sulphide scavenging duty to increase rougher flotation residence time;
- · Installation of a third flotation column to increase capacity of the cleaner circuit and alleviate flotation constraints at high throughput rates and high copper head grades.

The 2021 PFS metallurgical testwork program confirmed that a flowsheet incorporating crushing, grinding, flotation, and concentrate dewatering was suitable for the planned block cave material.

## 17.2 Plant Design

The plant consists of a SAG mill-ball mill-pebble crushing (SABC) comminution circuit housed in a single  process  building.    The  target  grind  size  is  a  P 80 of  150  µm,  with throughput taking precedence over grind size, resulting in typical grind sizes closer to 170-180 µm.

The flotation circuit as of May 2021 consisted of:

- · Copper rougher: five Outotec TC-200;
- · Mixed duty (copper rougher/sulphide rougher): one TC-200 and one TC-160;
- · Regrind: primary ball mill in series with a secondary Vertimill targeting a regrind size P80 of 30 µm;
- · Cleaner  circuit:  two  cleaner  columns  and  a  bank  of  five  Outotec  TC-50  cleaner scavengers;
- · Concentrate storage tank, thickener, and pressure filter.

Subsequently, in June 2021, the third flotation column was commissioned.

The flotation circuit is configured to produce a copper concentrate with a grade of 2324% Cu.    Originally  configured  as  a  two-stage  cleaning  circuit,  the  plant  was  often

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

operated with only a single stage of cleaning due to insufficient capacity in the cleaner columns.  This no longer occurs as the third flotation column is in place.

The process plant produces two tailings streams, nominal non-acid-generating (NAG) tailings and potentially acid generating tailings (PAG).  The plant is operated to ensure that NAG tailings are deficient in sulphide content such that the neutralizing potential ratio  (NPR)  is  greater  than  2.    NPR  is  a  ratio  of  the  neutralizing  potential  (NP)  of carbonates vs. the acid potential (AP) of sulphides.  In some cases, the NPR criteria can be achieved by operating a copper rougher-only circuit.  When sulphur feed grades are high, insufficient pyrite is removed from the copper rougher tailings to meet target NPR criteria.  In these cases, it is necessary to operate the last one or two nominally rougher cells in a pyrite scavenger duty.

PAG tailings are nominally cleaner-scavenger tailings and also include pyrite scavenger concentrate when the sulphide scavenger mode is in operation.  PAG tailings are much higher in sulphide (pyrite) content than NAG tailings and are currently required to be deposited sub-aqueously in the TIA.

A flowsheet of the circuit as at May 2021 is provided in Figure 17-1.  The current plant equipment is discussed in Section 17.4.3.

Process improvements are underway, and include:

- · Installation of a third Eriez Cavitation Tube Column in the cleaners, which started commissioning in June 2021;
- · Installation of two pre-rougher duty Eriez StackCells, due to be completed by Q1 2022.

Newcrest is investigating the installation of a tailings thickener for NAG cyclone overflow. A new tailings cyclone cluster will be installed adjacent the tailings thickener, should this project proceed.

## 17.3 2021 PFS Process Alternatives Options

The  2021  PFS  evaluated  process  plant  upgrades  required  to  meet  the  different  ore characteristics of underground ores compared with open pit ores, specifically increased hardness and higher copper head grades.

Figure 17-1: Plant Flowsheet (as at May 2021)

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Note:  Figure prepared by Newcrest, 2021.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Two process options were evaluated:

- · A Central Case (that forms the base case), that would treat 13.6 Mt/a of underground ore through the existing SABC circuit plus a new single-stage SAG mill circuit; this concept  was  within  the  current  maximum  permitted  throughput  of  38,000 t/d average, 13.87 Mt/a;
- · An  Upside  Case  (that  forms  an  alternative  case),  that  would  treat  15  Mt/a  of underground ore through the existing SABC circuit plus a new single-stage SAG mill circuit, with SAG mill discharge configurations modified to allow coarsening of grind size, and addition of a HydroFloat coarse particle flotation circuit.

In  both  cases,  flotation  and  concentrate  dewatering  upgrades  were included to allow processing of higher head grade underground ore.

## 17.4 Central Case

## 17.4.1 Background

The  Central  Case  (base  case)  expansion  aimed  to  increase  the  throughput  of  the process  plant  from  the  current  11.0  Mt/a  treating  open  pit  ore  to  13.6  Mt/a  treating underground ore.  The underground ore is harder and has higher copper and gold head grades.  In the Central Case the target grind size aimed to revert to the original Red Chris design of 80% passing 150 μ m.

The  Central  Case  expansion  largely  kept  the  existing  process  operation,  added  an additional  grinding  line  and  expanded  some  unit  operations  to  suit  block  cave  ore. Upgrades  include  a  new  coarse  ore  stockpile,  single-stage  SAG  mill,  pre-rougher StackCells, new regrind circuit and expansion of the concentrate dewatering circuit.  The ore  properties  of  underground  ore  are  expected  to  be  sufficiently  favourable  to discontinue sulphide scavenger flotation, which is required for most open pit ores.  The existing regrind ball mill would be removed to create space for an expanded cleaner flotation  circuit.    A  single,  large  vertical  stirred  regrind  mill  (HIG  mill  technology)  is proposed to make up for the loss of the capacity from the decommissioned regrind ball mill.  The expansion scenario considered that the ongoing process improvement projects would be online prior to the block cave expansion, including Cleaner Column 3, Phase 1 pre-rougher StackCells (treating cyclone overflow from the existing SABC circuit), and NAG tailings thickening.

## 17.4.2 Plant Design

The existing SABC comminution circuit will operate independently from the expansion single-stage SAG comminution circuit.  These two circuits will incorporate independent pre-roughing  StackCells  on  the  products  from  the  respective  grinding  circuits.    The tailings from these two pre-rougher circuits are then combined into the existing rougher flotation  circuit.    Upgrade  equipment  in  regrinding,  cleaner  flotation,  and  concentrate dewatering circuits will generally be integrated with the existing equipment.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

A new coarse ore stockpile (COS) will be required for the expansion.  The new COS will be covered to reduce dust emissions; the 2021 PFS envisaged a partial conical cover. The stockpile reclaim system will mirror the existing system with two operating apron feeders drawing crushed ore onto the single-stage SAG feed conveyor, and a third apron feeder as a standby.

Ore from underground will feed onto the existing COS via a transfer conveyor to the existing overland conveyor and onto the new COS via a new COS feed conveyor.  A diversion system will partition ore between the two conveyors.

The single-stage SAG feed conveyor will feed both fresh feed and recycled pebbles to a new single-stage SAG mill.  The product from the mill will discharge onto a single-stage SAG  discharge  vibrating  screen,  which  separates  oversize  from  undersize  material. Oversize pebbles will recirculate using a series of conveyors to a pebble bin.  For the Central Case, a future option is to install a pebble crusher; however, the pebble crusher itself was removed during value engineering.  A belt feeder will draw pebbles from the bin and through transfer chutes onto the single-stage SAG feed conveyor.  A provision exists to divert pebbles out of the circuit to a temporary stockpile when treating hard ore or  if  there  are  process  instabilities  (e.g.,  grate  damage  in  single-stage  SAG  mill). Stockpiled pebbles can be returned to the circuit via a loading chute adjacent the pebble crusher building.

Vibrating screen undersize will discharge into a cyclone feed pumpbox where it will be pumped to a cluster of cyclones.  Cyclone underflow (oversize material) will flow back via gravity into the single-stage SAG mill for additional grinding.  Cyclone overflow will discharge into a pumpbox where it will be pumped to the new single-stage SAG prerougher StackCells.

Grinding media will be added periodically using ball buckets for the SAG mill.  A ball bunker has been incorporated into the design.

The new single-stage SAG mill will have twin pinions and synchronous motors of 8,250 kW each.  Variable frequency drives (VFDs) will be incorporated to control mill speed. The  existing  SABC  circuit  will  continue  to  operate  in  the  current  configuration.    No modifications are anticipated for the SABC circuit for the Central Case.

The existing Red Chris rougher flotation circuit consists of up to seven tank cells.  In 2022 the operations are planning to install two new pre-rougher StackCells to treat the product from the existing single-stage SAG circuit (Phase 1).  The block cave process plant expansion will then add two more StackCells to process the product from the singlestage  SAG  grinding  circuit.    These  StackCells  are  considered  to  be  Phase  2  of  the StackCell installations, and are referred to as the single-stage SAG StackCells.  Tailings from  Phase  1  and  Phase  2  pre-rougher  StackCells  will  be  combined  and  fed  to  the existing rougher flotation bank.

A  new  metallurgical  sampler  will  be  installed  on  the  feed  to  the  single-stage  SAG StackCells.  The tailings from the single-stage SAG StackCells will flow via gravity to the existing rougher flotation feedbox.  The SABC StackCells tailings will also flow via gravity to  the  existing  rougher  flotation  feedbox.    Rougher  flotation  tailings  will  exit  via  the

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

existing 7 th rougher flotation cell and will continue to discharge into the NAG trench where the tailings will be transported to the TIA.  The SABC StackCell concentrate will discharge via gravity into the existing rougher flotation concentrate pumpbox for regrinding.  The single-stage  SAG  StackCell  concentrate  will  discharge  via  gravity  into  the  regrind cyclone feed pumpbox for regrinding and subsequent cleaning.

Reagents, including IPETC, PAX, and MIBC, will be dosed as required for the rougher flotation circuit.

Rougher  flotation  concentrate  will  require  regrinding  to  increase  liberation  and  allow upgrading in the cleaner circuit to saleable concentrate grades at high cleaner stage recovery.  The SABC StackCell and existing rougher flotation concentrate will be pumped into the regrind cyclone feed pumpbox where it will join the single-stage SAG StackCell concentrate and existing cleaner scavenger flotation concentrate.  The combined regrind circuit  feed  will  be  pumped  into  an  open  circuit  regrind  cyclone  cluster.    Cyclone underflow (oversize material) will discharge into HIG mill feed pumpbox.  The HIG mill feed pumpbox will pump concentrate into a new HIG3500 regrind mill.  The HIG mill discharge will overflow into a media retention screen with screen underflow discharging into the HIG mill product pumpbox where it will join regrind cyclone overflow.

An automated HIG mill media addition system will be installed to regulate media feed into the HIG mill.  The new HIG mill will be installed with a VFD to control speed and allow for optimization.

HIG mill product will be pumped to a new Jameson cell, which will operate in a cleanerscalper duty.  The product from the Jameson cell will report to final concentrate, and tailings will be pumped to the existing cleaner circuit.  The existing cleaner circuit will operate with two stages of columns in series.  The first stage will use Cleaner Column 1. Column 1 concentrate will feed Cleaner Column 3.  Cleaner Column 3 concentrate will be combined with Jameson cell concentrate in the Jameson cell concentrate pumpbox prior  to  transport  to  the  upgrade  concentrate  dewatering  circuit.    Cleaner  Column  3 tailings will be pumped back to Cleaner Column 1.  Cleaner Column 1 tailings will be pumped to the existing cleaner scavenger flotation circuit.  Cleaner scavenger flotation concentrate will report to the HIG mill circuit for regrinding.  Cleaner scavenger tailings will discharge into the existing PAG trench where it will discharge via gravity to the PAG deposition zone in the TIA.

The existing primary regrind ball mill will no longer be used and will be demolished to make room for the Jameson cell.  The existing regrind Vertimill VTM1500 will be retained in  a  standby  capacity  for  the  Central  Case.    It  will  be  used  in  the  Upside  Case  for regrinding of HydroFloat concentrate.

Flowsheet simulations  indicated  that  there  will  be  sufficient  capacity  to  process  spot surges in head grades from the block cave, if required when compared against industry standards for copper column flotation of 2.5 t/hr/m 2  for copper cleaner column flotation.

Due to the increase in throughput and copper head grade with the block cave plant upgrade, concentrate production will increase significantly  compared with  block cave operations.    Therefore,  a  significant  increase  in  concentrate  dewatering  capacity  is

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

required, both thickening, storage tanks and filtration.  The final concentrate from the cleaning circuit will be split between two parallel concentrate thickeners; the first being the existing concentrate thickener and the second a new thickener of equivalent size installed as part of the block cave upgrade.  The new concentrate thickener is required to  accommodate the extra concentrate production resulting  from  the  increased  head grade and throughput.

Concentrate thickener underflow will be pumped to and split between two concentrate storage tanks of equal size; the first is the existing concentrate storage tank and the second will be a new tank installed for the block cave upgrade.  The storage tanks, which serve  as  a  buffer  between  the  flotation  operation  and  the  filters,  will  have  overall concentrate storage retention time of 24 hours.

Concentrate from the storage tanks will be split and pumped into one of two parallel, identical concentrate filters; one existing and one new.  The concentrate filters discharge concentrate  onto  conveyors  which  discharge  into  the  concentrate  shed.    Additional concentrate filtrate tanks and pumps will be required for the new filter.

The  concentrate  storage  shed  will  be  expanded  to  accommodate  the  additional concentrate production.

## 17.4.3 Process Flowsheet

The proposed process flowsheet for the Central Case is included as Figure 17-2.

The layout plan for the Central Case plant design is provided in Figure 17-3.

## 17.4.4 Design Criteria

The plant design criteria for the Central Case is provided in Table 17-1.

## 17.5 Upside Case Alternative

## 17.5.1 Background

The Upside Case for the block cave process plant upgrade was an extension of the Central Case, and assumed HydroFloat coarse particle flotation and an increase in grind size at a higher throughput rate.  The concept included:

- · In the single-stage SAG circuit the pebble crusher will be installed in the transfer building included in the Central Case;
- · The  discharge  and  screen  configurations  of  the  SAG  mills  and  hydrocyclone components will be modified to allow coarsening of grind size;
- · A HydroFloat circuit will be installed on rougher tailings after classification;
- · HydroFloat concentrate will be reground in a re-configured Vertimill VTM1500;

- · Reground HydroFloat concentrate will be upgraded in a new HydroFloat rougher flotation stage that will incorporate smaller StackCells, than the ones nominated for pre-roughing duty, and the HydroFloat rougher concentrate will be blended with the existing rougher concentrate streams to feed the cleaner flotation circuit.

The Upside Case assumes that the maximum permitted throughput can be increased, sufficient make-up water can be provided to sustain the higher production rate, and the economics of the expansion to the Upside Case can be confirmed to be favourable.

## 17.5.2 Plant Design

The descriptions for the Central Case provided in Section 17.4 generally apply to the Upside Case; however, the following changes are envisaged in the Upside Case.

Rougher tailings will flow by gravity to the sand cyclones.  The sand cyclone underflow will discharge via gravity to the HydroFloat circuit.  The sand cyclone overflow will go to the fines thickener for water recovery.  The HydroFloat tailings will meet sand quality requirements and report to the TIA for use in embankment construction at the north and south dams (see also Section 18.5 and Section 18.6).  The HydroFloat concentrate will be  dewatered  using  cyclones  to  control  density  and  volume  flow  in  the  subsequent regrind and flotation steps.  The cyclone overflow will primarily contain low value slimes and water and will enter into the fines thickener for water recovery.

For the Upside Case it is assumed that the full regrind needs of the rougher and cleaner scavenger concentrates will be met by a new HIG mill 5000 installation, which will be part  of  the  plant  upgrade.    This  will  free  up  the  existing  Vertimill  VTM1500  to  be redeployed for regrinding dewatered HydroFloat concentrate.

The VTM1500 product will go to a HydroFloat upgrade flotation circuit.  The HydroFloat upgrade flotation circuit will consist of StackCells to upgrade the HydroFloat concentrate. The HydroFloat circuit flotation tailings will flow by gravity to the existing NAG trench. The  HydroFloat  circuit  flotation  concentrate  will  be  pumped  to  the  HIG5000  for regrinding.  At this point, the HydroFloat circuit concentrate will enter into the existing cleaner circuit where it will be upgraded to the final concentrate.

## 17.5.3 Process Flowsheet

The process flowsheet envisaged for the Upside Case is included as Figure 17-4.

## 17.5.4 Design Criteria

The plant design criteria for the Upside Case is provided in Table 17-2.

## 17.6 Concentrate Shipping

Red Chris concentrate is filtered and temporarily stored in the Red Chris concentrate storage shed at the mine before being trucked to the Port of Stewart.  Concentrate is dumped from the side tipper tables into the warehouse for storage, handling, and loading via conveyor and spout into export vessels.  There are currently no seasonal payload restrictions on the route between the mine site and the port.

The  Red  Chris  Operations  have  had  a  Terminal  Services  Agreement  in  place  with Stewart Bulk Terminals since 2013.  The term of the agreement is for the LOM.

Stewart  Bulk  Terminals  is  a  privately-owned  facility  not  subject  to  underlying  lease agreements with  the  government  port  authorities,  and  is  the  most  commercially  and logistically suitable port for Red Chris concentrates.

The 2021 PFS assumes the current transport method and port will continue to be used.

## 17.7 Energy, Water, and Process Materials Requirements

## 17.7.1 Energy

Current and planned power and electrical requirements for the LOM plan are outlined in Section 18.11.

## 17.7.2 Water

The source of process water supply for the LOM plan is discussed in Section 18.6.

## 17.7.3 Process Consumables

Key processing reagents include collectors, frother, lime, and flocculant with other key materials being mill grinding media.  The reagents envisaged are similar for the Central and Upside Cases. The HydroFloat in the Upside Case will require a minor quantity of diesel collector.

The site  has  suitable  reagent  handling  and  storage  facilities  for  these  items,  with  all materials transported to site via road transport.  Modest increases in the capacity of the reagent systems will be required for the block cave project.

## 17.8 QP Comments on 'Item 17:  Recovery Methods'

The QP notes:

- · The most suitable option compatible with a major investment in a block cave mine was found to be the installation of a large single stage SAG mill, coupled with a new coarse ore stockpile, to allow an increase in throughput to 13.6 Mt/a in the Central Case option, which is within the currently permitted throughput limit;

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

- · The Central Case also requires additional rougher flotation capacity at the existing process plant using StackCell technology, an upgraded regrind circuit using HIGmill technology,  a  new  cleaner  scalping  Jameson  Cell,  and  duplication  of  existing concentrate thickening and filtration equipment.  The concentrate loadout will also be  expanded.    The  cleaner  flotation,  concentrate  dewatering  and  concentrate loadout upgrades are required due to the higher head grade of underground ore compared with open pit ore;
- · Throughput could be increased to 15 Mt/a by reconfiguring both the existing and new SAG mills to coarsen grind from 80% passing (p80) 150 µm to 200 µm and installing coarse particle flotation using HydroFloat technology.

## 18 PROJECT INFRASTRUCTURE

## 18.1 Introduction

Existing mine infrastructure includes:

- · Open pit;
- · One coarse ore stockpile and one low-grade stockpile;
- · One WRSF;
- · TIA;
- · North and the south reclaim dams;
- · Non-contact water diversion structures;
- · Overhead high voltage electric transmission line;
- · Process plant, process facilities; mine laboratory, offices;
- · Warehouse;
- · Potable water and sewage treatment plants;
- · Camp with kitchen and recreational facilities;
- · Administration office building;
- · Core storage facility;
- · Maintenance workshop and truck wash;
- · Medical and ambulance facilities;
- · Operations facility;
- · Fuel storage and distribution.

The  transition  to  block  cave  mining  and  associated  changes  to  processing  will  be supported by existing infrastructure as well as infrastructure upgrades.

Infrastructure upgrades that have recently been completed or are currently in progress for ongoing open pit operations, and will be integrated with the block cave project, are as follows:

- · New mobile equipment maintenance and workshop facility;
- · Pumping upgrade from the North Reclaim dam to the booster station;
- · Seepage mitigation modifications for the TIA;
- · New cyclone sand plants and tailings thickener for dewatering NAG tailings cyclone overflow;

- · Associated modifications to tailings pipelines for the cyclone sand plants, thickeners. and short term tailings deposition;
- · Dust cover for the existing coarse ore stockpile;
- · Kitchen and camp upgrades to support the existing open pit operation.

Newcrest plans to implement, or is already implementing, an early-works program in support of the block cave project; which incorporates the following components:

- · Exploration decline;
- · Water supply and storage;
- · Road access;
- · Power supply;
- · Short-term stockpile areas;
- · Buildings (administration, workshop, mine dry);
- · Batch plant;
- · Exploration decline dewatering system.

The main changes to surface infrastructure to support the block cave project include the following:

- · A significant increase in the power supply to site to 110 MVa;
- · Power supply and distribution (including 287 kV substation expansion, upgrades to existing 25 kV distribution system, and a new mine 25 kV substation);
- · An increase in the size of the TIA will be required to develop MB2 and MB3;
- · Increases in water supply to support higher ore processing rates in conjunction with additional tailings dewatering for water recovery and TIA changes to reduce seepage potential;
- · TIA seepage water return system;
- · Potable water and sewage services;
- · Communications systems;
- · Fuel storage and distribution;
- · Storm water management;
- · New operations accommodation complex;
- · New mine dry facility;
- · New site asset operations complex (SAOC) and administrative complex;
- · New shotcrete and concrete batch plant;

<!-- image -->

- · New diesel drop pipe facility on the surface distributing fuel to the underground fleet;
- · Temporary construction facilities, including laydown areas
- · Truck wash relocation.
- · New site roads to allow access to the WRSFs, conveyor portal, exploration access portal, ventilation shafts, reclaim dams at the TIA, tailings lines, TIA dams, and to runoff diversion ditches;
- · Increase in the volume of concentrate transport to the Port of Stewart that will require additional road maintenance and upgrades to roads and port facilities.

The new infrastructure requirements are summarized in Table 18-1.  A location plan that shows the locations of the existing and proposed infrastructure is provided in Figure 18-1.

## 18.2 Road and Logistics

## 18.2.1 Roads

The mine site is accessible by a 23 km sealed access road that connects with Highway 37 at Tatogga (mine site entrance off Highway 37).  Highway 37 connects to Dease Lake, 95 km by road to the north.  The mine security gate is at the junction of Highway 37 and the start of the site access road.  Internal roads within the mine site are gravel surface.

There will be new haul roads and site roads to allow access to the various locations, including the TIA, conveyor portal area, exploration portal, ventilation pads and reclaim dams at the TIA.  Service roads will also be constructed alongside pipelines and diversion ditches.

Existing roadways around the process plant will be modified and re-graded to suit the new facilities, with some of the existing roads requiring widening and resurfacing.

## 18.2.2 Logistics

Concentrate is transported 320 km from the mine south to the Stewart Bulk Terminals at the Port of Stewart.  Concentrate is stored in sheds at the bulk terminal until there is a sufficient stockpile to ship load.

The current philosophy of shipping concentrate through the Stewart Bulk Terminals will be maintained for the block cave project.

## 18.3 Stockpiles

Stockpiles are discussed in Section 16.2.6.

## 18.4 Waste Rock Storage Facilities

The WRSF is discussed in Section 16.2.7.

## 18.5 Tailings Storage Facilities

## 18.5.1 Existing Facility

The TIA is currently permitted for 302 Mt of tailings, the containment of which is provided by a single impoundment with natural topography, and the LOM design incorporates three dams, the North, South, and Northeast dams, to a final elevation of 1,180 m.

The North and South dams are operational, and raised using the centreline method as needed; the Northeast dam is planned for approximately Year 21 of the 2021 PEA mine plan (circa 2036).  The North and South dams have been in operation since February 2015 when deposition began in the North Valley impoundment.  Deposition in the South Valley impoundment began in July 2017.

The North and South dams are designed to be predominantly constructed using cyclone sands.  This is to minimize the requirements for borrow materials, which are in relatively limited supply.  Extraction of such borrow materials in quantities required for complete dam construction would cause significant environmental impacts and would dramatically increase dam construction costs.  The M-240 permit specifies that cyclone sands must meet NAG criteria (NPR &gt; 2) if used for dam construction.  The Northeast dam would be constructed predominantly using rockfill.

The current mine permit requires the segregation and separate deposition of NAG and PAG tailings.  PAG tailings consist of cleaner-scavenger tailings and sulphide scavenger concentrate  when  the  sulphide  scavenger  stage  is  in  operation.    PAG  tailings  are required to be separately disposed of in the TIA and maintained in a saturated area (this is a permit condition).  NAG tailings can either be deposited whole into the impoundment or cycloned to produce a cyclone sand product used for embankment construction.

Currently cyclone overflow is placed in sand cells, either on the upstream side of the North dam or along the northwestern shoreline of the TIA for recovery and placement on the North dam.  Generally, sands are not placed into the impoundment, although some sand  may  enter  the  impoundment  as  a  result  of  handling  practices.    NAG  cyclone overflow is deposited in the impoundment (currently from the South dam).

There are two water reclaim dams located downstream of the North and South dams, referred to as the North and South Reclaim dams, respectively.

## 18.5.2 Setting

The TIA is located at the eastern edge of the mine site in a north-south-trending valley that has a major northeast tributary.

To  the  north,  the  North  dam  and  North  Reclaim  dam  are  within  the  Quarry  Creek catchment; to the south, the South dam and South Reclaim dam are within the Trail

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Creek catchment.  Quarry Creek flows north towards the Klappan River and Trail Creek flows south towards Kluea Lake.

The Red Chris site is located within an area of low historical seismicity.  De-aggregation analysis performed by the Geological Survey of Canada shows that the peak ground acceleration hazard is primarily from two sources:

- · Crustal area sources within about 300 km of the site;
- · Plate boundary  sources  420-560  km  from  site  (e.g.  the  Queen  CharlotteFairweather, Transition and Denali faults).

The  mean  estimated  1:10,000  annual  exceedance  probability  (AEP)  ground  motion corresponds to a peak ground acceleration of 0.1 units of gravity and mean magnitude of 6.5.

Block-cave-induced  seismicity  has  not  been  considered  in  the  TIA  design.    A  2020 update of the seismic source model was completed by the National Research Council of Canada and is expected to be released in 2021.  Both the updated seismic source model and the block-cave-induced seismicity will be considered in the next design stage.

Geohazard risks in the TIA area include:

- · Two landslide features (approximately 0.1 m 3  each) on the east side of the TIA valley with head scarps located approximately 500 m east of the north reclaim dam;
- · A landslide complex (approximately 100 Mm 3  on the eastern side of Kluea Lake approximately 4 km south of the south reclaim dam;
- · The Kluea Lake Landslide Complex (KLLC), estimated to be approximately 400800 Mm 3 , along the western slope of Kluea Lake.

The slope assessments on east and west sides of the TIA did not appear to show any significant risk of large-scale slope instability.

## 18.5.3 Facility Expansion

## 18.5.3.1 Designs

Facility designs were prepared by BGC Engineering, the Engineer of Record for the TIA.

To support the proposed block cave operation (including development of MB2 and MB3), the TIA will be expanded to a capacity of about 550 Mt.  The design assumes raises on the north, south and northeast dams above that which is currently permitted, to a final elevation of 1,207 m.

As  the  North  and  South  dams  are  raised,  their  footprint  increases,  requiring  the decommissioning of the existing north and south reclaim dams.  The 2021 PFS assumes decommissioning of the existing north and south reclaim dams and associated seepage interception systems, and reconstruction of those facilities further downstream; construction  of  a  new  Northeast  Reclaim  dam  will  also  be  required.    Existing instrumentation and wells (monitoring and pumping) may need to be decommissioned

and new infrastructure installed.  Existing water diversion channels or sections of existing channels will be decommissioned and new channels built around the expanded TIA to route contact water into the TIA and non-contact water away from the TIA.

The  proposed  TIA  infrastructure  is  summarized  in  Table  18-2,  and  a  layout  map  is provided in Figure 18-2.

The water management structures within the TIA were designed based on their failure consequence classification and regulatory requirements.

Stability  analyses  of  the  dams  were  completed  using  SLOPE/W,  a  commercially available  limit  equilibrium  analysis  software  package.    The  2021  PFS  embankment designs meet Newcrest's requirements for factor of safety (FoS) for stability.  For the north and south dams, the target FoS will be achieved through shallower slopes on the embankments.  However, the shallower slopes will increase the volume of materials required to construct the dams.  The higher embankments and shallower slopes will cause the North and South dam toes to migrate further down their respective valleys.

Based on the results of the pseudo-static analysis and Bray and Macedo (2019), the probability of seismic displacement equal to or larger than 150 cm due to the occurrence of the 1-in-10,000 year seismic ground motions is &lt;1% for all dams.

The 2021 PFS design also assumes completion of two site improvement projects:

- · Installation of a new cyclone sand plant treating NAG tailings;
- · Installation of a new tailings thickener to process NAG cyclone overflow.

It is proposed to locate the cyclone sands plant and tailings thickener between the mill location  on  the  Todagin  plateau  and  the  TIA  valley,  and  construction  completion  is forecast for 2023.

Evaluations of greater TIA capacities were reviewed in the 2021 PFS, to 620 Mt and 800 Mt, and found to be conceptually achievable.

## 18.5.3.2 Closure Considerations

The closure configuration for the TIA included in the 2021 PFS is aligned with current permit conditions.  A minimum 2 m water cover will be required over the PAG tailings zone  and  a  closure  spillway  will  be  constructed  at  the  northeast  dam.    Careful management of PAG tailings deposition will be required in the later part of the operation to ensure  that  the  water  cover  requirements  can  be  met.    Alternative  closure configurations will be investigated in future more detailed studies.

## 18.5.4 Tailings Deposition Plan and Dam Raise Schedule

Deposition modelling was completed using commercially-available Muk3D software and a five-year time increment.  Modelling was aligned with design basis assumptions for tailings and sand  production, beach  slopes, deposition density, and maximum operational pond volume.

| North dam                                     | Zoned earthfill and cyclone sand embankment constructed using the centre line construction  method. This Includes a 3 m thick chimney filter, which is designed to mitigate internal erosion  and provide drainage.  A minimum 100 m long upstream tailings beach is required.  Underdrainage is provided by a coarse aggregate drainage layer between a sand and gravel  filter                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| South dam                                     | Zoned earthfill and cyclone sand embankment constructed using the centre line construction  method.  The dam does not contain a core; therefore, the operating pond must be maintained  at least 300 m upstream of the crest.  A linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) liner was built  up to El.1,118m on the upstream face of the dam and valley sides, extending 300m upstream  from the upstream toe of the starter dam to limit seepage losses during initial filling.  Designed  with an underdrainage system, consisting of a coarse aggregate drainage blanket and a sand  and gravel filter.                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Northeast dam                                 | Zoned earthfill embankment constructed using the centre line construction method.  Will have a  vertical compacted till core, filters, and an underdrainage system, as well as upstream and  downstream rockfill support.  A series of three 3 m wide chimney filters (fine filter, coarse filter,  and transition filter) to be located directly downstream of the till core are designed to retain the  core materials and provide drainage for seepage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| North, South  and Northeast  Reclaim dams     | Located downstream of each tailings dam to collect impacted surface water, seepage exiting  the underdrains, and seepage intercepted by the seepage interception system.  Will be  approximately 3-7m in height, and sized to contain the environmental design flood (spring 200- year, 24-hour rainfall and snowmelt) and pass the reclaim inflow design flood (200-year, 30- day rainfall and snowmelt) through a spillway.  It is assumed that the new reclaim dams will be  constructed near the end of the permitted LOM (approximately 2040-2043).                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| East, west, and  northwest  diversion ditches | The east diversion ditch will divert non-contact water from the south side of the Northeast  Valley and the east side of the South Valley to the lower reaches of Trail Creek, which  ultimately discharges to Kluea Lake.  The ditch is designed to reduce the volume of non- contact water flowing to the TIA and to augment the flow in lower Trail Creek.  The west diversion ditch will divert contact water from Thurston's Trickle and the west side of  the South Valley and convey it to the TIA.  The northwest diversion ditch will divert non-contact water from the west side of the North  Valley to Camp Creek to reduce the volume of non-contact water flowing to the TIA.  All ditches are sized for peak flows resulting from the 200-year, 24-hour storm event. |

The pond was assumed to be migrated to a central location between the south and north dams prior to 2030 (a mid-way location was assumed for 2025).  The model was iterated to  target  a  central  pond  so  that  the  PAG  cleaner  tailings  remain  saturated  during operations and under a 2 m water cover at the end of LOM for closure.

A  dam  raise  schedule  and  cyclone  sands  material  balance  was  developed.    The cumulative cyclone sand requirements (North and South dams) hit an inflection point around 2041.  This reflects the flattening of the North dam slope as it is raised beyond the  current  permitted  level,  and  the  increased  sand  quantities  required  for  further incremental  raises.    An  inventory  of  sand  must  be  built  up  before  2041  to  provide sufficient material to build the final embankment heights.

## 18.5.5 Tailings Pipelines and Pumping

The current TIA has tailings pipelines to the following locations:

- · NAG tailings pipeline from the NAG tailings trench at the process plant to the existing cyclone sand plant;
- · NAG tailings bypass line from adjacent to the existing cyclone sand plant to the deposition point 300 m downstream of the South dam;
- · Sand line from the cyclone sand plant to the sand cells on the upstream face of the North dam;
- · Dedicated PAG tailings pipeline from the PAG tailings trench at the process plant to the deposition location near the centre of the TIA, where it can remain saturated.

Due to the significant elevation drop between the process plant and the existing cyclone sand plant, choke stations are installed on the NAG tailings pipeline to control pressure and flow.

As operations and tailings deposition continue, the height of the impoundment rises, which  will  eventually  submerge  several  of  the  current  tailings  pipeline  alignments, Newcrest has plans in place for modifications to the tailings piping, including:

- · Connection  of  the  NAG  tailings  pipeline  from  the  NAG  tailings  trench  to  a  new cyclone sand plant that will be located adjacent to the new tailings thickener;
- · Deposition of the NAG cyclone overflow from the North dam for beach formation; this is anticipated to start in late 2022 when the tailings thickener is installed a new pipeline from the tailings thickener to the North dam will be required;
- · A new smaller diameter pipeline from the thickener underflow to the  South  dam (smaller diameter is required due to the increased % solids and reduction in flow after thickening);
- · New sand lines from the new cyclone sand plant to the North dam and from the new cyclone sand plant to the South dam.

In the longer term, a pipeline extension is also needed for the thickened NAG cyclone overflow from the South dam to the Northeast dam.  Booster pumps will be required to

convey tailings approximately 4 km up the Northeast Valley.  The estimated pumping power required is 1,300 kW, and the pipeline must be fully functioning by 2035.

## 18.6 Water Supply

## 18.6.1 Process Water Supply

The main source of water for the process plant is reclaim from the main pond at the TIA and, when constructed, will be from the planned thickener and cyclone sand plant.  Other sources  include  seepage  recovery  from  the  north  and  south  reclaim  seepage  ponds formed by the North Reclaim dam and South Reclaim dam, respectively.  Groundwater pumping from the deep aquifer is the main source of makeup water when needed to meet process water demands.

The block cave project assumes the construction of the thickener and cyclone sand plant, and that the existing reclaim barge and booster station are adequate for the LOM.

A  portion  of  the  water  from  the  process  water  tank  will  be  used  in  the  grinding  and flotation circuits and the remaining water will be filtered using a screen filter package. Filtered water will be distributed to facilities around the site as utility water and will feed a fire water module for the process plant.

## 18.6.2 TIA

The TIA will be the main water management reservoir for the Red Chris Operations. Inputs to the TIA will include water from the tailings, runoff from the TIA catchment area, direct precipitation, and pump-back from the reclaim dams.  Collected water from the pit and WRSFs, including the low-grade ore stockpile, will be initially routed through the mill for process use before reporting to the TIA with the tailings.  Diversion ditches around the TIA will divert non-contact runoff water to the north and south of the TIA as much as practicable.

## 18.6.3 Reclaim Dams

The North and South Reclaim dams, located downstream of the main TIA dams, form ponds that collect runoff and groundwater seepage that reports to surface from the TIA. The reclaim ponds also serve as temporary reservoirs for groundwater pumped from the north and south valley TIA groundwater wells and from the south seepage interception system.  Water collected in the reclaim ponds is currently pumped to the TIA, before being pumped to the process plant via the main reclaim pumping system, resulting in fresh make-up water from the deep aquifers being mixed with the general TIA reclaim water.

An on-site project is currently underway to modify this system to allow the water collected in the north reclaim pond to be pumped directly back to the filtered/fire water tank as clean make-up water.  The same is planned for the south reclaim pond with water first pumped  to  the  exploration  portal  for  utility  water  and  any  excess  pumped  to  the filtered/fire water tank at the plant.

<!-- image -->

Water from the north wells and North Reclaim dam may be used as process water for the underground block cave project.

## 18.6.4 Potable Water

There are three existing potable water systems in operation at Red Chris:

- · Existing camp plus temporary expansion;
- · Core storage facility, assay laboratory, administration;
- · Heavy duty truckshop and warehouse.

Raw water is sourced from three groundwater wells, and treated through potable water treatment plants.

## 18.6.5 Water-Related Infrastructure

Water-related  infrastructure  for  the  Project  includes:    dewatering  of  the  underground mine back to the existing process water tank at the process plant; assessment of the site-wide upgrades associated with the block cave project including the tailings pond and the reclaim water system upgrades; and determining the impact and updating the water supply and distribution system as required.

The North and South Reclaim dams at the TIA will be relocated and will require new pumping systems to transfer water to the process plant for re-use.

As part of the ongoing development of the open pit, Camp Creek will need to be diverted for about 700 m of its length around the southeastern side of the open pit to allow for the construction of a haul road.  To address the potential zone of influence resulting from subsidence associated with the block cave project, Camp Creek will need to be diverted from a point further upstream for another 500 m.  The ditch will be cut into the hillside, lined with riprap for erosion control, and will incorporate a service road for maintenance and servicing.

The infrastructure design includes new potable water and sewage treatment plants for the new accommodations and administration complexes, together with new groundwater wells and new water supply pipelines to ensure sufficient water supply.

Fire water and potable water will be supplied from a new potable water/fire water tank to the decline conveyor, exploration decline, and mine drys.

Drinking water will be supplied to the underground mine in the form of bottled water.

## 18.7 Water Management

Non-contact storm water runoff will be directed away from the TIA by the east diversion ditch (to Trail Creek) and northwest diversion ditch (from the Beaver Creek watershed to Quarry Creek).

Contact storm water runoff will report to the TIA via the west diversion ditch.  No settling or sediment control will be required prior to discharge, and there will be no storm water

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

treatment or management infrastructure at the site for storm water runoff.  Diversion ditches in the area around the new administrative and accommodations complexes will be designed for erosion control.

Dewatering flow from the open pit and storm water runoff from the WRSFs are directed to a local sump from where the water is pumped to the process plant for use in operations before reporting to the TIA as part of the tailings.

The  2021  PFS  design  allows  for  storing  an  operational  inflow  design  flood  (IDF)  of 11.5 Mm 3  while maintaining a 2 m freeboard. The IDF was derived from the estimated runoff from the 10-day probable maximum precipitation event coincident with the 1-in100 annual exceedance probability 10-day snowmelt.  The closure spillway is designed to  safely  route  the  closure  IDF,  which  is  based  on  runoff  from  the  24-hr  probable maximum  precipitation  event  with  a  1-in-100  AEP  annual  exceedance  probability snowmelt.

Excess impoundment water suitable for direct discharge will be pumped from the reclaim barge via a pipeline along the western flank of the TSF valley beyond the North dam and reclaim dam and allow discharge into the Quarry Creek system.

## 18.8 Buildings and Laydown Infrastructure

A  new  administrative  complex,  combining  the  SAOC  and  administrative  offices,  is planned.  The SAOC will have dedicated operations rooms to manage and monitor the open pit, underground block cave development and operations, crushing and conveying systems,  milling  and  process  operations,  TIA  operations,  and  energy  and  water management facilities.  It will also include central meeting/multi-functional coordination rooms.

A mine dry facilities capable of accommodating 500 miners will be constructed near the service portal to support mining operations.  The overall facility will include a centrallylocated common area that will accommodate the shifters' offices, lamp room, dispatch room, and additional mine rescue space to augment the existing mine rescue building that will be provided for the early works phase.

There is a general laydown area designated for the Project that will be shared between other projects and contractors working on the Red Chris site.  The design allows for laydown areas that will accommodate materials and equipment for construction.  If space is  not  available  for  modules,  there  is  potential  for  modules  to  be  stored  off  site  and transported to site when required.

## 18.9 Camps and Accommodation

The current accommodation camp has a an approximate 800-person capacity, and an estimated remaining usage life of up to 10 years.

An  additional  400  to  600  beds  will  be  needed  to  support  the  construction  and development phases of the Project as envisaged in the 2021 PFS.  Therefore, it was decided to build a new facility for the operations staff and the existing camp will be used

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

for construction and decommissioned when no longer needed.  The 2021 PFS located the facility in an undisturbed area to the south of the existing camp.

The operations accommodation complex is designed with an approximate capacity of 600 beds with the possibility to expand to 800 beds in the future.  Common dining and recreation  facilities  will  be  designed  for  800  personnel.    The  complex  will  include dormitories, kitchen, dining room, gymnasium, games room, weight room and lounge.

## 18.10 Shotcrete/Concrete Supply

A modularized (semi-mobile) shotcrete/concrete batch plant will be constructed above the block cave footprint just outside the limits of the open pit and any subsidence potential from the block caving operations.  The plant will have a 45 m 3 /hr capacity and will deliver shotcrete  and  concrete  underground  via  a  slickline  through  vertical  boreholes  and transmixers.  Three cement silos (totalling 155 m 3  capacity) will be installed to store approximately seven days of underground requirements.

## 18.11 Power and Electrical

## 18.11.1  Existing Supply

Power  to  the  Red  Chris  Operations  is  provided  by  BC  Hydro  via  the  Northwest Transmission Line, which is a single 287 kV alternating current overhead high voltage electric  transmission  line  from  the  Skeena  Substation,  south  of  Terrace,  to  the  mine 287 kV substation.  The current contract with BC Hydro sets the authorized demand at 55 MVA at a 0.95 power factor or better, and current site demand typically fluctuates around 48 MVA.

At the 287 kV substation, two parallel 60/80/100 MVA transformers step the voltage down to 25 kV.  These transformers currently operate in parallel to supply the site.  The 25 kV power is reticulated around the site using cables or overhead lines, and the voltage is stepped down locally to 4.16 kV or 600 V, depending on the load requirements.

Emergency power requirements for critical systems are provided by two 1.27 MW diesel generators for the operations areas, and one 500 kW diesel generator for the camp.

## 18.11.2  2021 PFS Requirements

The preliminary load list indicates the total site load requirements to support the block cave project will increase from 45 MW to 100 MW.  It is envisaged that this increase will be accommodated by an extension to the existing power supply contract.

The existing 287 kV substation will be increased in capacity with the addition of a third 287  kV/25  kV  transformer  to  accommodate  the  load  increase  and  to  avoid  a  loadshedding scenario.  The substation yard will be expanded to accommodate the additional equipment.

A new mine substation dedicated to the underground area will be installed and located on  the  conveyor  portal  pad  adjacent  to  the  underground  conveyor  system.    The

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

substation will be fed by a dedicated 30 MVA line from the main switchyard.  A second line will be run from the substation to feed the planned ventilation fans.

Back-up power in the form of two 1.2 MW diesel generators were included at the mine substation at the conveyor portal to provide emergency power to ventilation and mine dewatering loads.

## 18.12 Fuel

The  existing  diesel  fuel  and  propane  infrastructure  will  be  used  for  contractor  and ongoing fuelling needs.  A new diesel fuel depot and propane tanks will be located near the ventilation raises to service underground needs.  Diesel will be supplied via a lined borehole to the underground diesel receiving station.  Propane will be used to heat the fresh air for the underground ventilation system.

## 18.13 Air Supply

Compressed air will be provided via a centralized, dedicated duty/standby arrangement of air compressors and dryer located on surface near the conveyor portal.

## 18.14 Communications

Communications to the site (terrestrial communications) are provided by NorthwesTel via a microwave link.  The existing site communication networks use a fibre network connected  in  an  ad  hoc  star  network.    The  open  pit  wireless  network  provides communications to the mobile equipment fleet using the MineStar system.

The  underground  communications  infrastructure will be designed  so that fixed equipment, people, and mobile equipment, and monitoring devices in all working areas have access to communications.

The intent of the operational technology network is to ensure that the communications technology and deployment underground provide the coverage, high bandwidth, speed, availability, and redundancy to support the required data communications.

## 18.15 QP Comments on 'Item 18:  Project Infrastructure'

The QP notes:

- · The Red Chris site is a brownfields site, and has infrastructure in place to support current open pit operations;
- · The transition to block cave mining and associated changes to processing will be supported by existing infrastructure as well as infrastructure upgrades as identified.

## 19 MARKET STUDIES AND CONTRACTS

## 19.1 Market Studies

An evaluation of the copper concentrate market was undertaken as part of the 2021 PFS.

The Red Chris Operations' current market for the open pit concentrate is Asia (primarily China) due to China's comparative advantage i.e., nil or low penalties imposed on the elevated mercury and antimony, and lower transportation cost compared to Europe.

An ongoing dialogue is maintained with smelters globally regarding their interest in the Red Chris Operations' concentrate.  For the reasons mentioned above, the strongest demand will remain to be from Chinese smelters, though counterparty evaluation needs to be carefully considered.

## 19.1.1 Introduction

The  majority  of  the  world's  copper  concentrate  production  is  processed  through pyrometallurgical processes in copper smelters and refineries around the world.  There is a variety of primary smelting technologies, with recent advances meaning lower copper grades and higher impurity levels can be treated, maintaining high metal recoveries.

The majority of mined copper (about 85%), reaches the market as concentrate, with most of the balance  in solvent extraction/electro-winning (SX/EW)  cathodes.    In  the concentrate market, there is a list of undesirable elements that are a hindrance to the smelting and refining process.  These elements impact in two ways: by complicating technical processing and requiring control or removal in-process; or, by contaminating waste streams resulting in problems with disposal of waste products.  This results in additional costs for the buyer (smelter).  As a result, the smelter/refinery will try to recoup the cost from the seller through the application of a penalty charge.  The list of these elements includes arsenic, antimony, bismuth, mercury, fluorine, chlorine, and lead.  This list has  been  growing  in  recent  years  due  to  increased  vigilance  by  Chinese environmental  authorities.    As  a  result,  China  has  set  maximum  impurity  levels  in concentrates which can be imported into the country, the world's largest smelting market.

Mines producing concentrate and smelters smelting concentrate and refining the smelter product (anode) can be categorized as 'integrated' or 'custom'. Integrated mines/smelters produce concentrate from their own mines for feed to their own smelters. Custom  producers  buy  or  sell  concentrate  on  the  open  market.    Some  integrated producers buy or sell concentrate on the market from time to time to supplement smelter feed  or to offload excess  mine  production.    The  custom  market  accounts  for approximately 60% of global copper.  Of that custom market, about 70% is sold directly to smelters and around 30% to traders.

Annual global copper mine production is estimated to reach 22 Mt in CY21.  Of the total primary production, about 18.6 Mt will be in the form of concentrate.

Due to the Chinese restrictions on quality and increased mine production of materials with elevated impurities, there has been an increase in concentrate blending facilities run

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

as  commercial  operations  by  some  trading  companies.    This  increase  in  blending operations could result in an incremental increase of the traders' share of the global custom concentrate market.

Wood Mackenzie forecasts that the copper consumption trend will be robust out to 2040 (Wood Mackenzie, 2021).  To feed the growing demand for refined product, smelters have undertaken, or plan to undertake, brownfield and greenfield expansions.  This is particularly  noticeable  in  China  up  to  2026.    By  association  smelters  will  demand increased primary raw material (concentrate) from mines. Wood Mackenzie (2021) has assessed  a  base  case  projection  of  copper  in  concentrate  mine  supply.  Before  a disruption allowance, copper in concentrate mine supply from existing operations and committed projects is forecast to peak in 2024.  Thereafter, base case output will start to decline due to grade attrition and reserve depletion falling to 13.9 Mt by 2040 (Wood Mackenzie, 2021). It follows that additional mine projects will need to come on stream to meet smelter demand, and copper prices will need to be sufficiently high to stimulate this new mine development.

China dominates global copper and copper concentrate demand.  Chinese demand for custom concentrate now accounts for ~50% of global demand.  Chinese Customs has strict regulations in place for the specification limits for certain elements that could cause environmental and occupational health problems in smelting and refining.  Concentrates exceeding these levels cannot be imported into the country.  Copper concentrates have such limits for the following impurities: arsenic, cadmium, fluorine, lead and mercury. Red Chris  concentrate  had  exclusively  been  delivered  to  the  Chinese  market  at  the Report  effective  date.    It  is  likely  that  Chinese  demand  for  the  product  will  remain consistent  provided  impurity  levels  do  not  breach  Customs  import  maximum  levels. Other smelter markets in Asia may be applicable to Red Chris concentrates and such opportunities will be reviewed.

The additional concentrate tonnage that will be produced from the block cave project will either be added to existing contracts (those contracts will be expanded) or sold to new smelters customers in Asia or Europe with whom direct communication already takes place.  It is not expected that Newcrest will need to pay a premium for market access.

## 19.1.2 Concentrate Production Forecast

The estimate for total concentrate production is about 6.4 Mdmt over the period FY25FY57  or  at  an  annual  average  rate  of  approximately  184,000  dmt.    Concentrate production will peak at about 304,000 dmt in FY31.

The grade of copper in the concentrate is estimated to be 23-28% Cu.  The average grade over the LOM is forecast at approximately 24.4% Cu.  Gold in  concentrate is expected to increase compared to the concentrate produced from the open pit, ranging from 14.4-44.8 g/t Au.  The anticipated average LOM grade is about 23.8 g/t Au.

Although most custom smelters once sought to feed concentrate at 28-33% Cu on a blended basis, declining grades from major mines have forced them to accept lower concentrate grades.  There are two main reasons that concentrate grades have fallen:

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

- · Changes in mineralogy, increased impurities and declining ore grades at mines;
- · Increases  in  copper  smelting  capacity  in  China,  which  has  changed  the  supplydemand balance between mines and smelters, reducing treatment charges, and therefore lowering the incentives for mines to produce high-grade concentrates.

At an average forecast LOM concentrate grade of 24.4% Cu, the Red Chris concentrate is  slightly  below  premium  concentrate  grades,  but  is  still  expected  to  attract  market interest.

## 19.1.3 Smelter Terms

Mines typically enter into one or more of the following types of contracts:

- · Tier 1 Long-term (or frame) contracts between mines and smelters;
- · Tier 2 Long-term (or frame) contracts between mines and traders;
- · Tier 3 The spot market (via traders).

The duration of a direct mine to smelter contract will be at least two years.  Contracts may be rolled over automatically for an agreed period of time if neither party objects, provided it complies with the prevailing Delegation of Authority.  Mine to trader contracts generally will not exceed two years.

Spot contracts may cover direct business between mines and smelters, and contracts between mines and traders.

Most long-term contracts specify a fixed annual sales tonnage or tonnage range over multiple years.  Most mines place the majority of their production with smelters under long-term contracts but reserve a proportion for merchant spot and merchant long-term sales.

In establishing long-term off-take contracts directly with Chinese smelters, mines must recognize credit risk (on payments), counterparty risks (on long-term ability to accept concentrate as per contract terms), and weight and assay risks (measurement) for some of the ports.  Currently, there is an increased geopolitical risk as seen by the Chinese government's blocking of Australian copper concentrate and other goods.  Although this Chinese risk can be largely mitigated through a variety of mechanisms and procedures, the risk remains greater than those associated with competing in established markets in Japan, Korea and Europe.

Credit, performance, and measurement risks are similar for sales to India as summarized for China.

## 19.1.4 Copper Payment Terms

The current typical copper payable by a smelter is 96.5%, subject to a 1.0 unit deduction (minimum) for a copper content of 20-30% Cu.  At levels &gt;30-33% Cu, smelters may agree to a higher copper payable rate.  However, some smelters have also sought a higher  unit  deduction  for  concentrate  where  the  copper  grade  is  &lt;24%  Cu.    Some

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

smelters are seeking to impose an additional copper unit deduction of 0.05-0.10 units on concentrates that have grades of 20-22% Cu.

## 19.1.4.1 Copper Treatment and Copper Refining Charges

For  standard-grade  copper  concentrates  (generally  regarded  as  25-35%  Cu),  direct mine-smelter annual benchmark copper treatment charges over the past 10 years have varied from US$56-US$107/dmt of concentrate, with refining charges from US$0.056US$0.107/lb of payable copper.  These terms are for long-term frame contracts between major producers and Asian smelters, and are agreed on an annual calendar year basis.

For higher-grade copper concentrates, smelters may also seek higher treatment charges from producers when the market is in the favour of the smelters to partially compensate the smelters for lower revenue received from the higher-grade producers in terms of ¢/lb Cu.  Lower-grade concentrate (e.g., in the range of 22-24% Cu) may pay a series of penalties; especially for new entrants in a surplus market.

## 19.1.4.2 Copper Concentrate Precious Metal Terms and Refining Charges

The gold payable scale in a sales contract may vary from smelter to smelter.    A typical payability  scale  is  shown  in  Table  19-1.    European  smelters  demand  a  minimum deduction for   gold in the application of the scale.

In Asian markets, silver is paid at 90% of the analytical silver content subject to such content  being  higher  than  30 g/t  and  no  payment  is  made  below  30 g/t.    European smelters typically exact a deduction on the silver content.

## 19.1.4.3 Deleterious Elements

Schedules for most deleterious elements are well established in the market.  Typical penalties for deleterious elements are shown in Table 19-2 (Wood Mackenzie, 2021).

As some smelters will be more sensitive to certain elements, those smelters may demand more punitive charges or will set a firm ceiling for those elements in their contracts.  From a commercial perspective, smelters will sometimes seek an income stream from penalties, even when those elements may not contribute to an overall deleterious impact on their processes.

From time to time, smelters may attempt to introduce a new penalty element or seek a favourable  variation  to  the  penalty  structure  for  a  specific  element,  without  a  sound technical basis.  Some penalty elements, such as arsenic, do not present any technical challenge to smelters, but do contribute to emission and waste disposal costs.

Smelters will typically seek to source up to a specific annual limit of arsenic, to ensure penalty revenue is maximised, without incurring fines or additional disposal costs.  As at the  Report  effective  date,  smelters  were  currently  claiming  heightened  sensitivity  to mercury and antimony.

## 19.1.4.4 Payment Terms

Payment  terms  with  Asian  smelters  generally  allow  for  90%  payment  against  a provisional invoice after a period of time (following the carrying vessel's arrival at the port of discharge) ranging from three business days to 15 calendar days.

Credit management between major miners and Japanese smelters generally allow for open  account  payment.    Sales  to  Chinese,  Korean,  and  Indian  smelters  are  almost always covered by letters of credit.

Sales to traders often includes access to a 100% pre-payment by the trader to the miner, with an interest component at an agreed rate for the early payment.

## 19.1.4.5 Red Chris Concentrate Specification

There  will  be  a  change  to  the  existing  product  specification  from  the  open  pit specifications, resulting from the Red Chris underground operation as summarized in Table 19-3.

The concentrate produced from Red Chris underground ores is expected to be more favourable for customers because:

- · Mineralogy of underground ore allows for an increase in copper concentrate grade due  to  the  presence  of  enriched  copper  minerals  and  lower  pyrite  content  in underground ores relative to the open pit;
- · Gold grades in concentrate are higher due to an increase gold head grades
- · Silver grades in concentrate are higher due to an increase silver head grades
- · Slightly lower mercury levels in concentrates

All  these  aspects  make  the  underground  concentrate  more  attractive  than  open  pit concentrates, which have nevertheless been successfully marketed since the start of operations at Red Chris in 2015.

## 19.2 Commodity Price Projections

Metal price assumptions were provided by Newcrest management.  Newcrest considers analyst and broker price predictions, and price projections used by peers as inputs when preparing the management pricing forecasts.

The metal price and exchange rate assumptions used are included in Table 19-4.

## 19.3 Contracts

Contracts are in place in support of the open pit mining and processing operations and include  mill consumables,  power,  explosives,  transportation,  and  camp  facilities. Contracts  are  also  in  place  with  equipment  vendors,  drilling  contractors,  and  for concentrate loading and storage.

Table: 19-3: Anticipated Product Specification Changes

| Product   | Unit   | Open Pit  (approximate range)   | Underground  (approximate range)   |
|-----------|--------|---------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Cu        | %      | 22-25                           | 23-28                              |

|               | Units   | FY22   | FY23   | FY24   | FY25   | FY26+   |
|---------------|---------|--------|--------|--------|--------|---------|
| Gold price    | US$/oz  | 1,750  | 1,700  | 1,550  | 1,500  | 1,500   |
| Copper price  | US$/lb  | 3.75   | 3.50   | 3.30   | 3.30   | 3.30    |
| Exchange rate | C$:US$  | 0.80   | 0.80   | 0.80   | 0.80   | 0.80    |

Contracts that are likely to be concluded in support of the block cave underground project include decline development, pipelines, conveyors, camp construction, port and roads. Major contracts in support of operations are likely to include:  accommodations camp management,  building  maintenance,  underground  mine  infrastructure  development, cave establishment, road maintenance, explosives supply, ground support and consumables  supply,  material  transport  and  logistics  to  the  preferred  port  site, infrastructure engineering procurement and construction management, labour training, and infrastructure construction.

Current contracts are typically reviewed and negotiated on a frequent basis.  Contract awarding is in accordance to the procurement standard and a delegation of authority process.    Based  on  Newcrest's  knowledge,  the  contract  terms  are  typical  of  similar contracts  both  regionally  and  nationally.    It  is  expected  that  future  contracts  will  be awarded and negotiated in a similar manner to contracts that are currently in place.

## 19.4 QP Comments on 'Item 19:  Market Studies and Contracts'

The QP notes:

- · Market studies were conducted.  The LOM Red Chris copper concentrate from the underground  operations  is  expected  to  be  relatively  high  in  copper  and  low  in impurities, and be saleable.  Copper grades in the copper concentrate are expected to increase by a modest amount when the underground mine comes into production;
- · Forecast payability and deduction assumptions appear reasonable;
- · As additional tonnage at Red Chris is produced from the block cave project, it will either be added to existing contracts (those contracts will be expanded) or sold to

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

new smelters customers in Asia or Europe with whom direct communication already takes place.  It is not expected that Newcrest will need to pay a premium for market access;

- · The  terms  contained  within  any  future  concentrate  sales  contracts  would  be expected to be typical of and consistent with regional and international standard industry practice;
- · No concentrate sales contracts are currently in place in support of the proposed block cave project.  Contracts will be negotiated and renewed as needed.  Contract terms are expected to be within industry norms;
- · Newcrest considers analyst and broker price predictions, and price projections used by peers as inputs when preparing the management pricing forecasts.

The QP is of the opinion that the marketing and commodity price information is suitable to be used in the cash flow evaluations supporting Mineral Reserve estimates.

## 20 ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES, PERMITTING, AND SOCIAL OR COMMUNITY IMPACT

## 20.1 Introduction

Extensive  environmental  baseline  data  collection  and  monitoring  of  the  area  has occurred since 2003.  Site-specific baseline studies were completed to support the 2004 Environmental  Assessment  Application  and  subsequent  2010  Joint Mines  Act and Environmental  Act Permit  Application,  as  well  as  associated  addendums  to  permit applications.

Following receipt of the EA certificate (M05-02), Mines Act (MA) permit (M-240), and Environmental Management Act (EMA) permit (105017), approvals for mine construction commencement  (2012)  and  operational  authorization  (June  2015),  the  Red  Chris Operations have continued to collect comprehensive environmental monitoring data to support effective environmental management.

Newcrest's primary environmental permits and authorizations include:

- · Environmental Assessment Act EA certificate M05-02;
- · Mines Act Permit M-240;
- · Environmental  Management  Act Permit  105017  (effluent  discharge)  and  Permit 100669 (air emissions);
- · Fisheries  Act , Metal  and  Diamond  Mine  Effluent  Regulation;  monitoring  and reporting requirements;
- · Restated and Amended  2019 Impact Benefit Co-Management Agreement; environmental  co-management  and  communication  commitments  to  the  Tahltan Nation.

## 20.2 Baseline and Supporting Studies

An environmental risk assessment and a gap analysis were performed during the 2021 PFS for the inherent (uncontrolled) risks and the current (residual) risks remaining, in terms  of  likelihood  and  consequence,  assuming  the  implementation  of  controls  and mitigation.  The  gap  analysis  identified  several  areas  requiring  additional  baseline characterisation work, such as hydrogeology, aquatic resources and fisheries.

Subsequent  2021  PFS  baseline  studies  leveraged  a  wealth  of  data  from  previous baseline studies, dating back as early as 2003, including:  dust; potential visual impacts; social and communities; air quality; meteorology; groundwater and surface water quality and  quantity;  hydrogeology;  aquatic  resources  and  fisheries;  terrestrial  ecosystems including vegetation and wildlife; and cultural heritage/archaeological studies.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Additional baseline characterization work is underway to address gaps identified, above, and additional information is planned to be collected in the areas of dust, noise, and air quality  to  assess  the  impacts  of  potential  incremental  Project  increases.    Further archaeological  assessment  will  be  carried  out  and  the  social  baseline  assessment expanded.

Closure  studies  for  the  2021  PFS  leveraged  previous  studies  on  land  use  and reclamation of the Red Chris site, and focused on establishing a holistic closure and reclamation plan to integrate with the existing closure plan for the open pit operation. More work is planned in subsequent study phase to further reduce risks associated with long-term water (quantity and quality) and metals leach/acid rock drainage management post-closure,  and  will  incorporate  social  aspects  of  closure  planning  and  input  from Tahltan engagement.

## 20.3 Environmental Considerations/Monitoring Programs

There  is  an  environmental  management  system  (EMS)  in  place  for  the  open  pit operations, which includes associated plans, procedures, policies, guidelines, auditing, and compliance.

The EMS and environmental management plans (EMPs) were developed based on an adaptive management strategy that requires periodical reviews of the EMPs, mitigation measures,  and  efficacies,  to  determine  whether  the  regulatory  requirements  and environmental commitments are being met.  This adaptive management strategy has undergone extensive regulatory and stakeholder consultation as an important component of an effective EMS.

Monitoring  plans,  which  are  developed  in  consultation  with  regulatory  and  Tahltan Environmental Oversight Committee input through the Red Chris Monitoring Committee, include  detailed  individual  monitoring  components  and  are  linked  to  a  monitoring  or trigger response program.  Response plans, and associated implementation processes, monitor for unpredicted environmental changes or exceedances of the environmental quality standards and describe the corrective actions or processes that are appropriate for each environmental change or exceedance.

An environmental planner is used on site to schedule the timing of requirements and commitments  relating  to the operations and  includes environmental  monitoring, reporting,  audits,  inspections,  reviews,  tasks,  and  training.    The  planner  is  regularly updated and managed by the Environmental Department and used as a planning tool to ensure compliance.

Environmental  incidents  are  reported  in  accordance  with  regulatory  and  internal requirements.    The  operations  investigate  reported  incidents  in  a  timely  manner  to identify and  implement  appropriate  preventive  and  remediation  measures;  these investigations consider the actual and the potential outcome of an incident.

Responsibilities and accountabilities for the provision of environmental management are assigned  to  all  personnel  throughout  the  operations  by  means  of  EMPs,  standard operating procedures, and position descriptions.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

The EMS and EMPs will be updated to incorporate the block cave project.  Key mitigation measures that have been identified for impacts assessed during the 2021 PFS will inform the updates to the EMPs.

## 20.4 Closure Plan

A closure plan was developed for the 2021 PFS for the closure of the proposed block cave  operation  in  its  entirety,  including  works  associated  with  the  existing  open  pit operations.

Under the M-240 permit, the primary end land use goal is to return the disturbed area available  for  reclamation  to  pre-mining  capability  for  wildlife  habitat,  particularly  for species specified in the Wildlife Management Plan and opportunities for recreation and re-establishment of opportunities for traditional use of the land by the Tahltan Nation. Prior to mine development, land use around the Mine Permit Area consisted of wildlife habitat,  backcountry  wilderness  tourism  and  recreation,  hunting,  trapping,  guideoutfitting, and mineral exploration.

Under  the  British  Columbia  Environmental  Management  Act  and  the  Mines  Act, maintenance of a five-year mine plan and a closure plan are required for mines operating in British Columbia.  For Red Chris, both plans are required to be updated with the Mine Review Committee (MRC) every three years as a condition of the M-240 permit.  The closure plan currently approved is for the closure of the existing facilities to support the open pit mine at Red Chris.

A reclamation bond is required to be updated according to the disturbance areas and facilities associated with the M-240 permit.

The closure plan for the proposed block cave project was completed for the purposes of development of a closure cost estimate.  The estimated total exit cost for the block cave project  including  decommissioning,  closure,  and  reclamation  of  mine  infrastructure associated with the existing open pit mine is approximately C$181 M.

## 20.5 Permitting

## 20.5.1 Current Permit Status

The Red Chris Operations were assessed and approved under applicable provincial and federal legislation.  The operations obtained an EA certificate (M05-02) on 24 August 2005 under predecessor legislation to the Environmental Assessment Act (EAA).

The EA certificate was set to expire on the fifth anniversary of issue unless, on or prior to that time, the construction of the operations was substantially started.  An extension of the EA certificate for a further five-year period was requested on 10 February 2010 and obtained in July 2010, with an extension to substantially start the mine by 24 August 2015.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

The EA certificate has been amended four times:

- · 24 February 2012:  Amendment 1 amends Condition 1 of the EA certificate to reflect more  recent  language  for  proposed  changes  to  the  EA  certificate  and  to  add  a requirement for compliance reporting to the EA certificate (Condition 8);
- · 19 August 2016:  Amendment 2 amends commitments G10, M11, and M12 of the EA certificate to allow design changes around the TIA and design changes to the South dam related to water management;
- · 15 August 2019:  Amendment 3 amends the EA certificate to the name of Newcrest Red Chris Mining Limited;
- · 3 May 2021: Amendment 4 amends the EA certificate to allow the operations to provide housing for up to 800 people.

Federal environmental assessment approval under predecessor legislation to the Impact Assessment  Act (the  former Canadian  Environmental  Assessment  Act (CEAA)  (SC 1992, c. 37)) was received in May 2006 and upheld by a Supreme Court of Canada decision on 21 January 2010 ([2010] 1 SCR 3-328).

## The operations also hold:

- · Mines Act permit M-240, issued on 4 May 2012 and amended on 12 occasions.  The most recent amendments included:
- o 8  February  2021:    approval  of  box  cut  and  portal  construction  (Phase  1 exploration decline);
- o 27  April  2021:    construction  approval  for  the  exploration  decline  (Phase  2 exploration decline);
- o 14 June 2021:  approving ultimate pit redesign;
- · EMA permit 105017, issued on 9 May 2012, for effluent discharges and amended on six occasions;
- · EMA permit 106668, issued on 7 June 2013, for air discharges and last amended on 7 November 2017;
- · EMA permit 106004 for wastewater discharges.

The EMA permits are undergoing a review initiated by the Ministry of Environment and Climate Change Strategy, Canada (ENV).  EMA permit 105017 for effluent discharge was  initiated  for  revision  in  2019  and  update  of  language  by  ENV;  monitoring  plan commitments  and  site  performance  objectives  are  being  developed  by  ENV  in consultation with Newcrest and the Tahltan Central Government for targeted completion in late 2021.  EMA 106668 permitting air discharge amendment was initiated in 2020 by the Red Chris Operations to update discharge points and monitoring programs; review has been delayed due to lack of ENV resources and an update is anticipated to be returned  from  ENV  by  early  2022.    EMA  permit  106004  for  wastewater  discharge  is

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

undergoing a review initiated in 2021 to update the permit to align with the Municipal Wastewater Registration of the wastewater treatment plant upgrades in 2020.

On 6 May 2016 the operations were granted a Schedule 2 Amendment to the Metal and Diamond  Mining  Effluent  Regulations  (MDMER;  SOR  2002-222)  authorizing  the inclusion of a portion of Trail Creek, thus enabling the use of water frequented by fish for mine  tailings  disposal.    On  22  July  2016,  the  operations  received  a Fisheries  Act authorization  under  to  Section  35(2)  for  construction  of  the  South  dam  and  South Reclaim dam in Trail Creek.

## 20.5.2 2021 PFS Permit Requirements

## 20.5.2.1 Environmental Permitting

The Reviewable Projects Regulation (RPR, BC Reg. 67/2020) under the EAA sets out the criteria for determining which projects are required to undergo an EA.  Projects are typically reviewable if they meet or exceed certain project design or effects thresholds (such  as  production  volume,  storage  capacity,  area  of  disturbance)  defined  in  the Reviewable Projects Regulation or if they are required to undergo an assessment by the provincial ENV.  If a project does not meet the prescribed criteria under the Reviewable Projects Regulation (and it is not designated by the ENV to undergo an EA), it is not required to undergo a formal EA review process.

Newcrest  understands  that  the  block  cave  project  does  not  meet  or  exceed  the thresholds defined in the Reviewable Projects Regulation; therefore, except in the event that the Project is designated by the ENV, the Project will not require a new EA certificate. However, amendments to the EA certificate will be required in connection with certain phases of the block cave project (such as underground mining) where the activities to be undertaken during such phases are not authorized by the existing EA certificate.

Under Section 32(1) of the 2018 EAA, an EA certificate holder may apply to the EAO for an  amendment.    The  EAO  categorizes  amendments  into  types  (simple,  typical,  or complex)  in  order  to  provide  applicants  with  guidance  on  what  potential  information requirements, procedures, engagement, and timelines could be part of an amendment assessment.  EAO staff will determine the nature of the amendment and establish the requirements for the amendment process.  Depending on the potential complexity of the proposed amendment, the EAO may set out supplementary application requirements that may include information typically included in a detailed project description.

Section 7 of the Bill-41: Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples Act sets out provisions for negotiating consent-based decision-making agreements for the purposes of reconciliation.  On 15 June 2021, in terms of Section 7, Order-in-Council Number 348 was deposited on the BC laws ordering that the Minister of Indigenous Relations and Reconciliation is authorized, on behalf of the government, to negotiate an agreement with  the  Tahltan  Central  Government  relating  to  the  consent  of  the  Tahltan  Central Government in respect of decisions under the EAA related to the Red Chris Operations. Newcrest will pursue engagement opportunities with the BC government and the Tahltan

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Central Government in order to gain a clear understanding of the process and scope of the consent and the potential impact on the block cave project.

## 20.5.2.2 Permit Plan

It is proposed that the permitting strategy will follow a phased approach, including:

- · Phase 1:  exploration decline box cut and portal;
- · Phase 2:  exploration decline development;
- · Phase  3:    pre-mining  underground  development  including  an  extension  to  the decline, development of the conveyor decline, preconditioning, access to the ore body and underground development to support the block cave infrastructure;
- · Phase 4:  block cave mining of MB1;
- · Phase 5:  block cave mining of MB2 and MB3.

Permitting for development of the exploration decline (Phases 1 and 2) is complete and the exploration decline is under construction.

## 20.5.2.3 Exploration Decline

The  exploration  decline  required  an  amendment  to  the M-240  permit.    The  ENV confirmed that an amendment to EMA Permit 105017 was not required as there was no mine  contact  water  discharge  to  the  environment.    No  other  provincial  permitting  or federal  permitting  or  authorizations  and  processes  were  triggered  or  required  for  the exploration decline.

## 20.5.2.4 Access and Conveyor Declines

Permitting for development of the access and conveyor declines is referred to as Phase 3AB reflecting the initial planning of a two-stage permitting process.  Facilities/activities to be permitted in this phase include:

- · Access decline;
- · Conveyor box cut and decline;
- · Tailings thickener.

This work phase will require amendments to the Mines Act M-240 permit.  An amendment to EMA Permit 105017 is not expected to be required by ENV as no mine contact water discharge to the environment is envisaged.  Newcrest will engage with FLNRORD with respect  to  an  exemption  under  the Water Sustainability  Act to  dewater  underground workings.

Because the access and conveyor declines are not related to exploration activities, EAC M05-02 will need to be amended for these underground works.  Newcrest proposes to amend  the  EAC  using  Condition  1.1  of  EAC  M05-02,  which  allows  for  a  'deemed' amendment  for  minor  changes  to  the  permitted  project  configuration,  provided  that

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

certain conditions related to environmental and social aspects are demonstrated to be achieved.  After consulting with the Tahltan Central Government, Newcrest submitted a request letter to amend EAC M05-02 under Condition 1.1 to the EAO, and is awaiting response.

Should provincial authorities not agree to amend the EAC via Condition 1.1, it is likely that an amendment under Section 32(1) of the BC EAA will be required.  This is not forecast to affect the permitting timeline.

No other provincial permitting or federal permitting or authorizations and processes are expected to be triggered or required for the Phase 3AB works.

## 20.5.2.5 Preconditioning, Large Excavations and Underground Development

Further pre-production underground development is referred to as Phase 3C and will include pre-conditioning and additional underground development including the pump station chamber, crusher chamber and underground workshop.  This work will require an EAC amendment, MAP amendment, and likely an amendment to the EMA permit.

## 20.5.2.6 MB1

The mining of MB1 is referred to as Phase 4 in the permitting plan.  The mining of MB1 will  not  necessitate  an  expansion  of  the  TIA  beyond  the  existing  permitted  300  Mt configuration, and will entail little additional surface disturbance as the subsidence zone will be mostly within the permitted footprint of the open pit.  Accordingly, permitting will be at the provincial level and, like Phase 3C, will include an EAC amendment and a joint MAP/EMA permit amendment.  The application review process is assumed to be carried out jointly or concurrently by the Tahltan Central Government and provincial regulators pursuant to an agreement under Section 7 of the provincial Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples Act.

MA and EMA permit amendment applications are expected to be submitted and reviewed concurrently during the EA certificate amendment process.  It is possible that the EA certificate amendment process will include modernization, which may broaden the scope of the review.

## 20.5.2.7 MB2 and MB3

Extension of the mine's operating life beyond 2040 through the mining of MB2 and MB3 may trigger  the  need  for  environmental  review  at  the  federal  level  under  the Impact Assessment Act and will likely entail permitting under the Fisheries Act ,  in  addition to provincial permitting including another amendment to the EAC and amendments to the MA and EMA permits.  These permitting activities are assumed to be initiated after 2035.

## 20.6 Considerations of Social and Community Impacts

The mining operations are located entirely  within  the  Tahltan  Nation's  territory.    The proposed block cave project requires an approach that aligns with the Tahltan Nation and leadership and with provincial governments.  This is planned to include:

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

- · Open and transparent consultation and communication in describing the Project's activities and assessment of alternatives;
- · Working  partnerships  with  Tahltan  and  government  to  ensure  the  social  and community relations programme is well designed and effectively delivered;
- · Recognising and respecting Tahltan rights and interests;
- · Compliance with statutory and regulatory obligations.

Since initiating discussions on exploration and Red Chris Operations activities, Newcrest representatives continued to meet regularly with Tahltan Central Government representatives, Tahltan leadership, and the Tahltan Nation.  While feedback has been largely positive, a range of concerns and interests have been raised.  Newcrest is actively working with Tahltan Central Government representatives, Tahltan leadership, and the Tahltan Nation to address concerns that have been raised.

In  April  2020,  Newcrest  commenced  discussions  with  representatives  of  the  Tahltan Central Government to develop and implement a participatory social baseline study to provide  social,  economic,  and  cultural  information  relevant  to  deepen  Newcrest's understanding of the Tahltan Nation and local communities.

## 20.7 QP Comments on 'Item 20:  Environmental  Studies,  Permitting,  and  Social  or Community Impacts'

## The QP notes:

- · Extensive environmental baseline data collection and monitoring of the area has occurred  since  2003.    Baseline  and  supporting  studies  were  completed  for  the current open pit mining operation.  Additional studies are ongoing in support of the block cave project, and/or planned to be completed prior to the commencement of underground operations;
- · A gap analysis identified several areas requiring additional baseline characterisation work;
- · The permitting  strategy  for  the  proposed  block  cave  project  will  follow  a  phased approach;
- · Permitting for development of the exploration decline (Phases 1 and 2) is complete and the decline is under construction.

## 21 CAPITAL AND OPERATING COSTS

## 21.1 Introduction

The capital and operating costs are presented for the open pit and proposed block cave underground operation.

## 21.2 Capital Cost Estimates

## 21.2.1 Open Pit

## 21.2.1.1 Basis of Estimate

The capital costs for the open pit operations are considered to be sustaining capital.  The cost breakdown is provided in the discussion in Section 21.3.1 on operating costs.

As  the  open  pit  is  operating,  the  estimated  life  of  mine  costs  are  based  on  actual expenditure as of FY21Q4 and forward-looking estimates.

## 21.2.1.2 Sustaining Cost Estimate

The major portion of the open pit sustaining capital costs relates to TSF enhancements particularly  in  FY22  and  FY23.    Other  items  include  mill  maintenance,  mine  fleet replacements, and contingency.

## 21.2.1.3 Processing Cost Estimate

Processing costs are based on FY21Q4 operating costs with modifications for liner and mill shutdown optimisation and additional reclaim stockpile movements.

## 21.2.1.4 General and Administration Cost Estimate

G&amp;A costs are based on FY21Q4 operating costs with modifications for fly-in-fly-out optimisation, site services maintenance optimisation and allocation of G&amp;A  to underground operations as open pit mining reduces.

## 21.2.1.5 Mining Cost Estimate

Mining costs are based on FY21Q4 operating costs and assumptions of forward-looking productivity gains.

## 21.2.2 Block Cave Underground

Capital cost estimates were prepared for the process plant expansions and underground development to produce an estimate with a target accuracy of -±25%.  All inputs were in Q2 2021 Canadian dollars.

Costs were estimated with a bottom-up unit cost and productivity approach, and were cross-referenced with benchmark data.

Footprint mine designs considered haulage scenarios that use single as well as multiple crusher layouts.  The reduced distances and the inclusion of a truck loop resulted in a single  crusher  configuration  being  selected  as  the  preferred  option,  substantially reducing the capital required in MB2 and MB3.

Capital costs were estimated based on a 13.6 Mt/a Central Case (that forms the base case) and a 15 Mt/a Upside Case (that forms an alternative case).  The Upside Case estimate was a modification of the Central Case with the following changes:

- · Underground mine development and production modified for higher tonnage;
- · Process plant upgrade with the HydroFloat system;
- · Changes to infrastructure to support the above.

## 21.2.2.1 Basis of Estimate

The capital cost estimate for the proposed block cave is divided into:

- · Initial capital for MB1:  includes all expenses up to the completion of underground mine development required to access MB1, material handling systems, and process plant upgrades;
- · Initial capital for MB2:  includes the incremental underground development capital expenditure required to access this section of the orebody;
- · Initial capital for MB3:  includes the incremental underground development capital expenditure required to access this section of the orebody;
- · Sustaining capital;
- · Closure and rehabilitation costs.

The capital cost estimate was based on a coding system, including a work breakdown structure, commodity coding, and cost element code format.

All costs in the estimate were based on the estimate base date.  Where historical data were used as a reference for pricing of equipment and materials, prices were escalated to the estimate base date using producer price indices.

## 21.2.2.2 Labour Assumptions

The direct labour  rates  were  based  on  a  composite  crew  (considering  a  craft  mix  of supervisors,  experienced  tradespersons  and  apprentice  helpers)  for  various  types  of activities, organized by commodity code.  The hourly rate per each trade was based on British Columbia construction worker agreements.  The base work week hours were 12 hours/day, seven days/week.  Assumed work schedules were:

• Underground:  14 days on, 14 days off;

• Construction:  21 days on, 7 days off;

<!-- image -->

• Production:  14 days on, 14 days off;

• Management:  8 days on, 6 days off.

The construction equipment cost was estimated as dollars per labour hour of direct work for each installation crew used in the estimate.  The construction equipment rates were based on hourly, weekly, and monthly rental quotes in the area and applied contractor equipment depreciation cost, insurance,  fuel,  oil,  lubricants,  maintenance,  equipment service, and repair.

An appropriate fleet of equipment was assigned to each installation crew used in the estimate based on the nature of the activity.

Productivity factors were applied to direct field labour hours in order to compensate for labour productivity loss on the job site, and were developed for each commodity code used in the estimate for above ground greenfield, brownfield, and underground work.

Distributables  were  applied  as  a  percentage  mark-up  to  the  labour  cost.    Itemized percentage allowances were obtained from similar projects.

## 21.2.2.3 Equipment and Materials

Third-party  consultants  supplied  pricing  for  the  equipment  and  materials  within  their scope of work.  Supporting quotations were provided for most major equipment.  For some  items,  allowances  were  added  to  quoted  supply  prices  to  include  ancillary equipment if that equipment was not included in the scope of the quote.

Pricing  for  materials  was  based  on  recent  contracts  and  quotations  received  from suppliers.  Material wastage was included in the unit material cost.

## 21.2.2.4 Quantities

Quantities were estimated for design growth, underground mining, civil works, concrete, structural steel, architectural, mechanical equipment, piping and electrical, and instrumentation and automation.

The  specific  estimating  techniques  used  to  develop  quantities  varied  by  the  level  of engineering  completed  by  each  third-party  consultant  contributing  to  the  estimates. Quantities  from  consultants  were  based  on  a  mix  of  material  take-offs,  factors,  and allowances.

## 21.2.2.5 Indirect Costs

Indirect costs were developed based on the work breakdown structure.  They included allocations for construction indirect costs (support services), Engineering, procurement and construction management (EPCM) costs, temporary construction facilities, temporary services, plant and equipment, freight/traffic warehouse services and logistics, environment, health and safety, spares, first fills, commissioning indirect costs, project delivery  services,  Owner's  team,  studies,  government,  community  and  environment, finance, legal and insurance, operational readiness, pre-production costs, other capital

<!-- image -->

costs, escalation, allowances and contingency, foreign exchange, escalation, provisions/allowances, and contingencies.

The  EPCM  costs  were  estimated  from  the  direct  cost  using  percentage  factors. Engineering and procurement services were estimated separately for each consultant scope, and ranged from 6-8.5% of the direct cost.

Engineering and QA/QC costs for the tailings scope, which will be performed by a thirdparty  consultant,  were  estimated  to  be  approximately  C$101  M,  based  on  annual allowances for the LOM.  This cost was considered to be sustaining capital; however, no other  EPCM  allowances  were  included  for  sustaining  capital  projects  that  would  be Newcrest-performed.

## 21.2.2.6 Owner's Costs

Owner's cost allocations made provision for:

- · Feasibility study;
- · Project execution and administration by Owner's team;
- · Government, community and environment costs;
- · Finance, legal and insurance costs;
- · Operational readiness costs.

## 21.2.2.7 Contingency

The  engineering  maturity  and  pricing  maturity  data  captured  in  the  estimate  were modelled  to  reflect  the  uncertainty  and  risk  using  a  deterministic  statistical  process. Contingency allocations were based on whether the estimate was detailed, factored, estimated, historical, allowed, or from an informal quote.

The total contingency was C$396 million or 17.9% of the base estimate of initial capital expenditure (including MB1, MB2 and MB3).

## 21.2.3 Capital Cost Summary

All open pit capital costs are considered to be sustaining capital and are summarized with the operating costs.

The capital cost estimate from the 2021 PFS is summarized in Table 21-1 for the planned underground operation.  The estimate totals C$2,632 M.

## 21.3 Operating Cost Estimates

## 21.3.1 Open Pit

## 21.3.1.1 Basis of Estimate

The Red Chris open pit is an operating mine with production history.  As such, capital costs  are  treated  as  sustaining  capital  operating  costs  rather  than  treated  as  initial capital.

The operating costs were estimated during FY21Q4 forecast period and represent the total open pit cost estimate for the remaining LOM (e.g., before the underground block caving operation is fully implemented).

Four major line items make up the open pit operating cost estimate:

- · Processing cost;
- · G&amp;A;
- · Sustaining capital operating cost;
- · Mining cost.

The current estimated open pit cost forecasts are mining cost at US$2.90/t mined, milling cost  at  US$6.70/t  milled,  G&amp;A  costs  at  US$3.30/t  milled  and  sustaining  capital  at US$3.60/t milled for an overall process cost of US$13.60/t processed.  These values were used to define the open pit mine plan.  Values used for the operating cost estimate

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

will not necessarily match those provided in the economic analysis that has validated the mine plan.

Table 21-2 shows the LOM open pit operating costs that are estimated on an annual basis  and  divided  by  total  material  movement  for  mining  cost  and  mill  tonnes  for processing cost. Costs are calculated in Canadian dollars and reported in US dollars.

## 21.3.2 Block Cave Underground

## 21.3.2.1 Basis of Estimate

No  escalation  was  included  in  the  operating  cost  estimates,  nor  was  a  contingency allocation made during estimation.

Cost items were calculated as either:

- · Labour as wages or salaries, including burdens, taxes, transportation, and any other compensation;
- · Mobile  equipment,  including  ownership  (if  leased  or  rented),  maintenance,  and energy requirements;
- · As  a  percentage  of  the  capital  costs  per  year  (typically  used  for  maintenance allowances);
- · Based on a variable consumption rate and unit price;
- · Fixed  recurring  cost  calculated  based  on  the  operating  plan  or  appropriate allowances.

The operating cost estimate is presented at an estimation accuracy of ±25%.  All inputs were in Q2 2021 Canadian dollars.

Economic assumptions were fixed for the operating cost estimate:

- · Exchange rates;
- · Fuel prices, including delivery;
- · Electricity price.

Variable costs were linked to production parameters defined by the mining schedule, milling schedule, or derived from consultant inputs as required.

Labour salaries for permanent employees as well as the expected number of people in each  position  were  defined  for  each  area.    Production  operators  and  maintenance personnel were assumed to work on a two-weeks on, two-weeks off basis.  Management was assumed to work eight days on, six days off.  All personnel were assumed to work 12-hour shifts when on site.

## 21.3.2.2 Mine Operating Costs

The basis of the costs for mining operations was developed as part of the integrated mine  production  plan  and  schedule,  which  includes  the  required  number  of  units  of equipment and operators on a monthly basis for the LOM.

The  labour  positions  indicated  on  the  mine  plan  were  mapped  to  the  master  labour positions, with variable manpower numbers, depending on the mine plan requirements. The  number  of  personnel  per  crew  was  multiplied  by  four  to  account  for  two  shifts (day/night), and two rotations, as production operations will be continuous.

Mine production equipment costs include maintenance and fuel consumption based on the hourly rates and equipment utilization.

Mine technical services will have a total of 36 personnel according to the labour positions list.  The total cost for these personnel is C$5.5 M/a.

Permanent equipment operating costs include maintenance supplies, power, and fuel for all  underground systems and infrastructure.  Inputs for these costs were provided by third-party  consultants.    These  costs  vary  from  year  to  year  based  on  operating parameters.

## 21.3.2.3 Process Operating Costs

The process area assumed a personnel count of 105, including management, technical services, and operators.  The total cost for these personnel is C$12.4 M/a.

Equipment maintenance and power costs for the existing process plant were based on a nominal process capacity of 11 Mt/a, cost estimates, and FY2023 operating budget forecasts.

Equipment costs for the coarse ore crushing and regrind mill areas are removed from the estimate when the process plant upgrades are complete.

Equipment maintenance and power costs for the new process plant operations were based on a 13.6 Mt/a throughput rate.

<!-- image -->

Reagents and consumables costs for the process plant were jointly developed by a thirdparty consultant and the Red Chris Operations.

The FY23 budget of C$1.03 M for metallurgy and assaying supplies was carried as a fixed annual cost.

## 21.3.2.4 Tailings

The TIA will require 44 persons.  The total labour cost is C$5.7 M/a.

Tailings  and  reclaim  equipment  maintenance  and  power  costs  were  based  on  the FY2023 forecast operating budget:

- · C$1.8 M/a for maintenance supplies;
- · Power consumption of 53.5 GWh per year.

Maintenance and power costs for water system upgrade were based on:

- · C$0.2 M/a for maintenance supplies;
- · Power consumption of 7.0 GWh per year.

## 21.3.2.5 Infrastructure Operating Costs

The infrastructure operating costs include all maintenance personnel for above-ground facilities, including process plant, infrastructure, ancillary buildings, tailings equipment, and site services, with the personnel count totalling 133.  Labour costs total C$15.6 M/a.

Maintenance  and  power  costs  for  existing  infrastructure  were  based  on  the  FY2023 forecast operating budget.  Maintenance and power costs for new infrastructure were based on third-party estimates.

Existing propane usage includes 220 m 3  for the camp and 593 m 3  per year for all other site facilities.  Forecast usage for the surface facilities are expected to remain in line with the current usage.

An annual allowance of C$78,180 was made for water and sewage treatment costs.

## 21.3.2.6 General and Administrative Operating Costs

General and administrative costs were estimated based on the FY23 operating budget.

Utility price assumptions were:

- · Diesel:  C$1.230/L;
- · Propane:  C$820/m 3 ;
- · Electricity:  C$0.0674/kWh.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

A  total  of  55  personnel  are  allocated  to  G&amp;A  operating  costs.    The  G&amp;A  fixed  cost budgets  include  an  estimated  116  additional  personnel,  including  management, administration, human resources, health and safety, and other areas.

Annual G&amp;A costs total C$50 M.

## 21.3.3 Operating Cost Summary

The operating cost estimate is summarized in Table 21-3 for the planned underground operation on a dollar per tonne processed basis, and in Table 21-4 by major area.

The annual average operating cost estimate for underground ore in the 2021 PFS totals C$271 M.  On a cost per tonne milled basis, mining costs average C$5.65, process costs average C$10.36, and site G&amp;A costs average C$4.33, for a total LOM average cost of C$20.34.

## 21.4 QP Comments on 'Item 21:  Capital and Operating Costs'

The combined open pit and block cave project capital cost estimate is C$4,991 M.

Operating costs over the combined open pit and block cave project LOM are C$9,900 M.

## A mineral tax is payable in BC:

- · 2% net current proceeds tax, which serves as a minimum tax on the net current proceeds of a mining operator (the net current proceeds of an operator is the amount by which the operator's gross revenue from the mine exceeds the current operating costs (excluding capital costs)).  The net current proceeds tax is accumulated in a Cumulative Tax Credit Account that is uplifted with an interest component (currently approximately 0.63% per annum);

- · 13% net revenue tax, which applies once payback of the cumulative operating and capital costs has been achieved (the net revenue of an operator is the amount by which the total of the operator's gross revenue for the year (plus government grants, subsidies, and other assistance receivable in the year, and the proceeds from the disposition of capital assets receivable in the year), exceeds the cumulative amount of operating and capital expenditures and certain investment allowances that allow the cumulative expenditure balance to be uplifted (current uplift rate of approximately 0.63% per annum)).

Provincial sales tax is a non-refundable sales tax payable at a rate of 7% on the purchase of goods or services for use in BC.  However, an exemption is available for production machinery and equipment used in the exploration of minerals or the development of mines, or equipment primarily used at the qualifying part of a mine site for the extraction or processing of qualifying minerals.

## 22.3.9 Closure Costs and Salvage Value

No salvage value was allocated.

Mine  closure  costs  are  based  on  an  estimated  total  closure  cost  for  the  operation consisting of an annual spend during operations and a final closure cost incurred over a period of 15 years, starting after the final year of production.  This cost is included in operating costs.  The closure costs are estimated at C$181 M.

## 22.3.10  Financing

The base case economic analysis assumes 100% equity financing and is reported on a 100%  project  ownership  basis.    Newcrest  holds  a  70%  interest  in  the  Red  Chris Operations, and Imperial holds the remaining 30% interest.

## 22.3.11  Inflation

The base case economic analysis assumes constant prices.

A 2.00% Canadian dollar inflation rate was used for tax calculations in nominal terms.

Capital and operating costs are based on Q2 2021 Canadian dollars.

## 22.4 Financial Analysis

The economic analysis shows a net present value at 4.5% of C$2,242 M, and an internal rate of return of 16.1%.  A payback period of 3.2 years is based on the earliest date that net accumulated free cash flow is equal to zero.  This is calculated from first commercial production that is defined as the date of achieving critical hydraulic radius for the Red Chris  block  cave,  which  is  assumed  to  be  FY27.    All  metrics  are  presented  prior  to shareholder loans.

Table 22-3 presents the financial metrics for the Red Chris Operations.  Table 22-4 to Table 22-8 provide the cashflow for the LOM on an annualized basis.  Figure 22-1 shows the free cashflow.

## 22.5 Sensitivity Analysis

A deterministic  point-estimate  sensitivity  analysis  was  conducted  on  each of  the key project variables and value drivers.  The sensitivity analysis reflects the changes in IRR (%) and NPV (C$ M) for the corresponding individual movement in each factor.

Figure 22-2 and Figure 22-3 present sensitivity analyses using IRR and NPV metrics, respectively.

The Red Chris Operations, including the proposed block cave, are most sensitive to changes in the copper price, less sensitive to changes in the gold price, copper grade, capital costs, gold grade, foreign exchange, gold recovery, copper recovery and least sensitive to changes in operating costs.

## 25 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS

## 25.1 Introduction

The QPs note the following interpretations and conclusions in their respective areas of expertise, based on the review of data available for this Report.

## 25.2 Mineral Tenure, Surface Rights, Water Rights, Royalties and Agreements

Information from legal experts and Newcrest's in-house experts support that the tenure held is valid and sufficient to support a declaration of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves.

The Project is 70% owned by Newcrest Red Chris Mining Limited, a Newcrest subsidiary, and 30% owned by Red Chris Development Company Ltd., an Imperial subsidiary.  The operating entity is the unincorporated Newcrest Red Chris Joint Venture.  Newcrest is operator.

The main tenures for purposes of the LOM plan are five mining leases issued on 20 June 2012, for a term of 30 years, with an expiry date of 20 June 2042.

All land in the immediate vicinity of the Red Chris Operations is Crown land.

Applications for groundwater licences under the Water Sustainability Act were submitted and are under review by the FLNRORD for new and existing groundwater use for 'Mining Use'.

Royalties are payable to the Tahltan Nation and Royal Gold on all or a portion of the mining leases.  Annual advance royalty payments to the Tahltan Nation commenced in October 2016.

Current environmental liabilities are in line with those to be expected from a long-life mining operation where mining activities are conducted via open pit mining methods. These include the open pit, operations infrastructure, and access roads.

To the extent known to the QP, there are no other significant factors and risks known to Newcrest that may affect access, title, or the right or ability to perform work on the Project that are not discussed in this Report.

## 25.3 Geology and Mineralization

The mineralization discovered to date in the Project area is considered by Newcrest to be representative of porphyry copper-gold systems.

The  understanding  of  the  Red  Chris  deposit  setting,  lithologies,  and  geological, structural, and alteration controls on mineralisation is sufficient to support estimation of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves.

The mineralisation style and setting are well understood and can support declaration of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves.

A number of areas remain prospective at depth in the immediate vicinity of the open pit operation.

## 25.4 Exploration, Drilling and Analytical Data Collection in Support of Mineral Resource Estimation

The exploration programs completed by Texasgulf, American Bullion, bcMetals, Imperial, and Newcrest are appropriate for the style of the deposits in the Project area.

Sampling methods are acceptable for Mineral Resource estimation.

Sample preparation, analysis and security are generally performed in accordance with exploration best practices and industry standards.

The quantity and quality of the lithological, geotechnical, collar and down-hole survey data collected during the Texasgulf, American Bullion, bcMetals, Imperial and Newcrest exploration and delineation drilling programs are sufficient to support Mineral Resource estimation.

No material factors were identified with the data collection from the drill programs that could significantly affect Mineral Resource estimation.

Sample preparation, analysis, and security practices and results for the Imperial and Newcrest programs are acceptable, meet industry-standard practice, and are adequate to support Mineral Resource estimation.  The collected sample data adequately reflect deposit dimensions, true widths of mineralisation, and the style of the deposits.  Sampling is representative of the gold and copper grades.

QA/QC programs for the Imperial and Newcrest campaigns adequately address issues of precision, accuracy and contamination.  Drilling programs typically included blanks, duplicates  and  SRM  samples.    QA/QC  submission  rates  meet  industry-accepted standards.  The QA/QC programs did not detect any material sample biases in the data reviewed that supports Mineral Resource estimation.

The  data  verification  programs  concluded  that  the  data  collected  from  the  Project adequately support the geological interpretations and constitute a database of sufficient quality to support the use of the data in Mineral Resource estimation.

## 25.5 Metallurgical Testwork

Metallurgical  testwork  and  associated  analytical  procedures  were  appropriate  to  the mineralisation type, appropriate to establish the optimal processing routes, and were performed using samples that are typical of the mineralisation styles found within the open pit and underground sectors of the Red Chris deposit.

Samples  selected  for  testing  were  representative  of  the  various  types  and  styles  of mineralisation.    Samples  were  selected  from  a  range  of  depths  within  the  deposits. Sufficient samples were taken so that tests were performed on sufficient sample mass.

Underground ore was determined to be significantly harder than open pit ore, therefore, requiring increased power input per tonne of ore treated for a given grind size.  There is a general increase in hardness with depth, implying that throughput rates and grind size will be impacted positively over the progression of each macroblock within the block cave design.

Copper and gold head grades were confirmed to be significantly higher than open pit material,  especially  for  macroblock  1.    Underground  ore  was  also  shown  to  have  a significantly  lower  pyrite  content  than  open  pit  ore,  which  may  help  moderate  water quality risks associated with potential acid generation in the TIA.

Recovery factors estimated are based on appropriate metallurgical testwork, and are appropriate to the mineralisation types and the selected process routes for the Red Chris deposit.

Marketable concentrates can be produced, with some ore zones enriched in secondary copper minerals such as bornite producing elevated concentrate grades.  Some samples showed elevated mercury levels in the concentrate, but these were not high enough to cause any significant marketing concerns.  Indications are that most underground ores are not expected to produce concentrates that trigger penalty mercury levels.  These observations  are  based  on  a  combination  of  laboratory  testwork  results  as  well  as predictions from underground mine plan mercury head grades.

## 25.6 Mineral Resource Estimates

The  Mineral  Resource  estimation  for  the  Project  conforms  to  industry-accepted practices, and is reported using the 2014 CIM Definition Standards.

There is upside potential for the estimates if mineralisation that is currently classified as Inferred can be upgraded to higher-confidence Mineral Resource categories.  Additional upside potential exists if the mineralization currently being drilled out in the East Ridge area can support Mineral Resource estimates.

Factors  that  may  affect  the  Mineral  Resource  estimate  include  changes  in  local interpretations of mineralization geometry and continuity of mineralized zones; changes to  geological  and  grade  shape  and  geological  and  grade  continuity  assumptions; changes to metallurgical recovery assumptions; changes to the input assumptions used to derive the conceptual open pit used to constrain the estimate; changes to the input assumptions for assumed block caving operations; changes to the NSR cut-offs applied to the estimates; variations in geotechnical, hydrogeological and mining assumptions; forecast dilution; and changes to environmental, permitting and social license assumptions.

## 25.7 Mineral Reserve Estimates

The Mineral Reserve estimation for the Project incorporates industry-accepted practices and meets the requirements of the 2014 CIM Definition Standards.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Mineral  Reserves  were  estimated  assuming  conventional  open  pit  and  conventional block caving methods.  Mineral Resources were converted to Mineral Reserves using a detailed mine plan, an engineering analysis, and consideration of appropriate modifying factors. Modifying  factors  include  the  consideration  of  dilution  and  ore  losses, underground mining methods, geotechnical and hydrological considerations, metallurgical recoveries, permitting and infrastructure requirements.

Factors that may affect the Mineral Reserve estimates include changes to long-term gold and  copper  price  assumptions;  changes  to  exchange  rate  assumptions;  changes  to metallurgical recovery assumptions; changes to the input assumptions used to design the optimized open pit shell; changes to the input assumptions used to derive the cave outlines and the mine plan that is based on those cave designs; changes to operating and capital  assumptions  used,  including  changes  to  input  cost  assumptions  such  as consumables, labour costs, royalty and taxation rates; variations in geotechnical, mining, dilution and processing recovery assumptions; including changes to designs as a result of changes to geotechnical, hydrogeological, and engineering data used; changes to the NSR cut-off criteria used to constrain the open pit estimates; changes to the shut-off criteria used to constrain the underground estimates; changes to the assumed permitting and regulatory environment under which the mine plan was developed; ability to maintain mining permits and/or surface rights; and the ability to maintain social and environmental license to operate.

Factors that are risk-specific to block cave operations, and which may affect the Mineral Reserves include:  inrush of water into the underground workings including decline, cave levels and infrastructure areas; poorer rock mass quality and quantity than interpreted; inability to achieve planned decline development rates having impact on schedule and cost; incorrect estimation of cave propagation potentially leading to air blast; and damage to mine workings due to a seismic event.

## 25.8 Mine Plan

Open pit mining operations are conducted year-round, and the block cave project is assumed to be operational year-round.

The mine plans are based on the current knowledge of geotechnical, hydrological, mining and processing information.

Open pit operations are conducted using conventional methods and a conventional truck and shovel fleet.  Underground operations will use conventional block cave underground mining methods and equipment fleets.

The Red Chris East Zone is currently being mined by open pit mining.  The open pit mine is due for completion of the final phase (Phase 8) in FY26, producing a total of 63.6 Mt of ore from Q4 FY21 to Q4 FY26.  The first cave ore from MB1 (located directly below Phase 8) is scheduled for January 2026 (Q3 FY26), with full production from MB1 in FY30.    During  the  block  cave  production  ramp-up  the  process  plant  feed  will  be supplemented by stockpiled ore.

The  proposed  block  cave  sequence  will  be,  in  order,  MB1,  MB2,  and  MB3.    This sequence is based on mining the high-grade portion of the Mineral Reserve first (MB1). MB2 will be a southern extension of MB1, and with cave rules and stress orientation dictating that MB3 is opened from southeast to northwest, MB2 must be opened prior to MB3.

The forecast tonnage profile transitions from a predominantly open pit feed in FY26 to an exclusively underground mill feed in FY30 when the nameplate capacity of 13.6 Mt/a is scheduled to be reached.

## 25.9 Recovery Plan

The proposed processing methods are conventional to the industry.  The comminution and recovery processes are widely used with no significant elements of technological innovation.

The process plant flowsheet designs were based on testwork results, previous study designs and industry-standard practices.  The flowsheet is a standard porphyry copper flowsheet employing SAG and ball milling, flotation, regrinding, thickening and filtering to produce a copper concentrate at a moisture content of 8% for export.  The plant has been in operation since 2015.

The 2021 PFS metallurgical testwork program confirmed that a flowsheet incorporating crushing, grinding, flotation, and concentrate dewatering was suitable for the planned block cave material.

The Central Case expansion aimed to increase the throughput of the process plant from the current 11.0 Mt/a treating open pit ore to 13.6 Mt/a treating underground ore.  The underground ore is harder and has higher copper and gold head grades.  In the Central Case the target grind size aimed to revert to the original Red Chris design of 80% passing 150 μ m.  The Central Case expansion largely keeps the existing process operation and expands  some  unit  operations  to  suit  block  cave  ore:    grinding,  rougher  flotation, concentrate  regrinding,  cleaner  flotation,  and  concentrate  dewatering.    There  were modifications to the existing plant that would no longer be required, such as sulphide scavenger flotation.  Some existing unit operations would be removed to create space in the existing process plant, this included removal of the existing regrind ball mill.  The expansion scenario considered that the ongoing process improvement projects would be online  prior  to  the  block  cave  expansion,  including  Cleaner  Column  3,  Phase  1  prerougher StackCells (treating cyclone overflow from the existing SABC circuit), and NAG tailings thickening.

The process plant will produce variations in recovery due to the day-to-day changes in ore type or combinations of ore type being processed.  These variations are expected to trend to the forecast recovery value for monthly or longer reporting periods.

The  plant  is  designed  to  cater  for  the  ore  composition  changes  over  the  LOM,  and blending is not expected to be required.

Copper  concentrate  is  assumed  to  be  shipped  out  of  Stewart  Bulk  Terminals. Concentrate will be transported via trucks from the mine site to the port.

## 25.10 Infrastructure

Infrastructure required to support open pit mining operations is in place.

The  transition  to  block  cave  mining  and  associated  changes  to  processing  will  be supported by existing infrastructure as well as infrastructure upgrades.  Infrastructure upgrades are required in the following areas:  new mobile equipment maintenance and workshop facility; pumping upgrade from the North Reclaim dam to the booster station; seepage  mitigation  modifications  for  the  TIA;  new  cyclone  sand  plants  and  tailings thickener  for  dewatering  NAG  tailings  cyclone  overflow;  associated  modifications  to tailings  pipelines  for  the  cyclone  sand  plants,  thickeners.  and  short-term  tailings deposition;  dust  cover  for  the  coarse  ore  stockpile;  and  accommodations  camp upgrades.

New  infrastructure  requirements  for  the  block  cave  project  include:    operations accommodation complex, site asset operation centre, mine dry, concrete/shotcrete batch plant; expansion of existing North dam and South dam, new Northeast dam, relocated North Reclaim dam and South Reclaim dam, new Northeast Reclaim dam. North Valley pumping wells, North Valley seepage wells, make-up water booster pumps and pipelines for fresh and reclaim water, potable water treatment plant, fire water supply to operations accommodation complex, decline conveyor; propane, diesel storage and distribution; air compressors to supply compressed air to underground utility stations; sewage treatment plant, septic field; ditches around the operations accommodation complex; expansions to switchgear and substations, mine substation, site-wide reticulation; communications backbone  feeding  surface  and  underground  facilities;  surface  haul  roads,  access  to conveyor portal, ventilation raises, process plant, TIA dam access roads; laydown areas, construction offices, warehouse, maintenance shops, water utility supply pump/pipeline from south reclaim pond; and stockpile pads, TIA reclaim dam diversion ditches, Camp Creek diversion, and Beaver Creek diversion.

There will be new haul roads and site roads to allow access to the various locations, including the TIA, conveyor portal area, exploration portal, ventilation pads and reclaim dams at the TIA.  Service roads will also be constructed alongside pipelines and diversion ditches.

The current  accommodation camp has an approximate 800-person capacity, and an estimated remaining usage life of 10 years.  An additional 400-600 beds will be needed to support the construction and development phases of the Project as envisaged in the 2021 PFS.

The TIA is currently permitted for 302 Mt of tailings and to an elevation of 1,180 m.  To support the proposed block cave operation, the TIA will be expanded to a capacity of about 550 Mt.  The design assumes raises on the north, south and northeast dams above that which is currently permitted, to a final elevation of 1,207 m.

<!-- image -->

The main source of water for the process plant is reclaim from the main pond at the TIA and,  when  constructed,  will  be  from  the  planned  thickener  and  cyclone  sand  plant. Groundwater pumping from the deep aquifer is the main source of makeup water when needed to meet process water demands.

Power  to  the  Red  Chris  Operations  is  provided  by  BC  Hydro  via  the  Northwest Transmission Line.  The current contract with BC Hydro sets the authorized demand at 55 MVA at 0.95 power factor or better.  The preliminary load list indicates the total site load requirements to support the block cave project will increase from 45 MW to 100 MW.  This will  require  expansions  to  transformers  and  switchgear,  and  a  new  mine substation.

## 25.11 Environmental, Permitting and Social Considerations

Baseline and supporting studies were completed in support of current and proposed mine designs, operations, and permitting.  The Red Chris Operations have continued to collect comprehensive environmental monitoring data to support effective environmental management.

There is an EMS in place for the open pit operations, which includes associated plans, procedures, policies, guidelines, auditing, and compliance.  The EMS and EMPs will be updated to incorporate the block cave project.

A closure plan was developed for the 2021 PFS for the closure of the proposed block cave  operation  in  its  entirety,  including  works  associated  with  the  existing  open  pit operations.

The Red Chris Operations were assessed and approved for open pit mining operations under applicable provincial and federal legislation.  The proposed block cave project will require  additional  permitting,  with  a  staged  approach  to  obtaining  permits  planned. Permitting for development of the exploration decline is complete and the decline is under construction.

Newcrest will pursue engagement opportunities with the BC government and the Tahltan Central Government in order to gain a clear understanding of the process and scope of the consent and the potential impact on the block cave project.

The mining operations are located entirely  within  the  Tahltan  Nation's  territory.    The proposed block cave project requires an approach that aligns with the Tahltan Nation and  leadership  and  with  provincial  governments.    Since  initiating  discussions  on exploration and Red Chris Operations activities, Newcrest representatives continued to meet regularly  with  Tahltan  Central  Government  representatives,  Tahltan  leadership, and the Tahltan Nation.  While feedback has been largely positive, a range of concerns and  interests  have  been  raised.    Newcrest  is  actively  working  with  Tahltan  Central Government  representatives,  Tahltan  leadership,  and  the  Tahltan  Nation  to  address concerns that have been raised.

## 25.12 Markets and Contracts

The marketing approach is consistent with what is publicly available on industry norms, and the information can be used in mine planning and financial analyses for the Red Chris concentrate in the context of this Report.

The additional concentrate tonnage that will be produced from the block cave project will either be added to existing contracts (those contracts will be expanded) or sold to new smelters customers in Asia or Europe.

At an average LOM concentrate grade of 24.4% Cu, Red Chris concentrate is slightly below premium concentrate grades, but is still expected to attract market interest.

Metal price assumptions were provided by Newcrest management.  Newcrest considers analyst and broker price predictions, and price projections used by peers as inputs when preparing the management pricing forecasts.

Contracts are in place in support of the open pit mining and processing operations and include  mill  consumables,  power,  explosives,  transportation,  and  camp  facilities,  and contracts with equipment vendors, drilling contractors, and for concentrate loading and storage.

Contracts that are likely to be concluded in support of the block cave underground project include decline development, pipelines, conveyors, camp construction, port and roads. Major contracts in support of operations are likely to include:  accommodations camp management,  building  maintenance,  underground  mine  infrastructure  development, cave establishment, road maintenance, explosives supply, ground support and consumables  supply,  material  transport  and  logistics  to  the  preferred  port  site, infrastructure engineering procurement and construction management, labour training, and infrastructure construction.

Current contracts are typically reviewed and negotiated on a frequent basis.  Based on Newcrest's knowledge, the contract terms are typical of similar contracts both regionally and nationally.  It is expected that future contracts will be awarded and negotiated in a similar manner to contracts that are currently in place.

## 25.13 Capital Cost Estimates

The capital costs for the open pit operations are considered to be sustaining capital and reported with the operating costs.

The capital cost estimate in the 2021 PFS has a target accuracy of ±25%.  Capital costs were estimated based on a 13.6 Mt/a Central Case.  All inputs were in Q2 2021 Canadian dollars.  The capital cost estimate in the 2021 PFS totals C$2,632 M of which C$1,729 M  is  in  direct  costs  (underground  mine,  materials  handling,  process  plant,  on-site infrastructure) and C$903 in indirect costs (construction support services, project delivery services, and contingency).

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## 25.14 Operating Cost Estimates

Four major line items make up the open pit operating cost estimate:  the processing cost; G&amp;A; sustaining capital operating cost; and the mining cost.  The estimated LOM open pit cost forecasts are mining cost at US$2.90/t mined, milling cost at US$6.70/t milled, G&amp;A costs at US$3.30/t milled and sustaining capital at US$3.60/t milled for an overall process cost of US$13.60/t processed.  These values were used to define the open pit mine plan.  Values used for the operating cost estimate will not necessarily match those provided in the economic analysis that has validated the mine plan.

The operating cost estimate in the 2021 PFS has a target accuracy of ±25%.  All inputs were in Q2 2021 Canadian dollars.  No escalation was included in the operating cost estimates,  nor  was  a  contingency  allocation  made  during  estimation.    The  annual average  operating  cost  estimate  for  underground  ore  in  the  2021  PFS  totals  C$271 M.   On  a  cost  per  tonne  milled  basis,  mining  costs  average  C$5.65,  process  costs average C$10.36, and site G&amp;A costs average C$4.33, for a total LOM average cost of C$20.34.

## 25.15 Economic Analysis

The financial evaluation is based on a DCF model.  The resulting net annual cash flows are discounted back to the date of valuation of start-of-year 30 June 2021.  A discount rate of 4.50% was used.  Red Chris Operations economics are presented on a 100% basis.  Newcrest holds a 70% interest in the Project.

The economic analysis shows a net present value at 4.5% of C$2,242 M, and an internal rate of return of 16.1%.  A payback period of 3.2 years is based on the earliest date that net accumulated free cash flow is equal to zero.  This is calculated from first commercial production that is defined as the date of achieving critical hydraulic radius for the Red Chris  block  cave,  which  is  assumed  to  be  FY27.    All  metrics  are  presented  prior  to shareholder loans.

The Red Chris Operations, including the proposed block cave, are most sensitive to changes in the copper price, less sensitive to changes in the gold price, copper grade, capital costs, gold grade, foreign exchange, gold recovery, copper recovery and least sensitive to changes in operating costs.

## 25.16 Risks and Opportunities

A number of risk workshops were held during the 2021 PFS and used to define Project risks and opportunities.

## 25.16.1  Risks

Key risks identified are summarized by discipline area:

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

- · Geology:
- -Lower  grades  encountered  in  mining.    Potentially  mitigate  by  completing additional drilling campaigns, and performing cave flow modelling;
- -Presence of unidentified faulting.  Potentially mitigate by completing a structural geology  interpretation;  evaluation  of  available  data  collection  including  face mapping and digital scanning;
- · Mining:
- -Geotechnical risk associated with potential pit wall failure;
- -Increased costs or reduced grades impacting the end of mine life production;
- · Seismicity:
- -A seismic event, either from earthquake or mining-related activity, remobilizes the Kluea lake landslide complex that is located to the south of the open pit. Potentially mitigate by completing mine seismicity modelling and the effect of seismic events on infrastructure and local features; evaluate the impact of block cave induced seismicity on the complex; conduct a structural geology interpretation;
- · Water balance and water quality:
- -Uncertainty  around  operational  water  balance  projection  that  may  impact permitting, design and production.  Potentially mitigate using data verification by independent review and de-risk option studies, monitoring, and completion of site-specific remediation and mitigation projects;
- -Wells cannot supply sufficient volume of quality raw water to maintain operation. Although current modelling shows that the capacity of the wells is sufficient to support the block cave project, there is a risk that the modelling completed to date  is  inaccurate.    This  could  be  mitigated  by  conducting  the  planned hydrogeological  surveys  and  modelling  work;  monitoring  of  water  usage requirements; implementing seepage reduction measures; minimizing evaporation  losses  by  reducing  the  pond  size;  utilizing  thickener  to  increase water  usage  efficiency,  and  apply  for  additional  water  extraction  permits  if needed;
- -Uncertainties  as  to  the  long-term  water  quality  (e.g.  TIA  seepage  quality). Potentially  mitigate  by  continuous  monitoring,  using  existing  extraction  wells, installing  new seepage interception system, implementing natural remediation measure and installing a water treatment plant if necessary;

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## · TIA:

- -TIA failure.  Potentially mitigate by retaining a third-party engineer with significant experience in BC and with sand tailings dam experience; establishing additional project/corporate/site interface and alignment on third party oversight requirements,  regulatory  requirements  and  IBCA  commitments;  completing assessment  of  valley  dump  geotechnical  risk;  careful  management  during construction to ensure dam constructed to design;
- -A seismic event, either from earthquake or mining-related activity, causes a TIA failure.    Potentially  mitigate  by  completing  mine  seismicity  modelling  and  the effect of seismic events on infrastructure and local features; conduct a structural geology interpretation; review designs during next study phase;
- -Required  quantities  of  borrow  materials  (till,  sand  and  gravel,  rockfill)  not available to support dam raises (includes North dam, South dam, Northeast dam and  reclaim  dams).    Potentially  mitigate  by  extensive  site  investigations identifying borrow materials that are of required quality, accessible, and within an economic distance of the TIA dam construction sites.  Manage and maintain consistent sand recovery operations from mine ore feed, to process plant, and to tailings cycloning system to ensure that borrow material requirements do not increase;
- -Dam raise assumptions.  The 2021 PFS assumes that sufficient inventory of tailings  sand  will  have  been  accumulated  by  2041  to  allow  for  the  final embankment raise.  This will require the site to  achieve the target sand yield at the  required  quality  and  quantity.    Failure  to  achieve  the  yield  target  would significantly increase embankment construction costs later in the mine life due to the need for additional borrow materials, or alternatively if borrow sources are constrained,  may  limit  the  height  of  the  final  dams  and  the  associated  TIA capacity;

## · Closure:

- -There is a risk that closure costs will increase as a result of additional reviews and feasibility study design, resulting from alternative concepts for TIA and RSA covers, water quality controls and post-closure land use;

## · Cost estimation:

- -There is a risk that estimates of sustaining capital, non-sustaining capital and operating costs could escalate more than anticipated, due to external economic pressures (e.g. labour shortages in BC, commodity prices, oil, steel, consumables and reagent prices), and/or changes to technical or operational issues underpinning the cost estimates (e.g. water treatments, TIA construction);

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

- · Permitting and contracts:
- -Permitting a block cave operation in BC in the anticipated timeframe.  Potentially mitigate  by  identifying  the  various  government  departments  and  regulations which will govern the approvals process; develop applicable permitting strategies; complete all environmental surveys and supporting studies; engage and consult with Major Mines Office prior to mining proposal submission; identify all potentially  interested  parties  and  stakeholders;  develop  monitoring  and mitigation plans;
- -Uncertainties as to assumed timelines to negotiate contracts in support of the planned block cave operations (e.g. contracts deemed to be direct award under the IBCA);
- · Human resources:
- -Skilled  personnel shortage.  Potentially mitigate by monitoring labour market; providing upgraded onsite accommodation; developing strategic partnerships;

## 25.16.2  Opportunities

Key opportunities are summarized by discipline area:

- · Geology:
- -Identification  of  additional  mineralization  at  higher  grades  within  the  known porphyry copper corridor that hosts the Red Chris Operations;
- -Identification of new targets of prospects within the Project area;
- · Incorporation of innovative technology in the next study stage:
- -Potential  to  include  state-of-the-art  design  and  technology,  such  as  eccentric rolls  crusher,  single  pass  cave  establishment,  novel  cave  footprint  designs, continuous miner, and autonomous vehicles;
- -Electrification of underground fleet to reduce carbon emissions and improve air quality;
- · Use of a dry cover on the TIA to potentially reduce closure costs;
- · North dam construction:
- -Once a 300 m or longer beach is established at North dam, as planned, following the relocation of the pump barge to the central location, the dam is no longer considered as a water dam; then the zoned structure can be simplified into a uniform cyclone sand dam similar to the South dam.  This change will simplify the construction process and hence increase dam stability, and presents a cost saving;

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

- · Combine NAG/PAG disposal:
- -This opportunity could be realized if the NPR is above 2 after appropriate and practical mixing of NAG and PAG tailings streams and deposited into the pond. Further study is needed to confirm this potential.

## 25.17 Conclusions

Under the assumptions in this Report, the Red Chris Operations show a positive cash flow over the life-of-mine and supports the Mineral Reserve estimate.  The mine plan is achievable under the set of assumptions and parameters used.

## 26 RECOMMENDATIONS

## 26.1 Introduction

The QPs prepared a recommended two-phase work program that focuses on a nearmine drill program in the first phase.  The second phase consists of work to support feasibility-level studies. The phases are independent and can be completed concurrently.

The cost estimate to complete the first phase of the proposed work is a total of about C$27.6 M.  The suggested budget to complete the second work phase is approximately C$50.2 M.

## 26.2 Recommendations Phase 1

No further deposit drilling is recommended in the area of the Mineral Reserves estimate until underground access is available.  However, drilling in support of Mineral Resources is  suggested.  This work phase should consist of a near-mine resource development drilling program with the aim of potentially upgrading resource confidence classifications in the area from the East Ridge to the western extent of MB3.  This is assumed to require about 79,000 m of drilling at a total estimated all-in cost of about C$27.6 M.

## 26.3 Recommendations Phase 2

Newcrest has approved the feasibility study budget that is summarized in Table 26-1 by key area.  Some study aspects have commenced.

The major elements of the planned study are broken out in the following sub-sections.

## 26.3.1 Geological Modelling

A Mineral Resource estimate update is recommended based on available drill data and, if required by the additional drilling information, an updated geological framework.  This modelling exercise has an approximate budget recommended of C$50,000.

Geometallurgical  domain  updates  should  be  undertaken  based  on  the  additional geometallurgical samples collected during Phase 1, and any resulting updated geological framework.  This modelling exercise has an approximate budget of C$50,000.

## 26.3.2 Mining and Geotechnical Studies

Refinement of the mining and geotechnical aspects is planned as part of the feasibility study.  A number of studies are planned, some of which are in progress:

- · Validate in situ stress parameters using the ANZI cell method.  Budget allocation of approximately C$600,000;
- · Refine the three-dimensional geological and geotechnical models and update rock mass characterizations, focusing on rock types, alteration types, weathering grades, rock quality/strength and major geologic structures.  Approximate program cost of C$800,000;
- · Optimize and refine cave footprint, including assessment of variable shut-off grades. Assumed C$550,000 cost to complete;
- · Improve cave monitoring system design using both microseismic and cave beacons. Cost allocation to complete of about C$100,000;
- · Update hydrogeological models and inflow assessments based on updated data from the Phase 1 collection program.  Assumed budget of C$900,000;

- · Complete a hill-of-value style site production rate assessment to identify opportunities to increase rate or optimise value.  Estimated budget of C$150,000;
- · Complete detailed engineering and optimisation of the material handling system. Cost estimate of about C$1.5 M;
- · Complete detailed ventilation design and engineering focusing on staged delivery; refine heating  options;  refine  material  handling/ventilation  interactions.    Cost allocation to complete of approximately C$380,000;
- · Optimise the transition between macro blocks both from a design and project value perspective, with a focus on minimising potential production interruptions. Approximate program cost of C$80,000;
- · Evaluate  potential  to  have  mine  fully  electric.    Cost  estimate  of  approximately C$420,000.

## 26.3.3 Metallurgy and Processing

Feasibility  level  engineering  is  planned  for  the  proposed  process  plant  upgrades. Additional work will include geotechnical site investigations in the plant upgrade footprint, a  laser  scan  within  the  existing  mill  building  to  assist  with  equipment  and  piping placement  and  additional  metallurgical  testwork  to  better  characterize  mineralization variation  in  the  underground  portion  of  the  Red  Chris  orebody.    The  feasibility  study budget allocation for this work is approximately C$6.9 M.

## 26.3.4 Tailings and Water Management

To support feasibility-level engineering of the dams, reclaim dams and diversion ditch modifications,  a  geotechnical  and  hydrogeological  site  investigation  is  proposed, together with characterization of future borrow sources.  A total of about $1.8 million was allocated to this work in the feasibility study budget.

## 26.3.5 Engineering and Infrastructure

Additional work is proposed for the new infrastructure.  This will include site investigations for  site  road  upgrades,  a  new  operations  accommodation  complex  and  vent  raises, assessment of quarry rock for use for concrete aggregate, asset integrity assessment, traffic study, power efficiency studies and investigations to secure additional concentrate storage capacity at Stewart Bulk Terminals.  The feasibility study budget allocation is about $7 M.

## 26.3.6 Permitting

Continue to assess and advance the understanding of the phased permitting approach to  pre-block  cave  development  and  block  cave  mining.    This  would  include  further

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

integration  of  the  block  cave  development  schedule  into  the  permitting  process  and engagement  and  consultation  with  the  Tahltan  Nation  and  provincial  and  federal regulatory agencies.  A total of approximately C$10 M was made in the feasibility study budget.

## 26.3.7 Environmental, Social and Cultural Heritage

Additional information is planned to be collected in the areas of dust, noise, and air quality to assess the impacts of potential incremental Project increases.  Closure studies are also planned to reduce risks associated with long-term water (quantity and quality) and metals leach/acid rock drainage management post-closure, and incorporate input from Tahltan engagement.  A budget allocation of about C$4.3 M was made in the feasibility study budget for this area.
